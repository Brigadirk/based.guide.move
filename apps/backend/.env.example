# Backend .env example for Railway deployment
# Copy these into your Railway environment variables. Values in parentheses are examples.

# --- Environment ---
# Railway automatically sets RAILWAY_* vars (project, service, environment).
# You can optionally set ENVIRONMENT yourself, but Railway's environment name is also respected.
# Staging: ENVIRONMENT=staging
# Production: ENVIRONMENT=production
ENVIRONMENT=production

# --- API Authentication ---
# The backend requires an API key. Priority:
#   PRODUCTION_API_KEY > STAGING_API_KEY > TESTING_API_KEY > API_KEY
# Pick the correct one for the Railway environment.
# Staging: set STAGING_API_KEY (e.g., STAGING_API_KEY=staging-key-123)
# Production: set PRODUCTION_API_KEY (e.g., PRODUCTION_API_KEY=prod-key-123)
# Optionally set API_KEY as a universal fallback.
PRODUCTION_API_KEY=
STAGING_API_KEY=
LOCAL_API_KEY=

# --- CORS ---
# Comma-separated allowed origins. Set to your deployed frontend URLs.
# Staging example: https://staging.example.com
# Production example: https://app.example.com
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://app.example.com

# --- Perplexity (optional) ---
# Only required if using the Perplexity features.
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=
# You can customize model/params if needed (defaults shown):
# PERPLEXITY_MODEL=sonar-deep-research
# PERPLEXITY_FALLBACK_MODEL=sonar
# PERPLEXITY_TEMPERATURE=0.2
# PERPLEXITY_TOP_P=1

# --- Open Exchange Rates (optional) ---
# If unset, the service generates/uses a local fallback snapshot.
# For fresh live rates, set your API key.
OPEN_EXCHANGE_API_KEY=
# Frequency to refresh rates (hours). Default is 24.
# EXCHANGE_UPDATE_INTERVAL_HOURS=24

# --- Railway Volume (persistent storage) ---
# The backend writes exchange-rate snapshots to a persistent volume on Railway.
# Railway mounts a volume at /app/data by convention if configured.
# These can be left empty; they are auto-detected when running on Railway.
# Override only if you know you need a custom path.
# RAILWAY_VOLUME_MOUNT_PATH=/app/data
# EXCHANGE_RATES_VOLUME_PATH=/app/data/exchange_rates
