# Backend Tester Environment Variables
# Copy this to .env.local for local development
# 
# IMPORTANT: All three preset buttons are always visible
# Set the URLs you want each button to use - unset variables show "(not set)"

# Railway Internal URL (secure, private network)
# The "Railway Internal" button will use this URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_RAILWAY_INTERNAL_URL=http://your-backend.railway.internal

# Railway Public URL (accessible from internet)
# The "Railway Public" button will use this URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_RAILWAY_PUBLIC_URL=https://your-backend-abc123.up.railway.app

# Local Development URL
# The "Local Development" button will use this URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCAL_URL=http://localhost:5001

# Example configurations for different Railway deployments:

# Staging environment
# NEXT_PUBLIC_RAILWAY_INTERNAL_URL=http://backend-staging.railway.internal
# NEXT_PUBLIC_RAILWAY_PUBLIC_URL=https://backend-staging-abc123.up.railway.app

# Production environment
# NEXT_PUBLIC_RAILWAY_INTERNAL_URL=http://backend-production.railway.internal
# NEXT_PUBLIC_RAILWAY_PUBLIC_URL=https://backend-production-xyz789.up.railway.app

# Local development with custom port
# NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCAL_URL=http://localhost:8080

# Benefits:
# - Railway Internal: More secure, faster (private network)
# - Railway Public: Can test from outside Railway network
# - Both URLs always available in the preset switcher
# - Default starts with internal URL in production for security
