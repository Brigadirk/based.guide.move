# API Keys for authenticated access (optional)
# Priority: PRODUCTION_API_KEY > STAGING_API_KEY > TESTING_API_KEY > API_KEY

# Production API Key (used in production environment)
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCTION_API_KEY=your-production-api-key-here

# Staging API Key (used in staging environment)  
NEXT_PUBLIC_STAGING_API_KEY=your-staging-api-key-here

# Testing API Key (used in development environment)
NEXT_PUBLIC_TESTING_API_KEY=your-testing-api-key-here

# Fallback API Key (used if no environment-specific key is set)

# Example configurations for different Railway deployments:

# Staging environment
# NEXT_PUBLIC_RAILWAY_PUBLIC_URL=https://backend-staging-abc123.up.railway.app
# NEXT_PUBLIC_STAGING_API_KEY=staging-secure-key-xyz

# Production environment
# NEXT_PUBLIC_RAILWAY_PUBLIC_URL=https://backend-production-xyz789.up.railway.app
# NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCTION_API_KEY=prod-secure-key-abc

# Local development with custom port
# NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCAL_URL=http://localhost:8080
# NEXT_PUBLIC_TESTING_API_KEY=local-dev-key

# Simple setup (single API key for all environments)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your-universal-api-key

# Benefits:
