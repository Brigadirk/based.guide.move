# Postmark Email Delivery Issue Investigation

## Current Status (Updated 2024-03-12)
**CRITICAL**: Messages sent from Next.js API routes are not appearing in any message stream, while Python backend messages appear but remain queued.

## Latest Test Results (2024-03-12)

### Next.js Implementation
1. API Response:
   ```json
   {
     "ErrorCode": 0,
     "Message": "OK",
     "MessageID": "f8b341c7-9a10-47da-af44-78ccc31937ce",
     "SubmittedAt": "2025-03-12T17:03:15.2122463Z",
     "To": "amaro+test@amarokoberle.com"
   }
   ```
   - API returns success responses
   - Message IDs are generated
   - But messages do not appear in any stream

2. Message Stream Behavior:
   - Messages sent to "broadcast" stream are not appearing
   - No queue entries are created
   - No error messages in Postmark dashboard
   - Complete invisibility of sent messages

### Critical Differences from Python Implementation
1. Python Backend:
   - Messages appear in broadcast stream
   - Messages get stuck in "Queued" status
   - Messages are at least visible in dashboard

2. Next.js Backend:
   - Messages completely invisible
   - No trace in any message stream
   - Same API credentials and domain verification

## Environment Details
- Server Name: based.guide
- Server Token: 89273b04-48a1-48c9-bed9-dbdf3717620a
- Account Token: 02f53151-696c-4762-815e-9b51a85c6fb8
- Message Stream: broadcast
- Verified Domains:

  - based.guide (DKIM & Return-Path verified)

## Current Theory
1. Message Stream Configuration:
   - Next.js implementation might not be properly connecting to the broadcast stream
   - Possible API version mismatch between Node.js and Python clients
   - Potential issue with message stream routing rules

2. API Client Differences:
   - Python client (postmarker) vs Node.js client (postmark)
   - Different default configurations
   - Possible header or metadata differences

## Immediate Action Items
1. **CRITICAL**: Test Different Message Streams
   - Try default "outbound" stream
   - Test with explicit stream ID
   - Verify stream routing rules

2. **CRITICAL**: API Client Configuration
   - Verify Node.js client version
   - Check for required headers
   - Test with minimal message configuration

3. Message Tracking:
   - Implement external message tracking
   - Log all API responses
   - Monitor message stream assignments

## Next Steps
1. Technical Investigation:
   - Test with different message streams
   - Verify API client configuration
   - Check message headers and metadata
   - Compare with Python client behavior

2. Monitoring:
   - Track all message attempts
   - Log stream assignments
   - Monitor API responses
   - Implement timeout detection

3. Client Configuration:
   - Update Node.js client
   - Test different API versions
   - Verify stream routing
   - Check authentication headers

## Test Matrix
1. Message Stream Tests:
   - Default outbound stream
   - Broadcast stream
   - Custom stream
   - No stream specified

2. Content Type Tests:
   - Plain text only
   - HTML only
   - Both text and HTML
   - With and without tracking

3. Recipient Tests:
   - Same domain
   - Different domains
   - Multiple recipients
   - Test addresses

## Status Monitoring
```typescript
interface EmailAttempt {
  messageId: string;
  stream: string;
  timestamp: number;
  appeared: boolean;
  status: string;
}

const attempts = new Map<string, EmailAttempt>();
```

## Latest Update (2024-03-12)
1. Migrated email functionality to Next.js API routes
2. Messages not appearing in any stream
3. API returning success responses
4. No visibility in Postmark dashboard
5. Environment variables and domains verified
6. Testing different message stream configurations

## Original Issue Description
Emails sent through Postmark's API and SMTP are now appearing in the Default Broadcast Stream but remain stuck in "Queued" status indefinitely.

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Messages Stuck in Queue
The most concerning aspect of this issue is that while messages are now visible in the activity stream:
- All messages are stuck in "Queued" status
- No progression beyond queued state
- Affects both API and SMTP sent messages
- Affects multiple recipient domains (gmail.com, amarokoberle.com)
- Messages never reach final delivery state

### Current Status
- Messages now appear in Default Broadcast Stream (progress from previous invisible state)
- ALL messages show "Queued" status
- No delivery confirmations or bounces
- System shows "0 of 100 emails this period" despite queued messages
- Complete halt in queue processing
- Affects both same-domain and cross-domain recipients

### Latest Test Results (March 12, 2025)
1. Message Visibility:
   - Messages now appear in activity stream (improvement)
   - All messages stuck in "Queued" state
   - Both test recipients affected:
     * amaro@amarokoberle.com
     * amaro.crypto@gmail.com

2. Queue Behavior:
   - Messages enter queue successfully
   - No progression from queued state
   - No error messages or bounce notifications
   - Queue appears to be completely stalled

3. API vs SMTP Testing:
   - Both methods show identical behavior
   - Messages accepted and queued
   - No difference in queue processing between methods
   - Both recipient domains affected equally

4. Stream Configuration:
   - Messages appearing in correct stream (broadcast)
   - Stream settings verified
   - Message tracking enabled
   - Using verified sender domains

### Environment Details
- Backend: Python with FastAPI
- Email Client: postmarker (Python Postmark client) v1.0
- Server ID: 15441584

    """
    # Check message stream status
    stream_status = check_message_stream(message_id)
    
    # Verify webhook delivery
    webhook_status = verify_webhook_delivery(message_id)
    
    # Check actual delivery confirmation
    delivery_status = check_delivery_confirmation(message_id)
    
    return {
        'stream_status': stream_status,
        'webhook_status': webhook_status,
        'delivery_status': delivery_status,
        'dashboard_visible': check_dashboard_visibility(message_id)
    }
```

## Latest Update (2024-03-12 17:03 UTC)

### Next.js Integration Test Results
- Migrated Postmark functionality from Python backend to Next.js API routes
- Environment variables correctly loaded and validated:
  ```
  POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN=89273b04-48a1-48c9-bed9-dbdf3717620a
  POSTMARK_SENDER_EMAIL=amaro@amarokoberle.com
  ```
- API continues to return successful responses:
  ```json
  {
    "ErrorCode": 0,
    "Message": "OK",
    "MessageID": "68692531-3d1e-45d5-b326-41c833157014",
    "SubmittedAt": "2025-03-12T17:03:15.2122463Z",
    "To": "amaro+test@amarokoberle.com"
  }
  ```
- However, the core issue persists:
  - Messages still not appearing in Postmark activity dashboard
  - No emails being delivered to recipients
  - API success responses proving to be unreliable indicators
  - Issue is framework-agnostic (affects both Python and Node.js implementations)

### Key Findings from Next.js Implementation
1. **Environment Configuration**:
   - All required variables present and validated
   - Server token length verified (36 characters)
   - Sender email properly configured
   - Message stream set to "outbound"

2. **API Behavior Consistency**:
   - Same false positive behavior observed in Next.js as in Python
   - API accepts messages and returns success responses
   - Messages still not tracked or processed
   - Identical MessageID format and response structure

3. **Cross-Framework Verification**:
   - Issue reproduced in both Python (FastAPI) and Node.js (Next.js)
   - Confirms problem is not language or framework specific
   - Suggests deeper issue with Postmark's message processing
   - Rules out client library implementation problems

## Next Steps to Investigate
1. Implement message queue monitoring system
2. Set up detailed delivery status tracking
3. Create test matrix for different email configurations:
