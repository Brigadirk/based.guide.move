# Turkey
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 02 May 2024
## WHT on dividends
Dividends paid to a resident or non-resident individual, or a non-resident company, are subject to WHT at the rate of 15%. There are DTTs signed by Turkey that provide WHT rates less than 15% on dividends under certain conditions. Treaty benefits are applicable subject to the fulfilment of the treaty eligibility conditions. Please note that dividend distributions to resident companies are not subject to WHT.
The following table provides a summary of dividend WHT rates applicable under the respective DTTs entered into by Turkey:

Notes
1. The local rate is 15% for dividends. Unless a lower rate is stated in the Agreement, the local rate is applied.
2. As per the provisions of the protocol amending the agreement, the rate may be (partially or wholly) reduced:
* For the Netherlands: To 10%, as long as, under the provisions of the Netherlands Company Tax Act and to the future amendments thereto, a company that is a resident of the Netherlands is not charged tax with respect to dividends the company receives from a company that is a resident of Turkey.
* For Belgium: To 10%, as long as, under the provisions of the Belgian laws and of the future amendments thereto, a company that is a resident of Belgium is not charged tax with respect to dividends the company receives from a company that is a resident of Turkey.
* For Austria: To 5%, if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) that directly holds at least 25% of the capital of the company paying the dividends, provided that such dividends are exempt from tax in Austria.
* For Ireland: To 5%, where the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) that directly holds at least 25% of the voting power of the company paying the dividends. 15% in all other cases.
3. Subject to 5% of the gross amount of the dividends if the recipient is the government, or a public institution that is wholly owned by the government or its political subdivisions, or local authorities of the United Arab Emirates.
4. The tax rate shall be 15% where the amount of the Turkish tax imposed on the income of the company paying dividends is less than 40% of such income derived in the accounting period ending immediately before the date when such dividends become payable.
5. The income should be subject to full corporate taxation in the hands of the Turkish tax-resident subsidiary.
6. If the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of Saudi Arabia, the tax so charged shall not exceed 5% of the gross amount of the dividends provided: (i) the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) that directly holds at least 20% of the capital of the Turkish company paying the dividends or (ii) the beneficial owner is a central bank or an entity that is wholly owned by the government.
7. In case of Turkey, the tax rate shall not exceed 5%, to the extent that they are paid out of profits that have been subject to full rate of CIT in Turkey (i.e. without benefiting from tax exemption).
8. The rate of the income tax shall not exceed 5% if it is derived by the Government Pension Fund (*Statens Pensjonsfond*) or by the Government Social Security Fund (*Sosyal Guvenlik Fonu*), provided that such dividends are exempt from tax in the contracting state where the beneficial owner is a resident.
9. The treaty-reduced rate of 5% shall apply if such dividends are exempt from tax in the contracting state of which the beneficial owner is a resident.
10. As per the provisions of the agreement, the rate may be reduced to 5% of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) that directly holds at least 20% of the capital of the company paying the dividends, provided that a relief from Swiss tax is granted for such dividends by way of an abatement of the profits tax in proportion corresponding to the ratio between the earnings from participations and the total profits or by way of an equivalent relief.
11. As per the provisions of the agreement, 5% of the gross amount of dividends that are subject to Turkish Corporate Income Tax at the full rate if the Australian company (other than a partnership) holds at least 25% of the capital of the Turkish company. Regardless of these, if the dividends are taxed in Australia, Turkey could tax the dividends at a rate not exceeding 15%.
12. The WHT shall be lowered to 5% if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) that directly holds at least 50% of the capital of the company paying the dividends or has invested more than 10 million United States dollars (USD), or the equivalent in Turkish or Vietnamese currency, in the capital of the company paying the dividends.
## WHT on interest and royalties
In case of royalty payments to non-residents, 20% WHT has to be deducted by the Turkish entity making the payment. The WHT rate may be reduced by the application of DTT provisions (generally to 10%).
Interest paid to non-residents is subject to 10% WHT under local legislation. The WHT rates set out in the DTTs that Turkey has signed are mostly equal to (or higher than) the local rate. A reduction in the WHT rate further to a DTT is possible only in very limited situations.

In the meantime, the Turkish Council of Ministers has not yet determined which countries receiving payments are considered 'tax havens'.
