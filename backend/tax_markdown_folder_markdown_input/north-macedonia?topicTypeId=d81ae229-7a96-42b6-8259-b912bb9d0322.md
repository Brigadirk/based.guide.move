All domestic legal entities and domestic physical persons that are registered for carrying out an activity, as well as foreign legal entities or physical persons that are non-residents but have a PE in North Macedonia, are obligated to withhold tax when paying certain types of income towards a foreign legal person and to pay the tax withheld to a respective suspense account simultaneously with the payment of the income.
The WHT rate is 10% and is applied on the following forms of incomes payable abroad:
* Dividends.
* Interest.
* Royalties.
* Income from entertainment or sporting activities in North Macedonia.
* Income from insurance or reinsurance premiums.
* Income from telecommunications services between North Macedonia and a foreign country.
* Income from the lease of immovable property in North Macedonia.
As an exception, WHT is not applicable to the following forms of income:
* The after-tax profit of a PE transferred to its foreign headquarters.
* Interest from bonds issued or guaranteed by the government.
* Interest on deposits in banks located in North Macedonia.
* Income from transactions in state securities on the international financial markets.
If a DTT is in place, WHT shall be payable in accordance with the provisions from the DTT. Taxpayers are obligated to obtain approval from the Macedonian tax authorities prior to applying the tax rates from the DTT.
