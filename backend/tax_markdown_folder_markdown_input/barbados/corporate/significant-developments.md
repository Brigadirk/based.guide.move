# Barbados
## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
## Pillar two subject to tax rule
Barbados signed the Multilateral Convention to facilitate the implementation of the Pillar Two Subject to Tax Rule (STTR MLI) on 24 September 2024. The STTR is a treaty-based rule that protects the right of developing Inclusive Framework members to tax certain intra-group payments, where these are subject to a nominal corporate income tax that is below the minimum rate.
## Crypto-asset transparency and reporting
On 26 November 2024 , Barbados signed the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on Automatic Exchange of Information under Crypto-Asset Reporting Freamework (CARF MCAA) and the Addendum to the CRS MCAA (CRS 2.0) at the 17th Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes Plenary Meeting .
The CARF MCAA establishes clear protocols for the automatic exchange of information on crypto-asset transactions, whereas the updated CRS Addendum strengthens reporting and due diligence requirements.  Barbados aims to implement the CARF MCAA framework in 2027, with the first exchange to occur in 2028.
## Corporate tax reform
## Corporate income tax (CIT) rates
| **Category** | **Income year 2024** | Income **year 2025** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| All companies except those that meet the below criteria: | 9%\* | 9%\* |
| Companies registered as approved small businesses | 5.5% | 5.5% |
| Companies engaged in international shipping business | 5.5% - 1% | 5.5% - 1% |
| Class 1, Class 2, and Class 3 insurance companies | 0% - 2% | 0% - 2% |
| Income derived from qualifying intellectual property (IP) | 4.5% | 4.5% |
\* Effective 1 January 2024
* the MNE group is deemed to be in an initial phase of international activity, or
* for the first fiscal year commencing on or after 1 January 2024, the income of an MNE group is not subject to an Income Inclusion Rule (IRR) or Under Taxed Profits Rule (UTPR) in another jurisdiction.
* the average qualifying revenue of the MNE group is less than EUR 10 million, and
* the average qualifying income of the MNE group is a loss or less than EUR 1 million.
## Transitional Country-by-Country Report (CbCR) safe harbour
## Qualified refundable tax credits
The following qualified refundable tax credits have been introduced:
* Jobs credits: A jobs credit may be claimed by the company or permanent establishment (PE) carrying on business in specified sectors and incurring eligible payroll expenditure after 1 January 2024. The jobs credit will be determined on the basis of a sliding scale of 25% - 100% of eligible payroll expenditure.
These credits may be set-off against any other tax liability for a period of four years.
## Patent box regime
Barbados has introduced a new patent box regime whereby, on election, income derived from qualifying IP may be subject to tax at a rate of 4.5%.  The categories of IP that qualify under the regime include rights to software copyright, rights to patents, and other similar legally protected rights.
## Group relief and change to tax loss carry forward period
The provisions for group relief will enable the current trading losses of a surrendering resident company to be set-off, by way of relief from CIT, against the profits of a claimant company, whether in whole or in part. Group relief is available under the following conditions:
* a surrendering company and a claimant company are members of the same group
* the companies are subject to tax at 9%
* the companies meet the 75% subsidiary test
* every company seeking group relief is resident in Barbados, and
* the relief sought must not exceed 50% of the amount of tax that would have been payable had the relief not been granted.
Group relief will apply from income year 2024 with respect to all entities that have trading losses from income years prior to income year 2024 in excess of 50 million United States dollars (USD). For all other companies, group relief will apply from income year 2025.
With effect from income year 2025, tax losses will only be available to be carried forward for five income years following the income year in which the loss was incurred.
## CIT prepayments
Companies are now required to prepay CIT monthly in an amount equal to one-twelfth of the tax payable on the taxable income for the income year before the preceding income year. Prepayments must be paid no later than the 15th day of each calendar month. Exemptions from monthly prepayments may apply for income year 2024 only if any one of the following criteria is satisfied:
* the company is not a member of an MNE group with annual consolidated revenue of EUR 750 million or more, or
## Treaties
