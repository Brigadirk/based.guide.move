# Moldova
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
Resident legal entities are taxed on their worldwide income, while non-resident entities are taxed on their Moldovan-sourced income. Taxable income is computed as accounting profit adjusted in accordance with tax legislation.
## Inventory valuation
Under the National Accounting Standards, the following inventory valuation methods are mandatory: specific identification, first in first out (FIFO), last in first out (LIFO), and weighted average cost.
Assets are generally valued at their acquisition cost, production cost, or market value.
## Capital gains
Transactions with capital assets performed by the companies are subject to general taxation rules.
## Dividend income
Starting 1 January 2021, dividends paid by Moldovan legal entities to other Moldovan legal entities from profit earned since 2012 do not represent taxable income.
Dividends are generally subject to a 6% WHT, except for those distributed from profits earned between 2008 and 2011, which are subject to a final WHT of 15%.
Dividends received by Moldovan legal entities from foreign legal entities are included in taxable income and taxed according to general established rules. According to Moldovan legislation, the beneficiary of such dividends is entitled to a credit for the tax paid in the foreign country, within certain limits.
## Interest income
In general, the interest income derived by legal entities is included in the total taxable amount and taxed at the applicable 12% CIT rate.
## Royalty income
Royalties are defined as payments of any kind received in consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright and/or ancillary right of a literary, artistic, or scientific work, including moving pictures, patent, trademark, design or model, plan, software, secret formula or process, or for information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific expertise.
The following specific types of payments are not considered royalty under the Moldovan tax law:
* Payments for software purchase, intended solely for the operation of that software, including its installation, deployment, storage, customisation, or updating.
* Payments for the full acquisition of a software copyright or a limited right to copy it solely for the purpose of its use by the user or for the purpose of selling it under a distribution contract.
* Payments for obtaining the rights to distribute a product or service without giving the right to reproduction.
* Payments for access to satellites through the hiring of transponders or the use of cables or pipelines for the transport of energy, gas, or oil, where the customer is not in possession of transponders, cables, pipes, fibre optics, or similar technologies.
* Payments for the use of electronic communications services in roaming agreements, radio frequencies, and electronic communications between operators.
In general, royalties derived by legal entities are included in the total taxable amount and taxed at the applicable 12% CIT rate.
## Exchange gains and losses
Revenues obtained from foreign exchange differences are included in taxable income. Foreign exchange losses are CIT deductible in the period they are incurred.
## Non-taxable revenues
Moldovan tax law provides for the following main types of non-taxable revenues:
* Contributions to the capital of an entity.
* Income earned while benefiting from income tax incentives.
* Money received from special funds in the form of grants from government-approved programmes.
* Income from revaluation of fixed and other assets and from reversing impairment losses on depreciation of fixed and other assets.
* Income from reversal or recovery of expenses and reversal of accruals that have not been previously deducted for tax purposes.
Starting with 2024, the composition of non-taxable sources of income also includes:
* The value of gifts in kind, including vouchers given to employees where the annual amount for each employee does not cumulatively exceed the value of 10% of the national average monthly salary forecast and approved by the government for the year for which it was granted.
* The training of employees and for activities related to the consolidation of corporate culture and team spirit, in the manner established by the government, in an annual amount not exceeding 5% of the value calculated as the difference between the total labour remuneration fund per enterprise, determined for the previous year or for the current year, and the remuneration fund for the work of persons specified in minor groups 112 and 121 of the Occupations Classifier of the Republic of Moldova for the respective year;
* Subscriptions for the use of sports facilities for the practice of sports and physical education for maintenance, prophylactic, or therapeutic purposes purchased from suppliers the activities of which are classified under codes 93.11, 93.12 or 93.13 of the Activities classifier in the economy of Moldova, as well as from their intermediaries, in an annual amount of up to 50% of the national average monthly salary forecast and approved by the government for the year for which it was granted, for each employee.
* The contracting of medical services in the amount of the national average monthly salary forecast and approved by the government for the year for which it was granted, for each employee.
* Payments of expenses incurred and determined for the transport of and food for trainees and/or students, up to the limit determined by the government.
* The costs of employees’ supplementary health insurance in the amount of the national average monthly salary, as per the government-approved forecast, for each employee.
* The amounts of payments made on behalf of employees for the purpose of compensating the costs of childcare services for their children up to the age of three, without exceeding MDL 2,500 per month for each child.
* Income obtained by individuals from the disposal of iron and non-iron waste, industrial residues containing metals or alloys, and returnable packaging.
From 17 June 2024, the allowance for increasing access to quality education, provided by the Education Code, in the amount and manner established by the government, will also be considered non-taxable.
## Foreign income
Resident legal entities are taxed on their worldwide income. The legal entities, under certain conditions, can benefit from tax credits provided under a double tax treaty (DTT) or can apply for unilateral tax credits against income tax paid in any foreign country if this income is subject to taxation in Moldova. Such tax credit shall not exceed the amount that would have been estimated at the CIT rate applicable in the given tax period. Otherwise, there is no specific tax deferral regime.
