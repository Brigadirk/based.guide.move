# Uruguay
## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 02 September 2024
## Social security contributions
The Uruguayan social security system is comprehensive, covering retirement pensions, health insurance, sick pay, and unemployment insurance. Social security contributions are compulsory, based on the salary earned, including bonuses and commissions, and are borne by the employer and the employee.
The employer contributes an amount equivalent to 12.625% and withholds 18.1% to 23.1% from the employee, as follows:
| Contributions | Employer contributions (%) | Employee contributions (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Retirement (1) | 7.5 | 15 |
| Health insurance | 5 | 3 to 8 (2) |
| Labour Restructuring Fund | 0.1 | 0.1 |
| Labour Credit Guarantee Fund | 0.025 | 0 |
| **Total contributions** | **12.625** | **18.1 to 23.1** |
Notes
1. Both employer and employee retirement contribution rates are applicable up to a monthly amount of UYU 256,821 until 31 December 2024 (the exceeding amount is exempt).
2. There is no health insurance contribution for Corporate Directors. These rates are applicable to employees, as follows:
* 3% for remunerations not exceeding 2.5 BPC monthly (UYU 15,443).
* 4.5% for remunerations exceeding 2.5 BPC monthly and employees with no spouse or concubine in charge and no dependent under-age children.
* 5% for remunerations not exceeding 2.5 BPC and employees with spouse or concubine in charge (with or without children).
* 6% for remunerations exceeding 2.5 BPC monthly and employees with no spouse or concubine in charge with dependent under-age children.
* 6.5% for remunerations exceeding 2.5 BPC monthly and employees with spouse or concubine in charge with no dependent under-age children.
* 8% for remunerations exceeding 2.5 BPC monthly and employees with a spouse or concubine in charge and one or more dependent under-age children.
## Value-added tax (VAT)
## Excise tax
In general, excise tax applies on the first transaction effected in the domestic market by manufacturers or importers of goods. Exports are not taxable.
Excise tax rates vary for each item, and they are generally fixed by the government within maximum parameters established by law.
## Net wealth tax (NWT)
NWT is not only levied on corporate taxpayers but also on the net wealth of individuals (resident or not) located In Uruguay at the end of each civil year at a progressive scale of rates that will depend on their residence. In this sense, while resident individuals will be subject to NWT at a scale of rates from 0.1% to 0.2%, the scale of rates applicable to non-residents individuals are from 0.7% to 1.5%.
Different rules for asset valuation, liabilities, and deductions are applicable to this category of taxpayers.
Furthermore, there is a threshold under which the local net wealth of the individual is considered exempt (currently amounts to approximately USD 155,000). This tax can be paid as a family unit, and, in such cases, the threshold is doubled.
