The flat rate of 5% is also applicable to the lease, sale, transfer, and other forms of supply of commercial space and property.
The taxable person is not entitled to input VAT deduction in respect of these supplies.
### Penalty on the failure to withhold and pay withholding VAT
Act 1107 imposes a penalty on an appointed VAT withholding agent who fails to withhold VAT and remit the same to the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) by the 15th day of the month following the month in which the withheld amount is due. The penalty is 30% of the amount in default.
The VAT withholding agent is allowed to recover the VAT that should have been withheld from the vendor but not the penalty, if any.
### VAT on non-life insurance
VAT is applicable on the supply of non-life insurance, which was previously exempt for VAT purposes.
Insurance companies engaged in the supply of non-life insurance contracts will be allowed to make input VAT deductions on amounts equal to the tax fraction of any amount paid during the tax period by the taxable person (insurer) to indemnify the insured person under a non-life insurance contract.
