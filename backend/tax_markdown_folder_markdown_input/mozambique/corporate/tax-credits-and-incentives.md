# Mozambique
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
## Foreign tax credit
Resident companies are allowed to deduct a credit correspondent to a tax paid abroad. The tax credit to be deducted should be equal to the lower of the amount of Mozambican CIT imputed to income obtained abroad or the amount of foreign tax effectively paid.
## Credit for domestic economic double taxation
When the taxpayer is not eligible for the participation exemption mechanism, they are required to include the profits distributed by resident entities in their taxable profits. In such cases and in order to mitigate the impact of economic double taxation, those taxpayers benefit from a tax credit to be deducted from the tax assessed, which corresponds to 60% of the CIT of the distributed profits that are included the taxable profits.
## General tax benefits and incentives
In addition to the guarantees of ownership and remittance of funds abroad, the Mozambican government also guarantees the concession of tax and customs incentives. The incentives vary depending on whether a company is starting a new venture or rehabilitating one and also on the nature of the project to be developed. The incentives discussed in this section are the generic benefits applicable to standard projects. Certain specific benefits also may be applicable depending on the activities of the industry for the investment project (e.g. agriculture, mining).
### Income taxes
#### Accelerated depreciation
Accelerated depreciation of new buildings used in the pursuit of the investment project, as well as rehabilitated buildings, machinery, and equipment intended for industrial or agro-industrial activities, by increasing the normal depreciation rates by 50%.
####
#### Tax deductible expenditures
* The amount corresponding to 110% or 120% of the actual cost (depending on the location of the project) incurred with infrastructure considered to be of public utility for a period of five years.
* The amount corresponding to 50% of the actual cost costs incurred with the acquisition of Mozambican art or cultural work for a period of five years.
####
#### Deductions to taxable income
Deductions to the taxable income of the amounts invested in (i) professional training of Mozambican employees and (ii) the modernisation and introduction of new technologies, up to a limit of 5% and 10%, respectively, during the first five years.
####
#### Investment tax credit
A carry-forwardable investment tax credit of 5% to 10% of the total investment realised on assets directly associated with the production activity of the operating company (depending on which location the project is implemented in), for a period of five years, to be offset against the gross income tax, up to its total amount.
### Taxes and duties on import of goods
An exemption from customs duties and VAT applies upon the importation of capital equipment listed in Section K of the Customs Tariff Schedule.
## Sector-specific tax benefits and incentives
### Processing industry
Exemption from payment of customs duties on imports of materials for the industrial production process.
### Agriculture and fisheries
* 10% reduction in the CIT rate until 2025.
### Upstream petroleum and mining
* Reduction of withholding tax rate from 20% to 10% for income derived by non-residents for tax purposes in connection with services related to upstream petroleum and mining activities.
* Exemption of customs duties on the import of equipment or exploration operations, classified under class K of the Customs Tariff Schedule, as well as on import of pre-determined goods intended for upstream petroleum and mining activities, equivalent to goods of class K of the Customs Tariff Schedule, provided such equipment/goods are not produced in Mozambique or, if produced, do not meet the specific characteristics of the required purpose or are not inherent to the nature of the activity to be developed.
### Gambling
The gambling concession holders and their shareholders are exempt from CIT. The casino concession holders are also exempt of payment of customs duties, excise duties, and VAT on imports of equipment and materials for the implementation, rehabilitation, expansion, or modernisation and business start-up.
## Project-specific tax benefits and incentives
