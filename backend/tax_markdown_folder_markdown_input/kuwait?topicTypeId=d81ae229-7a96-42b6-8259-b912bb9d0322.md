# Kuwait
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
Kuwaiti tax law does not impose withholding tax (WHT). However, all public bodies and private entities are required to retain 5% from the contract, agreement, or transaction value or from each payment made to any incorporated body until presentation of a tax clearance certificate, by the recipient of such payment from the Ministry of Finance (MoF), confirming that the respective company has settled all of its tax liabilities in Kuwait. The final payment should not be less than 5% of the total contract value.
## Tax treaties
Kuwait has entered into tax treaties with several countries for the avoidance of double taxation. Treaties with several other countries are at various stages of negotiation or ratification.
* Existence of a PE.
* Income attributable to a PE.
* Tax deductibility of costs incurred outside Kuwait.
The domestic tax law in Kuwait does not provide for WHTs. The WHT rates listed in the table are for illustrative purposes only.
