# Canada
## Overview
Last reviewed - 10 December 2024
Canada is the largest country in the western hemisphere and one of the largest in the world. Located in the northern part of North America, Canada extends from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west, and northward into the Arctic Ocean. It has a stable government, a skilled workforce, and its residents enjoy a high standard of living. The country has a well-developed transportation system and is rich in natural resources. Canada's official languages are English and French, and Ottawa is its federal capital. A parliamentary democracy, the country is divided into ten provinces and three territories. The official currency is the Canadian dollar (CAD).
Canada has abundant natural resources, a skilled labour force, modern capital plant, and a strong banking system, but the volatility of crude oil prices has taken a considerable toll on the oil and gas sector and the country’s overall economy. A lower Canadian dollar in recent years has encouraged growth in Canada’s manufacturing sector, with higher exports to the United States.
