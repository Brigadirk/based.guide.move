## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
## Social insurance contributions
Social insurance contributions are payable by every employee or self-employed person in any week in which they work.
Employees' contributions are calculated as 10% of gross earnings, subject to a minimum of GBP 13.65 per week (GBP 59.15 per month) and maximum of GBP 38.85 per week (GBP 168.35 per month).
Employer's contributions are calculated as 18% of gross earnings, subject to a minimum of GBP 30.45 per week (GBP 131.95 per month) and maximum of GBP 53.55 per week (GBP 232.05 per month).

## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)

## Wealth tax
There is no wealth tax in Gibraltar.
## Estate duty
There is no estate duty in Gibraltar.
## Inheritance tax

## Customs and excise duties
Goods imported into Gibraltar are generally subject to import duty at varying rates.
Noticeable exceptions are food, alcohol, and tobacco, which are subject to a fixed amount of duty regardless of the value.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is payable on the transfer or sale of any Gibraltar real estate or shares in a company owning Gibraltar real estate (on an amount based on the market value of said real estate) at the following rates:
* Less than GBP 200,000: 0%.
* Between GBP 200,001 and GBP 350,000: 2% on the first GBP 250,000 and 5.5% on the balance.
* Over GBP 350,000: 3% on the first GBP 350,000 and 3.5% on the balance.
The Chief Minister announced in his Budget Speech on 11 July 2023 that the stamp duty rate applicable to property sales over GBP 800,000 will increase from 3.5% to 4.5%. The effective date of this change is still to be confirmed.
For first and second-time buyers, there is no stamp duty to pay on properties valued at less than GBP 300,000.
On affordable housing estates developed by the government, the following applies:
* There is no stamp duty on the initial purchase price of the property.
* A special rate of stamp duty of 7.5% is payable on the sale of affordable housing developed by the government within the first ten years since original purchase. The duty is not payable in circumstances of a forced sale, including in the cases of divorce or where a family moves to a larger property as a meritorious upgrade to another, newer, government affordable housing estate.
Stamp duty on transfer of properties between spouses is nil.
Stamp duty is also payable on mortgages secured on Gibraltar real estate at the following rates:
* Less than GBP 200,000: 0.13%.
* Over GBP 200,000: 0.20%.
