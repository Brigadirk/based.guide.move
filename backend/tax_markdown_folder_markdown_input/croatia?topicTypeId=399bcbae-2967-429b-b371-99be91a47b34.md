### Reporting obligations
Taxpayers have to electronically file monthly VAT returns by the 20th day of the following month. Exceptionally, taxpayers who do not have any transactions with EU taxpayers (inbound or outbound) and whose aggregate value of goods supplied and services provided in the previous year does not exceed EUR 110,000 can submit the VAT return quarterly.
Any annual adjustments are made in the VAT return for December, which is the last monthly VAT return in a financial year.
In addition, both intra-Community acquisitions and supplies, as well as services provided to or received from an EU-registered taxpayer, have to be reported in a European Commission (EC) Sales and Purchase List, submitted by the 20th day of the month following the reporting month. Nil EC Sales and Purchase List do not have to be submitted.
Where the amount of input tax credits exceeds the entity’s VAT liability, a taxpayer is entitled to a refund of the difference or may choose to use the difference as a VAT prepayment.
The book of incoming invoices has to be submitted electronically by the 20th day of the following month in case the taxpayer received incoming invoices bearing Croatian VAT. Nil book of incoming invoices does not have to be submitted.
### VAT registration
VAT payers are defined as entrepreneurs that supply goods or perform services in Croatia. An ‘entrepreneur’ is any person that continuously and independently performs any economic activity. In addition to those that may be regarded as ‘normal’ taxpayers, domestic enterprises receiving services from foreign enterprises and legal entities and individuals that issue invoices or receipts including VAT without authorisation are also liable to pay VAT.
Companies have to obtain a Croatian VAT ID number in case of EU acquisition of goods in Croatia and EU supplies of goods from Croatia. Export also triggers VAT registration obligation.
Domestic companies performing or receiving services to/from the European Union also have to obtain a VAT ID number.
Foreign companies (not registered for VAT in Croatia) that supply goods within Croatia or perform land-related services in Croatia do not have to register if the recipient is a Croatian company or holds a Croatian VAT ID number, since Croatia has implemented Art. 194 of the VAT Directive.
A domestic taxpayer is required to enter into the VAT system when the value of supplies in the previous or current calendar year exceeded EUR 40,000. Voluntary registration is also possible.
Reclaiming of input VAT is granted to EU-registered VAT payers. No tax representative is required.
Entrepreneurs registered in third countries can apply for a VAT refund, provided reciprocity agreements are in place and a tax representative is used.
In case a foreign company, in general, is registered for VAT purposes in Croatia, it can request a VAT refund via the VAT return.
### Determination of VAT base
The VAT base for the supply of goods and services is the consideration that includes everything that the supplier has received or is supposed to receive from the buyer or a third person in connection to the supply, including the subventions directly related to price of goods and services supplied.
Where no consideration is provided, for instance where goods are exchanged, the VAT base is considered to be the market value of the goods or services. The VAT base of imports is the customs value as prescribed by customs regulations, increased by customs duties, import duties, special taxes, and other fees paid during customs clearing.
### VAT-exempt supplies
VAT-exempt supplies include insurance services; rental of residential property; granting of credits and credit guarantees; transactions related to bank accounts; interest; investment fund management; winnings from special games of chance in casinos, slot machine clubs, and other forms of gambling; supplies of domestic and foreign legal tender, securities, and shares; and supply of land (other than construction land).
Other exemptions, for example, include the following:
* Postal services.
* Public radio and television activities.
* Medical services, including services conducted by doctors, dentists, nurses, physiotherapists, and biochemistry laboratories engaged in private practices; services of medical care performed in healthcare institutions; and services performed by social care institutions and child and adolescent care institutions.
* Services closely linked to sports.
* Supplies (transfers) of real estate (land, buildings, parts of buildings, housing premises, and other structures), with the exception of 'newly built buildings'. 'Newly built buildings' subject to VAT are buildings that have not been used for more than two years. Buildings not subject to VAT are subject to real estate transfer tax (RETT).

## Property taxes
There are no property taxes in Croatia.
## Real estate transfer tax (RETT)
The acquisition of real estate is subject to taxation. ‘Real estate’ generally includes agricultural, construction, and other land, as well as residential, commercial, and other buildings. Transactions include the sale, exchange, and any other means of acquiring real estate for consideration. The acquisition of real estate on which the VAT is paid is not subject to the RETT.
The RETT is charged at 3 % of the market value of the real estate on the contract date and is paid by the acquirer.
## Stamp tax
There are no stamp taxation provisions in Croatia.
## Payroll taxes
Employers are required to withhold a percentage of their employees’ salaries and benefits as a payment on account of their PIT. The rate of withholding is a progressive rate between 15 % and 35.4 %, depending on the employee’s personal circumstances and income.
## Social security contributions
The Croatian social security system covers pension and health. In case of dependently employed individuals, social security charges are borne by the employee and employer.
Employers make social contributions at the rate of 16.5 % for health insurance.
The base for payment of employer’s social security contributions is gross salary, which is not capped.
Employers have certain obligations with respect to disabled individuals.
Apart from some exceptions, employers employing 20 or more employees are obligated to employ a prescribed number of disabled individuals. The number depends on the total number of employees and it cannot be lower than 3 % of the total number of employees.
Employers who do not comply with prescribed requirements are obligated to pay a monthly fee amounting to 20 % of minimal salary (minimal gross salary for 2024 amounts to EUR 840) for each disabled individual that employer was obligated to employ.
## Chamber of Commerce contribution
Companies are divided into three categories for membership fees to the Croatian Chamber of Commerce, which are based on the company’s value of asset, total income, and company size.
Companies classified under category I are not required to provide this contribution, although they can opt for voluntary payment, which brings them certain benefits. For companies under categories II and III, contribution is mandatory and the amount of the monthly membership fee varies between EUR 20 and EUR 527.31.
