## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
Generally, all income is subject to annual income tax.
In particular, the following income is taxable:
* Income from agricultural/forestry activity.
* Income from self-employed activity.
* Income from employed activity.
* Income from unemployment, accident, life, and health insurance.
* Income from lottery if this income is not subject to special tax for lottery or a foreign tax.
* Proceeds from gambling, unless a gambling tax pursuant to the Gambling Act or a foreign tax has been paid on such proceeds.
* Compensation for the surrender, severance, or non-performance of an activity or right.
* Contributions received by a taxpayer as a beneficiary, to the extent the privilege is not subject to wealth tax.
* Nominal income arising from taxable wealth.
## Employment income
An employee resident in Liechtenstein is principally taxed on any salary and any other monetary benefits (including reimbursements of living expense) received from the employer, regardless of where the work has been performed or where the payment is made.
## Capital gains
Capital gains from disposal of shares in domestic or foreign corporations are tax-exempt. In return, capital losses cannot be deducted.
Capital gains deriving from foreign participations held as business assets are subject to anti-abuse provisions. Capital gains deriving from investments in foreign legal entities are not tax-exempt for income tax purposes anymore if more than 50% of the total income of the foreign legal entity consists of passive income and its taxable income is subject, directly or indirectly, to low taxation. The grandfathering for participations established before 2019 ended as of 31 December 2021.
## Dividend income
Dividend income and liquidation proceeds are generally tax-exempt for individual investors (shareholders or beneficiaries) provided that the payment from ≥ 25% participations held as business assets is not tax deductible in the source country. The correspondence principle, however, does not apply for dividends received from participations that are held as private assets.
Dividend income deriving from foreign participations held as business assets are subject to anti-abuse provisions. Dividend income deriving from investments in foreign legal entities is not tax-exempt for income tax purposes anymore if more than 50% of the total income of the foreign legal entity consists of passive income and its taxable income is subject, directly or indirectly, to low taxation. The grandfathering for participations established before 2019 ended as of 31 December 2021.
