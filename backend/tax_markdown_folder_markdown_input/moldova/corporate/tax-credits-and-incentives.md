# Moldova
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Foreign tax credit
Income tax paid in any foreign country, if this income is subject to taxation in Moldova, is allowed for tax credit, provided that the taxpayer submits a document that justifies payment (withholding) of the income tax outside of Moldova, certified by the competent body of the respective foreign country, with its translation into the state language.
The amount of tax credit for any taxable year should not exceed the amount that would have been estimated at the rate applicable in Moldova with regard to this income.
A tax paid in a foreign country should be creditable for the year in which the income is taxable in Moldova.
## Free entrepreneurial zones (FEZs)
FEZs are territories where domestic and foreign investors can carry out entrepreneurial activities on preferential terms (i.e. favourable tax, customs, visa, and other regimes). There are currently seven FEZs in Moldova.
The following types of activities may be carried out in an FEZ:
* Production of goods preferentially for export, excluding alcohol and alcoholic products.
* External commercial activities.
There is also an international free port (Giurgiulesti International Free Port) and airport (Marculesti International Free Airport) with status similar to FEZs that can benefit from specific tax and customs incentives.
### FEZ incentives
The following CIT incentives for FEZ investors are in place:
CIT incentives will be available until 01 July 2034, or until the free economic zone ceases to operate, whichever comes first. These benefits apply to individuals or legal entities registered as residents of the free economic zone by 31 December 31 2023, and are contingent upon the size of investments made by 01 July 2024. The government will determine how these tax benefits are granted through the regional state aid scheme for enterprises in free economic zones, in accordance with the regulations set by the Competition Council and subject to certain conditions.
According to the customs provisions, goods are introduced into the FEZ with no VAT or customs duty and are not subject to economic policy measures, according to specific criteria. However, certain taxes in specific situations might be incurred by residents of the FEZ.
Individuals or legal entities registered as residents of the free zone by 31 December 2023, are permitted to engage in activities under the customs regime regulated by Free Economic Zones until 01 January 2034, or until the specific free zone ceases operations, whichever comes first.
## Law on information technology (IT) parks
Starting 2017, the law on IT parks entered into force. The law provides for certain tax incentives for the IT parks’ residents.
Under this law, residents of the parks could be legal persons or individuals registered in the Republic of Moldova as conducting entrepreneurial activity that carry out as their principal activity one or more of the following activities:
* Custom software activities (client-oriented software).
* Computer games editing activities.
* Editing activities of other software products.
* Management activities (management and exploitation) of calculation means.
* Data processing, webpage administration, and other related activities.
* Web portal activities.
* IT consulting activities.
* Other IT services related activities.
* Other forms of educations, limited to computer instruction.
* Manufacture of electronic components.
* Cinematographic, video and television program post-production activities, based on the use of specialised high-performance equipment.
* Specialised design activities, based on the use of specialised high-performance equipment.
Starting 12 February 2024, the following new types of activity eligible for IT park were introduced:
* Activities of call centres, including those based on any technology or communication channel with the customer (contact centre), exclusively for export.
* Labour force supply services, provided exclusively for export, limited to:
* + human resources services in the field of information technology and telecommunications (78.30.11) (in force 31 May 2024);
+ human resources services for other categories of personnel in the administrative sector (78.30.12) (in force 31 May 2024);
+ human resources services for personnel involved in the supply, logistics and customer relations processes in freight transport (in force 31 May 2024).
The residents of the IT parks are subject to a single tax that includes:
* CIT.
* PIT.
* Mandatory social security contributions.
* Mandatory health insurance contributions.
* Local taxes.
* Tax on immovable property.
* Road tax applied to vehicles registered in Moldova.
For the rest of the taxes, standard applicable tax treatment shall be applied.
In this context, the principal activity is that which generates 70% of a park resident’s sales revenue.
The single tax of 7% of sales revenue, but not less than the minimum amount due per employee, is to be calculated and paid monthly by each park resident. The minimum amount of single tax per employee is set at 30% of the national average forecasted salary for that year (e.g. MDL 16,100 for 2025).
