# Georgia
## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
## Social security contributions
There are no social security contributions in Georgia.
## Pension contributions
From 1 January 2019, joining a pension scheme is mandatory for all employees, except for:
* Individuals who have been 60 years of age (55 years of age in case of women) before the enactment
of the law.
* Self-employed individuals.
The pension scheme is financed by employer, employee, and government. Particularly:
* Each employer will transfer 2% of the employee’s salary income to one's private pension account while paying the salary.
* Each employer will transfer 2% of the employee’s salary income to one's private pension account on behalf of its employee.
* Each self-employed individual will transfer 4% of one's annual income to the individual pension account.
* The government will transfer (i) 2% of the income of the participant to one's private pension account when the annual salary of the participant/income of the self-employed individual is less than GEL 24,000 and (ii) 1% of the income of the participant when the annual salary of the participant/income of the self-employed individual is between GEL 24,000 and GEL 60,000. In case the annual salary of an employee/income of the self-employed individual is greater than GEL 60,000, the government will only contribute to the extent of GEL 60,000.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate is 18% and applies to the sale of all goods and services supplied in Georgia carried out as an economic activity.
## Property tax (except land)
Resident individuals whose annual family income exceeds GEL 40,000 in a calendar year are liable for property tax. The following is subject to taxation:
* Immovable property owned by the individual (including property received under a lease from non-residents and property that is leased to other persons).
* Yachts, motor boats, airplanes, and helicopters.
* Motor cars starting from 2018.
## Property tax on land
Individuals shall pay tax on land owned by them as of 1 April of the tax year:
* on land in their possession
* on land owned by the state and used or owned by them, and
* on a parcel of land owned and/or used by a natural person that is registered as property of a deceased person, except for the cases when the parcel of land is used under a lease, rent, usufruct, or similar agreement.
A natural person shall pay property tax and property tax on land no later than 15 November of a calendar year.
