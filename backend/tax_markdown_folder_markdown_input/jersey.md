# Jersey, Channel Islands
## Overview
Last reviewed - 08 January 2025
The Channel Islands, located in the English Channel, are constitutionally separate from the United Kingdom and France and, to all intents and purposes, are self-governing. Jersey, a British Crown dependency, is the largest of the Channel Islands. It is divided into 12 parishes, with Saint Helier as the capital. The official language of Jersey is English, and the currency is the British pound sterling (GBP). The state of Jersey is an effective legislator and government and ‘runs’ the island at a local level.
Jersey is one of the world’s major international finance centres, with a stable political, legal, and fiscal infrastructure and government. The Island is well regulated and has high standards of international telecommunications, information technology, postal, and courier services.
At PwC, we aim to deliver outstanding service to our clients and their organisations, putting relationships, integrity, and quality at the heart of our approach. Locally, the PwC Channel Islands firm has one of the largest and most experienced corporate and personal tax departments in the Islands, with offices in Jersey and Guernsey. The breadth of knowledge and expertise, and the international perspective offered by our tax specialists, has been gained through working in a number of firms' tax practices within the PwC global network. We are able to assist businesses and individuals with both local and international tax challenges. Our approach embraces all aspects of tax problem solving, from ideas to implementation, by blending the skills of financial and tax specialists with economists, lawyers, and our other in-house experts, as necessary. Locally, the PwC Channel Islands firm is highly respected for being at the forefront of the public debate on tax policy, rules, and regulations.
