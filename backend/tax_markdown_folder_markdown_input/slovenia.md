# Slovenia
## Overview
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
Slovenia, a country in Central Europe with a small coastline along the Adriatic Sea, is bordered by Italy to the west, Croatia to the south, Hungary to the east, and Austria to the north. It is subdivided into 212 municipalities, with Ljubljana as the capital. The official language of Slovenia is Slovene, and the currency is the euro (EUR).
Slovenia was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until its dissolution at the end of World War I. In 1918, the Slovenes joined the Serbs and Croats in forming the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, which was then named the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. After World War II, Slovenia became a republic of the renewed Yugoslavia, which broke away from the Soviet Union in 1948 and subsequently operated under a milder form of socialism. The Slovenes succeeded in establishing their independence in 1991 after a short ten-day war.
Historical ties to Western Europe, a strong economy, and a stable democracy have assisted in Slovenia's transformation to a modern state. Slovenia acceded to both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU) in the spring of 2004. In July 2010, Slovenia signed the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) convention and became a member of the OECD.
Slovenia became the first 2004 EU entrant to adopt the euro as its currency (on 1 January 2007) and has become a model of economic success and stability for the region. Slovenia has excellent infrastructure, a well-educated work force, and a strategic location between the Balkans and Western Europe.
