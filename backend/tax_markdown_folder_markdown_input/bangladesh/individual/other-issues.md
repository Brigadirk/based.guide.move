## Treatment of flow-through business entities
Partnership firms are taxed as individuals. The post tax income of a partnership firm is distributed proportionately among the partners.
## Exchange controls
As per the Bangladesh Bank Guidelines, foreign nationals who are resident in Bangladesh and who have an income in Bangladesh are permitted to make monthly remittances to the country of their domicile out of their current savings up to 80% of their net income to cover their commitments abroad. The term ‘net income’, in this context, signifies the gross income of the applicant less all compulsory deductions such as income tax, provident fund (if any), house rent, and other deductions that are of a fixed nature.
## Expatriate issues
Individuals who are not domiciled in Bangladesh or those domiciled but not expected to return must obtain specific certificates from the DCT before leaving the country. These certificates are listed below:
* Tax Payment Certificate: This certifies that the individual has no tax liabilities under the relevant tax laws.
* Exemption Certificate: This is issued if the individual intends to return to Bangladesh and the DCT is satisfied with this intention. It can cover single or multiple journeys within a specified period.

## Tax equalisation
Whether tax would be borne by the company or the individual will depend upon the terms of employment. The domestic tax laws do not contain any specific provision in this regard.
