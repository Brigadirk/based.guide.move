# Cabo Verde
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
## Foreign Investor Status (*Estatuto do Investidor Externo*)
The Foreign Investor Status, which has granted some tax benefits at the level of the investor (e.g. exemption from WHT on distribution of profits and on interest related to the financing of the investment) was revoked by the New Investment Law effective as of 1 January 2013. The tax benefits already granted or for which recognition has been requested prior to the entry into force of the Tax Benefits Code (TBC) and the Investment Code are maintained. Investment projects submitted for analysis and approval to the competent authorities prior to the entry into force of the Tax Benefits Code continue to be regulated under the legislation in force at the date of the respective submission.
## Contractual tax benefits
There are exceptional incentives regarding customs duties, CIT, personal income tax (PIT), property tax, and stamp duty to investments that fulfil all of the following conditions:
* The promoter of the investment should possess technical and managerial capacities.
* The invested amount should exceed CVE 3 billion (formerly CVE 550 million); the relevant amount is of CVE 1.5 billion in case of investments located in a municipal area where the average GDP *per capita* is lower than the national average (with reference to the last three years).
* Create, directly, at least 20 qualified jobs (10 in case of investments located in a municipal area where the average GDP *per capita* is lower than the national average, with reference to the last three years); a qualified job requires professional or higher education, specialised technical training, certified by a national or foreign entity, including management positions.
The concession of contractual tax benefits is subject to approval by the Council of Ministers upon agreement.
* Base rate: 40% of the expenses incurred in the tax period concerned. This rate in increased by 15% in case of taxpayers with less than two years of activity that have not benefited from the incremental rate mentioned below).
* Incremental rate: 50% of the added expenses incurred in the tax period concerned with reference to the arithmetic average of the two previous tax years.
Expenses that, due to insufficient tax due, cannot be deducted in the tax year they were incurred can be carried forward for ten years.
### Eligible taxpayers
The CIT deduction is available to taxpayers:
* taxed under the organised accounting regime
* with accounts that follow the Cabo Verde generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
* that fulfil their tax obligations electronically
* not subject to indirect taxation methods
* that have not held share capital of a company whose activity ceased less than five years ago with irregularities in the tax situation, and
* that have their tax and social security situation duly regularised.
### Covered R&D expenses
For the purposes of the regime:
* Development expenses are those incurred by the taxpayer through the exploitation of results from scientific work, or other scientific or technical knowledge, aiming at finding or improving in a substantial manner raw materials, products, services, or manufacturing processes.
### Eligible expenses
Among other expenses, the following are eligible provided that they are related with R&D activities:
* Acquisition of tangible fixed assets (except buildings and land), created or acquired new, and the proportion of its allocation to R&D activities.
* Expenses with staff with minimum qualification as a level 4 of the National Qualifications Framework that is directly engaged in R&D activities. These expenses are considered for 150% of the respective amount in case of staff with minimum literary qualification as a level 8 of the National Qualifications Framework.
* Expenses with the participation of managers and members of the board in the management of R&D institutions.
* Operating expenses (remunerations, wages, or salaries of the year concerned) of up to 50% of the expenses with staff with minimum qualification as a level 4 of the National Qualifications Framework that is directly engaged in R&D activities.
* Expenses incurred with the hiring of R&D activities from public entities, entities with public utility status, or entities with recognised expertise in the field of R&D.
* Holding share capital of R&D institutions and contribution made to public and private investment funds. In both cases, the entities should invest in the equity of R&D or other institutions with recognised expertise in the field of R&D.
* Registration and maintenance of patents.
* Acquisition of patents aiming mainly at carrying out R&D activities.
* R&D audits.
* Attribution of scientific awards to R&D activities.
* Attribution of PhD and post-PhD scholarships.
There is an exclusion from eligibility of the expenses with projects carried out exclusively by third parties through R&D contracts and rendering of services.
R&D activities related to ecological manufacturing of products are allowed an additional 30% deduction.
The regime applies until 2038.
## Incentive to the Capitalisation of Companies (Incentivo à Capitalização das Empresas or ICE)
An amount corresponding to the application of the rate of 10% of the net increase in eligible equity can be deducted against the taxable profit, capped at CVE 20 million.
The part that exceeds the cap can be carried forward for a period of five years.
The amount of net increases in eligible equity corresponds to the sum of the amounts assessed in the tax year concerned and in each of the nine previous tax periods. In case the net increase in eligible equity is negative, the result is zero.
The following are eligible equity increases:
* Cash contributions made in connection with the incorporation of companies or the increase in the share capital of the beneficiary company.
* Contributions in kind made within the scope of the share capital increase that correspond to the conversion of credits into capital.
* Premiums for issuance of securities.
* Net accounting profits of the tax period concerned that are applied to retained earnings or, directly, to reserves or to an increase in share capital.
The net increases in eligible equity correspond to the increases in eligible equity after deducting outflows, in cash or in kind, in benefit of the holders of equity, by way of remuneration or reduction of equity or equity sharing, as well as distributions of reserves or retained earnings.
## Incentive to the reinvestment of profits
An exemption from CIT applies on profits reinvested by technological-based companies duly authorised to operate in the Special Economic Area for Technologies (*Zona Económica Especial para Tecnologias* or ZEET). This includes any company carrying out R&D activities, either internally or in association with third parties, aiming at creating new or improved products, services, and processes.
The following are eligible as technological-based companies:
* Companies that have invested in R&D an amount equivalent to at least 7.5% of the previous year invoicing. Accounting elements demonstrating the invoicing volume and R&D investment volume are required.
* Companies with up to three years of activity, incubated in a certified incubator or an incubator recognised as such by *Pro Empresa*.
## Differentiated Merit Investment Projects (*Projetos de Mérito Diferenciado* or PMDs)
The PMD status, established by Law 80/IX/2020, of 26 March, is granted to investments that, among others, cumulatively meet the following requirements:

* Contribute, in net terms, to the improvement of the balance of payments.
* Use technology, production, and commercialisation processes that minimise environmental impacts or promote environmental sustainability.

Investment projects with PMD status are granted the following benefits:
* Reduced customs duty rate of 5% on the import of materials, goods, and equipment mentioned in Article 15 of the CBF.
* Customs duty exemption on the import of raw materials, consumables, finished and semi-finished materials, and other products to be incorporated in products manufactured by the company; the exemption is also applicable to packaging and wrapping materials used in products manufactured by the company, in case of industrial investment, projects of companies registered in the '*Cadastro Industrial*'.
* CIT credit of 30% of the eligible investments effectively made (capped at 50% of the CIT assessed).
* Stamp duty exemption on the borrowing of funds for the investment.
* IUP exemption on the acquisition of real estate exclusively aimed at the installation of the investment project.
* Other non-tax incentives established in specific legal diplomas.

* CIT credit of 40% of the eligible investments effectively made (capped at 50% of the CIT assessed).
* IUP exemption on the acquisition of real estate used in the development of the company’s main activity, including any developing needs arising throughout the first five years following the acquisition.
## Direct investment made in Cabo Verde by emigrants
Direct investment made by emigrants shall benefit from a set of tax incentives, as established by Law 73/IX/2020, of 2 March, namely:
* Exemption from taxation (as foreseen in the CIT Code) of dividends and profits distributed to the emigrant investor arising from authorised foreign investment.
* Exemption from customs duties on the acquisition of materials from construction, extension of refurbishment of a first residential house, including also furniture, appliances, and other imported goods, under certain conditions.
The regime applies to emigrant investors permanently living abroad, as well as to former emigrant pensioners and retired people receiving pensions and similar income from their country of immigration.
The investment on tangible assets or intangibles in Cabo Verde is eligible, under the conditions foreseen in the regime (e.g. the incorporation of entities or branches in Cabo Verde, acquisition of shareholdings, granting of loans or other forms of financing of entities in which a shareholding is held).
## Industrial activity
The following tax and customs benefits are provided for industrial activity:
### CIT benefits
A CIT credit is available for up to 50% of the eligible investments made in an industrial activity. Any unused tax credit may be carried forward for ten years, subject to certain limitations.
Eligible investments include the acquisition of new fixed assets, patents, and licences regarding technologies.
### IUP benefits
Industrial activities may benefit from an exemption from IUP on the acquisition of immovable property used exclusively for industrial purposes; however, the recognition of such tax exemption should be approved by the municipality.
### Customs duty benefits
Industrial activities benefit from an exemption from customs duties on the import of construction material, machines, utensils, semi and finished materials, products, and raw materials used in the production of goods.
### Stamp duty benefits
Financing transactions of industrial projects are exempt from stamp duty.
## International Business Centre (IBC) of Cabo Verde
The Cabo Verde Agency for Foreign Investment is the entity responsible for granting the licences to operate within the IBC, upon previous proposal of the Zona Franca Comercial S.A.. The following tax benefits are applicable to entities licensed to operate in the IBC on income from industrial or business activities and services.
Note that these tax benefits are not applicable to entities engaged in tourism, banking and insurance, real estate, or construction.
### CIT benefits
Reduced CIT rates of 5%, 3.5%, or 2.5% are applicable to entities that create, respectively, 10, 20, or 50 jobs.
The CIT rate is 2.5% in case of the creation of four jobs for entities licensed to operate within the International Service Centre.
Entities licensed to operate within the IBC are granted to benefit from reduced CIT rates until 2030.
### Shareholders benefits
Shareholders of the entities licensed to operate within the IBC are exempt from taxation on dividends and interest received.
### VAT and customs duty benefits
An exemption from customs duties applies with respect to certain goods, equipment, and materials used within the scope of the activity developed and licensed under the IBC.
## Maritime transport (tonnage tax)
Cabo Verde tax legislation foresees a special regime for the assessment of the taxable profit applicable to maritime transport activities (tonnage tax).
Entities licensed in the IBC that carry out activities related to the international maritime transport of persons or goods may opt for a special regime for the assessment of the taxable profit, provided that they fulfil the following conditions:
* All the ships and vessels owned by the taxpayer must be registered in the International Register of Ships of Cabo Verde (further regulation shall be published), and all the activity carried out must be eligible.
* At least 85% of the total income derives from activities carried out with other entities licensed and operating in the IBC or with non-resident entities.
Under the tonnage tax regime, the taxable profit shall be determined by applying the following daily amounts to each eligible ship or vessel:
| Net tonnage | Daily taxable income for each 100 net tonnes (CVE) |
| --- | --- |
| Up to 1,000 net tonnes | 646 |
| From 1,001 to 10,000 net tonnes | 566 |
| From 10,001 to 25,000 net tonnes | 307 |
| Above 25,000 net tonnes | 103 |
No deductions are allowed to the taxable profit assessed. The taxable profit assessed is subject to CIT at the rates applicable to entities licensed in the IBC.
No tax credits are available.
In the case of changing from the tonnage tax regime to the general CIT regime, the tax value of the assets held corresponds to the one resulting from the application of the general rules foreseen in the CIT Code, as if the taxpayer had not applied the special regime. Additionally, tax losses or any tax credits carried forward originated during the taxable periods to which the special regime applied are disregarded.
## Tax and financial incentives for internationalisation of Cabo Verde companies
A regime that provides for tax and financial incentives for investment projects in order to promote the internationalisation of Cabo Verde companies is in force.
The following incentives, to be granted under a contract of not more than three years, apply to internationalisation projects of companies with head office and place of effective management in Cabo Verde that are undertaken before 31 December 2020.

Investments that are eligible for the regime of tax benefits for internationalisation may benefit from:
* Reduced CIT rate of up to 50%, applicable until the term of the investment contract.
* Exemption from CIT on income obtained by qualified expatriate employees.
Additionally, a deduction for creation of employment ranging between CVE 26,000 and CVE 35,000 for each new job created may apply.
