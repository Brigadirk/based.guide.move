## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Finance Act 2024
Some of the significant changes brought in by the Finance Act 2024 include the following:
### Tax administration
* The deemed date of admission of an objection is now clarified to be the date the taxpayer has paid the tax deposit required to validate the objection.
* Document service to the commissioner or taxpayer to include those sent via emails, fax, or any other electronic means in accordance with written laws governing electronic transactions.
* Introduction of a new definition for the below term:
+ 'Cargo consolidator’ to mean ‘a person licensed by a competent authority to operate cargo consolidation and deconsolidation business’. The cargo consolidator is required to comply with customs and other laws and procedures governing deconsolidation of cargo to its owners at the time of importation of goods in the country. Failure to comply leads to a fine equal to 30% of the customs value of imported cargo.
* ‘Currency point’ increased from 15,000 to 20,000 Tanzanian shillings (TZS).
* Penalty for the failure to use an electronic fiscal device (EFD) or issue a fiscal receipt has been capped to a fine of 200 currency points (currently TZS 4 million).
* Applications of/for (i) value-added tax (VAT) refund and (ii) remission of interest and penalties can now be done online through the Taxpayer Portal effective November 2023.
* The due date of filing income tax return for entities audited by the Controller and Auditor General (CAG) changed to nine months from the end of year of income (previously six months from the end of year of income).
### Income tax
* The definition of ‘asset’ to now include ’digital asset’.
* New definitions introduced for ’artisanal miner‘, ’digital content‘, and ’digital content creator’.
* Limitation of the offset of tax losses to 60% (previously 70%) of the current year chargeable income where the entity has consecutive tax losses for previous four years.
* Change in control provisions (section 56 ITA 2004) will not apply where the change is a result of allotment of new membership interest in a resident entity.
* The Finance Act 2023 had introduced a single instalment tax of 3% of the greater of the incomings or approved value of the asset (instead of 10% on the profits) to resident persons realising interest in land or building with no records of the cost. The Finance Act 2024 has restricted the applicability of this provision to resident individuals (i.e. it will not apply to resident entities).
* The scope of charitable organisations is extended to institutions dealing with the advancement of health services and environmental protection.
* Entities engaged in processing of tea are exempt from payment of alternative minimum tax (AMT) for a three-year period from 1 July 2024 to 30 June 2027.
* Introduction of withholding tax (WHT) at the rate of 3% on payment made to resident persons for transfer of digital assets.
* Introduction of WHT of 5% on payments made by residents and non-residents to resident digital content creators.
* Introduction of a final WHT tax of 2% on purchases of industrial minerals (except for salt) and metallic minerals from a primary mining licence holder or artisanal miner.
* The scope of WHT on rental payments is extended to payments made to a resident person for the use of construction equipment or machinery (applicable rate is 10%).
* WHT exemption on interest paid by resident financial institutions to non-resident financial institutions and funds having an agreement with the Government of Tanzania to provide lower interest loan rates to resident financial institutions.
* WHT on royalty payments to resident sports entities or the Tanzania Football Federation has been reduced to 5%.
* Payments made to a local government authority, local community, or a resident individual in respect of verified carbon emission reduction is a final withholding payment (as opposed to similar payments made to a resident entity).
### Value-added tax (VAT)
* VAT scope expanded to cover ‘online data services’ provided by a non-resident supplier to an unregistered customer. ‘Online data services’ is defined as “any form of monetisation of user data, including the sale or licensing of, or access to, user data or information collected through user engagement with an online platform. This applies whether the data is sold or licensed directly or indirectly, aggregated or disaggregated, anonymised, or used in any other form”.
* New definitions for the terms ’gaming supply‘ (which is an exempt supply) and ’serviced apartment‘ (which is a taxable supply).
* Expansion of VAT deferral to capture capital goods under HS Code 8701.21.90.
* An introduction of a requirement to notify the Commissioner General within a period of 90 days after the end of the period in which a person registered as an ‘intending trader’ is expected to start making taxable supplies lapses and has not commenced making the supplies. Failure to notify the Commissioner will result in a deemed deregistration from VAT.
* Exemptions:

+ Introduction of VAT at a rate of zero percent on the supply of gold to the Bank of Tanzania.
+ Introduction of VAT at a rate of zero percent on the supply of gold to licensed refineries in Mainland Tanzania.
### **Excise duty**
* The new filing deadline for monthly returns is the 25th day of the following month (previously the last working day of the following month to which the return related).
* Excise duty rate on bottled water reduced to TZS 56 per litre from TZS 63.8 per litre.
* Introduction of excise duty on undenatured ethyl alcohol with an alcohol strength of 80% by volume or higher. Licensed manufacturers who acquire this alcohol, paid the excise duty, and use the alcohol as a raw material to produce finished alcoholic products, such as spirits, liqueurs, and other beverages under HS Code 2208, are allowed to offset the excise duty against that which ought to have been payable on the finished goods.
* Introduction of duty remission (subject to Commissioner’s approval) on undenatured ethyl alcohol under HS Code 2207, which should have been charged, levied, or collected. This applies when alcohol is used solely as a raw material for (i) the production of industrial energy by the producer of the undenatured ethyl alcohol and (ii) medical or laboratory use.
### Other taxes and levies
* Railway Development Levy (RDL) rate increased to 2% (from 1.5%).
