# Tanzania
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
There are no provisions for tax consolidation or group relief in Tanzania.
## Transfer pricing
With respect to transactions between related parties, there is an obligation to 'quantify, apportion, and allocate amounts' for income tax purposes on an arm's-length basis. The Transfer Pricing Regulations and Guidelines require:
* Any taxpayer whose transactions with associates exceed TZS 10 billion to file the CIT returns together with transfer pricing documentation.
* Any other taxpayer with related-party transactions to have transfer pricing documentation in place and provide this within 30 days from the date of request by the TRA.
* The penalty for any adjustment made during an audit is 100% of the underpaid tax.
## Thin capitalisation
There is a thin capitalisation restriction on the amount of deductible interest for what are termed 'exempt-controlled resident entities', where the debt-to-equity ratio exceeds 7:3. There are specific definitions of 'debt' and 'equity' for the purposes of thin capitalisation.
## Controlled foreign trusts and corporations
There are provisions that relate to the treatment of unallocated income of controlled foreign trusts and corporations.
## Change in control provisions
The change in control provisions are triggered at the moment the underlying ownership of an entity changes by more than 50% as compared to any time during the previous three years. Where there is such a change, the consequences are that:
* the accounting period of the entity is split at the point of such a change, so that the parts of the year of income before and after the change are treated as separate years of income, and
* there is deemed realisation of assets and liabilities at market values.
In certain cases, such a change can also result in the forfeiture of unutilised tax losses and tax credits.
The Commissioner has to be notified immediately before and after the change in control has occurred.
### Exemptions
The change of control provisions do not apply in the following circumstances:
* Where the change is a result of allotment of new membership interest in the resident entity.
* A sole result of transfer of membership interest of a resident entity to another resident person.
## Other anti-avoidance provisions
Other anti-avoidance provisions exist to address the following:
* Income or dividend stripping arrangements.
* Income splitting.
### Taxing right on an agent of a non-resident person or of a beneficial owner
A taxing right on a 'representative assessee' will apply in respect of income of a non-resident person or 'beneficial owner' for whom the 'representative assessee' acts as an agent.
Activities that can create the categorisation of 'agent of a non-resident person or of a beneficial owner' include employment, any 'business connection', receipt of income for the other party, or acting as a trustee.
The definition of the term 'beneficial owner' includes reference to aspects (whether direct or indirect) of 'substantial control', 'substantial economic interest in or … substantial economic benefit'.
The term 'business connection' includes reference to:
* Conclusion of or significant role leading to conclusion of contracts.
* Maintenance of stock of goods or merchandise.
* Habitually securing orders.
* Carrying on business or investment through an entity or an arrangement for the benefit of the other party (directly or indirectly).
* [Corporate - Deductions](deductions.html)
* [Corporate - Tax credits and incentives](tax-credits-and-incentives.html)
