# Guatemala
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
The tax system of Guatemala is a unitary system, whereby income of all kinds, other than capital gains, is lumped together and subject to a single tax. The components of gross income subject to tax are usually business income, interest, dividends, rent, salaries, and services. Companies are subject to income tax only on their Guatemala-source income. Dividends and other income payable abroad are taxed separately by way of withholding taxes (WHTs).
For income tax purposes, there are two main systems that taxpayers may subscribe to: the system on earnings from lucrative activities and the simplified optional system on income from lucrative activities. The taxpayer chooses what system the company is registered for. Once a system is chosen, it cannot be modified until the next tax period. The request for the modification must be requested before the tax authorities at least one month prior to the new tax period.
These systems are explained below.
## System on earnings from lucrative activities
Under the system on earnings from lucrative activities, the tax is determined and paid at the end of each quarter, without prejudicing the end-of-period final tax liquidation. The tax rate is 25% on net income.
This system allows taxpayers to deduct costs and expenses incurred during the period, according to requirements established by law.
## Simplified optional system on income from lucrative activities
Under the simplified optional system on income from lucrative activities, the tax is payable under flat tax withholdings (the tax is to be retained by either the customer or the recipient of services) or by direct remittances to the tax office made monthly within the first ten working days of the month following the invoice date. The tax rate is 5% on gross income that ranges from 0.01 Guatemalan quetzales (GTQ) to GTQ 30,000 and 7% on the excess.
## Local income taxes
There are no specific state or provincial government taxes on income other than the two systems previously described.
