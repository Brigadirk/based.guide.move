# Vietnam
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 22 August 2024
## Standard rates
All taxes are imposed at the national level. The standard corporate income tax (CIT) rate is 20%. Enterprises operating in the oil and gas industry are subject to CIT rates ranging from 25% to 50%, depending on each contract. Enterprises engaging in prospecting, exploration, and exploitation of certain mineral resources are subject to CIT rates ranging from 32% to 50%, depending on each project.
The government has issued Decree 64/2024 on extension of deadlines for tax and land rental payments in 2024, which took effect from the signing date of 17 June 2024 to 31 December 2024.
There is no concept of tax residency for CIT. Business organisations established under the laws of Vietnam are subject to CIT and taxed on worldwide income. 20% CIT shall be applicable to foreign income. There are no provisions for tax incentives for such income.
## Preferential rates
Preferential CIT rates of 10%, 15%, and 17% are available where certain criteria are met.
The Vietnamese government also has included a plan to review the impact of international tax reforms (e.g. Pillar 1 and Pillar 2) and amend or make changes to the domestic tax laws accordingly. With the policy relating to the global minimum tax rate, the application of tax incentives could be changed.
In June 2024, a draft law on CIT was posted on the official website of the government for public comments. It is expected that the draft law will be presented to the National Assembly for consideration in October 2024 and ratified in May 2025. The draft law makes various amendments to the existing regulations on CIT incentives, including proposed changes to the incentivised sectors, proposed changes in incentivised locations, and simplified rules for business expansions. The draft law also emphasises that in cases of any inconsistency between other laws and the CIT Law the CIT Law shall prevail.
*See the [Tax credits and incentives](vietnam/corporate/tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for* *more information**.*
## Calculation of taxable profit
Taxable profit is the difference between total revenue, whether domestic or foreign sourced, and deductible expenses (*see the [Deductions](vietnam/corporate/deductions.html) section*), plus other assessable income.
Taxpayers are required to prepare an annual CIT return, which includes a section for making adjustments to accounting profit to arrive at taxable profit.
## Local income taxes
There are no local, state, or provincial income taxes in Vietnam.
