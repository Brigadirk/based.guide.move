# Iraq
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 19 January 2025
Under the tax law, the amount due from any residing taxpayers to a non-resident, whether the payment is made in cash or credited to the account, is subject to withholding tax (WHT) at the rate of 15% if such amounts are related to interest on debentures, mortgages, loans, deposits and advances, as well as annual allowances, pension salaries, or other yearly payments.
The WHT rate in cases where a resident is making a payment for interest to resident is 1.8% to 10%.
Dividends are not subject to WHT since dividends paid out of profits that have been subject to tax are not taxed again in the hands of the shareholder.
Additionally, industries/activities (non-upstream) contracted with oil and gas companies are subject to WHT on all payments at a rate of 3.3% or 7%.
### WHT in Kurdistan region
The Ministry of Finance in Kurdistan has issued instruction number 7 regarding WHT implementation in Kurdistan region on 11 April 2022 as follows:
* The non-resident entity in Iraq will be subject to WHT at a rate of 15% from the deemed profit determined by the Ministry of Finance. *Please refer to the below table, which includes the deemed profit rates*.
