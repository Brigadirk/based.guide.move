# Panama
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 07 February 2025
Royalties and commissions on services paid to foreign entities are taxed through the application of the corresponding tax rate (i.e. 25%) over 50% of remittance under the concept of WHT (effective tax rate is 12.5%). The taxpayer may decide not to withhold taxes and consequently not deduct the expense.
Payment of interest is also subject to income tax on 50% of the interest paid to a beneficiary abroad on loans invested in Panama, but the payer must proceed with the WHT even if one does not deduct the interest.
If the beneficiary is registered as a taxpayer in Panama before the tax administration, no WHT may be required.
If, according to a special law, the payment of interest, royalties, dividends, fees, etc. is exempt from WHT, said exemption will not apply if the beneficial owner of the payment can credit the taxes that would have been paid in Panama in its country of residence. In the event that the credit application is not allowed in the country of residence, the taxpayer must request a formal opinion from an independent expert stating the non-applicability of the tax credit in the country of residence.
| Recipient | Dividends (%) | Interest (%) | Royalties (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Foreign corporations | 5/10/20\* | 12.5 | 12.5 |
In case of treaties, special rules are applicable in order to avoid double taxation.

Panama has deposited its instrument of ratification for the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (Multilateral Convention or MLI), which now covers almost 1,700 bilateral tax treaties, thus underlining its strong commitment to prevent the abuse of tax treaties and base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) by multinational enterprises.
For Panama, the MLI is in force. The MLI establishes the principal purpose test (PPT), and, as a result, in each case it should be studied how the MLI can affect tax treaty applications.
