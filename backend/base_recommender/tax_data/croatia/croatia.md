# Croatia
## Overview
Last reviewed - 07 January 2025
Croatia, a parliamentary republic in Central Europe that sits along the Adriatic Sea, is bordered by Slovenia to the north, Hungary and Serbia to the east, and Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro to the south. Croatia is divided into 20 counties and the city of Zagreb, which is also the capital of Croatia. The official language is Croatian, and the currency is euro (EUR). 
Croatia was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the end of World War I. In 1918, the Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes formed a kingdom known after 1929 as Yugoslavia. Following World War II, Yugoslavia became a federal social independent state. Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991.
On 1 July 2013, Croatia became the 28th European Union (EU) member state. It also became a member of the EUâ€™s borderless Schengen area on 1 January 2023.
