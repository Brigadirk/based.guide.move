There have been no significant developments in the taxation of individuals in Croatia during the past year.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 07 January 2025
A taxpayer for PIT purposes is every physical person deriving income.
Resident taxpayers are subject to worldwide taxation in Croatia. Non-resident taxpayers are liable to pay tax in Croatia on Croatian-source income. Non-resident performers (artists, entertainers, athletes) are not required to pay PIT if the fee for their performance is paid to a foreign legal entity and subject to WHT in line with CIT legislation.
Under certain circumstances, an individual can, either voluntarily or obligatorily, become a CIT (i.e. profit tax) payer instead of a PIT payer.
## Personal income tax (PIT) rates
Croatia has progressive tax rates that are applicable to the taxable base in the process of annual tax liability assessment. Progressive tax rates depend on an individual's place of residence or habitual abode in Croatia.
The local self-government units can choose on an annual level two progressive tax rates from a range where 15 % represents the lowest possible rate and 35.4 % represents the highest possible tax rate. However, the actual ranges from which a municipality/city can choose the lower and the higher of the two progressive tax rates depends on the size of the municipality/city:
  * A municipality can choose a lower rate in the range of 15 % to 22 % and a higher rate in the range of 25 % to 33 %.
  * A town with less than 30,000 inhabitants can choose a lower rate in the range of 15 % to 22.40 % and a higher rate in the range of 25 % to 33.60 %.
  * A town with more than 30,000 inhabitants can choose a lower rate in the range of 15 % to 23 % and a higher rate in the range of 25 % to 34.50 %.
  * The City of Zagreb can choose a lower rate in the range of 15 % to 23.60 % and a higher rate in the range of 25 % to 35.40 %.


The local self-government units have until 30 November of the current year at the latest to choose the rates applicable as of 1 January of the following year. The decision in made each year. Those locations for which a local self-government unit does not make a choice by the set deadline are subject to progressive tax rates of 20 % and 30 %.
The following types of income form part of the so-called 'annual income' that is subject to the process of annual tax liability assessment:
  * Employment income.
  * Self-employment income.
  * Other income that is not deemed 'final other income'.


Taxable base is calculated by applying prescribed tax deductions and tax allowances (i.e. non-taxable parts of income) to the total amount of annual income.
Tax deductions and tax allowances may, depending on the income type, also be applied when calculating monthly tax prepayments. The following tax rates and tax brackets are used on an annual basis, i.e. in the process of annual tax liability assessment:
Annual tax brackets (EUR) | Tax rate (%)  
---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 50,400 | 15 to 23.60  
50,400 | 25 to 35.40  
The following types of income form part of the so-called 'final income' that is not subject to the process of annual tax liability assessment:
  * Income from property and proprietary rights.
  * Income from capital.
  * Other income relating to the refund of social contributions.
  * Other income relating to the difference between taxpayer’s assets and reported sources for financing acquisition of assets.
  * Other income in relation to temporary and occasional seasonal work in agriculture.
  * Other income in relation to gratuity (tip), above the tax-free amount.
  * Income for which tax liability is determined on a lump-sum basis in line with PIT legislation.


Consequently, the difference between annual and final income is that the final income does not fall under the process of annual tax liability assessment and the tax paid on the final income is deemed finally paid tax (i.e. final income cannot be subject to additional taxation regardless of the amount of other types of income taxable at the annual level). On the other hand, the annual income is included into the annual tax liability assessment process; consequently, the tax prepayments are not necessarily the final tax payable on that income in the tax year in question.


# Croatia
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 07 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
The Croatian PIT system does not allow for joint annual tax return filing.
The annual tax return filing deadline is the end of February of the current year for the previous year.
Obligation to file an annual tax return exists if:
  * A taxpayer realises income from self-employment activities
  * International shipping crew members, Croatian residents, realise employment income, and
  * The tax administration requested the taxpayer to pay PIT subsequently.


The tax return shows the difference between the annual tax liability and the amount of tax prepayments made during the tax year. Depending on this difference, the taxpayer will be either entitled to a tax refund or will be required to make tax due payment.
The tax burden on income types that are included in the annual tax return can be higher compared to the tax burden indicated at each income category (e.g. other income that falls into the category of annual income).
A special procedure for annual assessment of PIT liability arising in connection with employment income and other income that falls into the category of annual income is applicable. The taxpayers are generally not obligated to file their annual tax return. Instead, the tax administration will carry out a special procedure for annual assessment of PIT liability.
Taxpayers can realise certain rights that are prescribed by the PIT Act (e.g. the right to increase basic personal allowance based on dependent family members, the right to avoid double taxation) by filing a request for a specific right to be recognised as part of the special procedure for annual assessment of PIT liability. The request filing deadline is the end of February of the current year for the previous year.
Income that falls into the category of final income is not included in the annual tax return nor does it fall under the process of annual tax liability assessment. Consequently, tax paid on the final income is deemed finally paid tax (i.e. it cannot be subject to additional taxation regardless of the amount of other types of income taxable at the annual level).
## Payment of tax
Depending on the income type and taxpayer’s circumstances, income tax prepayments can be paid:
  * On the basis of the tax administration’s assessment
  * On the basis of the filed annual tax return, or
  * At the time income is paid.


Such tax prepayments may constitute final tax (i.e. in case of final income) or a taxpayer may be obligated to file an annual tax return in order for the final annual tax liability to be determined (i.e. in case of annual income) or income enters the process of annual assessment of tax liability (i.e. in case of employment income and other income that falls into the category of annual income). In some cases, a taxpayer can voluntarily initiate the process of annual tax liability assessment in order to realise certain rights.
Based on the filed annual tax return, the tax administration issues a tax assessment. If per such assessment tax due is assessed, the taxpayer has 15 days from the day of tax assessment receipt to cover the tax due. Otherwise, late payment penalty interest is calculated.
Some of the exceptions to the above process are the following:
  * In case of taxpayers who are realising income from self-employment activity and are paying PIT based on the so-called lump-sum taxation ('_paušalno oporezivanje'_), the tax administration issues a tax assessment determining annual and monthly lump-sum tax liability. Annual tax refund or tax due is determined based on a special annual reporting form that the taxpayer needs to file within 15 days as of the end of the tax year for which the report is filed. In case of assessed annual tax due, the taxpayer needs to pay the tax due at the time of filing of the annual reporting form.
  * In case of taxpayers who are realising income from self-employment activity and are liable to file an annual tax return, they are liable to pay PIT arising in relation to the filed annual tax return by the annual tax return filing deadline.
  * In case of taxpayers who have been issued a tax assessment as a result of the special procedure for annual assessment of PIT liability carried out by the tax administration: 
    * If the taxpayer receives a tax assessment for the previous tax year by 30 June of the current year, one is liable to pay assessed tax due by 15 August of that year unless one files a complaint against the assessment.
    * If the taxpayer receives a tax assessment after 30 June of the current year, one is liable to pay assessed tax due within 45 days as of receipt of the assessment unless one files a complaint against the assessment.


## Tax audit process
The tax audit process is usually performed as follows:
  * Notification of a tax audit is sent to the taxpayer eight days prior to the tax audit, at the latest.
  * Tax audit is conducted with an interview with the taxpayer or an authorised person on behalf of the taxpayer.
  * Minutes of the tax audit are issued.
  * The taxpayer can complain to the minutes within a prescribed filing deadline. If objection shows new facts and evidence, the tax administration will prepare supplementary minutes.
  * Resolution of the tax audit is issued within 60 days as of the day deadline for objection to the minutes has expired or as of the day supplementary minutes have been provided to the taxpayer.
  * Appeal against the resolution can be filed within 30 days as of the day the taxpayer received the resolution.
  * After a rejected appeal, the taxpayer can initiate court litigation procedures.


## Statute of limitations
The tax administration's right to assess tax liabilities and interest; the tax administration's right to collect taxes, interest, and execution costs; and the taxpayer’s right to a refund of tax, interest, and execution costs is subject to a statute of limitations that becomes effective in six years, counted from the day statute of limitation commences. However, the tax administration may initiate the tax audit within three years counted from the day statute of limitation commences, with certain exceptions.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 07 January 2025
## Employment income (annual income)

Employers may give employees certain benefits that qualify as non-taxable. The following are the most common:
  * Reimbursement of travel expenses for coming to work (determined in the amount of the actual cost incurred by public transportation, i.e. monthly public transportation ticket).
  * Daily allowance for business trips in Croatia (up to EUR 30 _per diem_), plus travel and accommodation expenses.
  * Daily allowance for business trips abroad (the allowed sums are defined by a special decision and depend on the country), plus travel and accommodation expenses.

  * Severance payments paid under certain conditions (up to prescribed amounts).
  * Premiums for voluntary pension paid and borne by the Croatian employer into a Croatian voluntary pension fund for its employees are tax free up to EUR 67 per month (i.e. a total of EUR 804 per year).

If any of these benefits exceed the prescribed limits, the difference is considered to be salary and is subject to PIT and employer’s and employee’s social security contributions.
The taxable base for employment income is equal to total remuneration less expenditures (i.e. employee’s social security contributions) and applicable personal allowances (_see the_ _section_).
_Tax rates applicable to the annual taxable base for employment income are provided in the section_. Monthly tax brackets are provided in the table below.
Monthly tax brackets (EUR) | Tax rate (%)  
---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 4,200 | 15 to 23.60  
4,200 | 25 to 35.40  
Generally, tax calculation, withholding, and prepayments’ obligations, as well as all reporting obligations arising in respect to the realised income, lie with the income payer. However, there are cases (e.g. when income is realised directly from abroad) when this general rule is not applicable.
## Self-employment income (annual income)
Taxable self-employment income includes income from:
  * Small business (craft) and activities equivalent thereto
  * Independent professions (e.g. doctors, lawyers, consultants, artists, and similar) under certain circumstances
  * Agriculture and forestry activities as defined by the PIT regulations, and
  * Activity of electricity production.


Individuals realising self-employment activity are obligated to keep business books and evidences.
The taxable base for self-employment income is equal to business receipts less tax allowable business expenditures and applicable personal allowances (_see the_ _section_). Note that the relevant regulation specifically prescribes what is to be regarded as business receipts and business expenditures.
Taxpayers who earn self-employment income make monthly tax prepayments in accordance with annual tax returns that they are required to file after the year-end.
_Tax rates applicable to the taxable base for self-employment income are provided in the section_. 
A tax loss may be determined in respect of self-employment activities as well as other activities for which income is determined on the basis of business books. It can only be deducted from the income on the basis of which it has been determined. Tax loss can be carried forward for up to five successive years.
Derogations from the described tax compliance process are possible in case of a taxpayer realising self-employment activity who is not subject to VAT pursuant to the VAT Act and whose annual receipts from this activity do not exceed the amount prescribed by the VAT Act for the mandatory registration in the VAT system (EUR 40,000). The tax will be paid as a lump sum on the basis of the Tax Administration's assessment. Such taxpayer is not obligated to file an annual tax return in respect of this income.
Self-employed individuals are subject to social security contributions in accordance with special rules.
## Other income (annual income)
There are two categories of other income: (i) annual other income and (ii) final other income.
Annual other income is considered to be realised on the basis of the following:
  * Income received by the members of the supervisory, management, or other similar bodies of legal entities.
  * Royalties paid pursuant to a special act governing copyright and related rights.
  * Income arising from the activities of athletes.
  * Income received by travelling salesman, agents, referees and sports delegates, interpreters, translators, tourist workers, consultants, expert witnesses, and similar activities.
  * Income in kind, the use of buildings, means of transportation, favourable interest rates on credits, and other similar privileges granted by the payers of this income to individuals other than their employees.
  * Rewards to pupils during practical work and apprenticeship, as well as income of pupils during dual model education above tax-free amount.
  * Income of pupils and students in full-time education for the work via pupil and student associations, pursuant to special regulations above tax-free amount.
  * Scholarships to pupils and students for full-time education at secondary, two-year post-secondary, and higher schools and universities above tax-free amount.
  * Scholarships paid to athletes pursuant to special regulations for the improvement of their sport skills above tax-free amount.
  * Cash rewards for sport achievements and compensations to athletes pursuant to special regulations above tax-free amount.
  * Other unspecified income paid or given to individuals by legal entities and individuals (liable to profit tax or income tax based on self-employment activity) and other payers.


The taxable base for other income is equal to income less expenditures. Additional expenditures shall be recognised in the amount of 30 % of the income acquired on the basis of:
  * Royalties paid pursuant to a special act governing copyright and related rights, including considerations for delivered works of art paid to the persons engaged in artistic or cultural activities. Please note that in case of royalties received for the delivered work of art, 25 % of the amount is considered non-taxable, i.e. total income is decreased by 55 % (30 % + 25 %).
  * The work of professional journalists, artists, and athletes who are insured on that basis and pay compulsory insurance contributions pursuant to a ruling.
  * The income of non-residents arising from artistic, entertainment, sport, literary and visual art-related activities, and the activities connected with the press, radio, and television shows.


Tax levied on other income is withheld by a payer of income at the lower tax rate (ranging between 15 % and 23.60 %, depending on the individual's place of residence or habitual abode in Croatia) without provision for taxpayers to claim personal allowances.
Normally, other income is subject to social security contributions from received income, levied at 10 %, and on top of income, levied at 7.5 %.
Note that a taxpayer realising other income may, upon request, determine one’s income in the manner prescribed for self-employment activities.
## Income from property and property rights (final income)
Taxable income from property and property rights includes income from the following:
  * Rentals and leases.
  * Property rights.
  * Disposal of property and property rights.
  * Disposal of specific property categories (i.e. of waste) as in accordance with specific regulations.


Income from property and property rights is generally not subject to social security contributions. In specific circumstances, individuals realising income from property and property rights may be subject to social security contributions in accordance with special rules (e.g. if the income realised on this basis is taxed as self-employment income).
### Rentals and leases
The taxable base for income from property on the basis of rental or lease of movables and immovables can be decreased by 30 % for expenditures (lump-sum deduction). Tax payments are made according to the assessment issued by the Tax Administration.
The tax rate is 12 %, and no personal allowance is allowed.
### Property rights
The taxable base for income from property rights can be decreased by the amount of expenditures actually incurred, for which the taxpayer has proper and credible documentation. The expenditures are recognised based on a report that the taxpayer needs to file with the Tax Administration within 15 days as of year-end of the year for which the report is filed. The taxpayer needs to pay tax liability within 15 days of receiving the assessment. The tax rate is 24 %, and no personal allowance is allowed. 
### Disposal of property and property rights
The taxable base for income from disposal of property and property rights can be decreased by the procurement value (increased by a rise in producer prices of industrial products) and disposal costs. Tax payments are made according to the assessment issued by the Tax Administration. The tax rate is 24 %, and no personal allowance is allowed. 
### Disposal of waste
The taxable base for income from disposal of waste can be decreased in accordance with specific regulations. Tax payments are withheld by the income payer. The tax rate is 12 %, and no personal allowance is allowed. 
## Income from capital (final income)
Income from capital includes the following:
  * Interest income (excluding: late payment interest; interest realised on the basis of court assessments and assessments issued by bodies of local and regional government; interest realised on the basis of positive balance on giro, current and foreign currency account realised from banks, savings institutions and other financial institutions up to the level of interest such payers pay for a vista deposits assuming such interest is lower than the lowest level of interest paid for fixed-term deposits and assuming it is not higher than 0.5 % per year; interest from bonds [irrespective of the type of bond or bond issuer]; interest paid by debt securities and money market instruments issued by the Republic of Croatia and local and regional self-government units [e.g. treasury bills]; income realised on the basis of yield from life insurance with savings element and yield from voluntary pension insurance).
  * Withdrawal of assets and use of services by the members of legal entities for their private purposes at the expense of the current year's profit (note that this is also applicable in case of individuals who earn self-employment income that is subject to corporate income tax/profit tax).
  * Capital gains income realised from disposal of acquired financial assets and alienated within two years as of the date of acquisition when such alienation is not done between spouses, immediate family members, divorced spouses who are disposing of the assets in connection with the divorce, or when disposal is not in connection with financial assets' inheritance.
  * Income realised by board members and employees from grant of public and private limited liability company’s own shares or stock options for purchase of own shares at a favourable price. This also applies to shares and options for purchase of related public and private limited liability company's shares at a favourable price.
  * Dividends and shares of profit (and other corresponding distributions of profit) when paid out of profits realised in the period from 1 January 2001 through 31 December 2004 and as of 1 March 2012 onwards; there are certain exemptions (e.g. if dividends and shares of profit have been used for the purpose of increasing the company’s registered capital, if income is realised from investments into the Croatian Homeland War Veterans’ Fund).


The taxable base depends on the type of income from capital. No personal allowance is allowed when calculating tax prepayments at the rates stated below.
Tax calculation, withholding, and prepayments’ obligations, as well as all reporting obligations arising in respect to the capital income, lie with the income payer (unless income is realised directly from abroad) except for capital gains income.
The tax rates applicable to the taxable base are the following:
  * Income from interest, dividends, capital gains: 12 %.
  * Income from grant of own shares or stock option based on purchase of own stock at a favourable price: 24 %.
  * Income from withdrawals of assets and use of services: 36 %.


Capital losses can be deducted only from capital gains realised in the same tax year. Capital losses in relation to the disposal of financial assets that would, in case disposal resulted in capital gains, be exempt from taxation cannot be offset against the capital gains.
When it comes to capital gains income, obligation of keeping records, determining income from capital gains, tax calculation, tax prepayments, and reporting obligations lie with the financial assets holder, who may arrange it with the company/individual/Central Depository & Clearing Company Inc. to take over all obligations except for tax payment obligation. In case of capital gains realised on the basis of disposal of participation in capital of limited liability companies, a taxpayer is obligated to report the disposal to the Tax Administration and shall be obligated to pay tax on the basis of the tax assessment issued by the Tax Administration.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 07 January 2025
For the purpose of taxation, the PIT Act distinguishes between resident and non-resident taxpayers.
Taxpayers are deemed resident taxpayers where they:
  * have real estate in their ownership or at their disposal for an uninterrupted period of at least 183 days in one or two calendar years in Croatia (stay in the real estate is not a determining factor), or
  * are physically present in Croatia for at least 183 days in one or two calendar years. Short interruptions of stay, up to one year, are not decisive. 


Individuals who do not have real estate in their ownership or at their disposal nor are physically present for at least 183 days in one or two calendar years in Croatia are regarded as non-resident taxpayers.
If a taxpayer has real estate in one’s ownership or at one’s disposal in Croatia and abroad, one is considered a resident taxpayer in the country in which one's family resides; or if one has no family or place of one’s residence cannot be determined, one is deemed a resident taxpayer in the country from which one usually goes to work to or in which one is predominantly physically present. In case the other country does not consider such an individual as its resident taxpayer, one is deemed a Croatian resident taxpayer.
Where appropriate, provisions of the applicable Double Tax Treaty (DTT) are consulted for determining one's tax residence status for DTT purposes.

## Social security contributions
The Croatian social security system covers pension and health insurance.
Social security contributions are payable in respect of realised income or in respect of an artificial basis, depending on the status the individual has in the social security system as well as other relevant circumstances.
In the case of dependently employed individuals, social security charges are borne by the employee and employer.
Employee's social security contributions are pension contributions levied at the rate of 20 % (15 % first pillar payments, 5 % second pillar payments). The base for their payment is as follows:
  * For total monthly gross salary of up to (and including) EUR 700.00: The base is calculated as the total monthly gross salary reduced for EUR 300.00.
  * For total monthly gross salary ranging between EUR 700.01 up to EUR 1,300.00: The base is calculated as the total monthly gross salary reduced for 0.5 x (EUR 1.300,00 - total monthly gross salary).
  * For total monthly gross salary exceeding EUR 1,300.00, the base is the total amount of gross salary, which is further capped at the following values for 2024:


  *     * EUR 9,360.00 monthly cap (applicable for both first and second pillar payments in case of salary).
    * EUR 112,320.00 annual cap (applicable for first pillar payments irrespective of whether the payment is salary or another type of remuneration).


Additionally, employers make social contributions for the following social security benefits:
  * Health insurance: 16.5 %


The basis for payment of employer’s social security contributions is gross salary, which is not capped.
Employers have certain additional obligations with respect to disabled individuals.
Apart from some exceptions, employers employing 20 and more employees are required to employ a prescribed number of disabled individuals. The number amounts to 3 % of the total number of employees.
Employers that do not comply with prescribed requirements are required to pay a monthly fee amounting to 20 % of minimal gross salary (minimal gross salary for 2024 amounts to EUR 840.00) for each disabled individual that employer was required to employ.
