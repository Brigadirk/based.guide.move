## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
## Foreign tax relief
Resident individuals can use income taxes paid to a foreign country as a credit against imputed tax (subject to limitations and tax treaty conditions). A non-resident individual would not be entitled to a foreign tax credit.
As regards the credit method, the provisions described relating to unilateral relief will be supplementary to the credit provisions of the tax treaties. A WHT may not be deducted at an amount higher than the amount determined under the provisions of a tax treaty.
According to the Norwegian Tax Act, a foreign tax credit is granted for taxes paid abroad in respect of income derived from sources abroad and capital assets situated abroad.
The credit may not exceed the Norwegian tax, calculated before deducting the tax credit that is attributable to the relevant income category that has been taxed abroad (maximum tax credit). Nor may the tax credit exceed the amount of income tax actually paid abroad for the relevant income category. Tax credits exceeding the mentioned maximum may be carried forward for up to five years.
Foreign income tax may be credited only against Norwegian income tax, and foreign wealth tax may be credited only against Norwegian wealth tax.
## Tax treaties
### Double tax treaties (DTTs)
An individual Norwegian tax resident is entitled to claim tax credits and/or tax exemptions in respect of income derived from foreign sources. In order to decide what regulations apply, the current tax treaty must be examined. In previous years, the exemption method has been favoured in the Norwegian tax treaties, but this is changing, and new treaties are now based on the credit method to avoid double taxation.
_See the section in the Corporate summary for a list of countries with which Norway has a DTT_.
### Social security agreements
Social security agreements have been entered into with Australia, Canada, the European Economic Area, India, the United Kingdom, the United States, and others.
### Tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs)
TIEAs have been concluded with numerous countries, including countries where no other forms of tax treaties have been entered.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
## Proposals for special rules for private consumption in companies
On 9 May 2022, the Ministry of Finance sent out proposals for special rules for private consumption in companies. Originally, the consultation deadline for the proposal was set for 1 August 2022 and the planned entry into force in the income year 2023. In connection with the proposed national budget for 2023, the introduction of the rules has been postponed, and there will be published a new proposal in 2023, which is planned to take effect from 2024. In the 2024 state budget, the special rules were not implemented. A new proposal is expected in 2024, with potential entry into force in 2025.
## Changes regarding taxation of pension
The pension income tax free deduction and the thresholds for reducing the deduction are decided based on the pension level in the national budget issued in October, while the actual regulation of the deductions in the revised national budget issued in the spring are based on wage and price growth. Since there has been an increase in wage and price growth since October, there is a mismatch between the original estimate and actual pension growth.
The government is therefore increasing the threshold for step 1 for reducing the pension income deduction from 219,950 to 246,800 Norwegian kroner (NOK). In 2023, the deduction is phased out at a pension income level of NOK 567,650. The deduction will therefore apply to a smaller portion of pension income, resulting in a higher deduction. This is estimated to give an overall tax relief of NOK 4,500 for those who receive pension above the new threshold and up to the current threshold for step 2.
Further, this change results in a higher taxation of low pension income, since the rate for reducing the deduction is higher in step 1 than step 2 (16.7% and 6%, respectively). In order to steer the tax relief towards low pension income, the threshold for step 2 is therefore increased from NOK 331,750 to NOK 373,650. 
## Changes regarding deductions for commuter travel and long-haul drivers
The government is changing the tax-free deduction for additional costs for stays in barracks, boarding houses, and dormitories without cooking facilities when commuting from NOK 177 to NOK 250 per day. The rate for long-haul drivers will change from NOK 300 to NOK 350 per day. The changes come into effect on 1 September 2023, and it is therefore not necessary for employers to retroactively correct previously submitted salary reporting.
## Additional employer share
In 2023, an additional social security contribution was implemented, entailing 5% extra employer’s contribution on income exceeding NOK 750,000. (i.e. total contributions of 19.1%). The additional employer’s contribution will be phased out, starting by increasing the income threshold to NOK 850,000 for 2024. It is 'promised' that the additional 5% will be removed by 2025.
## Possible changes in exit taxation
On 20 March 2024, the Ministry of Finance issued a proposal for consultation regarding the amendment of the rules on the taxation of capital gains, etc. upon emigration. The proposed rules entail that individuals moving from Norway will be subject to an exit tax, which is to be paid in full upon emigration, in instalments over 12 years, or in full after 12 years. The rules have an uncertain aspect in relation to European Economic Area (EEA) law and could severely impact heirs. The consultation deadline expired on 21 May 2024, and the hearing is currently marked as not yet concluded.


# Norway
## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
Norwegian tax legislation distinguishes between full tax liability for resident taxpayers and limited tax liability for non-resident taxpayers. Residents are liable to income tax on their worldwide income, whereas non-resident taxpayers are only subject to income tax on specific types of income from Norwegian sources.
To simplify reporting and compliance for temporary employment in Norway, a pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system is introduced and in force from 1 January 2019. The PAYE scheme is applicable for limited tax liable non-resident workers, except workers offshore and seamen on ships, who have a salary below bracket tax level 3 (for the 2023 income year, the maximum amount is NOK 644,700; for 2024, the maximum amount is NOK 670,000). The rate is a flat 25% rate (includes social security contributions). Where PAYE applies, deductions are not applicable.
If PAYE applies, the workers are not in need of an individual tax return. The tax is final at payment and is, therefore, not subject to change.
Where an individual is tax liable to Norway only a part of the income year, the income is annualised. The same applies for certain deductions (i.e. personal deduction and minimum deduction, _see the section_).
The Norwegian income tax system for individuals is based on a dual tax base system: general income and personal income.
## General income tax
General income is taxed at a flat rate of 22%. The general income tax base comprises all categories of taxable income (i.e. income from employment, business, and capital). Tax allowances, expenses, and certain losses are deductible when computing general income. The taxes on general income are the county tax, the municipal tax (Norway is divided into 11 counties and subdivided into 356 municipalities), and the state tax.
## Bracket tax on personal income
Personal income between NOK 208,051 and NOK 292,850 is subject to a bracket tax of 1.7%. For personal income between NOK 292,851 and NOK 670,000, the bracket tax rate is 4.0%. For personal income between NOK 670,001 and NOK 937,900, the bracket tax rate is 13.6%. For personal income between NOK 937,901 and NOK 1,350,000, the bracket tax rate is 16.6%. For income exceeding NOK 1,350,000, the bracket tax rate is 17.6%. The personal income tax base comprises income mainly from employment, including benefits in kind, and pensions, as well as income from a self-proprietorship and certain remuneration from partnerships.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
## Taxable period
The fiscal year for individuals equals the calendar year (i.e. January thru December).
## Tax returns
Individuals will receive a pre-drafted tax return from the tax authorities to be controlled, corrected, and filed by 30 April of the consecutive year after the income year. Extensions may be granted by the tax authorities.
In cases where no amendments of the pre-drafted tax return needs to be made, filing is not required since the tax authorities will consider the pre-drafted tax return as accepted by the individual, and the tax assessment will be based on the information in the pre-drafted tax return.
Individuals on source tax (PAYE) are not required to file a tax return.
## Payment of tax
Individuals taxable in Norway are obligated to pay tax in advance during the income year. This applies to employees as well as self-employed persons. The employer must, without prior request, withhold taxes in advance. This also applies to foreign employers with employees working in Norway. An employer is defined as the person who oneself or through an authorised person pays the wages or other remuneration subject to the obligation to withhold taxes in advance. In case of hiring out of labour, both the contractor and subcontractor are responsible for fulfilment of this obligation.
The withholding is based on tax deduction cards issued by the local Assessment Office. This may either be a source tax card (PAYE) or an ordinary tax withholding card. If a tax deduction card has not been provided to the employer, the employer must withhold 50% of gross payments.
Advance tax paid by individuals as regards income not subject to withholding must be affected in four equal instalments during the income year, on 15 March, 15 May, 15 September, and 15 November. If the advance tax is not paid when due, an interest charge is imposed on the taxpayer.
When the assessed tax is higher than the withholding or advance tax, the difference is payable by the taxpayer in two equal instalments 3 and 8 weeks after the date on which the assessment has been made public. No payment is due before 20 August. Interest is charged on the amount equal to the instructive interest determined by the Norwegian National Bank less 22%. The taxpayer may avoid interest by making additional payments before 31 May in the assessment year. If the prepayments are greater than the assessed tax, the difference plus interest is refunded to the taxpayer.
## Tax audit process
Technically, the tax return is a self-assessment made by the taxpayer. The assessment provided by the tax authorities is based on information given by the taxpayer in the annual tax return (with supporting schedules) and other available information (e.g. reports from employers). If the assessment authorities find the information given by the taxpayer incomplete or incorrect, they may alter, add, or delete amounts. They may always alter estimates given by the taxpayer.
In certain cases, the taxable income and capital will be estimated by the assessment authorities at their discretion. This applies when the information given by the taxpayer is not considered to constitute a proper basis for the assessment and when the taxpayer has not filed a tax return or given other requested information.
The assessment will normally be finalised between June and October in the assessment year, depending on the nature of the taxpayer's income. A notice of assessment is sent to the taxpayer.
## Statute of limitations
A taxpayer can alter their personal tax assessment three years after the ordinary deadline.
The deadline for raising issues for amendment is normally five years after the end of the tax assessment period. The deadline is ten years if the taxpayer is subject to aggravated additional tax or is reported for violations of the penal provisions in Straffeloven. 
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Topics of focus for the tax authorities include undeclared salary, unreported foreign wealth, and tax avoidance in general, with a special focus on unreported wealth abroad and foreign employment income.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
## Personal deduction (_personfradrag_)
Individuals are entitled to a personal deduction for municipal taxation purposes. The allowance amounts to NOK 88,250. As of 2018, no special deduction is granted to spouses who are assessed jointly on their total income and capital.
## Minimum deduction (_minstefradrag_)
As an alternative to deduction for actual expenses, the taxpayer may claim a standard deduction, called the minimum deduction. The minimum deduction is intended to cover expenses normally connected with employment. The taxpayer may, however, choose to claim a deduction for actual expenses if these are higher. On the other hand, the minimum deduction may be claimed even if the taxpayer has not incurred any of the expenses the deduction is supposed to cover.
The deduction is 46% of the basis, the maximum being NOK 104,450 and the minimum NOK 4,000. The minimum deduction covers all expenses normally connected with employment, except additional expenses incurred through living away from home, interest payments, travelling expenses necessary for work, and union dues. Pension contributions, alimony, etc. are also not covered by the minimum deduction. Thus, such expenses may be deducted in addition to the minimum deduction.
## Interest expenses
As a general rule, interest expenses are deductible irrespective of whether the debt has any connection with the earning of income or not. Interest expenses are deductible irrespective of what the loan has been contracted for and irrespective of whether the loan is secured by mortgage or not.
If the taxpayer owns immovable property situated abroad or performs or participates in a business abroad and income from such property or business is exempt from tax in Norway under a tax treaty, only a proportional part of the business expenses is deductible, corresponding to the relationship between the value of the immovable property or assets abroad and the value of the total assets. Note that this is not applicable if immovable property is located in the EEA area.
## Alimony
In general, alimony is not deductible (and not taxable for the recipient).
## Charitable contributions
Deductions may be claimed for contributions to certain non-profit organisations. The total deduction per year may not exceed NOK 25,000.
## Contingent liabilities/pension schemes
Union dues are deductible (capped at NOK 7,700).
Both employers' and employees' contributions to various pension schemes may be deductible when certain conditions exist. The rules are of a very technical and extensive character.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are normally not deductible, including interest on tax due.
## Business versus non-business expenses
Expenses related to taxable income will normally be deductible (however, the minimum deduction will comprise expenses normally connected with employment). Private expenses not related to taxable income are not deductible.
## Losses
A loss or deficit incurred in business is normally deductible from other income in the year in which it occurs.
A capital loss is deductible to the extent a gain under similar conditions would have been taxable as general income.
As a general rule, a loss or deficit may be carried forward against a later year's income for an infinite period. The loss must be deducted the first year a profit arises.
A loss may only be carried forward in case of the taxpayer's bankruptcy to the extent that outstanding debts after the bankruptcy have been paid to the creditors.
A loss may normally not be carried back. However, when a business is terminated, a loss incurred in the year of termination or the previous year, which has not been set off, may be carried back for two years or one year, as the case may be.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
## Employment income
All types of income from employment, whether in cash or in kind, are normally taxable. Remuneration in kind includes items such as free housing, free car, and free travel. The taxable value of a company car and most other allowances are subject to withholding tax (WHT) along with the cash salary. The taxable values of these benefits are fixed annually by the tax authorities.
If the employee receives cash remuneration to cover housing costs, the gross income will be taxable. Married assignees with family abroad may claim a tax deduction for housing costs in Norway. In these cases only, the net profit will be taxable if the payment is split between deductible costs and profit. Personnel staying in hotels, guest houses, or barracks are subject to tax only on net profit on cash housing remuneration.
### Pensions with source in Norway
A tax of 15% is levied on all pensions with source in Norway. Exemptions may apply under tax treaties and for residents within the European Economic Area (provided certain conditions are met).
## Equity compensation
A benefit derived upon the exercise or sale of an option to acquire or sell shares or primary capital certificates related to employment is subject to tax on employment income. The benefit is calculated at the time of exercise.
For call options, such benefit is calculated as the difference between the market value of the shares upon exercise and the exercise price (less a possible premium paid).
For put options, the benefit is calculated as the difference between the exercise price and the market value of the shares (less a possible premium paid).
If the option itself is sold, a benefit is calculated as the difference between the sales price of the option and the acquisition cost (premium paid). The taxable benefit of the option is spread over the years during which it has been accumulated.
Social security contributions and income tax are computed as if the benefit of the option had been derived during the period the taxpayer held the option with the same amount for each year.
## Capital gains
Whether capital gains are taxable depends on the type of asset and the period of ownership. Losses will be tax deductible, provided that gain from the sale is taxable. Net positive capital income is subject to 22% income tax.
### Gains on shares and dividends
Gains on shares and dividends are adjusted by 1.72 before being taxed at the rate of 22% income tax. The effective tax rate on gains on shares and dividends is therefore 37.84%.
### Exit tax
Exit tax rules apply to total latent/contingent gains on shares and options exceeding NOK 500,000. The calculation of the taxable benefit is based on the value of the shares/options the last day before the day the individual is regarded as non-resident according to domestic rules or the individual is regarded as tax resident in another country according to tax treaty. If the shares/options are sold/exercised later than five years after the time the employee is regarded as non-resident, the tax liability lapses.
The Norwegian government has decided to review the exit tax regime and introduce stricter rules to ensure that unrealised gains accrued in Norway are actually taxed in Norway. As a starting point, the five-year exemption is therefore no longer applicable as of 29 November 2022. The taxability will also cover the transfer of shares to close family members living abroad.
## Interest income
Income on bank deposits, bonds, securities, or other outstanding amounts is taxable. The amounts are usually taxable in the income year in which they accrue.

There are no other significant tax credits or incentives for individuals in Norway.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
## Tax residency
Resident status is obtained when an alien resides in Norway more than 183 days in the course of any 12-month period or 270 days in any 36-month period.
An individual who is considered resident in Norway may, at the same time, be considered resident in another country under that country's domestic legislation (dual residence). If there is a tax treaty between that country and Norway, there are normally provisions in the treaty to determine in which country a person shall be considered resident in case of dual residence or how double taxation is to be eliminated. _See the section for a list of countries with which treaties exist_.
## Discontinuance of tax residency
When a person who is considered a Norwegian tax resident is moving from Norway, the individual will be considered resident until the first year they can prove that they have not stayed in Norway for more than a total of 61 days throughout the income year (1 January thru 31 December), and the individual (or any closely related person) has not had a dwelling in Norway at their disposal.For a person who has been a Norwegian resident for a minimum of ten years, the rule is that the individual must fulfil the above mentioned obligations for three consecutive years. Residence is broken from 1 January in the fourth year.

## Individual - Other taxes

## Social security contributions
The Social Security Law deals with the various benefits from and payments to the National Insurance Scheme.
The scheme is financed by the individual's and employer's social security contributions in addition to grants from the state and the municipalities. The individual's contribution is charged at a higher rate for self-employed persons (11%) than for employees (7.8%). The employer's contribution (14.1%) must be paid with respect to salaries, etc. The rates are determined by the Parliament in the annual decrees on contributions to the National Insurance Scheme.
Social security contributions are levied on the ‘personal income’ base.
### Employee's contribution
Individuals, including non-residents receiving remuneration for services performed in Norway, are liable to social security and pension contributions, which are paid together with income taxes. Foreigners may be wholly or partly exempted from social security contributions, according to social security agreements, or upon application, provided they are satisfactorily covered in their home country. The EEA agreement may also exempt member-country citizens from Norwegian social security.
The following conditions apply to both employed and self-employed individuals:
  * Income not exceeding NOK 69,650 is exempt; the contribution may not constitute more than 25% of the income for amounts in excess of NOK 69,650.
  * Income derived by individuals under 17 or over 69 years of age is subject to the contribution, but at a low rate of 5.1%.


The individual's contribution is not deductible for their tax purposes.
### Employer's contribution
The employer must also make social security contributions. The contribution is based on total Norwegian gross salary (and taxable benefit) costs. The employer’s contribution is levied at a rate of 14.1% but could be lower when the employer is established in certain sparsely populated areas. The employer share increases 5% (meaning a total rate of 19.1%) for income exceeding NOK 850,000 (NOK 750,000 in 2023).
Social security agreements may exempt the employer from this tax _(see the section for a list of countries with which social security agreements exist_). If a similar social security contribution is paid to another state based on the same salaries, etc., then a credit may be applied for against the employer's Norwegian social security costs.
The employer's contribution is deductible for tax purposes of the employer insofar as the wages to which it relates are deductible.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is a tax on sales. It is due to be paid when sales of goods and taxable services are taking place at all stages in the chain of distribution within Norway. VAT is also levied on imports.
The expenses (actual costs) are included in the following VAT rates:
  * Principal VAT rate: 25%.
  * Train: 12%.
  * Airplane: 12%.
  * Taxi: 12%.
  * Rental car: 25%.
  * Hotel, boarding house and rent: 12%.
  * Buying food, (e.g. in a grocery, take away): 15%.
  * Buying food in a restaurant: 25%.


## Wealth taxes
Individuals pay both municipal wealth tax and state wealth tax.
The municipal wealth tax rate is 0.7% and is calculated based on assets exceeding a net capital tax basis of NOK 1.7 million for single/not married taxpayers and NOK 3.4 million for married couples.
The state wealth tax rate is 0.3% and is calculated based on assets exceeding a net capital tax basis of NOK 1.7 million for single/not married taxpayers and NOK 3.4 million for married couples. For 2022, a new step for the state rate is introduced. For net wealth in excess of NOK 20 million (NOK 40 million for married couples), the rate is 0.4%.
Thus, the maximum wealth tax rate is 1.1%.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Inheritance and gift tax was removed as of 1 January 2014.
## Property taxes
Tax on property is an optional tax and decided by each municipality. If tax on property is levied, for personal homes and vacation homes, the minimum is 1‰ and maximum is capped at 4‰. A basic deduction may apply.
## Possible changes in exit taxation
On 20 March 2024, the Ministry of Finance issued a proposal for consultation regarding the amendment of the rules on the taxation of capital gains, etc. upon emigration. The proposed rules entail that individuals moving from Norway will be subject to an exit tax, which is to be paid in full upon emigration, in instalments over 12 years, or in full after 12 years. The rules have an uncertain aspect in relation to EEA law and could severely impact heirs. The consultation deadline expired on 21 May 2024, and the hearing is currently marked as not yet concluded.
