## Bolivian wealth tax
On 28 December 2020, the Executive approved a law on a wealth tax (‘ _Impuesto a las Grandes Fortunas_ ’ in Spanish) on resident and non-resident individuals who own a net wealth exceeding BOB 30 million as of 31 December of each year, with progressive rates between 1.4% and 2.4%. This tax has entered into force from 2020 onwards.
The law introduces relevant changes to the Bolivian tax system, which traditionally has followed the source or territoriality principle. In this sense, the law considers both assets located in Bolivia and abroad as taxable wealth in case of resident individuals.
This law also introduces a definition of tax residence for wealth tax purposes.
## Value-added tax (VAT) reimbursement regime
Law 1355 approved a VAT reimbursement regime for individuals with average monthly income up to BOB 9,000. The amount to be reimbursed is 5% of purchase goods included in fiscal invoices. In order to access this regime, individuals must register before the tax authorities.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
Bolivia taxes individuals only on their Bolivian-source income, regardless of their nationality/residence. In this regard, income arising from goods/assets located or utilised economically within Bolivian territory and performance of any activity carried out within the country is considered Bolivian-source income. No Bolivian taxes are imposed on foreign-source income earned by individuals.
## Personal income tax rates
The personal income tax (_Regimen Complementario del Impuesto al Valor Agregado_ or RC-IVA) rate is 13%.
Employers have the obligation to withhold and pay to the tax authorities the RC-IVA on gross income after deduction of social contributions and other concepts established by tax law.
In case of non-domiciled individuals who receive Bolivian-source labour income paid by non-resident entities (i.e. foreign employer), these non-domiciled individuals are considered direct taxpayers of RC-IVA and must declare and pay the tax on a monthly basis or upon leaving the country, whichever event occurs first.
## Local taxes on income
There are no local taxes on personal income in Bolivia.

## Tax returns
The employer submits a consolidated tax return on a monthly basis and withholds the tax (RC-IVA) on employee's income. No further tax filing requirement is required for this tax. Employees must submit tax returns if they are going to declare input VAT arising from purchases of goods/services to offset the corresponding RC-IVA.
Individuals working as employees are not required to submit an annual tax return. There is not a joint filing for husband and wife.
Individuals who are not employees and are subject to RC-IVA need to submit a tax return on a quarterly basis.
## Payment of tax
Employers file and pay taxes withheld on behalf of their personnel. Investment and other income must be declared on an individual basis, and the related tax liability is paid by the taxpayer on a quarterly basis.

## Social security contributions
Pension funds are administered privately, and only employees contribute toward their retirement pension. The contribution rate is 12.71% calculated on gross salary with a threshold of 60 minimum national salaries per month (i.e. approximately 19,400 United States dollars [USD]). This payment is registered under the individual account of each employee.
In addition, employees who earn more than 13,000 bolivianos (BOB) per month are subject to a supportive social contribution determined on a scale system from 1.15% up to 11.48% over the gross salary. Social tax charges are determined over the gross salary, including any compensation granted to the employee in-kind/cash.
Note that, according to the Pension Fund Law (Law 065), income arising from capital investment made in the country and abroad in the way of interest, dividends, or any kind of income obtained as a result of such investment are subject to a supportive social contribution determine on a scale system from 1.15% up to 11.48%. In this regard, it is important to mention that this social security contribution has not yet been collected due to the lack of further regulations.
