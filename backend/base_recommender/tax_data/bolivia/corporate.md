## 2025 General State Budget
In January 2025, Law 1613 was enacted to approve the government budget for the fiscal year 2025, which authorises the Ministry of Economy to: (i) raise public debt in external capital markets for an amount up to 3 billion United States dollars (USD) or its equivalent in other foreign currencies with a tax exemption on related interest and (ii) to manage and enhance transactions involving certified Emission Reduction Units (Carbon Credits or Bonds) including signing, negotiating, transferring, and using them as collateral or for future sales. In particular, Law 1613 exempts from corporate income tax (CIT) interest income from public debt through the issuance of securities in external capital markets and repurchase agreement operations involving securities issued by the Bolivian Government, including the provision of legal, financial, and other advisory services related to the operation of public debt in external capital markets and carbon market operations.
Furthermore, Law 1613 establishes tax incentives in connection with:
  * the import and sales of capital goods and industrial plants within the domestic market (i.e. exemption of payment of VAT for importations and application of a zero-rate VAT in respect of local sales);
  * the import of crude oil, gasoline for motor vehicles and diesel oil by legal entities and individuals (i.e. exemption of payment of VAT for importation of the previously mentioned goods);
  * domestic sales of soybean, cusi, totaí, and other cultivated or wild species and/or their derivatives, exclusively intended to produce biodiesel and/or ecological diesel for Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB) plants (i.e. exemption of payment of Transaction Tax and application of a zero-rate VAT in respect of local sales); and
  * the total or partial reinvestment of profits or dividends obtained in Bolivia by non-resident shareholders (i.e. reduction of withholding taxes (12.5%) based on the percentage of reinvestment of profits/dividends.


## Tax incentives on the import and sale of capital goods
Law 1613 establishes tax incentives for the economic reactivation and promotion of the importation substitution policy, for which it is established the following:
  * VAT exemption on the importation of capital goods and industrial plants for the agricultural and industrial sectors.
  * Zero-rate VAT for sales within the domestic market of capital goods and industrial plants for the agricultural, construction, mining, and industrial sectors.


These tax incentives have a period of one year commencing from 1 January 2025 until 31 December 2025.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Taxable period
The taxable year is the fiscal year. The fiscal year varies according to the activity of the corporation. Banks and commercial and other service activities have a fiscal year-end as of 31 December; industrial, oil, and gas companies as of 31 March; agribusiness and forestry companies as of 30 June; and mining companies as of 30 September.
## Tax returns
CIT is assessed on a self-assessment basis every fiscal year, and the due date for submission is 120 days after the fiscal year-end. Tax returns must be accompanied by audited financial statements (if applicable) and ancillary tax information as requested by the tax authorities.
## Payment of tax
CIT is payable in one annual payment 120 days after the fiscal year-end, except for mining companies, which are obligated to make advance payments on a monthly basis with respect to the additional tax (i.e. 12.5% and 7.5% for exploitation and manufacturing mining companies, respectively).
## Tax audit process
The tax audit process starts with a formal notification from the tax authorities where they indicate fiscal periods and taxes to be reviewed, together with a requirement of information. Tax inspection may generally take a 12-month period. Shortly after the provision of the finalisation of the tax inspection, a preliminary report of the tax audit’s results is provided to the taxpayer in which the total tax debt is described (i.e. tax due, restatement, interests, and penalties) together with the legal arguments supporting the tax enquires.
Taxpayers do have 30 days after receiving the preliminary report to present all supporting documentation and technical arguments if they consider that the tax enquires do not have grounds to be claimed. Tax authorities do have 60 days to review all documentation/arguments provided by the taxpayer and then issue the final report, which is the formal document that could be subject to tax litigation, either via administrative process of by a judicial court. Note that claimed taxes must be paid in advance if taxpayers decide to litigate directly through the judicial court.
## Statute of limitations
According to the current BTC, tax authorities have up to eight years to review and recalculate taxes determined by taxpayers, and this period could be extended two years more if taxpayers do not register in the appropriate regime or if taxpayers have performed commercial and/or financial transactions with a person (corporate or individual) resident in a country/region considered a low or nil taxation jurisdiction. This period must be computed as of the first day of the following year in which the tax payment due date has occurred (e.g. if the tax payment deadline occurred in August 2022, the period that can be subject to tax review is 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2030).
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
There are not specific topics/taxes of focus in which the tax authorities address their review. This will generally depend on the nature of the taxpayer and the industry where they belong (e.g. a mining company could be more likely to be subject to tax inspections than an industrial company). There are no formal statistics to provide information in this regard.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
A corporation is considered resident in Bolivia if it has been incorporated in Bolivia.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Note that Bolivian commercial laws allow foreign corporations to carry out isolated commercial acts in Bolivia without the obligation to constitute a permanent representation in Bolivia; however, such corporations cannot carry out habitual commercial acts without fulfilling the requirements established to constitute a company in Bolivia (e.g. through either a subsidiary or a branch). Unfortunately, Bolivian legislation does not include provisions to regulate situations that could trigger PE nor does it define what should be understood by 'carrying out habitual commercial acts'.


# Bolivia
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
As a general principle, expenses may be deducted for CIT purposes as long as they are necessary to generate Bolivian-sourced income and are properly documented.
Apart from the above, the Bolivian Tax Code (BTC) has established minimum amounts (BOB 50,000) for which taxpayers must document their economic transactions through documents of payments recognised by the Bolivian financial system and regulated by the _Autoridad de Supervisión del Sistema Financiero_ or ASFI (i.e. the bank regulator), including the possibility to document economic transactions through payments made via foreign financial institutions. Non-compliance with these requirements implies the lack of the possibility to compute input VAT and to deduct the associated expenses for CIT purposes.
## Depreciation
Depreciation of fixed assets is permitted for CIT purposes if fixed assets contribute to generate taxable income. Depreciation must be calculated based on a straight-line method and considering useful lives included in the tax law. Fixed assets that are not included in the tax law must be depreciated under a straight-line method in accordance with their useful lives, and this needs to be communicated to the tax authorities within ten working days following the incorporation of the affected fixed assets.
Some of the assets included in the tax law are as follows:
Asset | Useful life (years) | Depreciation rate (%)  
---|---|---  
Building | 40 | 2.5  
Fixture and furniture | 10 | 10.0  
Machinery | 8 | 12.5  
Equipment and facilities | 8 | 12.5  
Vehicles | 5 | 20.0  
Computer equipment | 4 | 25.0  
Tools | 4 | 25.0  
Processing plants for the oil/gas industry | 8 | 12.5  
Pipeline | 10 | 10.0  
Aircraft | 5 | 20.0  
Ships and motorboats | 10 | 10.0  
## Goodwill
Intangible assets (including goodwill) with a true cost can be deductible for tax purposes within a five-year period as long as taxpayers have paid a price for their acquisition.
## Start-up expenses
Taxpayers may choose to deduct start-up expenses within the first fiscal period or distribute proportionally their amortisation within a four-year period, commencing the first year of operation. Note that start-up expenses cannot exceed 10% of paid-in capital.
## Interest expense
Interest paid to owners or shareholders is not deductible to the extent the interest rate exceeds the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 3% in the case of foreign owners/shareholders and to the extent the interest rate exceeds the official interest rate on loans published by the Central Bank of Bolivia for national owners/shareholders. Interest deductible on shareholder loans may not exceed 30% of the total interest paid to third parties.
## Bad debt
Allowances for bad debt provisions are permitted if determined as required by law, which establishes an average method based on uncollectable receivables of the last three years. Uncollectable receivables are defined by current legislation as those that come from trade receivables and either: (i) remain unpaid for more than one year and have been sued without obtaining a seizure or (ii) when the receivables do not justify being sued due to the quantity of the receivables, remain unpaid for more than three years.
## Charitable contributions
Donations are not deductible unless made to non-profit organisations that are not subject to CIT. These donations are deductible up to a maximum of 10% of the donor’s net taxable profit.
## Compensation expenses
Salaries, as well as associated compensations, paid to employees without the application of withholding taxes (WHTs) (i.e. RC-IVA) are not deductible.
Provisions for employees’ severance payments are deductible. Provisions of other bonuses (e.g. holiday, productivity bonuses) accrued on behalf of employees are tax deductible as long as they are paid prior to the annual CIT filing due date and the company demonstrates it has withheld taxes (if applicable).
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties arising from late tax payments are not tax deductible (except interest and restatement by inflation associated with tax obligations).
## Taxes
Taxes effectively paid by the corporation as a direct taxpayer, other than CIT and FTT, are deductible for tax purposes. Any transaction tax (tax on gross income) that has been offset against CIT paid is not deductible for CIT purposes.
Taxes paid in the acquisition of fixed assets are not deductible. These taxes must be included in the cost of the asset and depreciated accordingly.
## Other significant items
In broad terms, the following additional items are not deductible for tax purposes, according to current legislation:
  * Owners’ or shareholders’ personal withdrawals and living expenses.
  * Fees paid to individuals (i.e. acquisition of goods and services) for which no WHTs have been withheld.
  * Amortisation of trademarks and other intangible assets, unless a price has been paid to acquire them.
  * Provisions that are not specifically authorised by the tax law and regulations.
  * Depreciation of fixed assets that include a revaluation reserve.
  * Losses arising from illegal acts.


## Net operating losses
Tax losses can be utilised over the following three fiscal years. New entrepreneurial productive projects with a minimum capital of BOB 1 million can utilise tax losses over the five fiscal years following the start-up of operations (including hydrocarbons and the mining sector).
Tax losses cannot be restated due to inflation in any case.
Bolivian legislation does not envisage carryback provision for tax losses.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments to foreign affiliates are subject to a 12.5% WHT with no restriction if the Bolivian company is remitting Bolivian-sourced income (e.g. interest on loans, provision of any kind of services, royalties). 


# Bolivia
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
Bolivia does not include group taxation rules within its legislation.
## Transfer pricing
### Arm’s-length principle
The value of commercial and/or financial transactions carried out between related parties must be the value that would have been agreed between independent parties if they had engaged in the same transaction under the same circumstances. In addition, domestic companies related to foreign companies must prepare their accounting records separately, so that their financial statements determine taxable net profits from Bolivian-source income.
### Existence of relationship
There is a relationship when an individual or a corporate entity participates in the direction, control, administration, or has capital in the other company, or when a third party directly or indirectly participates in the direction, control, administration, or has capital in two or more companies.
When individuals or domestic companies directly or indirectly conduct commercial and/or financial transactions with individuals or companies domiciled in countries or regions with low or null taxation (tax havens), these transactions will be considered as if they were carried out between related parties. Note that the Bolivian legislation initially approved Administrative Resolution 10170000001, which includes a reference list of countries/regions considered low or nil taxation jurisdictions based on guidelines set forth by Supreme Decree 2993. On 15 February, Administrative Resolution 101900000002 was issued, which updated the countries/regions considered low or nil taxation jurisdictions for tax purposes.
### Requirement to submit a transfer pricing study
Taxpayers must submit a transfer pricing study to the Bolivian IRS in regard to the transactions carried out between related parties, together with the statutory financial statements and the annual CIT return. The transfer pricing study must include, among others:
  * Complete identification of the taxpayer and related parties.
  * Description of the activity carried out.
  * Description, characteristics, amounts, and volume of transactions carried out between related parties.
  * Tax identification number and country of residence of related parties.
  * Commercial strategies, including determination of prices and other special circumstances.
  * Functions carried out by the taxpayer within the related transaction from a commercial and industrial perspective.


### Transfer pricing methods
Each of the following six methods may be used to determine the value of a commercial and/or financial transaction carried out between related parties:
  * Comparable uncontrolled price.
  * Resale price method.
  * Cost plus method.
  * Profit split method.
  * Transactional net margin method.
  * Evident price on transparent markets method.


The application of the above-mentioned methods will depend on the nature and the real economic situation of the transactions under analysis and the circumstances of each case (i.e. rule of the best method). Definitions of the methods are in line with international principles defined by the OECD, except for the sixth method, which comes from Argentinian legislation with some variations.
When it is not possible to determine the value of a transaction through one of the above-mentioned methods, taxpayers can apply other methods that are in accordance with the nature and real economic situation of the transaction.
## Thin capitalisation
Bolivian legislation does not include provisions for thin capitalisation apart from establishing restrictions on deductibility of interest when funding is provided by shareholders (_see Interest expense in the section_).
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no CFC provisions in Bolivia.


# Bolivia
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
Branch income is subject to the same tax applicable to other types of Bolivian corporations (i.e. CIT of 25%). However, the net profits of Bolivian branches are deemed to be distributed to the head office at the annual filing due date for CIT (i.e. 120 days after the fiscal year-end); consequently, a Bolivian branch must withhold 12.5% on such deemed distributed profits. Note that this can be avoided as long as the head office decides to reinvest the Bolivian branch's net profits.


# Bolivia
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Foreign tax credit
Bolivian legislation does not include provisions regarding recognition of foreign tax credits.
## Investment incentives

  * 3.125% for reinvestments equal to or greater than 75% of the profit/dividend;
  * 6.25% for reinvestments between 50% and 74.99% of the profit/dividend; and
  * 11.25% for reinvestments between 25% and 49.99% of the profit/dividend. 


## Export incentives
Export activities benefit from reimbursement of VAT and customs duties paid in the process of producing goods to be exported (with some limitations for oil/gas companies).
## Other incentives
Foreign exchange transactions are legal in Bolivia, and a system of free-floating exchange rates exists, although, in practice, the US dollar has had an official fixed exchange rate published by the Bolivian Central Bank for approximately the last ten years.

In addition, importation of books, magazines, and newspapers are exempted from importation taxes (i.e. VAT), and the sale of produced or imported books are taxed at the zero VAT rate.
International transportation by highway is also exempt from VAT (or subject to 0% VAT rate).
The provision of legal, financial, and other advisory services related to the operation of public debt in external capital markets and carbon market operations are are exempted from CIT.
Domestic sales of soybean, cusi, totaí and other cultivated or wild species and/or their derivatives, exclusively inteded to produce biodiesel and/or ecological diesel for Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB) plants (i.e. exemption of payment of Transaction Tax and application of a zero-rate VAT in respect of local sales).
## Regional manufacturing tax incentives
New investments (excluding services and commerce) and expansions of existing investments in the city of El Alto (Department of La Paz) will be eligible for the following benefits provided the Municipal Government of El Alto approves the investment proposal submitted by the investors and asset retention within El Alto for up to 20 years (10 years under CIT exemption and an additional 10 years without benefits).

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Payments made to Bolivian residents
Dividends paid to Bolivian residents, either individuals or corporations, are not taxable.
Payments made by corporations to individuals with respect to the acquisition of goods or provision of services that are not supported with an invoice or fiscal receipt are subject to a WHT of 8% on goods and 16% on services.
## Payments to non-residents
Dividend payments, distributions of profits to the head office by Bolivian branches, interest payments, royalty payments, and fees paid for any type of services made to non-residents are subject to a WHT of 12.5%. -note that this WHT rate can be reduced if dividends/profits are totally or partially reinvested (_see the section_)-.
Activities considered partially performed within Bolivian territory (e.g. telecommunication services, insurance, transportation, production/distribution of cinematographic films, etc.) by non-residents are subject to a reduced WHT of 2.5%.
Payments to non-domiciled individuals for their activities performed within Bolivian territory are subject to a WHT at a rate of 16%, such rate refers to transaction tax at rate of 3% and personal income tax (_Regimen Complementario del Impuesto al Valor Agregado_ or RC-IVA) at a rate of 13%.
## Tax treaties
Bolivia currently has in force double tax treaties (DTTs) with the Andean Community (i.e. Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru), Argentina, France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.
Beneficial WHT rates on dividend distributions are provided by DTT with Spain and Sweden at 10% and 0%, respectively, provided the Spanish or Swedish holding company demonstrates it is the beneficial owner and holds more than a 25% interest in the Bolivian company. 


# Bolivia
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
Taxable income is determined based on the financial statements prepared under Bolivian GAAP, then the income is adjusted for tax purposes in accordance with guidelines provided with respect to non-deductible and non-taxable items.
## Inventory valuation
Inventories must be valued at replacement cost or market value for tax purposes, whichever is lower. Replacement cost is defined as the necessary costs incurred in acquiring or producing the assets as of the year-end, whereas market value is defined as the net value that the company would have obtained for the sale of assets in normal conditions as of the year-end, less commercialisation direct expenses.
## Capital gains
Bolivian legislation does not include specific regulations for capital gains. Capital gains must be included in annual CIT if they are considered Bolivian-source income and will be taxed at a rate of 25%.
## Dividend income
Dividend income obtained from domestic corporations subject to CIT must be excluded from the net taxable profits of the investor. Dividend income obtained from foreign corporations is not subject to CIT due to the fact that it is not considered Bolivian-source income.
## Interest income
Interest income is subject to annual CIT if loans have been economically utilised within Bolivian territory since associated interest is considered Bolivian-source income.
Law 1613, which approves the government budget for the fiscal year 2025, exempts from CIT interest income from public debt through the issuance of securities in external capital markets and repurchase agreement operations involving securities issued by the Bolivian Government. 
## Rent/royalty income
Rent/royalty income is subject to annual CIT as long as the income comes from an asset situated or economically utilised in Bolivian territory.
## Foreign income
Bolivian corporations are taxed only on income generated within Bolivian territory.


# Bolivia
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
All companies in Bolivia are subject to CIT at a rate of 25%. The taxable base is the profit arising from financial statements prepared in accordance with Bolivian generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), adjusted for tax purposes (i.e. by non-deductible and non-taxable items) as per the requirements established in the tax law and regulations.
Bolivia taxes the income generated by corporations following the 'income source' principle (i.e. on a territorial basis). Therefore, income arising from goods and assets located or utilised economically within Bolivian territory and from any activity carried out within the country is considered Bolivian income source. Hence, such income is subject to CIT, regardless of the nationality/residence of the parties involved in generating such income or the place where the contracts were subscribed.
## Additional income tax on certain financial institutions and insurance/reinsurance companies
Financial institutions (except for development banks) and insurance/reinsurance companies with a return on equity index higher than 6% must pay an additional income tax of 25%. This additional income tax cannot be offset against the transaction tax (_see below_), nor can it be considered a deductible expense for CIT purposes.
## Surtax on extractive activities
There is an additional 25% CIT that affects only extractive activities of non-renewable natural resources (mining and oil/gas). This additional tax is calculated on the same basis as the normal CIT, except that two additional deductions are allowed: (i) up to 33% of the accumulated investment as of 1991, and (ii) 45% of the gross revenue of each extractive operation (e.g. a field or a mining site), with a threshold of 250 million bolivianos (BOB) for each extractive operation.
## Special taxes on mining companies
In addition to the general CIT of 25% and the 25% surtax on extractive activities, all mining companies are also subject to an additional tax, calculated on the taxable net profits, at the following rates:
  * 12.5% if the mining company carries out exploitation activities.
  * 7.5% if the mining company carries out manufacturing activities with raw minerals that add value.


Mining companies are also subject to mining royalties at a rate of between 1% and 7% (depending on the kind of mineral), calculated on the total sales price. Note that there is a 60% discount on the rates of mining royalties if minerals are sold within the Bolivian market. Mining royalties can be offset against CIT if official mineral prices are lower than the prices established by the tax law; however, in this case, mining royalties paid will not be deductible for CIT purposes. On the contrary, if official mineral prices are higher than the prices established by the tax law, then mining royalties will be considered a deductible expense for CIT purposes. Note that mining royalties paid on minerals and metals that are not included in the tax law can always be offset against CIT.
## Tax on gross income (transaction tax)
The tax on gross income (also known as transaction tax) generally taxes gross income arising from the performance of any economic or commercial activity (including non-profitable activities) at a rate of 3% on a monthly basis. However, exceptions exist for the sale of investments (as defined by the Stock Exchange Law) and the sale of minerals, oil, and gas within the local market, as long as such sales will ultimately be exported.
In essence, corporations pay either CIT or transaction tax, whichever is higher. From an administrative perspective, CIT is due and paid at the end of each tax year and is considered an advanced payment of transaction tax, while transaction tax is due monthly. If during the year the cumulative monthly transaction tax due exceeds the CIT prepayment, the taxpayer will be subject to transaction tax on a monthly basis until the end of the tax year. For example, a corporation pays CIT for the 2024 fiscal year in April 2025. This payment is considered a prepayment for the transaction tax due between May 2025 and April 2026.
## Local income taxes
There are no departmental or local taxes on income in Bolivia.


# Bolivia
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is levied on the sale of movable goods and provision of services carried out within Bolivian territory at a rate of 13%, including definitive importations. Since this tax is included in the final price, the effective tax rate amounts to 14.94% (13%/87%).
## Customs duties
Definitive importations are also subject to customs duties at the following rates: 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%, and 40%, depending on the product classification. Customs duties are calculated over the ‘transaction value’ of the merchandise valued as per Bolivian customs legislation, plus transportation and insurance costs.
## Taxes on specific goods for consumption (excise tax)
Specific goods are taxed at the following rates (applicable for year 2025):
Product | Tax rate  
---|---  
Black cigarettes | BOB 85.30 per 1,000 cigarettes  
Blond tobacco cigarettes and cigars | BOB 160.22 per 1,000 cigarettes  
Other cigarettes and tobacco for pipes | 50%  
Soft drinks (except natural water and fruit juices) | BOB 0.51/litre  
Energising drinks | BOB 5.74/litre  
Maize liquor | BOB 1.02/litre  
Alcohol | BOB 1.95/litre  
Beers with 0.5% or more volumetric degrees | BOB 4.30/litre + 1%

Ciders and sparkling wines (except maize liquor) | BOB 3.94/litre + 5%  
Liquors and creams in general | BOB 3.94/litre + 5%  
Rum and vodka | BOB 3.94/litre + 10%  
Other brandies/liquors | BOB 3.94/litre + 10%  
Whiskey | BOB 16.49/litre + 10%  
## Special tax on hydrocarbons and derived products
A tax is charged on the commercialisation of hydrocarbons and their derived products within the local market, regardless of whether they are produced in Bolivia or imported. This tax is updated by the Hydrocarbon National Agency and has a threshold annually updated by the Bolivian Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which currently amounts to BOB 8.80/litre (applicable as of 1 January 2025).
## Direct tax on hydrocarbons
A direct tax on hydrocarbons (IDH) is applied on the production of hydrocarbons, measured at the wellhead point, at a rate of 32%. To determine the taxable base for this tax, production of hydrocarbons must be valued taking into account the average sales price and considering the market (internal/external) where such hydrocarbons were sold.
## Property tax on real estate and vehicles
Real estate and vehicles are annually subject to municipal government property taxes at progressive rates that range from 0.35% to 1.5% and 1.5% to 5%, respectively. Regarding real estate, property values and tax bands are determined by each municipal government, thus real estate is taxed differently depending on its location.
## Transfer taxes
Transfer of property and real estate are subject to a transfer tax at a rate of 3%. This tax must be determined based on the provisions set forth for the transaction tax (tax on gross income; _see the section_) and is collected by the municipal government or by the tax authorities, which will depend on where the real estate is located and the nature of the seller.
## Stamp taxes
There are no stamp taxes in Bolivia.
## Payroll taxes
Employers are obligated to withhold and pay RC-IVA (_Regimen Complementario al Impuesto al Valor Agregado_) on gross salaries paid to employees on a monthly basis at a rate of 13% after labour contributions made to the pension fund administrators and deduction of other concepts established by tax law. Gross salary includes base salary, commission, bonuses, living allowance, and any other compensation in kind/cash granted to the employee.
In case of non-domiciled individuals who receive Bolivian-source labour income paid by non-resident entities (i.e. foreign employer), these non-domiciled individuals are considered direct taxpayers of RC-IVA and must declare and pay the tax on a monthly basis or upon leaving the country, whichever event occurs first.
## Social contributions
The Pension Law establishes employer social contribution obligations. Social tax charges for employers are equal to 17.21% of gross salary in general and 19.51% for the mining sector.
## Financial Transaction Tax (FTT)
An FTT is levied on bank transactions (deposit or transfer of funds), carried out within the domestic financial system, at a rate of 0.30% for fiscal years (FYs) 2023 through 2028. 
## Special tax on lottery and gambling games
A specific tax on lottery and gambling games is applied in Bolivia. The tax is also applicable to business promotions that involve a raffle or random activities in providing awards in order to increase sales or attract clients. The tax rate for lottery and gambling games is 30%, whereas the tax rate for business promotions is 10%.
