# Bolivia
## Overview
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
The Plurinational State of Bolivia ("Bolivia"), a landlocked country in South America, is bordered by Brazil to the north and east, by Argentina and Paraguay to the south, and by Chile and Peru to the west. It is a democratic republic that is divided into nine departments. Its capital city is Sucre; however, the government is based in La Paz. The boliviano (BOB) is the official currency of Bolivia, and the official languages include Spanish and numerous native languages.
Bolivia is rich in natural resources and has the second largest natural gas reserves in South America. Foreign and domestic investments have increased mainly in the construction and infrastructure sector (construction of highways, bridges, buildings, shopping centres). In 2018, the Bolivian government entered into a construction project of a Research and Development in Nuclear Technology Centre to be set up in El Alto, La Paz with a proposed investment of approximately 300 million United States dollars (USD), which is envisaged to be one of the most important nuclear centres in South America. This project is expected to be concluded in 2025. Similarly, there is also a relevant project related to the construction of a lithium carbonate plant in Uyuni, Potos√≠, which is began operations in December 2023 and will increase its production in 2025.
