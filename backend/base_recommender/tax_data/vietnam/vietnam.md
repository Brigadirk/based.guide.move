# Vietnam
## Overview
Last reviewed - 22 August 2024
Vietnam is located in the centre of Southeast Asia with a land area of 331,689 square kilometres. It is bordered by China to the north, Laos and Cambodia to the west, and the East Sea to the east. Vietnam is in an ideal position for the development of the economy in general, and trade and tourism in particular. Its capital is Ha Noi, and its currency is the dong (VND). Vietnamese is the national and official language of Vietnam.
The modern-day history of Vietnam is perhaps best started by reference to the Geneva Accord signed in 1954, which ended French colonial rule following the conquest in 1858 and partitioned the country into two parts. Since 1986, Vietnam has been carrying out economic reforms under the 'Doi Moi' (Renovation) to move from a central-planned economy maintained from its reunification in 1975 to a market-oriented economy. Since then, Vietnam has recorded important achievements in socio-economic fields and has become one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, with average annual gross domestic product (GDP) of 7% during 2015 to 2019. After two years being affected by COVID-19, Vietnam bounced back impressively in 2022 with the GDP growth rate of 2022 of 8.02%, becoming the fastest annual pace since 1997. In 2023, the GDP of Vietnam grew by 5.05%, lower than target by one percentage point but still outpacing many other nations, according to the government. Vietnam joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in January 2007, following more than a decade-long negotiation process. WTO membership has provided Vietnam an anchor to the global market and reinforced the domestic economic reform process. To-date, Vietnam stands firmly on its path of global economic integration with a total of 16 Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) already concluded.
Moving forward, Vietnam has its sights set on becoming a developing, upper-middle-income country with modern industry by 2030 and a high income, developed country by 2045. As the nation becomes more integrated with the regional and global economy, we believe that by standing united and acting with greater resolve, the nation will overcome challenges and achieve a new state of normal.
