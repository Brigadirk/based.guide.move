## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
Cyprus is expanding and updating its double tax treaty (DTT) network. A first-time Cyprus-Netherlands DTT entered into force as of 30 June 2023 and is effective as of 1 January 2024. A first-time Cyprus-Croatia DTT was signed and entered into force in 2023 and is effective as of 1 January 2024. A revised Cyprus-France DTT was signed on 11 December 2023 and is now awaiting ratification before it becomes effective.
Cyprus is an early adopter of the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) on automatic exchange of financial account information and also has signed an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) with the United States (US) for the Financial Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA).
Cyprus signed the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures (MLI) to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) on 7 June 2017. Subsequently, Cyprus ratified the MLI on 23 January 2020. The date of 'entry into effect' as regards Cyprus’ application of the MLI for any particular bilateral DTT covered by the MLI depends upon various possible legal processes/options by the other contracting party jurisdiction.
Over the last four years Cyprus has also successfully transposed into its legal and tax framework all European Union (EU) Directives on Administrative Co-operation and Mutual Assistance (i.e. DACs 1-5). Furthermore, on 30 March 2021, the law transposing the DAC6 Directive entered into force with retroactive effect covering transactions from 25 June 2018 and onwards.
As of 1 January 2022, new personal income tax (PIT) exemptions have been introduced for first employments exercised in Cyprus, and on 30 June 2023 further amendments were implemented. More specifically, a new 50% exemption applies as of 1 January 2022 for remuneration of 'first employment' exercised in Cyprus commencing as of 1 January 2022 with remuneration exceeding 55,000 euros (EUR) _per annum_ , subject to certain conditions. Individuals whose employment commenced prior to 1 January 2022 may also be eligible to transition into the new 50% exemption. Additionally, a new 20% exemption applies as of 26 July 2022 for first employments exercised in Cyprus commencing as of that date, subject to certain conditions. _See Exempt income in the_ _section_ for more information.
Τhe tax incentives relating to investments in innovative small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have been extended to 31 December 2026.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
## Personal income tax (PIT)
Cyprus PIT is imposed on the worldwide income of individuals who are tax residents in Cyprus. Individuals who are not tax residents of Cyprus are taxed only on certain types of income accrued or derived from sources in Cyprus.
The following table lists the PIT rates and bands currently applicable to individuals:
Chargeable income for the tax year (EUR) | Tax rate (%) | Accumulated tax (EUR)  
---|---|---  
From | To  
0 | 19,500 | 0 | 0  
19,501 | 28,000 | 20 | 1,700  
28,001 | 36,300 | 25 | 3,775  
36,301 | 60,000 | 30 | 10,885  
60,001 | and above |  35  
## Special Defence Contribution (SDC)
SDC is imposed only on dividend, interest (most types), and rental income earned by individuals who are both Cyprus tax resident and Cyprus domiciled for the purposes of the SDC.
For dividend (SDC rate of 17%) and interest income (SDC rate of 17%, except for interest income earned from Cyprus government bonds, Cyprus and foreign corporate bonds listed on a recognised stock exchange, or bonds issued by Cyprus state organisations or Cyprus or foreign local authorities listed on a recognised stock exchange, where a rate of 3% applies), SDC applies instead of PIT. For rental income (SDC effective rate of 2.25%), SDC applies in addition to PIT. However, on 13 September 2023, the Cypress Tax Authority (CTA) issued a Circular pursuant of which rental income from self-catering accommodation that is rented out via online platforms will be treated, subject to certain conditions, as business income (therefore subject to PIT and exempt from SDC).
Non-tax residents are exempt from SDC for all their income, whether earned from Cyprus or foreign sources. This exemption also applies to individuals who are Cyprus tax resident but not Cyprus domiciled for the purposes of SDC. Anti-abuse provisions apply.
An individual who does not have a 'Domicile of Origin' in Cyprus (as defined in the Wills and Succession Law) is only considered to be domiciled in Cyprus for SDC purposes when the individual has been a tax resident of Cyprus for a period of at least 17 years out of the last 20 years prior to the tax year in question. 'Domicile of Origin' is acquired at birth and, as a rule, is the same as the domicile of the father at the time of birth, and in exceptional cases of the mother. For those individuals with 'Domicile of Origin' in Cyprus, detailed rules are used to determine the individuals’ domicile status for SDC purposes.

## Taxable period
In Cyprus, the tax year is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Separate returns must be filed by each individual on a calendar-year basis. Submission deadlines vary depending on the individual taxpayer’s profile.
### Electronic submissions
All individuals should be registered online and submit their income tax returns electronically. In this respect, the deadlines for the electronic submission of income tax returns are as follows:

  * For self-employed individuals whose annual turnover exceeds EUR 70,000: 1 March of the second year thereafter.


## Payment of taxes
There is an obligation for PIT withholding on salaries under the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system. If a taxpayer has other income not subject to withholding tax (WHT), payments of estimated tax must be generally paid in two equal instalments on 31 July and 31 December within the same tax year.
For (i) employees and pensioners whose incomes do not include income from a trade/business, rents, dividends, interest, royalties, nor income relating to trading goodwill, and (ii) individuals who have gross income that falls under Article 5 (includes dividends, interest, and profits from share dealings) and who are not required to prepare audited financial statements, a final balancing payment must be made by 31 July of the following year.

Any such expenditure of capital nature is tax amortised in a reasonable manner over its useful economic life (as per accepted accounting principles) with a maximum period of 20 years.
For any such expenditure incurred during the years 2022, 2023, and 2024, an additional allowance is granted equal to 20% of the expenditure incurred, which (i) cannot be claimed in parallel with the 80% allowance on net profit under the Cyprus nexus IP regime (i.e. cannot be claimed in parallel with New Cyprus IP Box) and (ii) a person may elect, for each tax year, to waive claiming (in whole or in part).

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
## Employment income
Employees are taxed on all remuneration, including bonuses and certain employment benefits in kind. A number of important exemptions are available (_see Exempt income below_).
Employees are not taxed on reimbursements for business travel and business entertainment expenses.
Pensions received from abroad for services rendered outside Cyprus are taxable at the flat rate of 5% on amounts in excess of EUR 3,420 (the first EUR 3,420 is exempt). The taxpayer can, however, on an annual basis, elect to be taxed at the normal tax rates and bands set out in _Personal income tax (PIT) in the_ _section._
## Self-employed income/Business income
Profit arising from self-employment is generally subject to normal PIT bands as set out in _Personal income tax_ _(PIT) in the section._
For PIT purposes, generally, expenditure wholly and exclusively incurred for the generation of taxable income is deductible against the individual’s income. Such expenditure should be supported by invoices and relevant receipts or other supporting documents.
Profits from a permanent establishment (PE) abroad are exempt from PIT, subject to anti-avoidance rules set out below.
The foreign PE exemption is applicable, unless the below anti-avoidance rule applies:
  * more than 50% of the foreign PE’s activities directly or indirectly result in investment income, and
  * the foreign tax on the income of the foreign PE is significantly lower than the tax burden in Cyprus (i.e. an effective tax rate of less than 6.25%).


Losses from an ‘exempt foreign PE’ are eligible to be offset with other income subject to PIT. In such a case, future profits of an ‘exempt foreign PE’ become taxable in Cyprus up to the amount of losses previously allowed.
With effect from 1 July 2016, taxpayers may irrevocably elect to be subject to PIT on foreign PE profits. In such a case, credit in Cyprus will be available for foreign taxes paid on the foreign PE profits. Transitional rules may be applicable to such a credit where a foreign PE was previously exempt from taxation in Cyprus and subsequently a taxpayer elects to be subject to PIT on foreign PE profits.
## Carried interest / Performance fee for Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) and Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) fund managers
Certain employees and executives of investment fund management companies or internally managed investment funds may opt for a different mode of personal taxation:
  * AIF Managers authorised under the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Law 56(I)/2013, as amended (hereinafter, the ‘AIFM Law’).
  * Internally managed AIFs authorised under the AIFM Law.
  * UCITS Management Companies authorised under the UCI Law.
  * Internally managed UCITS authorised under the UCI Law.
  * A company to which the AIFM / UCITS Management Company has delegated the portfolio management or risk management activities of the AIF/ UCITS that it manages.


Subject to conditions, their variable employment remuneration, which is effectively connected to the carried interest of the fund managing entity, may be subject to Cyprus tax at the flat rate of 8%, with a minimum tax liability of EUR 10,000 _per annum_. This special mode of taxation is available for a period of ten years in total, subject to the annual election of the individual, and is not added to any other income.
_See the section in the Corporate tax summary for more information._
## Capital gains
Capital gains, other than those relating to Cyprus-located immovable property, are generally not taxed in Cyprus. _See Capital gains tax in the section for more information._
## Dividend and interest income
Dividend and (most types of) interest income received by individuals are exempt from PIT but are subject to SDC, which is imposed at flat rates of 17% on dividend income and 17% on interest income (except for corporate and Cyprus government bonds where 3% rate applies).
We note that, as of 16 July 2015, individuals are subject to SDC only in those cases where they are both Cyprus tax resident and Cyprus domiciled for SDC purposes.
_See the_ _section for more information._
## Rental income
Gross rental income, less a deemed deduction of 20% for buildings (in lieu of actual building repairs and related maintenance expenses), a deduction for capital allowances for buildings, and interest expense for the acquisition of the building/land, is subject to PIT under the normal PIT bands (_see the_ _section)._
Gross rental income (without deductions) is also subject to SDC at an effective rate of 2.25%. However, on 13 September 2023, the CTA issued a Circular pursuant of which rental income from self-catering accommodation that is rented out via online platforms will be treated, subject to certain conditions, as business income (therefore, subject to PIT and exempt from SDC).
We note that, as of 16 July 2015, individuals are subject to SDC only in those cases where they are both Cyprus tax resident and Cyprus domiciled for SDC purposes.
_See the_ _section for more information._
## Exempt income
The following types of personal income are exempt from tax in Cyprus:
  * As of 16 July 2015, individuals who are not domiciled in Cyprus for SDC purposes are exempt from SDC. Thus, dividend and (most types of) interest income for such individuals are exempt from all taxes in Cyprus. _See the_ _section for more information_.
  * As of 1 January 2022, a new 50% exemption on remuneration applies for 'first employment' exercised in Cyprus by individuals who were not resident in Cyprus for a period of at least 15 consecutive tax years immediately prior to the commencement of their employment in Cyprus. The employment should commence after 1 January 2022, and the remuneration should exceed EUR 55,000 _per annum_. An employee is considered as exercising 'first employment' in Cyprus if they did not exercise any salaried services (including occasional employment) in Cyprus, either for a local or a foreign employer, for a 15-year consecutive period immediately prior to the aforesaid employee taking up employment in Cyprus. For each individual, the exemption will apply once in their lifetime for a period of 17 years. Subject to certain conditions, individuals whose employment commenced prior to 1 January 2022 may also be eligible to transition into the new 50% exemption.
  * Also note, for employments commencing between 1 January 2022 and 29 June 2023, the employee may be eligible to claim 50% exemption subject to similar but not identical conditions. More specifically, employees may be eligible to claim 50% exemption if they were not tax resident in Cyprus immediately prior to the commencement of first employment for a period of ten years, rather than 15 years. Furthermore, 'first employment' refers to employment exercised by the employee in Cyprus at any point in time, rather than the 15-year period immediately preceding the start of employment. Some additional differences apply as well. Subject to certain conditions, individuals whose employment commenced prior to 1 January 2022 may also be eligible to transition into the 50% exemption.
  * As of 26 July 2022, a new 20% exemption on remuneration (up to a maximum amount of exemption of EUR 8,550 _per annum_) applies for first employments commencing after the 26 July 2022 exercised in Cyprus by individuals who immediately prior to the commencement of their employment in Cyprus were not a resident of Cyprus for a period of at least three consecutive tax years and were employed outside of Cyprus by a non-resident employer. For each individual, the exemption will apply for a period of seven years, starting from the tax year following the tax year of commencement of employment. In order to prevent duplication of these new exemptions, individuals granted the above-mentioned 50% exemption will not be eligible for this exemption.
  * Previously, for employments commencing until 26 July 2022, 50% and 20% exemptions were available subject to different conditions than the conditions that apply currently. These exemptions were available for a period of ten or five years, respectively. Eligible individuals may continue to claim the exemption even after 26 July 2022 for any remaining period. 
  * A 100% exemption from PIT for remuneration earned from an employment exercised outside Cyprus for a period of more than 90 days (in aggregate) in a tax year for a non-Cyprus tax resident employer/foreign PE of a Cyprus tax resident employer.
  * Profits of a foreign PE are fully exempt from PIT under certain conditions. _See the section for more information_.
  * Profits from disposals of corporate 'titles' are unconditionally exempt from PIT. 'Titles' is defined as shares, bonds, debentures, founders’ shares, and other titles of companies or other legal persons incorporated in Cyprus or abroad and options thereon. According to a circular issued by the Cyprus Tax Authority (CTA), the term includes, _inter alia_ , futures/forwards on titles, short positions on titles, swaps on titles, depositary receipts on titles, repos on titles, units in open or close collective investment schemes (CISs), international collective investment schemes (ICISs), UCITS, investment trusts and funds, mutual funds, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and units in stock exchange indices on titles.
  * Social grants. The following three categories of grants are exempt from PIT:


  *     * A grant is provided to families for every child receiving full-time higher education in Cyprus or abroad (subject to family income criteria and certain restrictions).
    * An annual grant for each dependent child of a family resident in Cyprus (subject to family income criteria and certain restrictions).
    * An annual grant for blind persons.


  * A 20% exemption from PIT of the gross rental income for rental of buildings (i.e. not for land) in lieu of actual expenses for repairs and maintenance etc.
  * Lump sum received by way of retiring gratuity, commutation of pension, or compensation for death or injuries is fully exempt from PIT.
  * Capital sums accruing to individuals from any payment to approved funds (e.g. provident funds) are fully exempt from PIT.
  * The lower of 35% of the eligible expenditure and 50% of the taxable income exemption from PIT is provided for profits from the production of films, series, and other related audiovisual programs. Any restriction may be carried forward for five years _(see the_ _section in the Corporate tax summary for more information_).

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
As of 2017, an individual is a tax resident of Cyprus if one satisfies either the '183-day rule' or the '60-day rule' for the tax year. For earlier tax years only, the '183-day rule' is relevant for determining Cyprus tax residency.
The '183-day rule' for Cyprus tax residency is satisfied for individuals who spend more than 183 days in any one calendar year in Cyprus, without any further additional conditions/criteria being relevant.
The '60-day rule' for Cyprus tax residency is satisfied for individuals who, cumulatively, in the relevant tax year:
  * do not reside in any other single state for a period exceeding 183 days in aggregate
  * are not considered tax resident by any other state
  * reside in Cyprus for at least 60 days, and
  * have other defined Cyprus ties.


To satisfy the fourth criteria, the individual must carry out any business in Cyprus and/or be employed in Cyprus and/or hold an office (director) of a company tax resident in Cyprus at any time in the tax year, provided that such is not terminated during the tax year. Further, the individual must maintain in the tax year a permanent residential property in Cyprus that is either owned or rented by the individual.
For the purposes of both the '183-day rule' and the '60-day rule', days in and out of Cyprus are calculated as follows:
  * the day of departure from Cyprus counts as a day of residence outside Cyprus
  * the day of arrival in Cyprus counts as a day of residence in Cyprus
  * arrival and departure from Cyprus in the same day counts as one day of residence in Cyprus, and
  * departure and arrival in Cyprus in the same day counts as one day of residence outside Cyprus.

## Social security contributions
As of 1 January 2024, the employees' own contribution to the state-administered social insurance fund is 8.8% of their gross remuneration, with a maximum annual cap on insurable emoluments as of 1 January 2025 of EUR 66,612. The rate of 8.8% applies for both employee and the employer as of 1 January 2024 and for the next five years. Thereafter, the rate will increase every five years until it reaches 10.3% to 10.7% (depending on the results of the actuarial studies to be performed) as of 1 January 2039.
As of 1 January 2024, the contributions of self-employed persons are 16.6% of their income (15.6% for 2019 through 2023). Thereafter, the rate will increase every five years until it reaches 19.6% to 20.4% (depending on the results of the actuarial studies to be performed) as of 1 January 2039. The amount of the contributions is subject to a lower and a maximum limit, depending on the profession or trade of the self-employed person. These limits are set on an annual basis.
## General Health System (GHS)
As per General Health System Law of 2001 (89(I)/2001) as amended 2017, a GHS is introduced in Cyprus aimed to provide to the population equal access to a holistic health care system. Patients will have the option to select a health care provider from the private as well as the public health care sector.
Contributions relating to the implementation of the GHS commenced on 1 March 2019 at reduced rates. As of 1 March 2020, the full rates apply as per the table below:
Ref | Category | Applied on | Rate (%)  
---|---|---|---  
(i) | Employees | Own emoluments | 2.65  
(ii) | Employers | Employees’ emoluments | 2.90  
(iii) | Self-employed | Own income | 4.00  
(iv) | Pensioners | Pension | 2.65  
(v) | Persons holding office* | Officers’ remuneration | 2.65  
(vi) | Republic of Cyprus or natural/ legal person responsible for the remuneration of persons holding an office | Officers’ remuneration | 2.90  
(vii) | Persons earning rental, interest, dividend, and other income | Rental, interest, dividend income, etc. | 2.65

* Relates to holders of public or local authority office or other office, the income out of which does not come within the scope of (i) or (iii) or (iv) or (vii).
GHS contributions are capped at EUR 180,000 annual income.
## Capital gains tax (CGT)
CGT applies only to gains relating to Cyprus-situated immovable property when the disposal is not subject to income tax.
Disposal for the purposes of CGT specifically includes sale, exchange, lease, gifting, abandoning use of right, granting of right to purchase, and any sums received upon cancellation of disposals.
CGT at the rate of 20% is imposed on gains arising from the disposal of immovable property situated in Cyprus or the disposal of shares in companies that directly own Cyprus-situated immovable property. CGT is also imposed on disposals of shares in companies that indirectly own immovable property situated in Cyprus where at least 50% of the market value of the said shares derives from Cyprus-situated immovable property. Shares listed on any recognised stock exchange are excluded from CGT.
In the case of disposal of company shares, the gain is calculated exclusively on the basis of the gain relating to Cyprus-situated immovable property. The value of the immovable property will be its market value at the time the shares were disposed of.
The taxable gain is generally calculated as the difference between the disposal proceeds and the original cost of the property plus any improvements as adjusted for inflation up to the date of disposal on the basis of the consumer price index in Cyprus. In the case of property acquired before 1 January 1980, the original cost is deemed to be the value of the property as of 1 January 1980 on the basis of the general valuation conducted by the Land Registry Office under the Immovable Property Law.
Other expenses that relate to the acquisition and disposal of immovable property are also deducted from the gain, subject to certain conditions (e.g. interest costs on related loans, transfer fees, legal expenses).
It is important to note that, subject to conditions, land, as well as land with buildings, acquired at market value (excluding exchanges, donations, and foreclosures) from unrelated parties in the period 16 July 2015 to 31 December 2016 will be exempt from CGT upon their future disposal.
### Lifetime exemptions
Individuals can deduct the following from the amount of the taxable capital gain:
Capital gain arising from: | Deduction (EUR)  
---|---  
Disposal of private principal residence (subject to certain conditions) | 85,430  
Disposal of agricultural land by a farmer | 25,629  
Any other disposal | 17,086  
The above exemptions are lifetime exemptions subject to an overall lifetime maximum of EUR 85,430.
Other exemptions are also available, under relevant conditions, including gifts between spouses, children (including foster children), and third degree relatives, gifts to family companies, gifts to charities, exchange of properties, donations to a political party, etc.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is imposed on the provision of goods and services in Cyprus as well as on the acquisition of goods from the European Union and the importation of goods into Cyprus. Taxable persons charge VAT on their taxable supplies (output tax) and are charged with VAT on goods or services that they received (input tax).
The standard VAT rate in Cyprus is 19%. Three reduced VAT rates, a 9% rate, a 5% rate, and a 3% rate, as well as a zero rate VAT, apply in Cyprus.
_See the_ _section in the Corporate tax summary for more information._
## Immovable property transfer fees
The fees charged by the Department of Land and Surveys to the acquirer for transfers of Cyprus-situated immovable property are as follows:
Market value (EUR) | Rate (%) | Fee (EUR) | Accumulated fee (EUR)  
---|---|---|---  
First 85,000 | 3 | 2,550 | 2,550  
From 85,001 to 170,000 | 5 | 4,250 | 6,800  
Over 170,000 | 8  
It is important to note that:
  * No transfer fees are payable if VAT is applicable upon purchasing the immovable property.
  * The above transfer fees are reduced by 50% in case the purchase of immovable property is not subject to VAT.


Certain debt-for-asset swap arrangements may, under certain conditions, be exempted from transfer fees.
In the case of free transfers of property, the transfer fees are calculated on the value of the property as follows (‘value’ in these cases refers to values as of 1 January 2013):
  * From parents to children: Nil.
  * Between spouses: 0.1%.

In cases involving a direct disposal of immovable property, the levy is imposed on the disposal consideration, whereas in cases involving a disposal of shares of a company, the levy is imposed on the latest general valuation undertaken by the Department of Land and Surveys.
The obligation for payment of the levy lies with the seller.

  * Debt for asset swaps.
  * Qualifying reorganisations.


  * Shares listed on a recognised stock exchange.


During the period 22 February 2021 to 17 November 2022, different provisions applied with respect to certain aspects of the levy. For example, during this period the levy is applied only on disposals of immovable property itself and disposals of shares of a company that directly held immovable property to the extent that the buyer of the shares assumes control of such company.
