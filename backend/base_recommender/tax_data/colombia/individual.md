## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
In December 2022, Law 2277 was approved, introducing the following significant changes to individuals' income taxation:
  * Two tax systems have been maintained for residents, ordinary and presumptive.


  * The presumptive income system remains at 0% since 2021.


  * The ordinary system is made up of three baskets of income. Nevertheless, the sum of all three baskets (dividends included) will determine the applicable tax rate for tax residents.


  * New tax reliefs have been introduced for individuals, such as 1% of purchases, up to 240 tax units (TU), made through the year, regardless of its connection with the individual’s activity.


  * Exempt income and deductions combined maintain a threshold of 40% of the net income. Nevertheless, said threshold cannot exceed TU 1,340 annually (the prior cap was TU 5,040 annually).
  * 35% remains as the tax rate for individuals qualified as non-tax residents.
  * Independent workers can choose to be treated as employees for income tax withholding proposes (procedure and tax reliefs).
  * Cost and deductions applicable for independent workers shall be deemed 60% of their gross income.
  * Foreign pension income is exempt from taxation up to TU 1,000.
  * Occasional/capital gain tax rate was increased to 15% (previously 10%).
  * Equity/wealth tax was introduced as a permanent tax for those equities exceeding TU 72,000. Said taxable base must consider the result of subtracting all debts from the individual's gross equity as of 1 January of each year.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
The concept of fiscal residency defines the nature of the source that the individual has to declare as follows:
  * Fiscal residents (nationals or foreign) are taxed on worldwide income and should report equity owned in Colombia and abroad.
  * Non-residents (nationals or foreign) are taxed only on Colombian-sourced income and should report only the equity owned in Colombia.


## Personal income tax rates
### General income basket
The following are the types of income included in the general income basket:
  * Employment income: Income received for services performed in Colombia, no matter where the payment was received, salaries, wages, fringe benefits, commissions, and all income arising from the labour relationship.
  * Capital income: Includes interest, financial income, royalties, rentals, and intellectual property (IP) income.
  * Non-employment income: All type of income that cannot be classified in other baskets.


The rates for fiscal residents (nationals or foreign) applicable to the general income basket, pension income basket, and dividend income basket (_see below_) are:
Taxable income (TU *) | Marginal rate (%) | Tax liability  
---|---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 1,090 | 0 | 0  
1,090 | 1,700 | 19 | (Taxable income translated into TU less TU 1,090) x 19%  
1,700 | 4,100 | 28 | (Taxable income translated into TU less TU 1,700) x 28% + TU 116  
4,100 | 8,670 | 33 | (Taxable income translated into TU less TU 4,100) x 33% + TU 788  
8,670 | 18,970 | 35 | (Taxable income translated into TU less TU 8,670) x 35% + TU 2,296  
18,970 | 31,000 | 37 | (Taxable income translated into TU less TU 18,970) x 37% + TU 5,901  
31,000 | And up | 39 | (Taxable income translated into TU less TU 31,000) x 39% + TU 10,352  
* In December 2006, the Colombian government approved a reform of the Colombian tax system. Such reform incorporated the TU to measure the different limits and thresholds originally set in absolute numbers, adjusted every year by decree. The value of each TU is equivalent to COP 49.799 for fiscal year (FY) 2025.
### Pension income basket 
Includes retirement and disabilities pensions or income received from labour risks, compensations that substitute pensions or refunds (_for rates, see table in General income basket above_). 
The recent tax reform considers foreign pension income as exempt of taxation up to TU 1,000.
### Dividend income basket
Dividends subject to tax at the corporate level and paid to fiscal residents will be subject to the progressive marginal rates previously mentioned applicable for the general and pension income basket (0% to 39%).
Nevertheless, residents subject to this tax on their dividend income will be able to claim a tax credit determined as follows:
Taxable income (TU) | Marginal tax credit (%) | Tax credit  
---|---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 1,090 | 0 | 0  
1,090 | And up | 19 | (Taxable income translated into TU less TU 1,090) x 19%  
On the other hand, dividends that were not subject to tax at the corporate level will be taxed at a 35% flat rate, and the net income resulting from subtracting such tax from the gross income will be subject to the individual tax (0% to 39%) previously addressed.
As for non-residents, the applicable tax rate for dividend income was increased to 20% (previously 10%).
## Local income taxes
There are no local taxes on individual income in Colombia.

## Tax returns
If one of the following requirements is met, then salaried taxpayers will be compelled to file an income tax return in Colombia:

Joint returns are not permitted. Income splitting is not allowed.
## Payment of tax
There is income tax withholding on employment income. If a balance is due according to the tax return, it must be paid on the due date for filing the return at any bank within the country.


# Colombia
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Employment expenses
Employees are not entitled to deduct business-related expenses from their employment income.
However, independent workers are able to. Independent workers can choose to be treated as employees for income tax purposes (procedure and tax reliefs). If they choose to be treated as independent (rather than employees), they are able to claim costs and deductions deemed as 60% of their gross income.
## Personal deductions
### Charitable contributions
Some donations are allowed as discounts, provided they are made to certain institutions dedicated to development of health, education, culture, religion, sports, scientific and technological research, ecology and the protection of the environment, or to social development programs of general interest. Most of these donations are limited with respect to their deduction.
### Mortgage interest deduction
For mortgage interest paid in Colombia, up to a maximum of COP 59.758.800 for FY 2025 (TU 1,200) is deductible annually.
### Healthcare expenses
Healthcare payments (i.e. payments to companies who offer prepaid health and are monitored by the national health superintendent, payments for health insurance to insurance companies that are monitored by the financial superintendent) for the taxpayer, spouse, and children are deductible up to a maximum of TU 16 monthly, an equivalent of COP 9.561.408 annually.
Note that the amount paid by the employee to the mandatory health system (_described in the_ _section_) is deemed as non-taxable income (different from deductions).
### Dependant deduction
For dependant deduction, the deductible limit is 10% of gross labour income until a maximum of TU 32 monthly, an equivalent of COP 19.122.816 annually.
Dependants are defined as:
  * Children of the taxpayer until 18 years old.
  * Children of the taxpayer between 18 and 25 years old who are studying in education institutions.
  * Children of the taxpayer older than 18 years who have psychological and physical dependence.
  * Spouse or living partner who has a psychological, physical, or economic dependence.
  * Parents or siblings of the taxpayer who have a psychological, physical, or economic dependence.


Additionally, employees are able to deduct TU 72 for each additional dependant, up to four dependants.
## Interests paid on educational loans
Law 2010 of 2019 introduced a deduction for interests paid on educational loans granted by the Government Education Entity ICETEX. This deduction applies while the education loan is for the taxpayer’s higher education and it is capped to TU 100 annually.
## Personal allowances
There are no personal allowances in Colombia.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Employment income
A foreign resident is taxed on employment income earned for services performed in Colombia no matter where payment is made. Employment income includes salary and non-salary items, such as bonuses, living allowances, housing allowances, tax reimbursements, benefits in kind, and certain payments that must be made under Colombian labour law. All employees, including those who have agreed to receive an integral salary (i.e. without social benefits of the legal bonus and severance compensations), can treat up to 25% of the total annual employment income as exempt income. This 25% is limited to a maximum cap of TU 790 per year (COP 39.341.210 for FY 2025). Although some payments derived from a labour relationship may be agreed as not being salary, they are deemed to be income and subject to income tax.
### Special savings account deposits
Deposits made to special savings accounts to support the purchase of housing (AFC) are considered exempt income, provided these amounts, added to the mandatory and voluntary contributions to the pension system, do not exceed 30% of the employee's labour income for the year or TU 3,800 and that the employee does not withdraw them before ten years from the date of deposit. However, even if the deposit is withdrawn within ten years, it would continue to be treated as exempt income if it is used to pay for a housing acquisition.
### Contributions to pension system
Mandatory contributions made to the Colombian pension system funds by an employee are not deemed to constitute income or capital gains for the employee and are not part of the withholding tax (WHT) basis. Additionally, along with mandatory contributions to the health system, these mandatory pension contributions are considered non-taxable income.
Voluntary contributions made by the employee or the employer to mandatory pension funds are considered non-taxable income for the employee and are not part of the WHT basis, provided that these amounts do not exceed 25% of the employee’s employment or taxable annual income nor TU 2,500 (COP 124.497.500 for FY 2025).
Notwithstanding the above, contributions to the voluntary pension fund or AFC accounts will be taxed if they are withdrawn from the fund by the employee within ten years of having been deposited into the fund. Also in this case, even if the deposit is withdrawn within ten years, it would continue to be treated as exempt income if it is used to pay for a housing acquisition.
Contributions made to foreign pension systems are deemed to be taxable for the expatriate or employee and are part of the WHT basis.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are subject to capital gains tax (_see the_ _section_).
## Dividend income
Domestic shareholders and individual foreign shareholders resident in Colombia are subject to income tax on dividends received from Colombian companies when these are paid out of profits taxed at the distributing entity level at the applicable rate from 0% to 39% (_see the section_). If received dividends were not subject to tax at the distributing entity level, such dividends will be taxed at a 35% flat rate, and the net income resulting from subtracting such tax from the gross dividend income will be subject to an additional tax from 0% to 39%.
## Interest income
‘Monetary correction’ on savings accounts (an adjustment that savings and loan institutions credit to clients placed in certain types of savings or term-deposit accounts in order to compensate for inflation) is free of tax. The correction must be certified by the financial institution. Any additional gain recognised as interest is, however, taxable.
The inflation component of interest received by individuals (not required to carry accounting books) on certain bonds is not subject to income tax.

There are no other significant tax credits or incentives for individuals in Colombia.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
A person is considered fiscally resident in Colombia if one remains in the country (continuously or not) for an aggregate period of time of 183 days within a period of 365 consecutive days. If one finishes in the second year, the individual is considered resident in the second year.
Also, if the person is a Colombian national, one will be fiscally resident if one falls within any of the following scenarios:
  * The spouse or dependants remain in the country for 183 days (continuously or not) within a period of 365 consecutive days.
  * 50% or more of one's income is sourced directly or indirectly in Colombia.
  * 50% or more of one's property/assets are managed in Colombia.
  * 50% or more of one's assets are 'physically' located in Colombia.
  * The tax authority (DIAN) requests proof of fiscal residency in another country and said proof is not provided to the DIAN.
  * The person has a fiscal residence in a place considered a tax haven by the Colombian government.


For the above scenarios, the period actually spent by the Colombian individual in Colombia is irrelevant.
However, an individual will not be a Colombian resident for any of the scenarios above if 50% or more of one's yearly income has been sourced where one is domiciled or 50% or more of one's assets are located where one is domiciled.

## Social security contributions
Every employee whose work contract is governed by Colombian labour regulations (with the exception of some foreign employees who may become voluntarily affiliated to the pensions system) must be affiliated to the integral social security system, which includes the:
  * general pensions system
  * health social security system, and
  * general system of professional risks.


The basis for contributions is determined by the monthly salary (excluding non-salary items) earned by the employee, which may not be, for ordinary salaried employees, less than the minimum legal monthly salary (COP 1.423.500 in 2025) and may not exceed 25 minimum legal monthly salaries (COP 35.587.500 million in 2025).
For employees who earn an integral salary, the basis for pension contributions will be the lower of 25 minimum legal monthly salaries or 70% of such integral salary.
### Contribution amounts
In the two regimes (public and private), the contribution amounts are currently 28.5% of the monthly salary.
Out of this percentage, 75% (approximately 20.5% of the monthly salary) must be borne by the employer and 25% (approximately 8% of the monthly salary) must be borne by the employee.
As such, for the mandatory health system, the employee should contribute 4% and the employer 8.5%. Note that starting from 2014, for employees with salaries below ten minimum monthly wages , the mandatory contribution to the health system on behalf of the employer does not apply. As such, the 8.5% contribution applies only to salaries above ten minimum monthly wages.
In regards to the mandatory contribution to the pension system, the employer should contribute 12% over the basis and the employee 4%.
Note that employees who earn more than 4 minimum legal monthly salaries (COP 5.694.000) must contribute an additional 1%, which will be destined to the pension solidarity fund, created by law to cover the risks of workers with scarce resources. Also, employees who earn more than 16 minimum monthly salaries (COP 22.776.000) must contribute an additional percentage (between 0.2% and 1%), depending on the amount of salary received.
For professional risks (_Aportes de Riesgos Profesionales_), the employer must pay a contribution ranging from 0.522% to 6.96% of the monthly salary, which is an insurance that covers risks of labour-related illnesses or accidents, permanent disability, death, and incapacity also derived from the employee's activity.
In addition, for employees with salaries higher than ten minimum monthly wages, employers must pay a 9% payroll tax on salary items only, the basis of which is 100% for ordinary salaried employees and 70% for integral salaried employees.
## Capital gains taxes
Capital gains are considered extraordinary income received by an individual from the occurrence of an exceptional economic act. The different kinds of capital gains in Colombian tax law are:
  * Gains derived from the sale of assets (shares, bonds, etc.) held for at least two years.
  * Gains derived from the liquidation of a company that has been in existence for at least two years.
  * Gains derived from inheritances, legacies, or donations (such as the portion of the estate received by the spouse or the heir).
  * Gains derived from lotteries or gaming.


The general tax rate for capital gains in Colombia is 15%.
In the case of gains derived from lotteries, gaming, or similar activities, the tax rate is 20% (of the gain).
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The general VAT rates are 19% and 5%.  _See the_ _section in the Corporate tax summary for more information_.
## Equity tax
  * Equity tax is applicable for individuals that meet the threshold as of 1 January of each year.
  * Triggering event is the holding of net wealth for tax purposes (assets less allowable liabilities) as of 1 January in excess of TU 72,000 (COP 3.585.528.000 for 2025).


  * The tax rates are marginal and progressive as follows:  Taxable base (TU) | Marginal tax rate (%) | Equity tax  
---|---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 72,000 | 0 | 0  
72,000 | 122,000 | 0.5 | (Taxable base in TU less TU 72,000) x 0.5%  
122,000 | 239,000 | 1.0 | (Taxable base in TU less TU 122,000) x 1.0% + TU 250  
239,000 | And on | 1.5 | (Taxable base in TU less TU 239,000) x 1.5% + TU 1,420  
  * 1.5% tax rate will apply only for 2023, 2024, 2025, and 2026.


## Inheritance tax
There is no inheritance or gift-specific tax, as such, in Colombia. However, for tax purposes, inheritance and gifts are considered extraordinary income, and, as such, the heir/beneficiary will be liable to capital gains tax.
## Property taxes
Property tax is a municipal tax and is imposed depending upon the nature and usage of the property, and generally the rates range between 0.4% and 1.2%. _See the section_ _in the Corporate tax summary for more information._
## Financial transactions tax
The financial transactions tax is a permanent tax on financial transactions, the collection of which is the responsibility of regulated financial institutions and the Central Bank (_Banco de la República_).
The tax rate is 0.4%, and the taxable event is the carrying out of financial transactions that involve the disposal of resources deposited in checking or savings accounts, as well as in deposit accounts with  _Banco de la República_ and the issuance of cashier’s checks.
50% of the total tax paid is deductible for corporate income tax (CIT) purposes, regardless of whether or not the transactions have a causal nexus with the income-producing activity of the taxpayer.
The law establishes a series of operations and transactions that are exempted from this tax.
