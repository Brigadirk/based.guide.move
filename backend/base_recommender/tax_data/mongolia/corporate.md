## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
There have been multiple additions and amendments to the tax legislation promulgated by Mongolian Parliament as follows:
## Corporate income tax (CIT)
To stimulate economic activity, a series of tax incentives were introduced in 2023 and 2024. These incentives were specifically designed to encourage businesses to:
  * Relocate operations beyond city boundaries.
  * Enhance employment opportunities.
  * Advocate for the use of public transportation.
  * Strengthen the financial market.
  * Invest in projects related to heating and electric power production.
  * Support start-up companies specialising in innovative products, works, and services
  * Foster investment in software development.


Commencing on 1 July 2024, a series of modifications were enacted for the securities issued by the government, provinces, capital city, and resident taxpayers that are traded on the primary and secondary domestic stock markets. These changes include the following:
  * The taxable income earned by non-resident taxpayers from the sale of these securities will be computed on a net basis, marking a departure from the previous practice where the tax base was the gross amount.
  * Obligations of the tax withholder are assigned to the entities responsible for the central depository and custodian activities of these securities, marking a departure from the previous practice of the self-assessment basis.
  * A significant tax credit is provided for the capital gain taxes on these securities. Specifically, a tax credit of 90% is applied for the years 2024-2026, and a 50% tax credit will be applied for the years 2027-2029.


In alignment with corporate social responsibility objectives, investments in fixed assets and financial support or donations provided to unrelated parties for the following activities, which are not directly related to the taxpayer's income-generated operations, are eligible for the CIT credit from September 2024 to 1 January 2035:
  * Protection, enhancement, sustainable use, and restoration of natural resources, such as forest, wildlife, and water; reduction of air, water, and soil pollution; and mitigation of desertification.
  * Provision of care services for the elderly, persons with disabilities, and children; protection of their rights; creation of accessible environments for persons with disabilities; and construction and operation of playgrounds, camps, and parks for children.
  * Protection and restoration of cultural heritage; operation of museums and libraries; creation, performance, and dissemination of music, films, crafts, and stage arts; construction and operation, protection, and maintenance of public roads, squares, and parks; and support for public transaction development.
  * Compensation for damages caused by _force majeure_ and other similar disasters.
  * Construction and operation of sports facilities; organisation of Olympic-type competitions; and financial support provided to Olympic-type sports associations registered with the Mongolian National Olympic Committee, including teams, professional athletes, and coaches.
  * Scholarships provided to students studying at foreign universities in priority areas announced by the government, as well as to students at accredited domestic universities and vocational and technical education institutions.
  * Scholarships provided for research purposes to universities and the Academy of Sciences.
  * Operation of state and local government-owned educational and health care institutions.
  * Operational of special government funds.
  * Other restoration expenses.


The amount of the CIT credit shall not exceed 1% of the taxable income for the relevant tax year. It is expected that requirements and standards for the development projects, activities, and operations eligible for the CIT credit will be approved and monitored by the responsible ministries.
In connection with the previously mentioned CIT credit introduction, the following expenses shall not be deductible from taxable income:
  * Financial support provided to vocational education and training institutions for the purpose of training specialists on order.
  * Donations up to 10 million Mongolian tugrik (MNT) provided to non-governmental organisations established by persons with disabilities in Mongolia.
  * Donations up to MNT 100 million provided to support the activities of sports associations and clubs, organise Olympic and continental competitions, and construct and operate sports facilities in compliance with international sports association standards.
  * Donations and investments provided to the fund supporting vocational education and training.
  * Donations provided to reduce air pollution.
  * Donations provided to support cultural creative industries and protect cultural heritage, not exceeding 5% of taxable income.
  * Operational expenses for social welfare and care services performed under agreements with social welfare organisations.


_See the section for details_.
## Customs tariffs, customs duties, and value-added tax (VAT)
From June 2024, the government is entitled to extend the payment period of customs duties and VAT for up to four years, or to allow partial payments over a four-year period, for imported building materials and equipment used in the following major projects:
  * Major projects and initiatives that are consistent with the regional development policy and supported by a technical and economic feasibility study.
  * Construction project included in the general and partial master plans for the development of New Zuunmod City, backed by a technical and economic feasibility study.
  * Projects for sports facilities that meet the requirements for hosting Olympic and continental competitions.


## Real estate income tax
  * The immovable property tax (IPT) rate has been increased from 0.6% through 1.0% to 0.6% through 2.0%.
  * Amendments and additions to tax exemptions have been introduced.


_See the section for details_.
## Revision of the Asset Valuation Act
The revision of the Law on Asset Valuation was approved by the Parliament on 17 June 2022, and it is effective from 1 January 2023. This revised legislation incorporates the principle of asset valuation for taxation purposes. In alignment with this objective, the Ministry of Finance is assigned to promulgate the procedural guidelines and standard methodology for the valuation of assets for tax considerations. However, the guidelines have not been issued yet.
## Law on Minerals
On 19 April 2024, a new law pertaining to the National Treasury Fund was introduced. This law brought about amendments to several existing laws, including the Law on Minerals and the CIT Law.
The recent amendments to the Law on Minerals now prohibit any entity, whether acting independently or in conjunction with affiliated parties, from owning more than 34% of the total issued shares in a legal entity that holds a licence for a strategically important deposit. The only exceptions to this rule are legal entities that have signed an Investment Agreement with the Government of Mongolia or state-owned entities.
Furthermore, the amendments to the CIT Law impose a tax rate of 30% if the beneficial owner of a mining licence for a strategically important mineral deposit transfers, either fully or partially, the right to own and use land, as well as exploration and exploitation licences for minerals, radioactive minerals, and oil. Such transfers may occur through the gifting or bequeathing of shares, participation, or voting rights in a legal entity.


# Mongolia
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Companies must submit a quarterly or semi-annual return by the 20th day of the month following the end of each respective period and an annual return by 10 February after the end of the tax year.
A withholder must prepare and submit a WHT return on a quarterly basis by the 20th day of the first month of the following respective period and an annual return by 10 February after the end of the tax year.
## Payment of tax
A taxpayer shall pay the taxes due in advance by the 25th day of each month in accordance with the payment schedule based on the previous year. However, the tax authorities practically do not use their right to establish the payment schedule, and the tax payment deadline is the same as the tax reporting deadline. Year-end settlement is made by 10 February of the following year (along with the annual tax statement).
In practice, the Mongolian tax authorities allow concessions as follows:
In instances where the total tax remitted exceeds the tax obligation, the surplus amount may be applied as a credit toward settling other outstanding taxes or future tax liabilities. Additionally, there is a potential for the overpaid amount to be refunded.
An economic entity or organisation that has withheld tax from a payment of dividends, royalties, sale of rights, or a payment of income to a taxpayer should transfer the WHT to the tax authorities within ten working days. Tax withheld relating to the sale of immovable property should be transferred to the tax authorities within ten working days.
## Tax audit process
The tax audit process is based on a risk-based system. Hence, there is no pre-defined cycle. However, the regular cycle in Mongolia is up to four years in practice due the statute of limitation period of four years. The tax audit is also conducted if the company requests a tax refund from tax authorities or liquidates its company. Moreover, a tax audit can be conducted anytime if the tax authorities suspect some risk or misuse of the legislation or receive information from a trustworthy source about tax evasion.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations in Mongolia is four years for tax arrears, fines, and penalties. However, the dispute settlement timeframe shall not pertain to payment of tax, fine, and penalty debts.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The tax authorities typically concentrate on issues such as the understatement of income, overstatement of expenses, and the withholding obligations of taxpayers. In this context, they are particularly vigilant in scrutinising cross-border transactions between related parties.
Another prominent issue in Mongolia currently is transfer pricing. The concept of transfer pricing became more comprehensive in 2020, with the introduction of detailed rules designed to align with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. Specifically, the regulations now include a list of controlled transactions, prescribed transfer pricing methods, requirements for transfer pricing documentation, and a detailed comparability analysis, all based on the OECD guidelines.
PE is also emerging as a key area of focus for the tax authorities. Although it is possible for PEs to be registered as taxpayers, the determination of taxable income for PEs remains an area of uncertainty.


# Mongolia
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
A resident taxpayer of Mongolia includes any economic entity incorporated under Mongolian law or a foreign entity with its effective place of management in Mongolia.
A foreign entity is considered to have its effective place of management in Mongolia if it meets at least three of the following criteria:
  * More than 50% of its shareholders, or shareholders who exercise their rights and responsibilities directly or indirectly through representatives, reside in Mongolia.
  * Over the past four consecutive years prior to the current tax year, more than 50% of shareholder meetings have been held in Mongolia.
  * The company’s accounting and financial records are maintained in Mongolia.
  * At least 25% of the Board of Directors (BOD) members, or those who exercise BOD rights and responsibilities directly or indirectly through representatives, reside in Mongolia.
  * At least 60% of the company’s total sales revenue is earned in or sourced from Mongolia.


A non-resident company is a foreign entity that conducts its business in Mongolia and earns income from Mongolian sources.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The new CIT law includes an expanded definition of 'permanent establishment' (PE) that aligns with international tax rules. A PE is now defined as a unit through which the business activities of a foreign entity are wholly or partly carried out. The specified types of PE are as follows:
  * Construction PE: Constituted for a building site, construction, installation, or assembly project, including connected supervisory services, if it lasts for 90 or more days within a consecutive 12-month period.
  * Service PE: Constituted if a foreign entity provides services, including technical, consultancy, management, supervision, or other services (through a non-resident's employees or contracted personnel) to a resident taxpayer for 183 or more days within a consecutive 12-month period.
  * Agency PE: Constituted if a person carries out the following activities in Mongolia on behalf of a non-resident taxpayer: (i) storing, selling, or supplying goods, and (ii) concluding a contract or playing the principal role leading to the conclusion of a contract without material modification to the main terms or conditions of the non-resident’s contract.


Detailed guidance on PE, including registration and tax reporting aspects, has been issued by the tax authorities.

Expenses mostly associated with income-generating activities are deductible for CIT purposes (provided they meet deductible expenses requirements), and the requirements and limitations on the deductible expenses are provided in the legislation.
## Accrued expenses
Accrued expenses are deductible only if they are supported by valid documentation and relevant WHTs are imposed and paid.
## Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities are not deductible.
## Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation of fixed assets and amortisation of intangibles are deductible within the limits provided in tax legislation. A straight-line method is used, and the years of usage are determined for tax purposes.

## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are deductible. However, there are limits with respect to the deductibility of interest expense. _See Thin capitalisation in the section for more information_.
## Bad debt
Bad debt provisions are not deductible. There is no clear guidance in the tax legislation as to whether bad debt is deductible or not; however, in practice, the tax authorities disallow deductibility of bad debt.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions are not deductible, except for donations to the fund of vocational training, donations to reduce air pollution, and donations up to MNT 10 million to support the activity of a sport club, association, or NGO established by a disabled Mongolian citizen.

In connection with the CIT credit (_see the section_), the following expenses shall not be deductible from taxable income:
  * Financial support provided to vocational education and training institutions for the purpose of training specialists on order.
  * Donations up to MNT 10 million provided to non-governmental organisations established by persons with disabilities in Mongolia.

There is no provision for the carryback of losses.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
As a general rule, deductible expenses shall be supported by proper documentation. Deductibility of payments to foreign affiliates depends on the nature of the payment, as follows:
  * Interest payments are deductible but with restrictions (i.e. thin capitalisation rule may apply, interest paid on loans for construction of buildings and installation of equipment needs to be capitalised during that period).
  * Dividend payments are not deductible.
  * Technical assistance service payments are deductible if applicable taxes were levied.
  * Payments for other services are deductible if applicable taxes were levied.




# Mongolia
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
There are no rules permitting grouping for tax purposes in Mongolia.
## Transfer pricing
Transfer pricing provisions in Mongolia are governed by the Corporate Income Tax (CIT) Law and the General Tax Law (GTL). Starting from 2020, Mongolia introduced comprehensive transfer pricing rules designed to align with the guidelines developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). These rules apply to both domestic and cross-border transactions.
The GTL provides an updated definition of 'related parties', which is referable in all tax relationships and broadly involves persons who can influence terms of transactions and their economic outcome between each other directly or indirectly, by involvement in assets, control, and managerial activities. This general definition includes also specific examples of related parties, but it is not exhaustive.
If conditions of the controlled transactions (transactions between the related parties) are different from conditions of independent transactions (transactions between the unrelated parties) and the tax base has been reduced because of these differences, the tax base shall be increased by the differences of such reduced amount, and relevant reassessed tax shall be levied. Transfer pricing rules apply to all related party transactions, including domestic and cross-border transactions.
Beginning from 2020, the Mongolian tax authorities also introduced rules strengthening the reporting requirements for transactions between related parties. Under these reporting requirements, in particular, all foreign invested and affected domestic entities will need to submit the transactional transfer pricing report, the local file, and master file alongside the annual CIT return. In addition, the qualifying entities will need to submit the country-by-country (CbC) report.
New amendments imposed severe administrative penalties for the failure of transfer pricing documentation requirements, and these administrative penalties are equal to 2% to 4% of a transaction value, apart from penalties and fines resulting from transfer pricing adjustments.
## Thin capitalisation
The CIT Law includes the following thin capitalisation rules:
  * Deductible interest expense incurred on a loan received from related parties shall be limited to 30% of the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBIDTA).
  * Debt-to-‘previously invested capital’ ratio of 3:1 applies to a loan received from investors. Interest paid in excess of this ratio is not deductible and is treated as a dividend. ’Previously invested capital‘ is defined as the investments made by the investor to the company in the form of purchasing or paying up the common stock, preferred stock, or interest contribution.


  * For the loan received from a resident taxpayer shareholder individual, interest expense shall not be deductible at all.


## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
The CFC rules were introduced from 2020, which define as a CFC a foreign entity in which a related party (i.e. a Mongolian tax resident, an individual permanently residing in Mongolia) holds 50% or more of the number of shares or voting rights of a foreign entity during any period of the current tax year directly or through one or more legal entities in the chain.
For taxation purposes, a CFC is treated as a Mongolian tax resident, but these rules shall not apply to a CFC that is established for IPO purposes.


# Mongolia
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
Establishing a branch of a foreign company is theoretically possible but not practically feasible, as, under Mongolian law, there are no regulations detailing the establishment procedure. Consequently, there are currently no branches of non-resident companies in Mongolia.


# Mongolia
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
At present, the following types of incentives exist:

  * In alignment with corporate social responsibility objectives, investments in fixed assets and financial support or donations provided to unrelated parties for the following activities, which are not directly related to the taxpayer's income-generated operations, are eligible for the CIT credit from September 2024 to 1 January 2025. The amount of the CIT credit shall not exceed 1% of the taxable income for the relevant tax year.

  * When a taxpayer relocates its plant or warehouse from the capital city to an area outside the capital city limits, excluding Baganuur, Bagakhangai, and Nalaikh districts, the expenses incurred in connection with the relocation (provided they meet the general requirements for deductible expenses) shall be deductible from taxable income with an additional 50% deductibility. This provision does not apply to taxpayers holding licences for minerals, radioactive minerals, oil exploration, or mining.
  * One-off salary expense (of the local employee hired) shall be deductible from taxable income with additional 20% deductibility, for a taxpayer, if all the following requirements are met:

    * Registers in the local territory in which a headquarter of the business entity operates.
    * Registers in the local tax department.
    * Hires a job seeking citizen under an employment agreement for a period of 183 days or more during the course of 12 consecutive months.


This excludes taxpayers holding minerals, radioactive minerals, oil exploration, and mining licence.
  * If a taxpayer residing in Mongolia issues travel tickets or travel rights to its employees, in forms other than cash that will be used for public transportation within the capital city, purchase cost of such tickets and travel rights shall be deductible from taxable income with additional 50% deductibility. This excludes taxpayers holding minerals, radioactive minerals, oil exploration, and mining licence.


## Foreign investment incentives
The Law on Investment provides tax incentives, including exemptions from tax, tax credits, possibility to use accelerated depreciation for tax purposes, tax loss carryforward, and deduction of employee training costs from taxable income.
### Tax stabilisation
The Law on Investment also provides a 'stabilisation certificate' in order to create a more stable tax environment in Mongolia. By obtaining a stabilisation certificate, investors can stabilise applicable rates of the following taxes:
  * CIT.
  * Customs duties.
  * VAT.
  * Minerals royalties.


The holder of a stabilisation certificate can stabilise tax rates for a period from 5 to 18 years, depending on amount of investment, industry of investment, and geographic location of investment in Mongolia (_see Stabilisation certificate terms below_). Under the valid period of a stabilisation certificate, investors also have the right to apply effective tax rates provided in general legislation if such rates are more beneficial for investors.
The criteria of issuing a stabilisation certificate are:
  * the total investment amount specified in the business plan and feasibility study reaches thresholds specified in the stabilisation certificate terms (_see below_)
  * an environmental impact assessment should be carried out
  * the investment should create new permanent jobs, and
  * the investment should introduce innovative technology.


An investor who made an investment in tobacco and alcohol related activities cannot benefit from tax stabilisation.
If certain conditions are met, the stabilisation certificate period may be extended by 1.5 times for some projects.
The conditions are that the projects:
  * produce products that substitute for imported products or export-oriented products that are important for the long-term social and economic development of Mongolia, that will require investment of more than MNT 500 billion, and have a development period of more than three years, or
  * produce value-added, processed products for export.


In addition to above, the law provides for incentives with respect to customs duty (exemption) and VAT (zero-rate) on imported equipment and machinery during the construction period of specific projects, as below:
  * Construction of a factory for processing construction materials, petroleum, agricultural products, and products intended for export.
  * Nano, bio, and innovation technology plant construction.
  * Construction of power plants and railroads.


#### Stabilisation certificate terms

## Free Trade Zones (FTZs)
### Establishing FTZs
Currently, there are three FTZs established at the border towns of Altanbulag, Zamyn-Uud, and Tsagaan Nuur.
FTZs have special regimes in terms of tax, customs, transit, state registration, foreign currency, specialised inspection, and visa and labour regulations. Companies registered in FTZs should commence their operations within a year after their registration; otherwise, their registration will be suspended.
### Tax and customs regime
#### CIT
Businesses that have invested 500,000 United States dollars (USD) or more in the FTZs operating to improve infrastructures, such as energy and heating sources, pipeline networks, clean water supplies, wastewater sewage, auto roads, railways, airports, and basic communication lines, shall receive a CIT discount equal to 50% of their invested capital in the FTZ.
For businesses with more than USD 300,000 invested in building warehouses, loading and unloading facilities, hotels, tourist camps, or manufacturers of export and import-substituted goods in the FTZ shall receive a CIT discount equal to 50% of their invested capital in the FTZ.
Loss-making entities in the FTZs can carry forward their losses reflected on their CIT return up to five years from the time of becoming fully operational to reduce their future tax payable.
Entities using innovated and enhanced technology in their businesses shall be fully exempted from CIT for the first five years from the time of starting operation in the FTZs.
#### VAT
Goods imported to the FTZs are not subject to VAT. If goods are to be transferred from the customs territory to the FTZs, there will also be no VAT on those goods, and any previously paid VAT will be reimbursed accordingly based on related documents.
There will be a 0% rate on VAT for domestic goods to be transferred from the customs territory to the FTZs.
In addition to purchases per Article 38.1.4 of the Law on Custom Tax and Tariff (which refer to goods for passengers’ personal use), purchases in the FTZ of up to MNT 3 million made by passengers are exempt from VAT when entered into the customs territory.
There will be no VAT imposed on goods and services manufactured and sold by registered individuals and businesses in the FTZs.
#### Customs and excise taxes
Goods imported to the FTZs are not subject to customs and excise taxes. If goods are to be transferred from the customs territory to the FTZs, there will be no customs and excise taxes on those goods, and any of these taxes previously paid will be reimbursed accordingly based on related documents.
In addition to purchases per Article 38.1.4 of the Law on Custom Tax and Tariff (which refer to goods for passengers’ personal use), purchases in the FTZ of up to MNT 3 million made by passengers are exempt from customs tax when entered into the customs territory.
Any goods, except purchases made by passengers as mentioned above, are subject to customs and related taxes as required in the regulation when transferred from the FTZs to the customs territory.
Goods exported from the FTZs are not subject to taxation.
#### Land payments and property taxes in the FTZ
Individuals and businesses may request a land possession and usage right in the FTZs through either project bid or auction.
Entities operating in trade, tourism, and hotel sectors in the FTZs are fully exempted from land possession and usage right payment for the first five years from commencement of operation. This payment is further reduced up to 50% for the following three years.
Businesses operating to improve infrastructures in the FTZs, such as energy and heating sources, pipeline networks, clean water supplies, wastewater sewage, auto roads, railways, airports, and basic communication lines, will be fully exempted from land payment for the first ten years from start of operation.
Buildings and facilities built and registered in the FTZs are fully exempted from the immovable property tax.
## Foreign tax credit
A provision exists for a foreign tax credit, applicable to taxes remitted to foreign jurisdictions. This credit is limited to the equivalent tax liability that would have been assessed in Mongolia on the same income. Furthermore, upon meeting certain prerequisites, taxes paid in foreign countries that are party to information exchange agreements with Mongolian tax authorities may be eligible for credit. This credit can be applied against tax liabilities in Mongolia, thereby mitigating the potential for double taxation.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
Interest provided to non-residents on bonds issued by Mongolian commercial banks are subject to WHT at 5%. A special 5% rate applies on dividend and interest income of an investor who purchased debt instruments or shares of a local entity (not holding mineral resources, oil exploration, and mining special licences) traded in local and international stock markets.
In other cases, dividends, interest, and royalties paid to resident companies and individuals are all subject to WHT at 10%, while dividends, interest, and royalties paid, and payments made for goods sold and work/services provided (directly or electronically), to non-residents are subject to WHT at a 20% rate.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
In Mongolia, a resident entity is subject to CIT on its worldwide income, unless the income is specifically exempt. CIT applies to all taxable income and capital gains, at various rates dependent on the type of income and gains.
Non-resident corporations are taxed in Mongolia on their income earned in Mongolia or sourced from Mongolia (from which the income provider entity in Mongolia should withhold taxes), as well as income from a Mongolian source arising through a PE in Mongolia.
Mongolian-source income is defined in the CIT Law as including:
  * income provided by a Mongolian tax resident and/or PE in Mongolia to a non-resident taxpayer for goods sold in Mongolia or for work performed and services provided directly or electronically
  * income earned by a non-resident taxpayer from sport, arts, culture, and other events organised in the territory of Mongolia
  * dividend income paid by a Mongolian tax resident to a non-resident taxpayer
  * interest income paid or transferred by the national and local state administration office, by a Mongolian tax resident, and/or by a PE in Mongolia to a non-resident taxpayer
  * income from the sale, transfer, or lease of an asset or associated right in Mongolia that is possessed, used, or owned by a non-resident taxpayer
  * royalty income, income from the lease, usage, and right to use movable and immovable property, intangible assets, interest on finance leases, and income from technical, management, consulting, and other services provided by a Mongolian tax resident to a non-resident taxpayer
  * income transferred by a PE in Mongolia to a non-resident taxpayer operating through the PE
  * income from the sale or transfer of an asset, associated rights possessed, used or owned by a PE of a non-resident taxpayer
  * income earned by a non-resident taxpayer from the sale or lease of movable and immovable property or intangible assets to be used for the activities of a PE in Mongolia, and
  * other income equivalent to those specified above.


## Inventory valuation
There is no specific provision in the tax law for inventory valuation, but a loss incurred from inventory revaluation is not deductible from taxable income.
## Capital gains
Capital and ordinary transactions are treated in the same way for tax purposes (i.e. included in annual taxable income). An exception is provided for income from sales of immovable property, which is subject to tax of 2% on gross sales proceeds.
A non-resident taxpayer’s income earned in Mongolia or from a Mongolian source is taxed in Mongolia. The definition of Mongolian-source income includes income from a sale or transfer of asset and associated rights in Mongolia (including shares). Such income is taxed with a 20% withholding tax (WHT) on a gross basis.
Obligations for withholding, reporting, and paying such tax rests with a Mongolian resident taxpayer who provides such income to a non-resident. However, in absence of this agent (i.e. in case a transaction is done between two non-residents), a non-resident-seller should be responsible for tax reporting and payment of a Mongolian WHT on a self-assessment basis.
## Dividend income
Dividend income earned by a Mongolian resident entity is subject to WHT of 10% if the recipient is a Mongolian resident taxpayer. Dividend income to be remitted out of the country to a foreign tax resident is subject to WHT at 20% but may be reduced by an applicable double tax treaty (DTT).
There is a special provision for investors who have purchased shares of a local entity (excluding those holding licences for mineral resources, oil exploration, and mining) traded in both local and international stock markets. In such cases, the dividend income is subject to a reduced WHT rate of 5%.
## Interest income
Interest income is subject to a special income tax of 10% if the recipient is a Mongolian resident taxpayer. For interest income remitted out of the country to a foreign tax resident, the WHT rate is 20%, which may be reduced by an applicable DTT.
A special 5% rate applies on interest income of an investor who purchased debt instruments issued by a Mongolian commercial bank and debt instruments of a local entity (not holding mineral resources, oil exploration, and mining special licences) traded in local and international stock markets.
## Rental income
Rental income is included in taxable income for tax determination.
## Royalty income
Generally, royalty income is taxed at a special rate of 10% if the recipient is a Mongolian resident taxpayer. Royalty income to be remitted out of the country to a foreign tax resident is subject to WHT at 20% but may be reduced by an applicable DTT.
A special 5% rate applies on software license fee and server renting fee income transferred to a non-resident legal entity by a resident taxpayer in Mongolia that is engaged in primary activities of software development**.**
## Partnership income
There is no transparent partnership concept in Mongolia. Partnership income is treated as income of a legal entity and is subject to CIT.
## Unrealised currency exchange gains/losses
Unrealised currency exchange gains are not considered as taxable income, and, at the same time, unrealised losses are not deductible from taxable income.
## Exempt income
Tax exempt income includes:
  * Interest on bonds issued by the government, capital city, and the Development Bank of Mongolia.
  * Income of a loan guarantee institution earned from its primary activities specified in the law.
  * Income collected from its members for services specified in the charter document of an Apartment Owners’ Association.
  * Dividend income and income subject to common tax rate (including operational income, income from sale of shares and securities, income from quiz, gambling, and lottery activities, income from sale of assets, etc.) derived from sale of its portion of product and earned by a taxpayer who operates in the territory of Mongolia under a product-sharing contract in the oil industry.
  * Income of a cooperative earned from a price difference for the intermediary services for sale of its member’s products.
  * Income distributed from the state budget to the future heritage fund and the investment income of the fund.
  * Income from activities of organisations specified in the Law on Education and the Law on Health.
  * Dividend distributed from state-owned enterprises to the government.
  * Income from economic activities in connection with the implementation of the purposes specified in the charter of a non-profit organisation.
  * Income from dividend specified in the Law on Sovereign Wealth Fund.
  * Income from the sale of innovative products, works, and services specified in the Innovation Law and newly created by a start-up company within five years from the date of its registration.
  * Operating income of investment funds.


## Foreign income
Mongolian legal entities pay tax on their worldwide income. Unremitted earnings are taxed the same as ordinary earnings.
Credit relief is available for foreign taxes paid on income from countries that have information exchange agreements with the Mongolian tax authorities. This relief is capped at the amount of Mongolian tax that would have been payable on the same income if it had been earned in Mongolia.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
Mongolian resident entities are taxable on their aggregate annual income earned worldwide. Non-resident entities conducting business activities in Mongolia are taxable on income earned within Mongolian territory and from Mongolian sources.
Mongolian corporate income tax (CIT) is levied using a progressive rate scale, as follows:
  * 1% for entities with annual revenue up to MNT 300 million, except for those in the mining, petroleum, alcoholic beverage, and tobacco industries.
  * 10% on the first MNT 6 billion of annual taxable income.
  * For annual taxable income exceeding MNT 6 billion, the tax is MNT 600 million plus 25% of the income over MNT 6 billion.


However, certain types of income, as detailed in the chart below, are excluded from the calculation of annual taxable income and are taxed at different rates on a gross basis:
Source of income | Applicable tax rate (%)  
---|---  
Dividends | 10  
Royalties | 10  
Interest | 10  
Gambling, betting games, and lotteries (net) | 40  
Sale of immovable property | 2  
Sale of rights (e.g. mining licences, special activity licences, and other rights granted by the authorised organisations for conducting specific activities) | 10  
A special 5% tax rate will apply to dividend and interest income for investors who purchase debt instruments or shares of a local entity (excluding those holding mineral resources, oil exploration, and mining special licences) traded on local and international stock markets.
Entities with annual revenue up to MNT 300 million will submit CIT returns on an annual basis and will be taxed at a rate of 1%. This rate does not apply to entities operating in the mining, petroleum, alcoholic beverage, and tobacco industries.
## Ultimate beneficial owner (UBO)
Under the General Taxation Law (GTL), the UBO for tax purposes is defined as a person who owns 30% or more of the shares, ownership interest, or voting rights in a legal entity holding a mining or petroleum licence or land-use (or possession) rights, either directly or indirectly through a chain of legal entities; exercises voting rights; or has the right to receive dividends. Concurrently, the concept of a 'right holder' is introduced, defined as a person who possesses a mineral, radioactive minerals, and petroleum exploration or mining licence or land-use (or possession) rights.
The taxpayer (the right holder) must register its UBO for tax purposes with the tax authorities. If there is a change in the UBO, the taxpayer must notify the authorities within 30 days.
If the UBO's share ownership in the licence-holding company changes due to the sale or transfer of shares, the transaction is considered an 'indirect sale/transfer of rights' and is subject to CIT in Mongolia. Importantly, the tax obligation falls on the legal entity holding such rights, not on the person who earns income from the transaction.
### Assessing taxable income
In general, taxable income shall be assessed based on the value of rights pro-rated to the number of shares or percentage of participation that are transferred from a right-holding entity or its UBOs. For the purpose of certainty, the Ministry of Finance passed the Decrees No. 303 and 302, dated 31 December 2019, which set the following methodologies to assess taxable income:
In general, taxable income is assessed based on the value of rights proportional to the number of shares or the percentage of participation transferred from a right-holding entity or its UBOs. To ensure clarity, the Ministry of Finance issued Decrees No. 303 and 302, dated 31 December 2019, establishing the following methodologies to assess taxable income:
  * Methodology to assess and impose taxes on income from the sale of the right to use or possess land (Decree No. 303).
  * Methodology to determine the value of mining licences and assess taxes on income from the transfer of mining licences (Decree No. 302).


### Penalties
Breach of the above-mentioned legislative requirements (including failure to properly assess taxes, failure to report relevant information, or concealing documents and information, as well as providing false documentation for tax purposes) may result in the cancellation of the respective rights, such as mining licences and/or land-use or possession rights.
## Local income taxes
CIT is levied at the state level in Mongolia. There are no provincial or local corporate income taxes.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
According to the VAT Law, any person (including legal entities, individuals, and PEs) whose sales income reaches MNT 50 million or more within 12 consecutive months must register as a VAT withholder. The threshold for voluntary registration is MNT 10 million in sales income. The sale of fixed assets is not considered when determining VAT registration thresholds.
A VAT rate of 10% is imposed on the supply of goods, services, and works that are imported, exported, or sold in Mongolia.
A distinctive feature of Mongolian VAT legislation is that services and works received from a non-resident, regardless of whether they are supplied in Mongolia or not, are subject to VAT under the reverse-charge procedure (RC VAT).
## Customs duty
Customs tariffs in Mongolia range between 5% and 40%, depending on the type of goods imported. However, certain items, such as gas condensate, petroleum oils, crude oils, oils obtained from bituminous minerals, automatic data processing machines, electrical machinery and equipment and their parts, medical equipment, and pure-bred livestock, are zero-rated.
Export duties apply to specific exported goods, including unprocessed camel wool, wood, and wooden materials.
## Excise tax
Excise tax is levied on goods manufactured in or imported into Mongolia, including tobacco, alcohol, gasoline, diesel fuel, and passenger vehicles. Additionally, excise tax is imposed on the physical units of special-purpose technical devices and equipment used for betting games and gambling, as well as on the activities of individuals and legal entities conducting such activities.
Currently, the excise tax rates on goods such as alcohol and tobacco vary. For instance, the tax is MNT 350 per litre for Shimiin arkhi (a traditional Mongolian alcoholic drink) distilled using a production method, and MNT 4,180 per 100 cigarettes of tobacco. For other types of alcoholic beverages, the excise rate varies based on the alcohol content and is set to progressively increase over the next few years.
**Beverage types** | Excise**rate/litre (minimum-maximum range in MNT)**  
---|---  
**2023-2024** | **2025-2026** | **2027-2027** | **2029 onwards**  
All types of white alcohol, liqueurs, cordials, and other spirits drinks | 3,700-31,300 | 3,900-34,450 | 4,100-37,900 | 4,300-41,690  
All types of brandy, whiskey, rum, and gin | 9,100-38,280 | 9,600-44,000 | 10,100-50,600 | 10,600-58,200  
For special-purpose technical devices and equipment used for betting games and gambling, the excise tax ranges from MNT 4.35 million to MNT 116 million per unit, depending on the origin and type of equipment.
For imported gasoline and diesel, the excise tax rates range from MNT 0 to MNT 850,000, depending on the port of import.
For imported automobiles, the excise tax varies between MNT 750,000 and MNT 65,975,000, based on the year of production, type of automobile, and engine capacity.
## Immovable property tax (IPT)
The IPT is an annual tax that ranges from 0.6% to 2%, depending on factors such as location, usage, size, market demand, and supply conditions of the property. The exact tax rate within this range is determined by the Citizens' Representatives Khurals of the Aimag and Capital City, considering the location, designation, size, market needs, and requirements of the property.
The tax is levied on the value of immovable property as reported in state registration records. If the property is unregistered, the insured value is used. In the absence of both a registered and insured value, the accounting value is utilised.
This tax does not apply to properties owned by legal entities financed through the state budget, dwelling houses, or buildings and constructions of a public nature. Other tax-exempt properties include:
  * Buildings and structures registered in the special zone of the capital city.
  * Two apartments owned by a citizen or legal entity in the soum, aimag, or the capital (previously, all apartments were exempt from IPT).
  * Real estate located in the territory of an industrial and technological park, which is exempt from IPT for the first five years and 50% exempt for the following five years. This amendment is effective as of 1 August 2022.


## Transfer taxes
Mongolia does not have a separate transfer tax. Instead, the transfer of a right or licence, except for intellectual property (IP) rights, granted by state authorities is treated as a sale of rights and is taxed at 10% under the CIT law. The sale of IP rights is subject to a 5% CIT (_for more details, please refer to the section_). For individuals, the transfer of land rights is subject to a 10% tax under the personal income tax (PIT) law.
In the case of transfer of property, stamp duty will be applied.
## Stamp duty
Under the Law of Mongolia on State Stamp Duties, there are 45 types of activities subject to stamp duties, including the following:
  * Settlement of legal disputes by a court.
  * Court involvement in arbitration.
  * Notary services.
  * Consulate services.
  * State registration services for legal entities.
  * Registration services for foreign-invested economic entities and representative offices of foreign organisations.
  * Other specific activities requiring permissions and rights from state authorities.


The amount of the duty varies depending on the type of service or activity involved.
## Social insurance contribution by employer
Employers’ social insurance contributions in Mongolia vary depending on the industry type and the job positions of the employees, ranging from 12.5% to 14.5%. This contribution includes 8.5% for pensions, 1% for benefits, 2% for health, 0.2% for unemployment, and 0.8% to 2.8% for industrial accident and occupational disease insurance. Employer contributions are not capped and are deductible when determining taxable income.
Employers are also required to withhold social insurance taxes from employees, generally at a rate of 11.5%. This amount will be capped at MNT 910,800 per month if an employee’s income exceeds MNT 7,920,000 after 1 April 2025, reflecting the increase in the minimum wage from MNT 660,000 to MNT 792,000. Employers must submit social insurance returns electronically and by paper before the fifth day of the following month on a monthly basis. Payments should be made to the social insurance fund account before the end of the month.
## Payroll taxes
In addition to social insurance contributions, employers in Mongolia are subject to payroll taxes. Employers are required to withhold PIT from employees' employment income at progressive rates of 10% to 20% for Mongolian tax residents and a flat rate of 20% for tax non-residents. Employers must submit PIT returns electronically on a quarterly basis.
## Fees and taxes applicable to the extractive industry
A range of fees and other taxes are payable for activities in the extractive industry. The primary ones include the following:
  * Mining Licence Fee that is agreed to up front and stated in the mining licence.
  * Mining Royalty Tax.
  * Water Pollution Fee.
  * Air Pollution Fee.
  * Land Use Fee.
  * Natural Resources Usage Fee.
