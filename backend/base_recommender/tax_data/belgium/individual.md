## Foreign tax relief
Belgian tax residents must report their worldwide income on their Belgian resident tax returns. Income that is taxable/taxed/effectively taxed (depending on the wording of the particular treaty) abroad is exempted with progression from Belgian tax (i.e. the foreign income is exempt from taxation in Belgium but is taken into account to determine the marginal tax rate applicable to the other income taxable in Belgium).
Exempted income from Bahrain, China, Congo, France, Germany, Japan, Macedonia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Rwanda, San Marino, Seychelles, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Uruguay is, however, subject to communal taxes in Belgium.
## Tax treaties
Belgium has concluded a double tax treaty with more than 150 countries.

## New expat tax regime
A 'new' special tax regime has been introduced for qualifying expatriates arriving in Belgium as of 1 January 2022. This regime replaces the 'old' special tax regime in place since 1983. In order to allow a smooth transition, the Belgian tax authorities have issued a circular letter that provides for a two-year transition period during which the 'old' regime can still be continued. The 'old' special tax regime will, in any case, stop on 31 December 2023. Expatriates who benefited from the special tax regime can therefore continue to benefit from the 'old' regime until 31 December 2023 provided they continue to meet the required conditions. In some case, they may opt-in for the 'new' regime. Employees starting as of 1 January 2022 may not apply for the 'old' regime. They can, however, apply for the 'new' regime, provided they meet the conditions. 
The essential characteristics of the 'new' expat regime can be summarised as follows:
  * Separate, although in many regards identical, regime for executives and for qualifying researchers.
  * Limitation in time to five years, with possible extension for another three years.
  * Open to employees and company key individuals directly recruited abroad or seconded to Belgium within international groups of companies.
  * Open to both foreign and Belgian citizens, whether employee or company key individuals (except for researchers what regards the latter).
  * Required minimum gross annual taxable income of 75,000 euros (EUR) (not applicable to researchers).
  * Precondition of lack of submission to Belgian income tax in the 60 months preceding the start of professional activities in Belgium (whether as resident or as non-resident).
  * Precondition of previous place of residence more than 150 kilometres away from the Belgian border.
  * Possibility for the employer/company to pay up to a maximum 30% of gross annual taxable income as tax and social security free expense reimbursement (a payment that comes on top of the gross salary).
  * Limitation of the 30% lump sum tax and social security free expense reimbursement to EUR 90,000 _per_ _annum_.
  * Possibility for the employer/company to reimburse on top of the lump sum 30% specific other expenses, such as moving expenses, installation costs (maximum of EUR 1,500), and school fees.
  * New regime is individual centric, not company centric (i.e. it can be continued with another employer in Belgium, provided all conditions are still met).
  * Formal request to be made by the employer/company and by the employee/company key individual within three months from the arrival in Belgium. 
  * Entry into force: 1 January 2022.
  * Expats who are less than five years under the current regime may (under certain conditions) still opt-in in the 'new' regime (with an overall time limitation of eight years) or choose to stay in the 'old' regime.
  * Fading out of (transitional measures of) the 'old' regime on 31 December 2023.


## Tax measures in response to COVID-19
As a result of the COVID-19 crisis, the Belgian government has introduced various tax measures of which some examples are listed below. _For more details, see_.
### Double tax treaties (DTTs)
There is no general 'force majeure' tolerance for cross-border employment.
Belgium has, however, concluded specific agreements with France, the Netherlands, Germany, and Luxembourg, which implement a mutual 'force majeure tolerance' for cross-border workers in relation to COVID-19 (travel) restrictions. These agreements have been extended until 30 June 2022. 
As of 14 March 2020, the presence of a worker (who normally works in Luxembourg) teleworking at home in Belgium will not be taken into account in the calculation of the 24 days (2020 and 2021) or 34 days (2022) in a calendar year. This is the day count calculation that tax residents of Belgium, who (under normal circumstances) work in Luxembourg, can work outside the territory of Luxembourg without attributing taxation power to Belgium.
Similarly, the Belgian and French authorities consider that the situation related to the coronavirus met the characteristics of a force majeure situation. Therefore, it was decided that, as of 14 March 2020 until 30 June 2022, the presence of a French frontier worker at one's place of residence (in particular for teleworking) will not be taken into account for the calculation of the 30-days period by reference to which tax residents of France who usually work in Belgium can work outside Belgium. 
Please note that there is no administrative tolerance foreseen for foreign executives working in Belgium under the 'old' special tax regime with respect to the foreign travel that is impacted solely because of COVID-19 measures. 
From a social security point of view, according to the European Union (EU) regulation for social security nr 883/2004, employees who works at least 25% of their time in the country of residency are covered by the social security system in that country. Employees who perform less than 25% of work in their country of residence are usually covered by the social security system in the country where their employer is located. In June 2020, due to travel restrictions linked to COVID-19, the European Union adopted guidelines indicating that changes in the work pattern of employees due to COVID-19 should not be taken into account for the determination of the country responsible for social security. This measure has been extended until 30 June 2023. No further extension is expected after that date.
## Other measures
  * Introduction of a mandatory reporting (as of 1 January 2019) and withholding (as of 1 March 2019) requirement in the hands of a Belgian entity in case affiliated foreign companies grant taxable benefits (in kind or in cash) to employees or directors working for the benefit of the Belgian entity. 
  * Introduction of a new reporting obligation as of 1 January 2022 for companies to report the actual amount (real value) of cost proper to the employer that are reimbursed on the basis of supporting documents.
  * According to the latest administrative instructions of the National Security Office (NSSO), social security contributions are due on all benefits related to the work performed by the employee in the framework of one's employment contract with the employer. This adjusted NSSO position applies a very broad, and possibly questionable, interpretation by stating that employees of a Belgian subsidiary only receive a benefit that is granted by a foreign parent company because of their employment with the Belgian subsidiary and that, consequently, such benefit should always be considered as salary subject to Belgian social security contributions, even when there is no intervention of the Belgian employer in the grant of the benefit and no recharge of the costs to the Belgian employer. 
  * The tax on securities accounts that reach or exceed EUR 500,000 per account holder has been abolished with effect as of 1 October 2019 after a decision of the Belgian Constitutional Court and will be replaced by a solidarity tax of 0.15% on securities accounts that reach or exceed EUR 1 million (held by Belgian resident taxpayers in Belgium or abroad and by non-residents in Belgium).
  * Resident taxpayers who own real estate abroad must report their foreign property in their Belgian tax return. Since 2021, they must submit a declaration to the Administration of Measurement and Valuations, which will determine the deemed rental value of the foreign real estate.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 28 August 2024
Belgium taxes its residents on their worldwide income, irrespective of their nationality.
Residents of Belgium are taxable on their worldwide income, while non-residents are only taxable on Belgian-source income.
Personal income tax (PIT) is calculated by determining the tax base and assessing the tax due on that base. Taxation is charged on a sliding scale to successive portions of net taxable income. For income year 2024, the federal tax rates range between nil and 50% (_see below_).
The tax calculation contains two major components, notably the 'federal PIT' and the 'regional PIT'. Pursuant to the 6th Reform, the Belgian regions are now entitled to retain surcharges on 'reduced federal personal income taxation', and also grant tax reductions/tax credits. The tax liability may therefore differ (although slightly at this stage) depending on the region in which the residence of the taxpayer is located on the 1st of January of the respective tax year.
Tax rates are the same for resident and non-resident taxpayers, but some deductions or tax rebates are only granted to non-residents, provided that they earn at least 75% of their worldwide professional income in Belgium.
## Personal income tax rates
Tax brackets for income year 2023 are applicable to net taxable income after the deduction of social security charges and professional expenses.
Taxable income (EUR) | Rate (%) | Tax on bracket (EUR) | Cumulative tax (EUR)  
---|---|---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 15,820 | 25 | 3,955 | 3,955  
15,820 | 27,920 | 40 | 4,840 | 8,795  
27,920 | 48,320 | 45 | 9,180 | 17,975  
48,320 | and above | 50  
## Tax on investment income
Income from capital includes interest, dividends, or other forms of investment.
Interest and dividends paid out and collected via a Belgian financial institution are, in principle, subject to a flat-rate tax of 30%. Interest from ordinary savings accounts is exempted from taxation up to a limit of EUR 1,020 (income year 2024). Any interest exceeding this amount is subject to tax at a rate of 15%. Dividend payments are exempted for the first EUR 833.
Foreign interest and dividends collected abroad by resident taxpayers must be declared in their annual tax return for the net amount (after the deduction of the foreign tax withheld at source), and the flat-rate tax is paid on assessment. Please note that pursuant to a decision of the European Court of Justice, communal taxes should no more be applied on these foreign interest and dividends.
Pursuant to a ruling of the Belgian Supreme Court, it is now possible to subtract a part of the French WHTs from the Belgian WHTs that are due on dividends received from those French stocks. Investors can claim back excessive WHTs from the past five years. Please note that this regime only applies to French dividends and cannot be extrapolated to dividends received from other countries.
## Local income taxes
For residents of Belgium, communal taxes are levied at rates varying from 0% to 9% of the income tax due. The average rate being 7%. For non-residents, a flat surcharge of 7% is due. In some cases, communal taxes may also be levied on exempted foreign-source income.

## Taxable period
The Belgian tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December. The tax return for income year 'x' must be filed during the year 'x+1', called the tax year (e.g. income year 2023, tax year 2024). The assessment notice must be sent by the tax authorities by 30 June of the year 'x+2'.
## Tax returns
A tax return is sent during the tax year by the tax authorities to be filled in by the taxpayer. An assessment note is sent by the tax authorities within six months following the tax year. Any tax due must be paid to the tax authorities within two months following the sending of the assessment notice.
Spouses and legal cohabitants must file a joined tax return even though their income is taxed separately.
## Payment of tax
There is a compulsory income tax withholding (WHT) from salaries (also for directors, now called 'key men').
Professional WHT is due under the following circumstances:
  * When remuneration is paid or attributed by Belgian residents, in Belgium or abroad, to Belgian residents or non-residents.
  * When remuneration is paid or attributed by Belgian non-residents if the remuneration concerned can be classified as professional expenses, that is, relating to income of the non-resident employer that is taxable in Belgium.
  * A new reporting and withholding requirement has been introduced applicable to Belgian companies since 1 January 2019 (reporting) and 1 March 2019 (withholding) for all remuneration and benefits in cash or in kind granted by a related foreign company (e.g. a foreign parent company) to employees/company directors working for the benefit of the Belgian entity. This reporting and withholding obligation applies even if there is no recharge of the costs to Belgium and there is no involvement of the Belgian entity in the grant of the benefit or the management of the plan.
  * To calculate the WHT, employers must follow the legal scales as published by the tax authorities. 
  * All allowances paid to employees as of 1 January 2022 as reimbursement of costs incurred by the employee/director in the framework of the business activity must be justified in the individual tax forms (281.10/281.20) for their actual amount (real value). This reporting obligation concerns all costs to the employer that are reimbursed on the basis of supporting documents. 




# Belgium
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 28 August 2024
## Employment expenses
In determining the tax base, compulsory social security contributions (paid in Belgium or abroad) are fully deductible. Employment-related expenses are also deductible, provided they are substantiated; alternatively, standard deductions may be claimed.
For employees, the standard expense deduction amounts to 30% of the gross earning, up to a ceiling of EUR 5,750.
For remunerated directors, the standard deduction is a flat 3% and cannot exceed the ceiling of EUR 3,030.
In addition to social security contributions and professional expenses, some non-business expenses can also be deducted from the taxable basis, and personal exemptions are granted.
## Personal deductions
### Support payments
80% of the support (alimony) payments to near relatives or a separated spouse are deductible (non-residents can deduct only payments made to residents of Belgium; however, there are some tax treaty exceptions).
### Tax reductions
Some non-business expenses give rise to a tax reduction.
At the federal level, the most commonly granted reductions mainly concern:
  * Pension savings contributions, with a maximum of EUR 1,020 or EUR 1,310, depending on the extent of the tax reduction (i.e. 30% or 25%, respectively).
  * Employee's contributions to group insurance: 30%.
  * Charitable contributions of minimum EUR 40 made to certain recognised EEA institutions give right to a 45% tax reduction.
  * Life insurance premiums: 30% with a maximum of EUR 2,450.
  * Remuneration costs of domestic personnel give right to a 30% tax reduction (up to certain limits and under certain conditions).
  * Child custody expenses, up to a maximum of EUR 16.4 per day for income year 2024 for children under 14 years of age, give right to a 45% tax reduction.


At the regional level, the most commonly granted tax reductions concern:
  * The capital repayment of a mortgage loan.
  * Payment of services performed in the framework of local employment agencies or paid with service-checks.
  * Security investment against theft or fire.
  * Expenses incurred for the maintenance and renovation of certain real estate.


## Personal exemptions
In addition to the above-mentioned deductions, some personal exemptions are granted. The following amounts are deductible in determining taxable income.
### For each taxpayer
The personal basic exemption amounts to EUR 10,160.
### For dependent children
Number of children | Exemption increase (EUR) | Accumulated exemption (EUR)  
---|---|---  
1 | 1,920 | 1,920  
2 | 3,030 | 4,950  
3 | 6,140 | 11,090  
4 | 6,850 | 17,940  
For any other dependent person, an amount of EUR 1,920 is deductible.
It must be stressed that the exemption takes place on the lowest part of income (at the lowest marginal tax rates).
Handicapped children or other dependants count for two children/dependants in the above scale.
For each child less than three years old on 1 January of the tax year, the above amounts are increased by EUR 690, provided no child custody expenses are deducted.
The rates and brackets applicable as of assessment year 2025 (income year 2024) to determine the taxes linked to the personal exemptions are as follows:
Personal exemptions (EUR) | Rate (%) | Gains on bracket (EUR) | Total (EUR)  
---|---|---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 11,120 | 25 | 2,780 | 2,780  
11,120 | 15,820 | 30 | 1,410 | 4,190  
15,820 | 26,360 | 40 | 4,216 | 8,406  
26,360 | 48,320 | 45 | 9,882 | 18,288  
48,320 | and above | 50  
The income of each spouse/legal cohabitant is taxed separately. Special rules exist when one spouse has no or low earned income, as noted below.
  * Only one spouse receives earned income: A splitting is applicable. An income equal to 30% of the gross taxable earnings of the spouse will be attributed to the spouse without earnings and taxed in that spouse's own name (the so-called 'marital quotient'). Income that may be attributed to the non-earning spouse cannot exceed EUR 13,050. If one of the spouses is self-employed or is engaged in a liberal profession and is effectively assisted by the other, an income equal to a maximum of 30% of the earning spouse's net earnings will be attributed to the assisting spouse if the net earnings of the latter do not exceed EUR 16,950. The maximum of 30% can be exceeded (up to a maximum of 50%), provided sufficient evidence of the real assistance of the helping spouse is given.
  * Both spouses receive earned income: The above regulations also apply where both spouses receive earned income if the earnings of one spouse exceed 70% of total earnings and the earnings of the other spouse do not reach EUR 13,050. In this case, income may be attributed to the spouse earning less, until 30% of total earnings without exceeding the maximum of EUR 13,050 is reached.


The exempt income, personal deductions, and the attribution of income to the spouse are, in principle, applicable both to residents and non-residents, although for non-residents these exemptions and deductions are only applicable provided they earn at least 75% of their worldwide professional income in Belgium. Moreover, in order to be entitled to regional tax benefits in Belgium, those non-residents must also maintain their tax residency in another member state of the European Economic Area.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 28 August 2024
Belgian residents and non-residents are taxed on their employment income, movable income, property income, and miscellaneous income. Other taxes that may be relevant are gift and succession taxes (_see the section for more information_).
Belgian residents are taxed on their worldwide income, but their foreign-source income is exempted with progression in Belgium if it is taxable, taxed, or effectively taxed (depending on the wording of the DTT) in another country according to the applicable DTT. Please note that in some cases exempted income may be subject to local taxes (e.g. exempted income from Bahrain, China, Congo, France, Germany, Japan, Macedonia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Rwanda, San Marino, Seychelles, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Uruguay).
Belgian non-residents are taxed on their Belgian income source only.
## Employment income
Employment income is widely defined and includes all fringe benefits provided by an employer (e.g. the private use of a company car, bonuses, stock options, commissions, tax equalisation reimbursements, cost of living allowances, housing allowances).
Personal income tax is calculated by determining the tax base. Taxation on a sliding scale is applied to successive portions of the taxable income. Rates vary between 25% and 50% (plus local taxes). _See the section for more information_.
In determining the tax base, employee compulsory social security contributions paid either in Belgium or abroad are fully tax-deductible. Professional expenses can also be deducted from the taxable income (either on an actual basis, or on a lump sum basis). Income tax is calculated on that base, after allowing for part of that base to be exempt from tax (the so-called personal tax exemption - _see Personal exemptions in the section for more information_).
In addition to these standard personal deductions, some non-business expenses may reduce tax liability (such as gifts made to recognised institutions, childcare expenses for children younger than 14 years old, titres-services/dienstencheques, reduction for own dwelling, etc.).
Non-resident taxpayers are only entitled to personal deductions (at the federal income level - such as deduction for childcare expenses, tax reductions for gifts made to recognised institutions, etc.) if they earn at least 75% of their income in Belgium. Tax reductions at the regional level are only granted to non-residents who earn at least 75% of their income from Belgian sources and who remain resident of another European Economic Area (EEA) country. _See the section for more information_.
### Special tax regime
The Law introducing the new expat regime was published in the Official Gazette on 31 December 2021. It is applicable as of 1 January 2022.
The essential characteristics of the new regime can be summarised as follows:
  * Separate, although in many regards identical, regime for executives and for qualifying researchers.
  * Limitation in time to five years, with possible extension for another three years.
  * Open to employees and company key individuals directly recruited abroad or seconded to Belgium within international groups of companies.
  * Open to both foreign and Belgian citizens, whether employee or company key individuals (except for researchers what regards the latter).
  * Required minimum gross annual taxable income of EUR 75,000 (not applicable to researchers).
  * Precondition of lack of submission to Belgian income tax in the 60 months preceding the start of professional activities in Belgium (whether as resident or as non-resident).
  * Precondition of previous place of residence more than 150 kilometres away from the Belgian border.
  * Possibility for the employer/company to pay up to a maximum 30% of gross annual taxable income as tax-free expense reimbursement (a payment that comes on top of the gross salary). This amount is exempt from both social security contributions and income tax.
  * Limitation of the 30% lump sum tax-free expense reimbursement to EUR 90,000 _per_ _annum_.
  * Possibility for the employer/company to reimburse on top of the lump sum 30% specific other expenses, such as moving expenses, (very) moderate installation costs, and school fees.
  * New regime is individual centric, not company centric (i.e. it can be continued with another employer in Belgium, provided all conditions are still met).
  * Formal request to be made by the employer/company and by the employee/company key individual within three months from the arrival in Belgium.
  * Entry into force: 1 January 2022.
  * Expats who were less than five years under the old special tax regime on 31 December 2021 may (under certain conditions) still opt-in in the new regime (with an overall time limitation of eight years) or choose to stay in the old regime until 31 December 2023 (provided they continue to meet all required conditions).
  * Fading out of (transitory measures) of the old regime on 31 December 2023.


### Company cars
The private use of a company car is considered a taxable benefit in kind but is exempted from employee social security charges.
The yearly benefit in kind on which the employee or company director is taxed is equal to 6/7 of the catalogue value of the car (to be understood as the list price of the car for a sale to an individual when it was new, including options and the actually paid VAT, but excluding any discounts and rebates) multiplied by a percentage linked to the car’s CO2 emission rate (the 'taxable percentage'). In addition, the benefit in kind takes into account the age of the car, by multiplying the catalogue value with a percentage in function of the age of the car (based on the first registration of the car). The base taxable percentage to apply to the catalogue value of the car is 5.5% for a diesel car with a CO2 emission rate of 65 g/km and for a petrol car with a CO2 emission rate of 78 g/km (figure for income year 2024 - assessment year 2025). This base taxable percentage of 5.5% is then increased/decreased by 0.1% for each CO2 gram/km above or below the CO2 reference emission threshold (with a minimum percentage of 4% and a maximum percentage of 18%). In no circumstance can the benefit in kind be lower than EUR 1,600 per year (amount for income year 2024).
The following formula will be applied to determine the taxable benefit in kind (figures 2023):
  * Diesel cars: [(5.5% + (CO2 emissions of the car - 65)) * 0.1 %] * catalogue value * age % * 6/7 (minimum 4% and maximum 18% of the catalogue value)
  * Petrol, LPG, and natural gas cars: [(5.5% + (CO2 emissions of the car - 78)) * 0.1 %] * catalogue value * age % * 6/7 (minimum 4% and maximum 18% of the catalogue value)
  * Electric cars: Catalogue value * 4% * 6/7


The list of the so-called 'false hybrid cars' is updated annually. This has an impact on the determination of the taxable benefit in kind for the beneficiary and on the corporate tax deductibility. 
#### Mobility budget
Since 1 March 2019, the government has introduced a mobility budget in order to stimulate employees that have a company car to opt for different means of transportation. If offered by the employer, the mobility budget gives the employee the opportunity to change one's car in exchange for a budget based on the total cost of ownership of the car handed in. With this budget, the employee can choose a less polluting car, sustainable means of transportation, and/or a cash payment. The mobility budget is subject to a favourable tax and social security regime that differentiates depending on the options chosen by the employee. 
## Equity compensation
### Stock options accepted in writing within 60 days of the offer date
Stock options accepted in writing within 60 days of the offer date are taxed to the beneficiary on the 60th day following the offer date. The taxable basis of a stock option listed on a stock exchange is determined as the closing market price of the day preceding the offer date of the option.
The taxable basis of a stock option accepted in writing within 60 days and not listed on a stock exchange is the sum of
  * The 'taxable time value': 18% of the stock fair market value at the time of the offer for options that have a life of five years maximum. For options that have a life of more than five years, the value will be increased by 1% for each year or part of a year in addition to the five years. Under certain conditions, the above-mentioned percentages are reduced by 50%. No social security contribution is due on the taxable time value of the stock option.
  * The 'taxable intrinsic value': The positive difference between the fair market value of the stock at offer date and the exercise price, after deduction of possible applicable Belgian employee’s social security contributions.


### Stock options accepted in writing after the 60th day following the offer and stock options that have not been formally accepted
Stock options accepted in writing after the 60th day following the offer date and stock options that have not been accepted in writing are taxable at exercise. The taxable basis for such options consists of the positive difference between the fair market value of the underlying shares at exercise and the exercise price paid, after deduction of possibly applicable Belgian employee’s social security contribution.
Please note that a reporting and withholding obligation is now applicable in any case to Belgian companies when benefits (in cash or in kind) are granted directly by a foreign affiliated company to employees/company directors working for the benefit of the Belgian entity. In practice, this means that the Belgian company must report on the employee's salary slips/summary statements all benefits granted by a foreign-related company even if there is no recharge of the costs and no intervention of the Belgian employer. The reporting obligation is applicable since 1 January 2019. The withholding obligation is applicable since 1 March 2019.
## Business income
Profits from a business or profession also include capital gains on the sale of business assets, although a favourable tax treatment applies if these assets have been held for more than five years. Self-employed expatriates do not qualify for the special tax regime described above.
## Capital gains
### Real estate
Capital gains realised in the scope of a professional activity are taxed at the normal progressive rates. Capital gains realised outside the scope of normal management of one's private estate is taxed at 33% plus communal tax.
In case the sale occurs outside the scope of a professional activity, but inside the normal management of one's private estate, the capital gain can be taxable depending on the length of the investment. A difference is made whether it concerns a residence or land.
#### Residence
Capital gains realised on the sale of the primary residence are not taxed provided that the taxpayer has actually occupied the residence continuously for at least 12 months. At least six months of this must fall within the 12-month period before the sale of the residence.
In case the building is not the primary residence and the sale occurs within five years following the acquisition of the building, the capital gain will be taxed at 16.5% to be increased with communal tax.
#### Land
Capital gains realised on land are potentially taxable depending on the duration of the ownership:
  * Less than five years: 33% to be increased with communal tax.
  * More than five but less than eight years: 16.5% to be increased with communal tax.
  * Eight years or more: Tax exempt.


#### Taxable basis
The taxable basis is the difference between the sales value and the purchase value. A lump sum amount of purchase cost equal to 25% of the purchase price is taken into account (unless one can prove that one incurred more costs) as well as the costs of any renovation work carried out by a registered contractor. Finally, the purchase value is also increased by 5% for each full year that has passed between the purchase and the sale. Costs incurred during the sale are, in principle, deductible to determine the sale price.
#### Exemptions
Several exemptions exist:
  * Capital gains realised on inherited real estate are exempt from income tax. In case the sale value exceeds the amount mentioned in the inheritance tax return, the difference will be subject to additional succession tax in case the sale occurs within two years following the filing of the inheritance tax return.
  * Capital gains realised in the scope of expropriation are exempted from income tax.
  * Capital gains realised on real estate owner by minors, the mentally disabled, and the legally incompetent are exempted from income tax.


### Assets other than real estate
Capital gains are not taxable to individuals in Belgium, provided they are realised within the framework of the normal management of the individual's private estate. Capital gain taxes for private individuals are levied only on sales to a foreign (non-EEA) company of substantial holdings in a Belgian company and on sales of property in certain circumstances.
Capital gains and foreign-source investment income cashed outside the country are not taxable for non-residents working in Belgium.
Since 1 January 2017, all stock exchange transactions are subject to a stock exchange tax. _See Stock exchange tax in the section for more information_.
## Dividend income
Since 1 January 2017, dividends paid or attributed via a Belgian financial institution are subject to withholding tax (WHT) at a flat rate of 30% (15% is also applicable on dividends in some restrictive cases). The first EUR 1,020 (income year 2024) are exempted from tax.
## Interest income
Since 1 January 2017, the WHT rate on most movable income, such as interest, is fixed at 30%.
The first EUR 1,020 (income year 2024) of interest on a savings account is exempted from taxation (limit applicable to each taxpayer in case of a joined account). Interest from saving accounts exceeding that threshold remains taxable at 15%.
## Rental income
Owners occupying residential houses are taxed on the notional rental income. Properties rented out are taxed on the notional rental income or on the net rental income received (after deducting lump-sum rental expenses). Non-resident expatriates are liable to tax on Belgian real estate.
## Cayman tax
The ‘Cayman tax’ is a tax charge on certain income from certain legal constructions (which are deemed to be transparent) in the hands of Belgian individuals (and Belgian entities subject to legal entities tax).
The legal constructions include, among others, foreign trusts, foundations, undertakings for collective investments or pension funds when not publicly offered, low-taxed or non-taxed entities, etc. to which the Belgian individual (or Belgian entity subject to legal entities tax) is, in one way or another, linked as a founder, effective beneficiary, potential beneficiary, etc.
Under these provisions, the income of certain legal constructions becomes taxable in the hands of the private individual before distribution of the income. Consequently, the owner may be taxed on income that one has not yet received.
The taxpayer has to mention on one's yearly tax return the existence of a legal construction (including additional information) of which one (or one's spouse or one's children) is the founder or the third beneficiary.

## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 28 August 2024
The Program Act of 10 August 2015 has introduced a new tax deduction for individual taxpayers (both residents and non-residents) who acquire new shares in a starting small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) even when the investment is made via a recognised crowdfunding platform or via a recognised starters’ fund. This tax deduction amounts to 30% (45% if it concerns micro-companies) of the qualifying amount (which is limited per taxable period) and is only granted if several conditions are met regarding shares, time of acquisition of these shares, and enterprise, in which the taxpayer invests. The tax deduction can be cancelled retroactively in the case where the taxpayer does not meet a four-year holding period. This is applicable to shares issued as of 1 July 2015.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 28 August 2024
Residents of Belgium are those who have established their domicile or, if they do not have a domicile in Belgium, their centre of economic interests in Belgium. Persons deemed to be residents of Belgium are those who have registered in the population register of a commune in Belgium. The fiscal residence of married couples and legal cohabitants is determined by the place where the family is located.
In civil law, domicile is essentially the same as residence in income tax law; the term is generally used when considering liability to inheritance tax.
Generally, an international assignee is considered to be a Belgian resident if:
  * as a married person (or legal cohabitant), they are accompanied by their family to Belgium, or
  * as a single person, they establish their permanent home and centre of economic interests in Belgium.

## Social security contributions
The employee's share of social security taxes is 13.07% of the total gross compensation, with no cap.
The employer's share currently varies around 27%. 
Social security taxes are deductible in determining taxable income. For foreign employees with short-term assignments in Belgium who continue to be subject to the social security schemes of their home country, an exemption from social security may be granted, depending on the home country of the claimant.
As an example, foreign employees who are transferred to Belgium by a United States (US) employer for a period not exceeding five years and who remain covered by the US social security scheme, the Belgium/US social security agreement provides for full exemption from Belgian social security taxes.
### Special social security contribution
A special social security contribution is also due, the amount varying between EUR 9.30 and EUR 60.94 per month. This contribution is collected by means of monthly deductions from net salary, although the final amount due will be determined through the tax return process on the basis of actual net taxable family income.
The special social security contribution is not tax deductible. The maximum amount due by a family on a yearly basis amounts to EUR 731.28.

## Net wealth/worth taxes 
Since March 2018 and until 30 September 2019, there was a 0.15% tax due on securities accounts that reached or exceeded EUR 500,000 (per account holder). In October 2019, the Belgian Constitutional Court issued a decision annulling this tax on securities accounts, with effect as of 1 October 2019. 
A solidarity tax of 0.15% is now applicable on securities accounts that reach or exceed EUR 1 million.
## Inheritance and gift taxes
Inheritance tax is paid by heirs or legatees on the net amount inherited by each recipient from the estate of any deceased person who is considered to be a resident of Belgium. Since 2018, the family home is not subject to tax when inherited by a direct-line heir, spouse, or cohabitant (applicable to all regions).
A special form of inheritance tax arises on the death of a Belgian non-resident who leaves property in Belgium. Tax is chargeable on the gross value of the property instead of on the net amount inherited by each recipient, at standard rates of inheritance tax. Inheritance tax rules differ depending on the region where the deceased had fiscal residence.
In principle, a gift must be made by way of a Belgian notary deed. As all notarial deeds are required to be registered, Belgian gift taxes becomes due. Manual gifts and indirect gifts are exempt from Belgian gift taxes.
Gift tax rates vary based on the region where the gift is registered. In the Flemish and Brussels capital regions, registered gifts of movables are taxed at a reduced flat registration rate of:
  * 3% for gifts between spouses, children, grandchildren, parents, grandparents, and cohabiters, or
  * 7% for gifts between other individuals.


According to Article 7 of the inheritance taxation codes (IHTC) of each region, gifts made no more than three years prior to the death of the donor and that were not subject to Belgian gift taxes are deemed added to the estate of the donor and are subject to inheritance taxes. Such gifts must be reported in the inheritance tax return at the value that the donated assets have at the time of death.
The inheritance tax law has recently been deeply reformed at the federal level, and the new rules have entered into force on 1 September 2018. As a result, important changes in the regional inheritance taxes have been implemented and specific advice is highly recommended in this respect.
## Property taxes
Local property tax is assessed on 'cadastral income', i.e. the deemed rental value attributed to the property by the authorities. Rates generally range between 20% and 50% of the 'indexed cadastral income'.
Resident taxpayers who own real estate abroad must report their foreign property in their Belgian tax return. Since 2021, they must submit a declaration to the Administration of Measurement and Valuations, which will determine the deemed rental value of the foreign real estate.
## Stock exchange tax
The stock exchange tax is a flat-rate tax that is due on transactions (i.e. purchases and sales) of stocks and bonds as well as on redemptions of capitalisation shares of collective investment vehicles that are executed by Belgian residents through Belgian or non-Belgian financial intermediaries. The tax rates vary from 0.12% to 1.32% depending on the type of transaction. The tax is automatically withheld at source in case the transaction occurs through a Belgian financial institution. Otherwise, in case the foreign bank does not comply with its withholding and reporting obligation, it is the beneficiary's responsibility to report the transaction and pay the tax.
## Other non-income taxes
### Registration duties
Purchases and transfers of real estate located in Belgium, including buildings (except new buildings, which are subject to VAT as described above), are subject to registration duty at the rate of 12.5% of the higher of transfer price or fair market value in the Walloon and Brussels Regions. In the Flemish Region, the applicable rate is 10%. Since income year 2017, the Brussels Region has introduced an exemption of registration duties for the first EUR 175,000 provided several strict conditions are met.
In case the purchase or transfer of land is subject to VAT, no registration duties will be charged on this purchase or transfer.
In principle, no registration duty is due upon a capital contribution; only a fixed fee of EUR 50 is due.
### Stamp duties
Stamp duties are due on transactions relating to public funds that are concluded or executed in Belgium, irrespective of their (Belgian or foreign) origin, to the extent that a professional intermediary intervenes in these transactions. Exemptions for non-residents and others are available.
