# Belgium
## Overview
Last reviewed - 28 August 2024
Belgium lies in the heart of the largest industrialised trading bloc in the world, the European Union (EU), and has existed as an independent kingdom since 1830. It is a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy, with King Philippe I reigning as the sovereign as of 21 July 2013. Belgium has a population of about 11 million people and three official languages: Dutch, French, and German. The currency of Belgium is the euro (EUR).
Belgium is divided into three regions, which are each responsible for the management of their own territory:
  * The Flemish region (Dutch speaking) forms the northern part of Belgium, in which three seaports are located: Antwerp, Ghent, and Zeebrugge.
  * The Brussels region (bilingual French/Dutch) is situated in the middle of Belgium (approximately 1 million inhabitants). The city of Brussels is the capital of Belgium, the capital of the European Union, seat of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), and host to numerous headquarters of other international organisations.
  * The Walloon region (French speaking) is situated in the south of Belgium; Li√®ge and Charleroi are its major cities.


Belgium is at the very top of the European hit parade when it comes to the best locations for research and development (R&D), industry, and logistics. It has a modern, private-enterprise economy that has capitalised on its central geographic location, highly developed transport network, diversified industrial and commercial base, and its highly educated inhabitants.
Industry is concentrated mainly in the populous Flemish area in the north, and much of Belgium's trade is with other EU countries. It has a relatively equal income distribution, and its gross domestic product (GDP) was EUR 584.7 billion in 2023. 
As home to several EU institutions, Belgium is where all important European political decisions are made and is, accordingly, host to international organisations like NATO, the European Defence Agency (EDA), the European Environmental Bureau (EEB), and the World Customs Organisation (WCO). Owing to its central location, Belgium has become a melting pot of different cultures and economic and technological activities.
PwC Belgium's multi-disciplinary teams bring together global industry scope and experience as well as comprehensive knowledge of Belgium in terms of local issues and regulations. PwC is one of the leading tax service providers in Belgium.
