## Foreign tax relief
A credit for foreign tax paid by a Slovak tax resident on foreign-source income taxable in the Slovak Republic is available in cases where the DTT concluded between the Slovak Republic and the foreign country states so. The credit of foreign tax can be applied up to the amount of tax that would be payable on that income in the Slovak Republic. If the DTT requires the exemption method to avoid double taxation, this method has to be applied. The taxpayer can also opt, based on Slovak law, to use the exemption method of foreign-source employment income if this method is more favourable for the taxpayer.
If the Slovak Republic has no DTT concluded with a foreign country, the employment income from foreign-source that was taxed abroad can be exempt from taxation in the Slovak Republic.
## Tax treaties
_See the_ _section in the Corporate tax summary for a list of countries with which Slovakia has a DTT_.

Within 2023, some amendments on the taxation of the natural persons were adopted:
  * From 1 August 2023, the controlled foreign company (CFC) rules for natural persons, which were introduced from 1 January 2023, are cancelled. Under the transitional provisions, the related tax liability incurred under the CFC rules effective till 31 July 2023 ceases on 1 August 2023. If the tax is already paid, it is treated as a tax overpayment.


Note that the tax legislation in the Slovak Republic (Slovakia) is subject to frequent amendments and new official interpretations; consequently, it is advisable to contact PwC Slovakia for up-to-date information.

## Taxable period
The tax year corresponds to the calendar year for individuals.
## Tax returns
If annual taxable income exceeds half of 21 times the minimum subsistence amount announced on 1 January each year (i.e. EUR 2,876.90 for 2025), a tax return must be filed by 31 March following the calendar year-end, unless all of the taxpayer's taxable income has been taxed through a Slovak payroll or through WHT, and, in the case of payroll, the individual has obtained a year-end tax reconciliation from one's employer.
A taxpayer can extend the deadline for filing and payment of the tax return. The deadline can be extended up to three months upon notification and up to six months if the individual has income from foreign sources.
Husbands and wives must file separate income tax returns.
## Payment of tax
Income tax is withheld monthly at source from employment income for employees of a Slovak company or branch, for most employees of a foreign company assigned to work in a Slovak branch or PE of that foreign company, as well as for most employees assigned to work in a Slovak company.
Individuals who are Slovak tax residents or Slovak tax non-residents who intend to be present in Slovakia for more than 183 days and receive employment income from abroad for work carried out in Slovakia must calculate and pay monthly tax advances on this income if this income is not being taxed through a Slovak payroll.
For non-employment income that is not liable to Slovak WHT, individuals are responsible for making advance tax payments on the basis of their previous year's tax liability.
## Electronic communication obligations
As of 1 July 2018, all entrepreneurs and their representatives are obligated to deliver all communication with the Financial Administration electronically only.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Employment expenses
No deductions are available from income from employment, except for statutory health and social insurance contributions. Sums received by way of reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with employment are exempt from tax, provided they do not exceed the statutory limits and are not aimed for private use.
## Deduction from certain income from capital
An annual deduction of up to EUR 500 is available from certain types of income from capital, including gains on the sale of shares, and rental income from real estate.
## Personal allowances
The personal allowance of 21 times the minimum subsistence amount announced on 1 January each year is available to all individuals whose annual tax base does not exceed a certain limit. If the tax base of a taxpayer exceeds a certain limit, the personal allowance is reduced to nil progressively, based on a formula.
For 2025, the personal allowance is set at EUR 5,753.79 based on the minimum subsistence amount valid on 1 January 2025. Individuals whose tax base for 2025 is higher than EUR 25.426.27 cannot apply the entire non-taxable personal allowance. Their personal allowance is reduced to nil progressively, based on a formula, so that those with an annual tax base equal to or higher than EUR 48,441,43 in 2025 are not entitled to any personal allowance.
A dependent spouse allowance of up to 19.2 times the minimum subsistence amount can also be claimed in 2025 by Slovak tax residents with permanent residence in Slovakia, provided the spouse does not have income in excess of the allowance amount (i.e. EUR 5,260.61 in 2024). The amount of the spouse allowance depends on the level of the individual’s and spouse’s 2025 incomes and is based on a formula. However, if the individual's tax base is equal to or higher than EUR 48,441,43in 2025, the individual will not be entitled to any spouse allowance. A Slovak tax non-resident can claim the spouse allowance only if 90% of one’s worldwide income is from Slovak sources.
Personal and dependent spouse allowance can decrease only the income from employment, business, or other self-employment.
The spouse allowance is applied only if the spouse is living with the taxpayer in the common household and is taking care of a dependent child, receives a cash allowance for nursing, is registered with an employment centre and is actively seeking a job, is considered a disabled individual, or is a severely disabled individual.
## Business deductions
Private entrepreneurs may deduct ordinary business expenses incurred to maintain, secure, and generate business income, provided they keep accounts recording their income and costs. For rental income, the costs should be recorded in the sequential order.
As an alternative, an entrepreneur (apart from a person having just rental income) who is not a Slovak VAT payer can opt to deduct lump-sum expenses of 60% (up to yearly amount of EUR 20,000) of income in order to determine the taxable income. In this case, actual business expenses or rental costs are not tax deductible.
## Tax bonus for young people on mortgage interest paid
Individuals between 18 and 35 may deduct 50% of the interest paid on mortgage during five years, up to EUR 1,200 annually. Interest bonus is claimed by individuals whose average monthly income is up to 1.6 times the average monthly salary of employees in the economy.

## Employment income
Taxable remuneration from employment includes all remuneration, whether monetary or non-monetary, including in-kind benefits provided to an employee. Statutory health insurance and social security contributions paid by the employee reduce taxable income. Obligatory employer’s health insurance and social security contributions paid by the employer are not part of the employee’s taxable income.
Employers must keep Slovak payroll records for employees and members of their statutory bodies.
### Taxable benefit of employer-provided car
The taxable benefit for a car provided by the employer is 1% of the car’s purchase price for each calendar month or partial month during which the car is available for business and private use. Fuel costs paid by the employer for an employee’s private use are also a taxable benefit, as is the reimbursement of travel expenses in excess of statutory limits.
Computation of benefit-in-kind resulting from the use of a company car for business and private purposes should reflect the period of using the car. An employee's income for every calendar month (that is even started) of using the car for business and private purposes will include 1% of the employer's car acquisition price (including VAT) in the first year of putting the car into use. In the next seven calendar years, the employer's car acquisition price (including VAT) should be annually decreased by 12.5% as of the first day of each calendar year for this purpose.
### Provision of meals to employees and tax on employment income
The tax-free amount related to the provision of meals to employees has been changed. As of 1 September 2024, only the employer’s contribution of up to 55% of the value of the meal allowance provided for a business trip lasting 5 to 12 hours, i.e. currently up to EUR 4.57, will be exempt from the employees’ employment income tax, regardless of the form in which the meal is provided.
This means that regardless of whether an employer provides meals via its own canteen, in a canteen of another employer, via a third person, a meal voucher, or a financial meal allowance, the amount of the employer’s meal allowance exceeding EUR 4.57 will be the employee’s taxable income, except for the part of the allowance provided from the employer’s social fund.
## Capital gains
There is no separate capital gains tax in the Slovak Republic. Gain on the sale of non-business property is exempt from taxation if the individual owned property for minimum of five years or has used the property for non-business purposes for longer than five years.
Capital gains enter into the individual’s tax base and are subject to income tax.
Capital gains from the sale of shares listed on a recognised stock exchange are exempt from tax if held for more than one year. Further, income from special saving schemes are also exempt from tax if participation lasts for at least 15 years and certain other conditions are met.
## Dividend income
The recently approved amendment of the ITA changed taxation of dividend income in Slovakia. Dividend income from profits arising from 2004 to 2016 is not subject to Slovak tax (subject to anti avoidance provisions). However, the dividend income from profits arising from 1 January 2017 and later years will be subject to a 7% tax rate (WHT applies if paid from a Slovak company). The same 7% tax rate will also apply to dividend income arising from profits before 2004.
Dividend income from profits arising in 2024 will be subject to 10% tax rate (WHT applies if paid from a Slovak company). Dividend income from profits arising from 1 January 2025 will be subject to 7% tax rate (WHT applies if paid from a Slovak company).
## Investment income
Taxable investment income includes interest and other yields from securities, interest, winnings, income from savings on deposit accounts, yields from supplementary pension insurance, and yields from life insurance after passing a certain age. Some of these types of income are subject to WHT, unless they are received from abroad, in which case they are treated as part of the tax base. The WHT may be reduced under DTTs for individuals who are not Slovak tax residents. Income from bonds arising to a foreign taxpayer is not subject to taxation in Slovakia.

## Social security contributions
Slovak and European Union (EU) nationals working in Slovakia, as well as other employees of Slovak companies, must contribute to the Slovak statutory social security and health insurance schemes, unless they have an exemption to this under EU rules (e.g. they contribute in their home state and have issued a form E101/PD A1) or under a social security treaty between Slovakia and the country in which they pay contributions.
As of 1 January 2018, employee’s social security contributions total 9.4% of remuneration; however, due to caps on the amounts on which these contributions are levied, the total contribution does not exceed EUR 1,478.62 per month in 2025.
The employee’s health insurance contributions total 4% of remuneration; however, as of 1 January 2017, caps on amounts on which these contributions are levied were abolished and the health insurance contributions are levied from the total remuneration of the employee.
Employer’s social security contributions total 24.4% of remuneration; however, due to caps on the amounts on which these contributions are levied, the total contribution does not exceed EUR 3,838.12per month in 2025, plus they pay injury insurance contributions of 0.8% of employees' total salary costs per month, which are not capped.
The employer’s health insurance contributions total 11% of remuneration; however, as of 1 January 2017, caps on amounts on which these contributions are levied were abolished and the health insurance contributions are levied from the total employee’s remuneration.
The regular monthly contributions to the health insurance system are treated as advance payments for the yearly liability and are subject to an annual reconciliation of health insurance contributions. Reconciliations are performed by a health insurance company.
Note that non-cash benefits and income from the sale of shares are subject to health insurance contributions. Dividend income received from profits arising from 2012 until 2016 is subject to health insurance contributions at a rate of 14%, up to 60-times the average monthly salary from two years prior (i.e. EUR 51,480). The recent amendment of the Income Tax Act (ITA) abolishes the 14% statutory health insurance contribution from dividends received from profits arising from 1 January 2017 or later years.
