## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Based on the amendment of the Income tax Act (ITA), valid as of 18 April 2023, the withholding taxation of interest and other income from the commercial corporate bonds issued by Slovak issuers has been abolished. Interest and other income from the commercial corporate bonds were subject to the Slovak withholding tax (WHT) from 1 January 2023 to 17 April 2023. 
European Union (EU) Directive on a global minimum level of taxation was transposed to the Slovak legislation in 2023. According to the adopted legislation, Slovakia has introduced only the qualified domestic minimum top-up tax (QDMTT), applicable form 1 January 2024. For more details please refer to EU Directive on a global minimum tax
Additionally, the spin-off concept has been introduced into the Slovak commercial law along with the relevant tax provisions. The relevant legislative provisions took effect from 1 March 2024. Generally, the tax rules for spin-offs follows the already existing tax rules for mergers and demergers, i.e. the transaction should be done at fair market value in most cases.
Note that the tax legislation in the Slovak Republic (Slovakia) is subject to frequent amendments and new official interpretations; consequently, it is advisable to contact PwC Slovakia for up-to-date information.
As of 1 January, 2025 a new consolidation package will come to effect bringing significant changes to CIT, VAT rates. A new financial transactions tax (FTT) and tax on sweetened soft drinks (Sugar tax) are introduced from 1 January 2025. Please see more information in the relevant sections.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Taxable period
The standard fiscal year is a calendar year, but a Slovak entity may opt to change this to a different 12-month period.
## Tax returns
A corporate tax return must be filed together with the entity’s financial statements within three months following the fiscal year-end. The taxpayer may extend the filing deadline by up to three months or six months (in case foreign income is included in the tax return). To extend the filing deadline, the taxpayer must notify the Tax Office before the normal filing deadline. After notification, the deadline is automatically extended.
## Payment of tax
The balance of tax due for a fiscal year is payable by the filing deadline.
Advance payments of corporate tax must be paid monthly or quarterly during the current tax period. Instalments are usually based on the last known tax liability of the entity. It is not necessary to pay tax advances if the last tax liability did not exceed EUR 2,500.
As of 1 January 2020, companies are required to pay tax advances only if their last tax liability exceeds EUR 5,000.
Starting from 1 January 2022, the tax administrator will notify a taxpayer who submitted a tax return of the amount and the due date for payment of the income tax advance no later than five days before its due date.
As of 1 January 2022, the tax reliability index is introduced, which represents the evaluation of a taxpayer regarding their ability to fulfil certain tax responsibilities towards the tax administrator. The taxpayer considered as reliable shall have specific tax benefits.
### Penalties
The penalties levied by the Tax Office will depend on the time elapsed from the deadline for filing the regular tax return to the date of filing the amended tax return or the start of the tax audit. As the interest rate of the European Bank is changed from 18 December 2024, the tax penalties are changed accordingly:
  * From 4.25% to 3.15% a year for self-assessment via an amended tax return.
  * From 8.5% to 7% a year for self-assessment within 15 days after notification that a tax audit has been opened (‘self-disclosure’).
  * From 12.75% to 10% a year for an assessment made by the Tax Office during a tax audit.


The penalties will be levied at a minimum of 1% of the assessed amount and a maximum of 100% of the assessed amount.
An ‘aggregated penalty’ applies for cases of more than one administrative offence.
## Electronic communication obligations
As of 1 January 2018, all legal entities registered in the Commercial Register are required to deliver submissions to the Financial Administration electronically only.
## Tax audit process
Generally, the tax authority selects the taxpayers subject to tax audit based on certain criteria that are not communicated to the public.
The taxpayers that utilise state aid in the form of tax relief are subject to specific tax audit in the year of utilisation of the tax relief.
The tax audit has to be finalised within one year.
## Statute of limitations
A tax may not normally be assessed or additionally assessed more than five years (ten years when DTT treaty was applied, including transactions with foreign-related parties) after the end of the year during which the obligation to file a tax return arose, or during which the taxpayer was obligated to pay the tax. If a tax inspection is undertaken within this five-year period, another five-year period commences from the end of the year in which the taxpayer was notified of this action.
However, tax may be assessed, or additionally assessed, no later than ten years after the end of the year during which the obligation to file a tax return arose, or during which the taxpayer was obligated to pay the tax.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The tax authorities, within a tax inspection, generally focus on transfer pricing, VAT, limited tax deductibility of special types of costs (e.g. entertainment, promotion costs), and tax incentives.


# Slovak Republic
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
A company is a tax resident in the Slovak Republic if it:
  * has its registered seat in the Slovak Republic
  * has its effective place of management in the Slovak Republic, where the key management decisions are made or accepted, or
  * is not considered a tax resident in another contractual country according to the respective DTT.


## Permanent establishment (PE)
A PE is created if:
  * a foreign entrepreneur uses, either continually or repeatedly, a permanent place or facility for carrying out its business activities in Slovakia
  * a foreign entrepreneur repeatedly mediates transportation and accommodation services, including via a digital platform
  * an individual acting on behalf and in the name of a foreign entrepreneur repeatedly mediates or plays a leading role in concluding contracts or negotiating contract details, or
  * the period of providing services by the foreign entrepreneur or by individuals working for this foreign entrepreneur in Slovakia is longer than 6 months in any consecutive 12-month period.


The conditions for creating a PE may be regulated in more detail by a DTT.
A PE need not be entered in the Slovak Commercial Register, but a foreign entrepreneur with a Slovak PE is taxable in Slovakia. A foreign entrepreneur with a Slovak PE has the same tax registration, filing, payment, and tax advance payment obligations as a Slovak company. The tax base of a PE may not be less than one that which would have been achieved if similar activities under similar conditions were performed as an independent entity (e.g. a Slovak company).


# Slovak Republic
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Depreciation and amortisation
Tangible fixed assets (acquisition value over EUR 1,700) are classified into seven tax depreciation groups to which different depreciation periods apply. The possibility to use accelerated tax depreciation methods is limited to assets belonging to the tax depreciation groups 2 and 3.
Depreciation group |  Assets |  Depreciation (years)  
---|---|---  
0 |  Battery-electric cars or plug-in hybrid personal cars, bicycles and scooters with an auxiliary electric motor |  2  
1 |  Motor vehicles, office machines and computers, tools and implements, trolleybuses, electric buses |  4  
2 |  Combustion engines, outboard engines, most production line equipment, furniture |  6  
3 |  Electric motors, turbines, air-conditioning systems |  8  
4 |  Buildings made of metal, ships, railway locomotives |  12  
5 |  Buildings not involved in depreciation group no. 6 and engineer‘s sites not included in other depreciation groups |  20  
6 |  Administrative and residential buildings, hotels and buildings for culture, education, health, and public entertainment |  40  
Taxpayers do not have to depreciate an asset every year. Tax depreciation may be interrupted in any year and continued in a later year without a loss of the total tax depreciation available.
A lessee can depreciate a tangible fixed asset held under a financial lease. The tax depreciation base equals the acquisition value of the leased asset without VAT and financing costs plus expenses related to acquisition of the leased asset that the lessee incurred before the asset was put into use. The assets acquired under finance lease shall be amortised proportionally or using an accelerated method.
The value to be used as the basis for tax depreciation depends on how the asset is acquired and is usually based on one of the following:
  * Acquisition costs (i.e. the price for which the asset was acquired).
  * The taxpayer’s own costs incurred, if the asset is acquired or produced internally.
  * Intangibles (acquisition value of EUR 2,400 or more) and low value assets (acquisition value of EUR 1,700 or less) are amortised for tax purposes in line with their accounting amortisation (i.e. over the useful life of the asset).


## Goodwill
Amortisation of purchased goodwill, including the goodwill on purchase of a business as a going concern, if it represents an identifiable intangible asset, is tax deductible over up to seven consecutive tax years.
For goodwill created at the contribution of business as a going concern or goodwill created at a merger, the tax deductibility of the goodwill depends on the method of tax treatment of this reorganisation. In general, if the reorganisation is performed for tax purposes at fair market values, the goodwill created will be tax deductible.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses are tax deductible in the period when incurred.
## Interest expenses
In general, interest expenses incurred in order to generate taxable income can be treated as tax deductible, subject to thin capitalisation rules (_see Thin capitalisation in the_ _section_).
Interest on loans for the acquisition of shares is tax deductible only in the period of their sale and if the income from this sale is not tax exempt.
## Bad debt provisions
Provisions for unsecured receivables from loans created by banks, and bad debts of regular commercial companies, are fully tax deductible (subject to certain conditions) once the debt has been overdue for more than 1,080 days (20% of the bad debt is tax deductible when it has been overdue for more than 360 days, and 50% after 720 days), provided certain conditions are met. Provisions for bad debts in other circumstances can also be tax deductible if specific conditions are met (e.g. bad debts registered in bankruptcy proceedings).
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions are treated as gifts, which are not tax deductible.
## Pension expenses
Contributions to supplementary pension savings made by the Slovak employer on behalf of the employee, up to 6% of the gross salary of the employee participating in these plans, are tax deductible.
## Fines and penalties
In general, penalties and fines are not tax deductible. Contractual fines and late payment interest are tax deductible upon the payment.
## Allowance for students
Subject to specific conditions, taxpayers may deduct from their tax base a special allowance with respect to practical education provided to students of up to EUR 3,200 per student per year.
## Transporting employees to place of work
The employer’s expenses incurred on transporting employees to their place of work and back are tax deductible under the following conditions:
  * Public transport is either verifiably not carried out at all or not in the extent as the employer needs.
  * The employer uses a contract carrier or its own means of collective transport for 10+ persons for this purpose.


## Taxes
Road tax, real estate tax, financial transaction tax and most other such taxes are tax deductible. Social security contributions paid by an employer with respect to employees are also tax deductible. VAT charged to profit and loss is tax deductible only if certain conditions are met.
## Other non-deductible expenses
Expenses are generally tax deductible if incurred to generate, secure, and maintain the entity’s taxable income. However, certain other costs are specifically not tax deductible. These include entertainment costs, various provisions (e.g. provisions to tangible and intangible assets, certain bad debt provisions), and various expenses in excess of statutory limits (e.g. employee travel expenses and meal allowances).
## Net operating losses
A company or a branch may currently carry forward and utilise:
  * tax losses reported for periods starting before 1 January 2020 equally over a period of four years following the year in which the loss arose (25% per year max), and
  * tax losses reported for periods starting from 1 January 2020 over five consecutive tax periods, up to 50% of the tax base declared in the respective tax period.


The new rules also apply to micro taxpayers (with taxable revenues up to EUR 100,000 (previously 60,000 EUR)) in respect of tax losses generated during tax periods since 1 January 2021, where the above-mentioned 50% limitation would not apply.
For issues related to the interim provision regarding tax losses carried forward from years 2010 to 2013, please contact the local PwC Tax office.
Carryback of losses is not available in the Slovak Republic.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Generally, deductions may be claimed for royalties, management service fees, and interest charges paid to foreign affiliates, provided such amounts are at arm’s length and subject to other limitations by the law (e.g. thin capitalisation rules).
## Hybrid mismatches
As of 1 January 2020, the anti-hybrid rules apply in Slovakia in respect of situations arising between a corporate taxpayer and its related parties (e.g. between a taxpayer and a subsidiary abroad, between the PEs of a taxpayer). Hybrid mismatches also apply to unrelated parties that create a structured arrangement (i.e. an agreement that includes a hybrid mismatch).
According to the Slovak ITA, the following situations are qualified as a hybrid mismatch:
  * Mismatch leading to deduction without taxation of income (deduction without inclusion) due to:
    * Different treatment of financial instrument.
    * Different treatment of hybrid entity’s income taxation.
    * Different approach to allocation of taxable income between PE and its HQ, or between different PEs of the sale HQ.
    * Different approach to allocation of taxable income between PE and its HQ due to different approach to PE recognition.
    * Payment performed by hybrid subject.
    * Deemed payment between HQ and its PE or between different PE of the same HQ.
    * Multiple deduction of costs without a corresponding inclusion of the multiple corresponding income.


  * Incorporated mismatch where expense is used (directly/indirectly) to finance the expense that leads to a mismatch as defined above.


Application of new rules would limit tax deductibility of expenses related to hybrid mismatches (subject to certain exemption).


# Slovak Republic
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
There is no concept of group CIT in the Slovak Republic. Each company in a group is taxed individually.
## Transfer pricing
Under the transfer pricing rules, prices in transactions between a Slovak company and its related parties should be at arm’s length, which means the prices should be at rates similar to those that would be charged between unrelated parties for the same or similar transactions under comparable conditions.
Starting from 1 January 2023 transactions must follow transfer pricing rules when exceeding EUR 10,000 and in the case of financial transactions when principal exceeds EUR 50,000. Also possibility to use the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines was directly included to the law..
The transfer pricing documentation requirements also apply to domestic-related parties in addition to the rules for foreign-related parties. This means that the prices used between two Slovak related parties need to be set at an arm's-length basis for tax purposes. All provisions of the law on methods of determining such prices for the purpose of adjusting the tax base and the obligation to keep associated transfer pricing documentation also apply to domestic-related parties.
If transactions between the related parties are not made at arm’s length, and this results in a reduction in the Slovak entity’s corporate tax base, then the tax authorities can adjust the corporate tax base to that which it would have been if arm’s-length prices had been used.
Based on the amendment of the ITA as of 1 January 2017, Slovak tax residents can request approval of an advance pricing agreement (APA) by the tax authorities. The amendment also sets fees for such APA approval in an amount of EUR 10,000 for unilateral APA approval and EUR 30,000 for multilateral APA approval (approval based on application of DTT).
In some cases, doubled penalties can be imposed for transfer pricing adjustments made by the Slovak tax authorities as a result of a tax audit initiated after 1 January 2017.
### Transfer pricing documentation
All Slovak taxpayers must keep sufficient transfer pricing documentation to justify prices charged by or to their foreign-related parties. The Slovak Ministry of Finance has issued a guideline setting out detailed requirements for transfer pricing documentation (the Guideline).
The EU code of conduct was not formally implemented. However, the Guideline requires maintaining transfer pricing documentation in a form generally in line with the EU standards.
Slovak tax inspectors may require transfer pricing documentation. The deadline to provide transfer pricing documentation for taxpayers is 15 days, and the tax authority may request transfer pricing documentation without the formal opening of a tax audit. Without such documentation, transfer pricing adjustments (increased tax base) are much more likely to be imposed.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
An amendment to the Act on International Cooperation in Tax Administration valid from 1 March 2017 introduced CbC reporting based on the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) plan with an aim to introduce automatic exchange of tax information between countries.
If consolidated revenues for a multinational enterprise (MNE) group of entities are higher than EUR 750 million for the immediately preceding financial year, the group is required to file CbC reporting.
The amendment defines parent entity, substitute parent entity, and principal entity. In most cases, the parent entity is obligated to file CbC reporting in the country in which it is the tax resident.
If a Slovak tax resident is not considered to be a parent entity, a substitute entity, or a principal entity (i.e. the entity that is required to file CbC reporting), it must announce to the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic the business name, address, identification number, and country of tax residence of the reporting entity by the filing due date of its income tax return. This notification requirement should already apply to the 2016 tax period.
The concept of a secondary obligation has also been introduced, which delegates the obligation to submit the CbC report to a surrogate parent entity or to another basic entity of the MNE if the parent or surrogate parent entity that is not the Slovak company does not prepare and submit the CbC report in the country of its tax residence. Therefore, Slovak tax residents may also be required to prepare a CbC report.
For the accounting periods starting from 22 June 2024, the Slovak companies that are members of the MNE groups will have to disclose information about the CIT paid in the jurisdictions of the group’s presence. Generally, Slovak legislation regarding this disclosure is in line with the relevant EU Directive. The Slovak company may not be required to prepare the report but must provide reference to the report prepared and published by another group’s member. As required by the EU Directive, the report will be publicly available.
## Thin capitalisation and interest limitation rule
The limit for the maximum amount of tax-deductible interest and related fees on credits and loans between related parties is established as 25% of the adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA), i.e. the sum of:
  * accounting profit before tax
  * depreciation and amortisation, and
  * interest expenses included in the accounting profit before tax.


From 1 January 2024, additional interest limitation rules will apply, though only to the contracts and amendments to the already existing contracts concluded after 31 December 2023.
A taxpayer first checks if the interest expenses fall under the interest limitation rules; if not, the ’already in place‘ thin capitalisation rules should be checked. The main features of the Slovak interest limitation rules are generally in line with the ATAD:
  * The Slovak company should compare its net interest expenses with the EUR 3 million threshold. Net interest expenses are calculated as a difference of interest income and interest expenses.
  * If the amount of the net interest is below the 3 million threshold, the already-in-place thin capitalisation rules are checked.
  * If not, then the amount of the net interest expenses exceeding 30% of the sum of the tax base, net interest expenses, and tax depreciation cannot be deducted.
  * Non-deducted interest can be carried forward and deducted within the next five years, still subject to the above limit check.


The law provides examples of the interest income and interest expenses to be used for the net interest calculation. However, as the list includes other similar payments equivalent to interest, there could be some uncertainty about the net interest expense calculation in some cases.
Banks and insurance companies are not subject to the interest limitation rules and not subject to the thin capitalisation rules.
## Controlled foreign corporations (CFCs)
The rules for CFCs seek to tax income artificially diverted by a Slovak parent company to a CFC if the income is paid without economic justification or to obtain a tax advantage for the Slovak company.
A company is considered a CFC if:
  * it is controlled or managed, directly or indirectly, by the Slovak company (e.g. by voting rights, share capital, or share in profit), and
  * the CIT paid in another country is lower than 50% of the tax the CFC would pay in Slovakia.


If income is diverted to a PE, it will only be sufficient (for purposes of the CFC assessment) to fulfil the second condition (i.e. the condition regarding the hypothetical Slovak tax).
The CFC’s income will be taxed in Slovakia by including the CFC’s tax base in the tax base of the Slovak parent company to the extent it is attributable to the assets/risks related to the significant functions of the Slovak company, which manages and controls the CFC.
To avoid double taxation, the Slovak parent company will be able to factor in the tax paid by the CFC abroad when calculating/paying tax in Slovakia.
The application of adjustments to the CFC tax base in line with transfer pricing rules will take precedence over the application of CFC rules for the taxation of profits.
The CFC rules apply for tax periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019.
As part of the Slovak financial administration activities against tax evasion, the CFC rules will be extended to natural persons. Based on these, individuals who are Slovak tax residents will be taxable on income attributable to them from their foreign company or an entity controlled by them, provided the CFC’s income has not been taxed abroad at the minimum level of the effective tax rate or the CFC is established in a non-cooperative jurisdiction.
The attributable income will be taxed at 25% or 35% at the moment of the right to a claim (i.e. without the need for its actual payment). The amendment provides for exceptions where this procedure will not apply.
## Treatment of inter-company items
Dividends are not treated as taxable (subject to anti-avoidance provisions) if they are paid out of the profit after tax earned in the years 2004 to 2016. _For tax treatment of dividends paid out from profits realised before 2004 and from 2017 onwards, please see Dividend income in the_ _section_.
In general, royalties, commissions, and other payments paid to foreign-related parties are tax deductible, provided they are incurred for genuine business reasons and the charges are in line with transfer pricing rules.


# Slovak Republic
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
A foreign company may trade through a Slovak branch, which must be registered in the Slovak Commercial Register. The taxable income of the branch must not be lower than that which an independent entity (e.g. a Slovak company) would achieve from carrying out similar activities under similar conditions. If the branch’s taxable income cannot be assessed based on its income less costs, as adjusted for tax purposes, certain other methods may be used. A taxpayer may ask the tax authorities in writing to approve such a method.


# Slovak Republic
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
There are several types of investment incentives potentially available, including corporate tax credits, discounts on the price of publicly owned real estate, and financial support for creating jobs or for the acquisition of long-term assets. All of these are treated as state aid.
Various conditions must be met in order for a company to qualify for state aid. These include a minimum amount of investment in fixed assets, where the amount depends mainly on the type of project and where it is located, or a minimum number of newly created jobs.
## Investment incentives
Investment incentives (including tax credits) are potentially available for projects in the following areas:
  * Industry.
  * Technology centres.
  * Shared services centres.
  * Tourism.


The granting of a tax relief is subject to approval of the Slovak authorities. If certain conditions are met, a taxpayer may apply tax relief in the ten subsequent years following the tax period in which the relief was granted.
### Investment deduction
As of 1 January 2022, taxpayers are eligible to apply a newly introduced additional investment deduction, according to which taxpayers may deduct the determined percentage of expense from depreciation from the investment, the amount of which depends on the planned percentage of reinvestment of the average value of investments and the value of reinvestment of this planned average value of investments stipulated in the investment plan as stated in the table below:
Re-invested average value of investments | Investment deduction based on the value of the planned amount of reinvestment of the average value of investments  
---|---  
EUR 1 million to EUR 20 million | More than EUR 20 million to EUR 50 million | More than EUR 50 million  
700% to 1,399.99% | 15% | 25% | 50%  
1,400% or more | 20% | 30% | 55%  
The investment deduction shall be applied to the investments put into use during the investment plan and can be applied within the depreciation period of the assets up to a maximum of ten consecutive tax periods following the tax period in which the assets were put into use.
The new investment deduction aims to support higher added-value investments linked to Industry 4.0. An investment means, for example, an investment in a manufacturing and logistics system consisting of mechanisms, machines, ancillary devices, automation and communication technology, including software for managing the manufacturing and logistics process, able to exchange, process, and archive digitised data in real time to optimise this process.
## Research and development (R&D) super deduction
Taxpayers who perform R&D activities may apply for a special form of support, the super-deduction of R&D costs. The total of the following items may be deducted from the tax base adjusted by the tax loss deduction:
  * 100% of R&D costs incurred in the taxable period for which the tax return is filed.
  * 100% of positive difference between the average of the total R&D costs incurred:
    * in the taxable period for which the taxpayer applies super-deduction, and in the immediately preceding taxable period, and
    * in the two immediately preceding taxable periods.


According to the amendments to the Slovak ITA valid from 1 January 2020, the total of the following items may be deducted from the tax base adjusted by the tax loss deduction:
  * For the financial year starting on or after 1 January 2019: 150% of R&D costs incurred in the taxable period for which the tax return is filed.
  * For financial years starting on or after 1 January 2020: 200% of R&D costs incurred in the taxable period for which the tax return is filed. 
  * For financial years starting on or after 1 January 2022: 100% of R&D costs incurred in the taxable period for which the tax return is filed.


If a tax loss is recorded or if the tax base after the tax loss deduction is lower than the available deduction, the deduction may be applied in the next taxable period in which the taxpayer reports a positive tax base; however, this may not exceed five taxable periods immediately following the period in which the entitlement to make a deduction arose.
## Tax exemption for intangible assets (Patent box)
The amendment of ITA valid since 1 January 2018 introduced a tax exemption of 50% for income from considerations for granting a right to use, or for using, a protected patent, utility model, or software created by the taxpayer (basic patent box). Tax exemption refers only to assets created by own activities and applies to tax periods in which amortisation of an intangible asset is included in tax expenses.
A similar exemption also applies to a certain part of income from selling goods that were manufactured on the basis of a protected patent or a utility model (extended patent box). Tax exemption accounts for 50% of income attributed to the sales price, less related costs and less profit margin.
If intangible research results acquired from another person are used to develop intangible assets, the tax exemption is reduced by a coefficient.
Entities applying this tax exemption are entered in a public register kept by the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic.
## Foreign tax credit
Foreign tax credits are available if allotted under an applicable DTT.


# Slovak Republic
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Mainly, the following payments are subject to WHT when made by Slovak companies to foreign parties. Dividends are also subject to tax, effective as of 1 January 2017 (subject to specific rules - if paid to private individuals). However, a DTT may reduce or eliminate the rate.
Payments | WHT (%)  
---|---  
Fees for services | 19/35  
Royalties * | 19/35  
Interest on loans and deposits * | 19/35  
Dividends ** | 7/10/19/35  
* Royalties and interest paid to related EU-resident companies are not subject to WHT if certain conditions are met.
** Dividends paid out of profits arising from 2004 to 2016 are not subject to Slovak WHT (subject to anti-avoidance provisions). _Please see Dividend income in the Corporate_ _and Individual sections_.
A 35% WHT rate applies on payments to taxpayers from non-cooperative jurisdictions (i.e. where no DTT or TIEA exists, the taxpayer is from a jurisdiction that is listed in the EU's List of Non-Cooperating Countries or a state that does not apply CIT, or a zero CIT rate applies) or where the beneficial owners of the income cannot be identified.
Service fees may be subject to tax in Slovakia only if the service is provided in the territory of Slovakia or if paid for by a Slovak tax resident.
WHT should be paid to the Tax Office no later than 15 days from the end of the calendar month following that in which the payment was made. The withholding obligation lies with the Slovak resident taxpayer. The taxpayer must also notify the tax administrator of the tax withheld and transferred. If the tax is not properly withheld, the unpaid tax becomes the Slovak tax resident’s tax liability, and a penalty may be assessed.
This table highlights countries with which Slovakia has entered into a DTT.

# Slovak Republic
## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Business combinations
The amendments to the Commercial Code from November 2017 have strengthened the legal and administrative requirements for carrying out mergers, fusions, and demergers of commercial companies (e.g. new obligation to submit a draft contract for a merger or demerger project to the tax authorities no later than 60 days before the date on which these transactions are to be approved by the company bodies).
In 2018, in-kind contributions, mergers, fusions, and demergers of commercial companies may only be performed for tax purposes in most cases at fair (market) values. Under this method, the taxpayer should value assets for tax purposes using their current market values, and the revaluation difference must be reflected in the appropriate company’s tax returns within seven years of the transaction.
The historical price method may only be applied for mergers, fusions, and demergers of commercial companies, in-kind contributions, or cross-border transactions if certain conditions are met.
With effect from 1 March 2024, a new Act on Conversions of Companies and Co-operatives (the ’Conversion Act‘) has been approved. The Conversion Act introduces the spin-off concept to the commercial and tax law. A spin-off is a transaction where the company being split up does not cease to exist, but an appropriately specified part of its capital is transferred to one or more successors.
Overall, for tax purposes, spin-offs are treated in the same way as mergers and demergers, i.e. fair market value should apply to the spun-off assets. In some exceptional cases the historical prices can be used.
## Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
Slovakia has adopted most of the principles of IFRS in its accounting law. However, there are still some differences between IFRS and Slovak accounting standards.
### Obligation to prepare statutory financial statements according to IFRS
Financial institutions (banks, insurance companies, etc.) must prepare their statutory financial statements according to IFRS. In addition, a company that fulfils two or more of the following conditions, in two consecutive accounting periods, may opt to prepare its statutory financial statements according to IFRS:
  * The total value of assets is more than EUR 170 million.
  * Net turnover exceeds EUR 170 million.
  * The average number of employees in the individual accounting period exceeds 2,000.


An entity may decide to prepare its financial statements under IFRS if certain conditions are met.
If the Slovak taxpayer is obligated to prepare its financial statements under IFRS, the tax base is derived from either:
  * the profit before tax under IFRS, adjusted for tax purposes using the 'IFRS Tax Bridge' issued by the Slovak Ministry of Finance, or
  * the profit before tax under Slovak statutory accounting standards.

## International agreements
The Slovak/United States (US) Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) entered into force during 2015. However, financial institutions in the Slovak Republic were allowed to register on the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) registration website consistent with the treatment of having an IGA in effect even earlier.
FATCA was implemented into Slovak legislation with effect from 1 January 2016, with a first reporting deadline of 30 June 2016.
The Common Reporting Standard (CRS) was also implemented into Slovak legislation with effect from 1 January 2016, and the first reporting deadline to the Slovak tax authorities was 30 June 2017.
## EU Mandatory Disclosure Rules (DAC6)
Slovakia has implemented provisions of the EU Directive 2011/16/EU on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation (DAC6) into its local law, imposing reporting obligation on intermediaries or clients (in case intermediaries are subject to professional privilege) in respect to the cross-border reportable arrangement (i.e. arrangements involving more than one member state or a member state and a third country).
The cross-border arrangement is to be reportable, provided at least one of the hallmarks (generic or specific) from the list set by the act is met. Some of the hallmarks are also subject to the main benefit test (i.e. where tax benefit was the main or one of the main aims of cross-border arrangement).
The specific conditions set by the law should be checked on a case-by-case basis to confirm the related reporting obligations.
## EU Directive on a global minimum tax - Pillar II
European Union (EU) Directive on a global minimum level of taxation (so called Pillar II initiative of OECD) was transposed to the Slovak legislation in the end of 2023. According to the approved adopted legislation (The Law on minimum Slovak top-up tax for multinational enterprise groups and large-scale domestic groups „The Top-up Tax Act”), effective from 1 January 2024
Given the specific position of the Slovak Republic, where only a very low number of parent entities are headquartered, the option to suspend the IIR and UTPR rules was utilised. On the other hand, considering the higher number of subsidiary entities that are Slovak tax residents, the Top-up Tax Act introduces a qualified domestic minimum top-up tax (QDMTT) to prevent the taxation of these entities abroad due to the application of mandatory IIR/UTPR rules by parent or other entities headquartered abroad.
The Top-up Tax Act will apply to those Slovak entities, including Slovak permanent establishments of non-resident taxpayers, that are part of a multinational group of enterprises or a large-scale domestic group (hereinafter referred to as the “group”), if the consolidated annual revenues of this group, as reported by the ultimate parent entity (hereinafter referred to as the “parent entity”) in its consolidated financial statements, reach at least 750 million euros in at least two of the four fiscal periods preceding the analysed fiscal period.
Under the Top-up Tax Act Slovakia imposes a top-up tax on Slovak entities falling within the scope of law if their income has been taxed below the effective tax rate of 15%.
The top-up tax is based on three fundamental elements: the calculation of qualifying income (or qualifying loss), the calculation of adjusted covered taxes, and the calculation of the effective tax rate. The Top-up Tax Act generally follows the Directive.
The basic rule for calculating the effective tax rate and the top-up tax is that it will be calculated collectively for all constituent entities of the group located in the Slovak Republic.
### Exceptions
The law also prescribes some exceptions to the calculation of the top-up tax. For instance, the filing entity may decide that the top-up tax for the relevant accounting period is zero. This applies in cases where the average revenues of all constituent entities in the jurisdiction are less than 10 million EUR and the average income (profit) or loss of all constituent entities is less than 1 million EUR.
Under the Top-up tax Tax Act it is possible to reduce the net qualifying income by the amount of excluded income based on economic substance, which equals the sum of excluded payroll costs and the sum of excluded tangible assets.
In the first year of the Top-up Tax Act’s application, constituent entities can reduce their net qualifying income by up to 9.8% of recognised payroll costs for recognised employees and by 7.8% of the book value of recognized tangible assets located in the Slovak Republic. The percentages will decrease each year until 2033, when they will reach a final level of 5% and 5% respectively.
### Tax administration
The Slovak entities falling under the Top-up Tax Act will submit a tax return for the top-up tax and a notification containing the information required by law for determination of this tax within 15 months after the end of the relevant tax period.
The tax period of the top-up tax is the accounting period for which the main ultimate parent entity of a multinational group of enterprises or a large-scale national group of enterprises prepares consolidated financial statements.
It is not possible to extend the deadline for submitting a notification to determine the top-up tax and the deadline for submitting a tax return, nor to excuse its omission. If the tax subject fails to submit a tax return or tax notification within the prescribed period, the tax administrator will impose a fine of between EUR 1,500 and EUR 50,000, even repeatedly. 
The right to impose the top-up tax and the right to enforce the collection of tax arrears expire after the lapse of four tax periods immediately following the tax period in which the top-up tax was due.
In case that the tax period is a transitional year (it is the first accounting period in which a multinational group of companies or a large-scale domestic group falls within the scope of this law), the deadline for filing is extended by three calendar months. This means that the first reporting obligations, calculating and remitting the top-up tax will need to be completed by June 30, 2026, for the year 2024. 


# Slovak Republic
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
The tax base is generally the accounting result as determined under Slovak statutory accounting rules, adjusted for tax purposes.
## Inventory valuation
Stock (i.e. inventory) is valuated at cost. Slovak legislation specifically provides for the use of the arithmetical average cost and first in first out (FIFO) methods to value stock. Last in first out (LIFO) may not be used. The tax treatment follows the accounting treatment.
## Capital gains
Capital gains from the disposal of assets are included in the CIT base. The tax treatment of capital losses depends on the type of asset on which they arose.
Capital gains on the alienation of shares and participation interest in Slovak companies may be taxed in Slovakia, predominately if sold to a buyer who is a Slovak tax resident or has a PE to which the purchase is attributable.
The income from the sale of shares or participation interest of a company where the value of immovable property is more than 50% of the equity has its source in Slovakia.
However, as of 1 January 2018, income from the sale of shares in joint-stock companies, ownership interests in limited liability companies, or limited partnerships (hereafter ‘participation’) may be exempt from CIT if certain conditions are met. These conditions include the possession of at least 10% of shares or ownership interests for at least 24 months (counting from 1 January 2018 at the earliest).
A taxpayer who performs substantial functions in Slovakia, bears and manages the risks associated with the participation ownership, and has adequate personnel resources and material equipment to perform these functions may apply the tax exemption. However, the tax exemption does not apply to taxpayers who trade in securities, to the sale of companies in liquidation, bankruptcy, or restructuring, or to taxpayers in liquidation.
## Exit tax
The exit tax applies to income in situations where taxpayers (Slovak tax residents and non-residents with a PE in Slovakia) transfer outside of Slovakia:
  * individual property (transfer carried out by a tax resident from their headquarters in Slovakia to a PE in another country or by a tax non-resident from their PE in Slovakia to their headquarters of PE in another country)
  * business activities (transfer carried out by a tax resident to another country or by a tax non-resident from their PE in Slovakia to another country), or
  * tax residence (tax resident is no longer Slovak tax resident).


The tax is calculated by applying a 21% tax rate to a specific positive tax base, which is determined as follows:
  * When transferring individual property, its fair (market) price at the time of exit will be considered as income and its tax value will be regarded as an expense.
  * When transferring business activities, its fair (market) price of transferred asset and liabilities at the time of exit will be considered as income and the specific tax base will be calculated in the same way as when selling a business, or part thereof.


The exit tax must either be paid in one instalment in the period for filing the tax return or, upon request, in five annual instalments if it is a transfer to an EU or European Economic Area (EEA) member state. When paying the tax in instalments, the taxpayer must also pay interest on outstanding instalments.
The regulation on the exit tax also addresses the valuation of assets and liabilities for Slovak tax purposes where a Slovak tax non-resident becomes a tax resident in Slovakia.
## Dividend income
Dividends paid to legal entities from the profits generated after 1 January 2004 are not subject to Slovak income tax, except for dividends:
  * from the profits generated after 1 January 2017 and paid to legal entities that are residents of non-cooperative jurisdictions from a Slovak tax resident company, which are subject to WHT of 35%
  * from the profits generated after 1 January 2017 and received by a Slovak tax resident company from residents of non-cooperative jurisdictions, which are subject to tax of 35%
  * paid to legal entities and the taxpayer cannot provide evidence of the beneficial owner of dividends, which are subject to WHT of 35%, and
  * received by a general partnership or a limited partnership, subsequently 'paid' to its partners of a non-cooperative jurisdictions, which are subject to WHT of 35%.


Dividends paid to entities from profits generated until 31 December 2003 and:
  * paid out from a Slovak tax resident company to a Slovak non-resident company will be subject to WHT of 19% (no taxation if subject to EU Parent/Subsidiary Directive exemption), and
  * received by a Slovak company from foreign sources will be subject to taxation in Slovakia (no taxation if subject to EU Parent/Subsidiary Directive exemption).


## Interest and royalty income
Slovak-source interest income earned by taxpayers with limited, as well as unlimited, tax liability is subject to withholding at a flat tax rate of 19% (for states without a DTT / from non-cooperative jurisdictions,  _please refer to the_ _Withholding taxes_ _section_), except where the recipient of the deposit interest or the yield is a Slovak investment fund, Slovak supplementary pension fund, Slovak bank or the branch of a foreign bank, or the Slovak Export-Import Bank.
Slovak-source royalty income of tax non-residents is subject to the 19% corporate flat tax rate (for states without a DTT / from non-cooperative jurisdictions, _please refer to the_ _Withholding taxes_ _section_).
Interest and royalty income is exempt if it is paid by a Slovak payer to a recipient who is a tax resident in the European Union and is a beneficial owner of this income, provided that for 24 months before the payment:
  * the payer owns at least a 25% direct shareholding of the recipient of the income
  * the recipient owns at least a 25% direct shareholding of the payer of the income, or
  * a third entity resident in the European Union owns at least a 25% direct shareholding in both the payer and the recipient of the income.


## Unrealised foreign exchange gains/losses
The taxpayer may decide whether to include unrealised foreign exchange differences relating to unsettled payables and receivables in the tax base in the tax period when they are accounted for or in the tax period when they are realised. However, the decision to include/stop including these differences when they are realised must be made on the CIT return.
## Foreign income
Companies resident in the Slovak Republic are taxed on their worldwide income, including income of its foreign branches. A Slovak tax resident entity is able to deduct from its tax base a tax loss made by its taxable PE (e.g. branch) outside the Slovak Republic, adjusted for Slovak tax purposes.
Credit relief is available for foreign tax paid under most of Slovakia’s DTTs. Alternatively, exemption of foreign income taxed abroad from taxation in Slovakia may apply.
Slovakia does not have provisions related to deferral.
## Reverse-hybrid mismatches
In relation to the implementation of Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 as regards hybrid mismatches with third countries (ATAD 2), a provision concerning the taxation of a reverse-hybrid entity has been added to the ITA.
The purpose is to prevent non-taxation of income (revenues) achieved by 'transparent companies' (e.g. a general and a limited partnership) domiciled in the Slovak Republic where the partner of such a company is a person or entity from the state who considers the Slovak company to be a taxable entity, i.e. the income is neither taxed as being that of a Slovak company nor as being that of a foreign partner.
This means that the income (revenue) of Slovak transparent entities attributable to its foreign shareholders with at least 50% of the share capital, voting rights, or profit of this company may be taxed, provided certain conditions are met, as being that of a Slovak company. The provision will not, however, apply to a collective investment vehicle that is widely held and is subject to investor-protection regulation in the Slovak Republic.
The provision became effective as of 1 January 2022 and applied for the first time in the tax period beginning from 1 January 2022.


# Slovak Republic
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
As a member state of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Slovak Republic’s (Slovakia's) system of corporate taxation generally follows OECD guidelines and principles.
The corporate income tax (CIT) applies to the profits generated by all companies, including branches of foreign companies.
Slovak tax residents are taxed on their worldwide income. Slovak tax residents may utilise a method of elimination of double taxation if their income is taxed abroad. The exemption or credit method can be used to eliminate the double taxation, depending on the relevant double tax treaty (DTT) and the type of income.
Slovak tax non-residents are taxable in Slovakia on their Slovak-source income only. Slovak-source income is defined by local tax law and includes,  _inter alia_ , the business income of permanent establishments (PEs) and passive types of income, such as royalties, interest, and income from disposal of assets.
The standard CIT rate for 2024 was 21%. The reduced CIT rate for 2024 at 15% is applicable for corporate taxpayers and entrepreneurs and self-employed individuals that achieve taxable income (revenues) up to 60,000 euros (EUR) (previously 49,790 EUR) for the relevant tax period.
From 1 January 2025 the following CIT rates applies to the taxpayers-legal entities:
  * A 10% CIT rate (instead of the previous 15%) to legal entities whose taxable income does not exceed EUR 100,000 in the tax period.
  * A 21% CIT rate to legal entities whose taxable income will be in the range from 100,000 EUR to 5,000,000 EUR.
  * And a 24% CIT rate to legal entities whose taxable income will exceeds 5,000,000 EUR.


Legal entities whose taxable income in the tax period exceeds EUR 5,000,000 will pay income tax at an increased tax rate of 24%.
Also legal entities are required to pay a minimum CIT, regardless of actual results. Annual minimum required CIT amount are prescribed as follows:
  * 340 EUR for legal entities with taxable income up to 50,000 EUR;
  * 940 EUR for legal entities with taxable income from 50,000 EUR to 250,000 EUR;
  * 1,920 EUR for legal entities with taxable income from 250,000 EUR to 500,000 EUR;
  * 3,840 EUR for legal entities with taxable income exceeding 500,00 EUR.


Entrepreneurs and self-employed individuals, who achieve taxable income (revenues) up to 100,000 euros (EUR) (previously 60,000 euros (EUR)) will keep the 15% tax rate for 2025.
A 10% WHT rate, which applies to certain taxable dividend payments to individuals from 1 January 2025 reduced to the previously applicable 7% WHT rate.
Further, some income, such as interest or royalties, may be subject to a 19% WHT rate. A specific 35% WHT rate applies for payments to taxpayers from non-cooperative jurisdictions (i.e. where no DTT or tax information exchange agreement [TIEA] exists, the taxpayer is from a jurisdiction that is listed in the EU's List of Non-Cooperating Countries or a state that does not apply CIT, or a zero CIT rate applies) or where the beneficial owners of the income cannot be identified, including payments of taxable dividends.
## Local income taxes
Slovakia does not have local, state, or provincial CIT.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
From 1 January 2025 a basic VAT rate of 23% (previously 20%) applies to all taxable supplies, with certain exceptions. From January 1, 2025, two reduced tax rates of 19% (instead of 10%) and 5% apply (this reduced rate does not change). At the same time, the list of goods and services to which reduced rates are applied is changing.
A general overview of the application of reduced rates is provided below:
**Current rate** |  **New rate**  
---|---  
Basic food |  10% |  5%  
Other food |  20% |  19%  
Electric energy |  20% |  19%  
Medicines |  10% |  5%  
Printed books, magazines |  10% |  5%  
Electronic books |  20% |  5%  
Medical devices |  10% |  5%  
Accommodation services |  10% |  5%  
Restaurant services - food |  10% |  5%  
Restaurant services - non-alcoholic beverages |  10% |  19%  
Restaurant services - alcoholic beverages |  20% |  23%  
Fitness centre - entrance fees |  10% |  5%  
Ski lifts, entrance fees to sports facilities and swimming pools |  10% |  23%  
Entrance fees to sports events |  20% |  5%  
Social enterprises |  10% |  5%  
Rental apartments |  5% |  5%  
From 1 January 2025 taxable persons established in Slovakia will become VAT payers if their annual turnover exceeds the threshold of EUR 50,000 in the current calendar year. The VAT registration is generally effective from the next calendar year, however if the annual turnover exceeds the threshold of EUR 62,500 the VAT registration is effective immediately. Voluntary registration is also possible. Upon VAT registration, all bank accounts used for business purposes related to Slovak VAT registration have to be announced to the Tax Office.
More taxable persons established in Slovakia (i.e. with a seat, place of business, or VAT establishment in Slovakia) can create a VAT group if certain conditions are met.
From 1 January 2025, foreign taxable persons (no seat or VAT establishment in Slovakia) will no longer be obliged to apply for VAT registration before commencing activities subject to Slovak VAT, but they will become a Slovak VAT-payer upon supply of the goods/services subject to the Slovak VAT (with some exemptions); receipt of the prepayment for the the goods/services subject to the Slovak VAT; receipt of the goods in Slovakia from other EU member state under certain conditions. Notification obligation will be introduced.
There is a list of supplies that foreign taxable persons can perform in Slovakia without a need to register for Slovak VAT, including mainly:
  * Supplies subject to VAT reverse-charge.
  * Supplies subject to triangulation simplification performed by the first customer in a chain.
  * Intra-Community supplies of imported goods if represented by a tax representative.
  * VAT-exempt transport and supplementary services related to export and import.
  * VAT-exempt supplies without credit entitlement.
  * Distance sales to non-taxable person using the One Stop Shop (OSS) scheme.


This list, among others, includes local supplies of goods and specific services to taxable persons established in Slovakia as such supplies are subject to local VAT reverse-charge mechanism (i.e. person liable to pay VAT on such supplies is the customer).
Foreign taxable persons registered for Slovak VAT are not entitled to deduct input VAT via Slovak VAT return if such input VAT relates only to supplies subject to VAT reverse-charge. Foreign companies can claim Slovak input VAT via the VAT refund procedure, provided they meet the stipulated conditions. If the foreign VAT payer that is entitled to a full VAT refund via a specific EU VAT refund application acquires goods in Slovakia from EU countries, its acquisition of goods in Slovakia from another member state is considered as VAT exempt.
Exempt supplies without credit entitlement include, among others, certain postal services, financial and insurance services, education, public radio and TV broadcasting services, health and social services, the transfer and leasing of real estate (with exceptions), and lottery services. There are also exempt taxable supplies with credit entitlement, for example financial and insurance services provided to the customer established outside of the European Union, supply of goods to other EU member states, certain import of goods, and export of goods and services.
A special regime for payment of VAT by a supplier based on receipt of payment for supplied goods or services (‘cash accounting’) is available in Slovakia in very specific cases. This regime postpones the obligation to pay VAT until the customer pays the supplier for the supply. This cash accounting scheme can only be used by Slovak-established entities (i.e. with a seat, place of business, or fixed establishment in Slovakia) provided they meet certain conditions.
Supplies of certain types of goods and services between two Slovak VAT payers are subject to local reverse-charge. Such supplies, among others, include supplies of real estate, metal waste and scrap metal, agricultural crops, iron and steel, mobile phones and integrated circuit devices, etc. Local reverse-charge also applies to supply of construction works, supply of building or parts of buildings under construction, and some supplies of goods with assembly and installation. For such supplies, the supplier will not charge VAT on the issued invoice and the recipient must apply a reverse-charge.
Under specific conditions, VAT payers (creditors) can decrease the tax base and VAT if customers (debtors) fail to pay fully or partially for domestic supplies and the receivable becomes irrecoverable.
Slovakia implemented EU quick fix rules into the Slovak legislation and new EU rules for taxation of cross-border business-to-consumer (B2C) supplies of goods (e-commerce) and introduced One Stop Shop (OSS) and Import One Stop Shop (IOSS) schemes.
Additionally, from 1 January 2025 the definition of the supply of goods related to leasing contracts, where the terms provide for the transfer of ownership of the leased goods to the lessee at the end of the lease period, is changed. The interpretation in line with the decision of the Court of Justice of EU C-164/16 Mercedes Benz will apply on contracts concluded after 31 December 2024. Based on the introduced amendments transfer of assets under the financial lease contracts could fall under the supply of goods (rather than under the supply of services), causing the immediate VAT liabilities arise from the total value of the asset in the period of the transfer.
## Customs duties
Goods imported from non-EU countries are subject to import customs clearance. Goods exported from the EU customs territory have to be declared for export customs clearance.
To communicate with the customs offices, each person must have an Economic Operator Registration and Identification Number (EORI), which is registered by the customs authorities on request. EORI registration is mandatory for customs clearance.
The European customs nomenclature and customs tariffs are set by EU legislation. Customs procedures are harmonised within the European Union.
## Excise taxes
Excise tax is charged on the release to tax-free circulation or import of tobacco products, wine, spirits, beer, mineral oil, electricity, coal, and natural gas. The excise tax rate depends on the customs classification of the product.
The excise duty administrator is the Customs Authority. Communication with the Customs Authority must be in electronic form if the company is a VAT payer registered in Slovakia or if it is represented by a tax adviser or attorney.
## Immovable property tax
Immovable property tax, which is divided into land tax, building tax, and tax on apartments, is governed by the Act on Local Taxes. Immovable property tax is calculated based on the area of the real estate, its location, and its type, as well as the tax rate of each self-governing region.
The immovable property tax rate may vary significantly. Please find below the spread of the tax charges per square metre.
Property |  Immovable property tax per square metre (EUR)  
---|---  
Four floor office building in center of city of Bratislava |  13.15*  
One floor hall rural area, approx. |  0.89 to 9.00  
* For each additional floor, add an additional tax of EUR 0.33.
Further, municipalities may opt to impose a local development levy that applies to real estate developments. If a municipality decides to impose the levy, its rate may be between EUR 3 and EUR 35 per square metre.
## Transfer taxes
There are no transfer taxes in the Slovak Republic.
## Stamp taxes
There are no stamp duties or similar taxes on share or other property transfers in the Slovak Republic, although small administrative fees are payable to register such transactions.
## Turnover taxes
There are no turnover taxes in the Slovak Republic.
## Payroll taxes
Taxable remuneration from employment includes all remuneration, whether monetary or non-monetary, including in-kind benefits provided to an employee. Statutory health insurance and social security contributions paid by the employee reduce taxable income. Obligatory employer’s health insurance and social security contributions paid by the employer are not part of the employee’s taxable income.
Employers must keep Slovak payroll records for employees and members of their statutory bodies.
The tax base up to EUR 48 441,43 €is taxed at 19%. The exceeding part of the tax base is taxed at 25%.
A tax rate of 7% or 35% applies to taxable dividend income (e.g. dividends from profits generated from 1 January 2017) of individuals starting from 1 January 2017. The higher tax rate applies in case of dividends received from non-treaty jurisdictions.
A tax rate of 10% applies to taxable dividend income from profits generated from 1 January 2024 – 31 December 2024. From 1 January 2025 a tax rate of 7% applies to taxable dividend income from profits generated from 1 January 2025.
Income of constitutional authorities from dependent activity is, in addition to the tax calculated as listed above, subject to a special tax rate of 5%.
## Social security contributions
Employer’s health insurance and social security contributions total 36.2% of employee remuneration. From 1 January 2025, the maximum assessment base for all types of social insurance was increased to EUR 15 730 (previously EUR 9,128) monthly. Health insurance assessment base is not capped. Employers also pay injury insurance contributions of 0.8% of employees' total salary costs per month, which are not capped.
The maximum assessment base for the purposes of health insurance is cancelled for all types of income, except dividend income. Dividend income paid out from the profit generated after 1 January 2017 is no longer subject to health insurance contributions. The rate of health insurance contributions for individuals who receive dividend income paid out from the profit generated before 31 December 2016 (except for dividends from listed shares) is 14% of the assessment base. In general, the payer of the dividend needs to withhold the health insurance contribution on the payment of the dividend.
## Special tax on regulated industries
There is a special tax from activities of entities in regulated industries (e.g. energy, insurance and re-insurance, public healthcare insurance, electronic communications, pharmaceuticals, postal services, railway transport, public water distribution and sewerage, air transport). In 2025 pharmacies that have received permission from the State Institute for Drug Control and companies that produce petroleum products will be added to the list of regulated persons. The tax is calculated as a multiple of the tax base, coefficient, and the tax rate. The liability to pay this special tax arises in case the accounting profit exceeds EUR 3 million.
The coefficient (maximum of 1) depends on the amount of income from the regulated activity. As of 1 January 2025, the monthly levy rate for the telecommunication services increases from 0.00363 to 0.01576. From 1 January 2040, it will again be reduced to 0.00363. For the petroleum industry the rate is established at 0.025.
## Special tax on banks
The special levy payable by certain financial institutions (bank levy) has been cancelled effective as of 1 January 2021.
From 1 January 2024 the special tax on banks is recovered. It applies to the banks and other institutions having license from the National bank of Slovakia or similar EU institution. The tax applicable to the banks is 0.025. This rate will gradually decrease and from the accounting period starting from 1 January 2028 it will constitute 0.00363.
## Insurance premium tax (IPT)
IPT of 8% applies to non-life insurance premiums in Slovakia and is payable by insurance companies.
## Motor vehicle tax
Vehicle tax applies to vehicles that are registered in the Slovak Republic and used for business purposes. The taxpayer is the entity that uses the vehicle for business purposes. The tax rate depends on engine capacity, vehicle size, etc. The motor vehicle tax is administrated by the Tax Office.
## Financial transaction tax
From 1 January 2025, a new Financial transaction tax is introduced. The first tax period will be April 2025.
Taxpayers will be individual entrepreneurs, legal entities, and branches of foreign entities that are clients of a payment service provider performing financial transactions. Exceptions include the Social Insurance Agency and budgetary organisations.
The law distinguishes between the taxable person and the person responsible for the tax collection and transfer to the budget. Payment service providers (banks and similar institutions) that have a registered office or branch in Slovakia will collect the tax from taxpayers and remit it to the tax administrator. If a Slovak entrepreneur is a client of a payment service provider seated outside Slovakia and with no branch here, the obligation to declare and pay this tax will be the responsibility of the respective entrepreneur. This obligation will still apply if the entrepreneur authorises another entity to perform the financial transaction. The law provides a rather extensive list of exceptions: e.g. payment of taxes, levies, and similar; purchase of government bonds; certain operations of a securities dealer related to the purchase of securities on behalf of a client, etc.
Subject of the tax: 1) Financial transactions resulting in debiting the entrepreneur’s bank account with a specific amount. 2) Use of a payment card issued to a business account. 3) Charged expense related to the performance of a financial transaction that applies to the entrepreneur’s activities carried out in Slovakia.
The basic tax rate is 0.4%, but a maximum of 40 euros from the tax base. The annual rate for a payment card is two euros.
The taxable period is a calendar month. The deadline for filing a tax return and paying the tax is the end of the calendar month immediately following the taxable period.
In addition to filing tax returns, detailed records for individual taxable periods should be kept to the extent necessary to determine the tax correctly.
## Tax on sweetened soft drinks (Sugar Tax) in Slovakia as of 2025
As of 1 January 2025, the final version of the Sugar Tax Act introduces a tax on selected packaged sweetened soft drinks and packaged concentrates containing added sugar or a sweetener. As regards taxation, the separate category of sweetened soft drinks (packaged drinks or packaged concentrates) with a precisely determined caffein content (more than 150 mg/l (caffeine sugar-sweetened soft drinks) has been modified.
The tax rate for caffeine sugar-sweetened soft drinks will be twice as high as for sweetened soft drinks with caffeine content below the above limit, i.e. €0.30/l for packaged soft drinks for direct consumption, and €2.10/l or €8.60/kg for packaged concentrates of these soft drinks.
The act also defines exemptions from taxation for packaged sweetened soft drinks that are initial baby food, follow-on baby food, food for special medical purposes, total food replacement for weight regulation, or packaged concentrates that are a medicine or a nutritional supplement.
