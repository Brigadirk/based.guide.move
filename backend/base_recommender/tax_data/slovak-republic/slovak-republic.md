# Slovak Republic
## Overview
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
The Slovak Republic (Slovakia) is a landlocked country in Central Europe. It is bordered by the Czech Republic and Austria to the west, Poland to the north, Ukraine to the east, and Hungary to the south. Its capital is Bratislava. The official language of the Slovak Republic is Slovak, and the currency is the euro (EUR).
Slovakia joined both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU) in the spring of 2004 and the Euro area on 1 January 2009. Slovakia has made significant economic reforms since its separation from the Czech Republic in 1993. Reforms to the taxation, healthcare, pension, and social welfare systems have helped Slovakia to consolidate its budget.
The 3Q 2024 gross domestic product (GDP) grew year-on-year by 1.2%. As of September 2024, the unemployment rate reported by the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic is 5.41%.
