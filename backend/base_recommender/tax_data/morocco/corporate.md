## Revision of value-added tax (VAT) rates
The 2024 Finance Act introduced a gradual convergence towards two VAT rates (10% and 20%) over the period 2024 through 2026, as follows:
VAT rate (%)  
---  
Fiscal year (FY)  
2023 | 2024 | 2025 | 2026  
Electricity | 14 | 16 | 18 | 20  
Electricity generated from renewable energies | 14 | 12 | 10 | -  
Urban transport operations and road transport of passengers and goods | 14 | 13 | 12 | 10  
Other passenger and freight transport operations | 14 | 16 | 18 | 20  
Services provided to insurance companies by direct marketers or insurance brokers | 14 | 12 | 10 | -  
Economic cars | 7 | 10 | - | -  
Water intended for public distribution networks, as well as sewerage services and water meter rental operations, other than those relating to water intended for domestic use. | 7 | 10 | 10 | 10  
Refined sugar | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10  
## VAT exemptions
Finance Law 2024 extended VAT exemption to certain basic consumer products as follows: 
  * Exemption, with right of deduction, on sales and deliveries of internal and imported pharmaceutical products.
  * Exemption, with right of deduction, on sales of water for domestic use, sanitation services provided by sanitation organisations, and water meter rental for the same purpose.
  * Exemption, without right of deduction, for school supplies, products, and raw materials used in their manufacture.
  * Import and domestic exemption, without right of deduction, for butter derived from animal milk, canned sardines, milk powder, and household soap.


## VAT withholding tax (WHT)
The 2024 Finance Act introduced a VAT WHT system applicable to two categories as follows:
### VAT-registered suppliers of equipment
WHT must be levied on VAT due on taxable transactions carried out by suppliers of equipment who fail to present a recent certificate of tax compliance (issued by tax authorities within the past six months).
Companies carrying out transactions outside the scope of VAT or exempt from VAT without the deduction right are not required to operate the WHT.
### VAT-registered service providers
75% of invoiced VAT in respect of the supply of services listed by regulation should be withheld by the following entities:
  * State, local, and regional authorities, public establishments and their subsidiaries, as well as other public bodies.


  * Entities governed by private law and individuals, whose income is determined according to the system of actual net income or simplified net income, who pay the remuneration for these services to taxable individuals who have presented a recent certificate of tax compliance. In the absence of such certificate, the WHT should be operated at up to 100% of the invoiced VAT.


The following operations are excluded from the VAT WHT:
  * Sales of electricity and water delivered to public distribution networks.
  * Sanitation services provided to subscribers by sanitation organisations, as well as the rental of water and electricity meters.
  * Sales and services provided by telecommunications operators.
  * Services provided by canvassers and insurance brokers.
  * Services worth up to 5,000 Moroccan dirhams (MAD), up to a maximum of MAD 50,000 per month per service provider.


## VAT on digital operations
Finance Law 2024 expanded the scope of VAT to cover digital operations.
Services supplied remotely by a non-resident person with no establishment in Morocco to:
  * a customer whose registered office, place of business, or tax domicile is in Morocco, or
  * an occasional resident customer


are now subject to VAT.
A service provided remotely in a dematerialised manner is every service rendered via a remote communication tool, including intangible and other immaterial goods.
## Revision of the corporate income tax (CIT) rates
The 2023 Finance Bill fixed the applicable CIT rates as follows:
  * 20% for companies with net tax income lower than MAD 100 million.
  * 35% for companies with net tax income equal to or higher than MAD 100 million (subject to some exceptions).


Still, the target rates of 20% and 35% rates will not be applicable until January 2026. As such, CIT rates will progressively evolve, from 2023 to 2026, as follows:
CIT rate (%)  
---  
Fiscal year (FY)  
2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 | 2026  
Evolution of the CIT rate for companies with net taxable income lower than MAD 300,000 | 10.00 | 12.50 | 15.00 | 17.50 | 20.00  
Evolution of the CIT rate for companies with net taxable income ranging from MAD 300,001 to MAD 1 million | 20.00 | 20.00 | 20.00 | 20.00 | 20.00  
Evolution of the CIT rate for companies with net taxable income higher than MAD 1 million and lower than MAD 100 million | 31.00 | 28.25 | 25.50 | 22.75 | 20.00  
Evolution of the CIT rate for companies with net taxable income of MAD 100 million or more | 31.00 | 32.00 | 33.00 | 34.00 | 35.00  
## Social solidarity contribution (SSC)
The 2023 Finance Act extended the application of the SSC for corporate profits and professional income for the years 2023, 2024, and 2025.
The contribution is calculated as follows:
  * For companies: Based on the same amount of net profit used for the calculation of CIT that is equal to or superior to MAD 1 million for the last closed fiscal year.
  * For individuals: Based on the net income made that is equal to or superior to MAD 1 million as of the last closed fiscal year. 


### SSC calculation method and applicable rates for companies
For companies, the SSC is calculated on the net taxable profit of the previous fiscal year according to the following proportional rates:
Net taxable income (MAD) | SSC rate (%)  
---|---  
Between 1 million and 5 million | 1.5  
Between 5 million and 10 million  | 2.5  
Between 10 million and 40 million | 3.5  
More than 40 million | 5.0  
Companies subject to SSC must submit a declaration, by electronic means, according to a model established by the administration within three months following the closing date of the last accounting period. They must pay the amount of the contribution at the same time as the declaration referred to above.
## WHT on dividends
The 2023 Finance Law introduced a reform on the WHT rate applicable to income from shares, units, and similar income that extends to 2026. Thus, the target rate of 10% will not be applicable until January 2026. As such, the WHT rate on dividends will progressively evolve, from 2023 to 2026.
The WHT rate applicable to dividends is the one corresponding to the year in which these products were distributed as follows:
Fiscal year | Applicable WHT rate (%)  
---|---  
2023 | 13.75  
2024 | 12.50  
2025 | 11.25  
2026 | 10.00

Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
## Taxable period
The taxable period corresponds to 12 months. The first taxable period can be less than one year but should never exceed it.
## Tax returns
CIT returns must be filed within three months following the closing of the fiscal year.
## Payment of tax
Payment of tax is made during the fiscal year by way of four instalments of 25% each based on the CIT of the previous year.
In case the CIT of the year exceeds the sum of the four instalments, the company should proceed to tax regularisation along with the submitting of the taxable income return after three months following the closing of the fiscal year (i.e. 31 March for fiscal year corresponding to the calendar year). Otherwise, the exceeding tax amount should be offset against the following instalments without limitations.
### Penalties
Finance Law 2016 provides for the application of the following rates for penalties and late payment interest:
In case of late tax return:
  * 5% penalty in case the tax return is submitted within 30 days following the legal deadline, or in case of corrective return. 
  * 15% penalty in case the tax return is submitted after the above mentioned 30 days. 
  * 20% penalty in case of automatic taxation due to non-submission of tax return. 


In case of late tax payment:
  * 5% penalty in case the tax payment is made within 30 days following the legal deadline. 
  * 10% penalty in case the tax is paid after the above mentioned 30 days. 
  * 20% penalty in case of non-payment or late payment of VAT and other WHTs. 
  * 5% interest related to the first month late tax payment and 0.5% interest for the following months. 


## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations runs until the end of the following fourth year. This period may be extended in case of deficits or credits.
## Topics of focus of tax authorities
The topics of focus of tax authorities depend on each specific situation (sector of activity, company size, etc.). However, it is very common to find the following points:
  * Transfer pricing. 
  * Tax treatment of provisions. 
  * Taxation of indemnities and benefits granted to employees.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
Companies, whether or not established in Morocco, are subject to CIT on all profits or income relating to property that they own, activities that they carry on, and profit-making transactions that they carry out in Morocco, even when these are of an occasional nature.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The notion of PE is not explicitly defined under Moroccan tax law.
However, the Moroccan tax authorities apply this concept for non-resident companies according to some determined criteria that are inspired from the various tax treaties that Morocco has signed with other countries.
Indeed, the question of whether an entity will be deemed to have a PE in Morocco is a question of fact, in particular, subject to having, in Morocco, any fixed place of business through which a foreign entity conducts industrial or commercial activity for an indefinite or substantial period of time.
The term fixed place of business includes, for instance, a place of management or operations, a branch, an agency, a premises used as a sales outlet, a construction of assembly project, or a purchasing office. Also, in some specific cases, a non-resident company may be deemed as having a PE if it operates in Morocco through a dependent agent.


# Morocco
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
## Depreciation
Fixed assets are normally depreciated according to their economic life duration according to the provision of the accounting regulation.
Depreciation is computed according to two methods: the straight-line method and the declining-balance method.
The tax regulation (through administrative guidelines) has provided indicative depreciation rates applicable when the company activity or the asset to be depreciated is specific or particular.
Indicative depreciation rates are as follows:
Asset | Depreciation rate (%)  
---|---  
Business premises and buildings | 4 to 5  
Light construction (metal frame construction) | 10  
Production equipment, tools, and construction fittings | 10 to 15  
Huge computer facilities | 10 to 20  
Computers and related items (printers) and programs, as well as vehicles (cars, trucks, vans, lifters) | 20 to 25  
Office furniture and software | 20  
Non-significant tools | 30  
## Goodwill
Under Moroccan tax law, goodwill cannot be subject to amortisation. However, a decrease of the value of goodwill is allowed to be recorded through provisions.
## Start-up expenses
The development as well as incorporation expenses shall be capitalised and depreciated for tax purposes over a period of five years.
The carryforward of any loss due to the above expenses is limited to a period of four years.
## Interest expenses
Interest on loans granted by direct shareholders is deductible if the capital is fully paid in. Also, the deductible interest is limited to (i) the portion of the loan that does not exceed the share capital equity and (ii) the interest rate provided, annually, by the Ministry of Finance (2.22% in 2018).
## Bad debt
Bad debts that are definitively non-recoverable (after all recovery procedures have been undertaken) are treated, from a tax point of view, as deductible losses.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions made by companies are deductible only if they are granted to foundations and societies explicitly provided by law.
The contributions made to the community enterprise are deductible at up to 0.2% of the company turnover.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are not tax deductible expenses if they relate to infringements to legal and regulatory dispositions.
However, expenses relating to late payment penalties (calculated in accordance with the provisions of the law) should be tax deductible.
## Taxes
Taxes constitute deductible expenses, except CIT itself and recoverable taxes.
## Net operating losses
Tax losses may be carried forward for a period of four years from the end of the loss-making accounting period. However, the portion of a loss that relates to depreciation may be carried forward indefinitely.
A carryback mechanism is not allowed under Moroccan law.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments to foreign affiliates are allowed under Moroccan law. However, such payments should respect the arm’s-length principle and foreign exchange regulations.


# Morocco
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
Under Moroccan law, consolidation or group taxation is not allowed.
## Transfer pricing
Morocco has a general provision within its tax legislation requiring transactions between related parties to be at arm’s length.
Where a Moroccan company is directly or indirectly connected with enterprises situated inside or outside Morocco, profits transferred indirectly to such enterprises, by means of increases or decreases in buying or selling prices or by any other means, must be included among taxable profits on the tax return.
In order to determine the amount to be included among taxable profits, Moroccan tax authorities will make comparisons with other similar companies carrying on normal business activities or by means of direct assessment based on information available to the tax authorities.
### Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
The Finance Act of 2020 has introduced CbC reporting.
The relating information will be exchanged automatically, subject to reciprocity, with the tax authorities of countries that have concluded a convention or agreement to this effect.
The filing obligation of the CbC report applies to a company established in Morocco when it meets the following criteria:
  * It directly or indirectly holds an interest in one or more companies or establishments located outside Morocco which requires from the Moroccan entity to prepare consolidated financial statements in accordance with applicable accounting standards or which would be required to do so if its interests were listed on the Moroccan stock exchange.
  * Its consolidated annual turnover before tax is equal to or greater than MAD 8,122,500,000 for the financial year preceding the one concerned by the declaration.
  * It is not owned directly or indirectly by any other company located in Morocco or outside Morocco.


The filing obligation might also apply in some other situations.
A penalty of MAD 500,000 applies for not filing the CbC report or for filing it out of the due date.
This provision becomes effective for fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2021.
## Thin capitalisation
No specific thin capitalisation rules exist in Morocco.
However, the tax law restricts the interest rate on debts issued by shareholders and the basis of calculating deductible interests.
Interest incurred is tax deductible if the shareholder’s capital is fully paid. Additionally, the sum of the shareholder loans generating deductible interests should not exceed the equity capital subscribed, and the applicable interest rate should not exceed the official rate calculated annually on the basis of six months treasury bills.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no provisions for CFCs in Morocco.


# Morocco
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
Non-resident entities are subject to income tax at normal CIT rates derived from all profits or income relating to property that they own, activities that they carry on, and profit-making transactions that they carry out in Morocco.
The taxation is levied to the portion of income allocable to the branch located in Morocco.
In addition, a 15% 'branch tax' applies to a non-resident’s after-tax profits. Some treaties may provide protection against the application of the branch tax.
For resident entities having branches in Morocco, the income is taxable in the hands of the head office at normal CIT rates.


# Morocco
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
The Moroccan tax law provides several tax incentives for specific sectors of activities.
## Tourism companies
For companies operating in the tourism sector, the permanent exemption is replaced by a temporary exemption on their profits related to their export turnover during five years from the first export operation.
## Industrial companies
Industrial companies carrying out activities fixed by regulation and companies carrying out outsourcing activities inside or outside the industrial zones benefit from the total exemption from CIT during the first five consecutive fiscal years from the date of the beginning of their operation.
## Sports companies
Sports companies constituted in accordance with the provisions of Law n° 30-09 relating to physical education and sports, promulgated by the Dahir n° 1-10-150 of Ramadan 13, 1431 (24 August 2010), benefit from the total exemption from CIT for a period of five consecutive financial years from the first fiscal year of operation.
## Capital risk companies
Capital risk companies are exempt from CIT on profits derived within the scope of their activities (these are profits related to purchases of companies’ shares that support such companies’ development and the sales of such shares thereafter).
## Casablanca Finance City
A law was enacted in 2010 for the setting up of a finance area in Casablanca, called, Casablanca Finance City.
The Casablanca Finance City statute may be granted to specific financial institutions as well as non-financial institutions that offer such services as auditing, fiscal, legal, financial, actuarial, and human resources management advisory.
The above statute may also be granted to regional and international headquarters.
Entities established in Casablanca Finance City are exempt, for their export turnover, from CIT during the first five years following the date they obtain the Casablanca Finance City statute. However, this exemption ceases to apply on expiry of the first 60 months following the date of incorporation of the companies concerned. These companies benefit from a reduced rate of 20% in subsequent years.
## Free trade zones (FTZs)
The activities that must be necessarily performed by the companies established in the FTZs are mainly the following (the activities may vary for each FTZ):
  * Food processing industries.
  * Textile and leather industries.
  * Metallurgic, mechanic, electric, and electronic industries.
  * Chemical and special chemical industries.
  * Services connected with the aforementioned activities.


Entities established in FTZs are exempt, for their export turnover, from CIT during the first five years starting from the date of the beginning of their operation.
However, and notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary, this exemption does not apply to the following companies:
  * Companies carrying out their activities in the said zones within the framework of a construction or assembly site.
  * Credit institutions and similar bodies having this status in accordance with the legislation in force.
  * Insurance and reinsurance companies and insurance intermediaries, having this status in accordance with the legislation in force.


Temporarily, the tax regime in force before 1 January 2021 will remain applicable to companies established in industrial acceleration zones before that date (i.e. exemption for five years and taxation at 8.75% for the next 20 years).
## Listed shares
Non-resident entities are exempt from capital gains derived from the sale of stocks listed on the Casablanca stock exchange, excluding the shares of real estate entities.
## Foreign tax credit
Income tax paid on income earned from outside Morocco may be credited against CIT payable in Morocco if provided by treaty.

## WHT on dividends
The WHT rate applicable to income from shares, units, and similar income is set at 12.5% for FY 2024.
The WHT rate will progressively evolve, from 2023 to 2026, until it reaches 10%.
## WHT on interests
The standard WHT on interest paid to non-resident entities is set at 10% as provided by the Moroccan law (unless reduced by treaty). However, the Moroccan law provides that interest on loans granted in foreign currency with a maturity exceeding ten years is exempt from WHT.
## WHT on services paid to non-resident entities
According to the Moroccan Tax Code, all payments of all kinds of services rendered by non-resident entities are subject to WHT at the rate of 10%.
However, it shall be noted that treaty dispositions limit the scope of application of WHT only to remunerations that constitute royalties. Such dispositions overrule the domestic tax law provided by the Moroccan law.

## Exchange controls
Foreign investors are allowed, following the accomplishment of some formalities, to freely transfer abroad the whole proceeds of their investments in Morocco (i.e. dividends, shares sale price, and liquidation income under the condition that the initial investment is realised in one of the foreign currencies listed by the Moroccan Central Bank).
However, some specific transfers of funds into and out of Morocco are subject to prior authorisations from the exchange control office.
## Choice of business entity
The legal vehicles used by foreign companies for the purpose of setting up a business in Morocco are the branch and the subsidiary.
Under subsidiary form, the foreign entities generally opt for the corporation (SA) or the limited liability company (SARL).
The SARL is most adequate for companies with low investment capital while the SA is most appropriate for companies that are investing an important amount of capital. In general, the rules relating to the organisation and functioning of an SARL are more flexible than those required for an SA.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
In general, the Moroccan Tax Code considers that all revenues and capital gains generated in Morocco are subject to Moroccan taxation.
Companies are taxed on the difference between their trading income and expenditure. Business expenses incurred in the operation of the business are generally deductible unless specifically excluded.
The CIT rates applicable for FY 2024 are as follows:
Taxable income (MAD) | CIT rate (%)  
---|---  
From | To  
0 | 300,000 | 15.0

100,000,000 | or more | 33.0  
## Special and industry-specific CIT rates
For companies carrying out industrial activities, the CIT rates applicable for FY 2024 are as follows:
Taxable income (MAD) | CIT rate (%)  
---|---  
From | To  
0 | Lower than 100,000,000 | 23  
100,000,000 | or more | 33  
The rate of 20% is applicable to:
  * Companies with controlled foreign company (CFC) status.
  * Companies operating in Industrial Acceleration Zones (ZAIs).
  * Companies created as of 1 January 2023 that commit to the framework of an agreement signed with the state to invest MAD 1.5 billion in tangible assets and maintain it for ten years (with the exception of public establishments and companies and their subsidiaries).


For credit institutions and similar organisations, Bank Al Maghrib, CDG, and insurance and reinsurance companies, the CIT rate will progressively evolve, from 2023 to 2026, to reach 40% in 2026.
## Minimum contribution
CIT cannot be lower than a minimum contribution of 0.25% of turnover and other specific revenues for all companies, regardless of the reported current result, and 0.15% for operations carried out by commercial companies for sales of petroleum products, gas, butter, oil, sugar, flour, water, electricity, and medicines.
These measures are applicable for fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2023.
The minimum contribution is not due during the first 36 months following the beginning of activities.
## Local income taxes
There are no provincial or local taxes levied on income in Morocco.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is levied under the Moroccan Tax Code and is due on all industrial, commercial, and handicraft transactions taking place in Morocco, as well as on importation operations.
The 2024 Finance Act provided for gradual transition to the following rates: 0%, 10%, and 20% over the period from 2024 to 2026.
The following table summarises the VAT rates applicable in FY 2024.
FY 2024 VAT rate (%)

Electricity | 16  
Electricity generated from renewable energies | 12  
Urban transport operations and road transport of passengers and goods | 13  
Other passenger and freight transport operations | 16  
Services provided to insurance companies by direct marketers or insurance brokers | 12  
Economic cars | 10  
Water intended for public distribution networks, as well as sewerage services and water meter rental operations, other than those relating to water intended for domestic use. | 10

### VAT withholding tax (WHT)
The 2024 Finance Act introduced a VAT WHT system applicable to two categories as follows:
#### VAT-registered suppliers of equipment
WHT must be levied on VAT due on taxable transactions carried out by suppliers of equipment who fail to present a recent certificate of tax compliance (issued by tax authorities within the past six months).
Companies carrying out transactions outside the scope of VAT or exempt from VAT without the deduction right are not required to operate the WHT.
#### VAT-registered service providers
75% of invoiced VAT in respect of the supply of services listed by regulation should be withheld by the following entities:
  * State, local, and regional authorities, public establishments and their subsidiaries, as well as other public bodies.


  * Entities governed by private law and individuals, whose income is determined according to the system of actual net income or simplified net income, who pay the remuneration for these services to taxable individuals who have presented a recent certificate of tax compliance. In the absence of such certificate, the WHT should be operated at up to 100% of the invoiced VAT.


The following operations are excluded from the VAT WHT:
  * Sales of electricity and water delivered to public distribution networks.
  * Sanitation services provided to subscribers by sanitation organisations, as well as the rental of water and electricity meters.
  * Sales and services provided by telecommunications operators.
  * Services provided by canvassers and insurance brokers.
  * Services worth up to MAD 5,000, up to a maximum of MAD 50,000 per month per service provider.


## Customs duties
Importation of goods in Morocco gives rise to payment of importation duties, the VAT on importation, and the special tax on importation called _Taxe Parafiscale à l’Importation_ (TPI).
Customs duties are computed on the basis of the _ad valorem_ value of the goods at the time of their entrance into Morocco.
Customs duties can be reduced if the imported products are covered by free trade agreements signed by Morocco or other specific regulatory dispositions.
Under Moroccan tax law, the importation operations are subject to VAT at the rate of 20%. A lower rate of 10% applies to specifically designated importations.
The Moroccan tax law also offers some economical customs regimes that provide VAT exemptions with credit (equivalent to zero rate).
The TPI rate is 0.25% levied on the value of the imported goods.
## Excise taxes
Excise taxes apply to specific products imported or produced in Morocco, such as tobacco, alcohol, and lubricants.
## Professional tax
A professional tax is levied on individuals and enterprises that carry out a professional activity in Morocco.
The tax consists of a tax on the rental value of business premises (rented or owned) and fixed assets. The tax rates range from 10% to 30%, with exemption for the first five years of activity.
The rental value is exempted for the portion of cost exceeding MAD 50 million.
## Registration duties
Registration duties are due on all written or verbal conventions, such as property transfer of real estate, shares, or rights; company set up; equity increase; and goodwill transfer.
The rates of registration duties range from 1% to 6%. A flat rate of MAD 200 is also applicable to specific operations and conventions.
The applicable rate for the transfer of goodwill is 6%.
## Payroll taxes
Individual income tax on salaries is paid by way of withholdings made by resident employers.
## Social security contributions
The only mandatory social security regime in Morocco is the one managed by the CNSS fund (_Caisse Nationale de Sécurité Sociale_).
The CNSS rates are as follows and apply to the gross salary, excluding exempted allowances and indemnities:
Contribution | Employee portion (%) | Employer portion (%) | Computation basis ceiling (MAD)
