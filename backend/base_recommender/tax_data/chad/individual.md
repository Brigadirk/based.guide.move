## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
An individual with residence in Chad is subject to personal income tax (PIT) on worldwide income. A non-resident individual in Chad is subject to PIT on the income stemming from activities in Chad.
The taxable income is made up of work incomes and capital incomes.
The work incomes (salaries, wages, benefits, emoluments and life annuities, industrial and commercial incomes, agricultural incomes, non-commercial incomes and remuneration of main managers of limited liability companies and limited partnerships and other similar income) are taxed according to the following progressive rates, after deduction of non-taxable allowances (transport, representative fees, social security contributions at rate of 3.5%, etc.):
Work incomes (XAF*) | Rates (%)  
---|---  
0 to 800,000 | 0  
800,001 to 6,000,000 | 10.5  
6,000,001 to 7,500,00 | 15  
7,5000,001 to 9,000,000  | 20  
9,000,001 to 12,000,000 | 25  
Above 12,000,000 | 30  
* _Franc de la Coopération fina_ _ncière en Afrique_ (Central African CFA) (XAF).
Kindly note that the above basis is an annual one.
The capital incomes are taxed at proportional rates as follows:
Capital income | Rates (%)  
---|---  
Capital gains | 20  
Receivables, deposits and suretyship incomes | 5/25  
Rental incomes (for residents) | 15  
Rental incomes (for non-residents) | 20  
Dividends, incomes from shares | 5/10/20  
Taxation is calculated by using a progressive or a proportional rate in consideration of the revenues of the taxpayer.
There is an annual calculation for the total income of the taxpayer. However, some categories of incomes may lead to withholding taxes (WHTs) during the year.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year in Chad is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Married taxpayers are generally required to file a joint income tax return stating their worldwide income.
Prior to 1 January of each year, each employee must deposit, by using forms provided by the tax authorities, an individual declaration of all income received during the past year.
In addition to one's salaries, the employee (and family members, if applicable) must declare all income from property, movable assets, services rendered, etc.
## Payment of taxes
Employers withhold payroll taxes from employees' salaries each month and pay the corresponding amount of tax to the Treasury.
The taxpayer must pay additional taxes if the instalment payments (WHTs on employment income or other income) are insufficient to cover the amount of tax due.
## Tax audit process
The tax audit exercise of the _Direction Générale des Impôts_ (Directorate General of Taxes), Chad is completed in the following manner:
Tax officials having at least the rank of an inspector and with their professional card and a copy of the audit notice perform spot checks on the accounting documents that taxpayers are required to submit.
Accounts are audited at the head office of the enterprise or at the place of its main establishment. Where this is not possible in either of these two places, the taxpayer must expressly request that it be conducted either in the accountant’s office or in the offices of the tax authority.
The operations include confronting the accounts presented with certain facts or material to control the accuracy of returns filed and to proceed, where necessary, to the establishment of the taxes and the taxes evaded.
Any taxpayer under the PIT can be audited on the overall personal tax situation. On the occasion of this control, the administration may check the consistency between, firstly, on the reported income and, secondly, on the patrimonial situation, cash position and/or elements of the lifestyle of members of the tax household.
At least eight days before the date of the first intervention, the tax administration shall send to the taxpayer a verification notice by personally delivered registered mail with acknowledgement of receipt or discharge slip to inform the taxpayer of the date of the first intervention and the possibility of getting a tax consultant of the taxpayer's choice to assist the taxpayer. It must, under pain of rejection, be mentioned in the verification notice.
In case of postponement of the original date of the first intervention, on the initiative of the tax administration, the tax authorities must imperatively send the taxpayer a notice of correction.
The taxpayer may also request a postponement of control by writing, giving reasons for his request within 48 hours of receipt of the notice. This report must be expressly accepted by the administration.
The tax administration may conduct unannounced inspections; it then sends an audit notice personally to the taxpayer, who acknowledges receipt, at the first intervention.
Where the notice bears no indication as to the taxes, duties, or years or periods of assessment, the items to be audited shall be all the taxes owed by the taxpayer for the period still due for payment. In such case, the audit is called a 'general audit'.
However, where it is specified in the audit notice, the tax administration may limit the scope of the audit to one or more taxes due on all or part of the period still due for payment or on a group of operations over a period less than one fiscal year, in which case a spot check is done.
The verification can, nevertheless, go up to one or more years beyond the prescribed period when these exercises are in deficit, as long as the deficits made under a year are carried forward and are deducted from the profits of the non-specified first year that constitute charges.
The verification can also go up to one or more years beyond the prescribed period when these exercises show a tax credit of a VAT carried over the first statement of the non-barred period.
Where the tax service intends to extend the audit to a period or a tax that is not indicated on the initial audit notice, it shall forward another notice following the same manner and deadline laid down in Article L. 21 and seq. of the General Tax Code (GTC), indicating the new period or new tax to be audited.
Where the accounts auditing or adjustment procedure require special technical knowledge, the tax authority may hire the consultants appearing on a list drawn up by Order of the Minister of Economic and Finance. Such consultants shall be professionally liable in case of damage resulting from their work.
When the accounts are kept using computerised systems, the tax administration is empowered to require, in accordance with Article L 18 of the GTC, the technical advice from experts for carrying out tests on the hardware that hosts the operation and to check:
  * the accounting operating system
  * all information, data, and processes that contribute directly or indirectly in the formation of accounting or tax results and the elaboration of documents mandated by the GTC, and
  * the documentation, relating to analysis, programming, and the execution of processing.


The civil and military authorities lend support and assistance to Tax Officers for the exercise of their functions, whenever they are needed.
## Statute of limitations
According to Article L. 82 of the GTC of Chad:
"The total or partial omissions found in the tax base, the inadequacies and inaccuracies, or the taxation errors, can be repaired by the tax administration until the end of the third year following that in which the tax or fee is payable.
Furthermore, any omission or insufficiency of tax revealed by a proceeding before the criminal courts or by a contentious claim may, without prejudice to the general period of repetitions established above, be repaired until the end of the third year following the revelation of the facts".
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Topics of focus for tax authorities include the following:
  * Obligation to file a return.
  * The verification of the return filed.
  * Taxation of office/Arbitrary Assessment.
  * The right of access to taxpayers' documents.
  * Obligation to pay tax.
  * Procedure for the abuse of control.
  * Limiting the right of control.

## Individual - Other issues
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
## Work permits
A request to the National Office for Employment Promotion (ONAPE) for a work permit must be filed by the employer before concluding a labour contract with a foreigner.
In order to be in compliance with both the labour and immigration authorities, all expatriates working in Chad must possess the following legal documents:
  * An employment authorisation that cannot exceed a one-year period ('autorisation d'emploi'). 
  * A work permit ('permis de travail'). 
  * A resident card ('carte de sejour'). 
  * A long-term visa and a return visa ('visa long sejour et visa retour').

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
## Employment income
Employment income is composed of salaries, allowances, premiums, and benefits in kind received by an employee.
When an employee is a tax resident in Chad, employment income is taxable in Chad, notwithstanding instances where the employee's remunerative activities are performed outside Chad or the employer is not established in Chad.
When an employee is not a tax resident in Chad, employment income is taxable in Chad if the employee's remunerative activities are performed in Chad and the employer is established in Chad.
Benefits in kind are taxable according to their actual value. However, the benefits in kind listed below are assessed at the base or least of the corresponding rates (as a percentage of salary) or their actual value:
  * Housing: 20% (actual cost must be used if the benefit is considered luxury housing, although 'luxury' has not been defined by the tax administration).
  * Electricity: 4%.
  * Water: 4%.
  * Vehicle: 10%.
  * Food: 15% (with a maximum of XAF 75,000 per month for each person).
  * Gas: 2%.
  * Telephone: 3%.
  * Housekeeping/guarding: 4%.


Pensions, in general, are exempted from PIT.
## Equity compensation
Equity compensation is not specifically addressed in Chad's General Tax Code.
## Business income
Industrial, agricultural, and other commercial income is combined with the other categories of income in order to determine the annual amount of PIT.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are taxable in Chad. Their taxation depends on the duration of the possession of the goods, and the rate depends on the nature of the goods.
### Capital gains realised during the transfer of corporate rights
The capital gains arising from the transfer of all or part of the social rights, by a partner, shareholder, dormant partner, or unit holder beneficiaries, to another person during the term of the company are subject to PIT at 20% of their sum, provided:
  * that the individual or spouse, ascendants or descendants are, or have served, over the past five years, as a director or manager in the company and that the rights of these people in the social benefits have exceeded, as a whole, 25% of those benefits during the same period, and
  * that the amount of capital gain exceeds XAF 500,000.


### Capital gain of private wealth
The following are subject to taxation of capital gains realised on private wealth:
  * The capital gains realised by individuals in the management of their private assets, in particular on the occasion of the sale, exchange, sharing, expropriation, of the contribution to a company or liquidation of a corporation on the movable or immovable property or on rights of any kind.
  * The capital gains realised on the sale for value of securities or social rights of companies whose assets are primarily made up of real estate or rights relating to such property.


### Method of taxation of capital gains
The taxable gain is made by the difference between the sale price and the market value of such property and the purchase price by the seller.
The sale price is less the amount paid by the seller at the time of this sale.
The purchase price is increased costs relating to the acquisition. Where appropriate, the purchase price is increased spending of construction, reconstruction, expansion, renovation, or improvement made since the acquisition, when they have not already been deducted from taxable income and are not like rent expenses.
A discount of 15% is made on the taxable amount of the capital gains realised during the same year after the eventual application of capital losses.
The tax on capital gains is paid voluntarily on 15 April of the year following the completion of the capital gain by the taxpayer who made the capital gain taxable at the tax office on which it depends.
## Dividend income
Dividend income is combined with the other categories of income in order to determine the annual amount of PIT.
## Interest income
Interest income is combined with the other categories of income in order to determine the annual amount of PIT.
