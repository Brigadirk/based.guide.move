## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 25 April 2024
## Foreign tax relief
A foreign tax credit may be granted, in accordance with the relevant DTT, provided that the tax paid abroad for the income obtained abroad was actually paid directly by the natural person or by their legal representative. The payment of the tax abroad must be proved with justifying official documents issued by the foreign country’s tax authorities or, in certain circumstances, with documents issued by the payer of the income withholding the income tax or by means of tax returns and the proof of income tax payment.
The tax credit is granted at the level of the tax paid abroad for income derived from abroad, but it may not exceed the part of the income tax payable in Romania related to the taxable income from abroad. In case the taxpayer in question obtains incomes from abroad from several countries, then the tax credit admitted to be deducted from the tax payable in Romania shall be calculated, according to the above-mentioned procedure, for each country and each category of income.

  * As of January 2024, the value of subscriptions for the use of sports facilities borne by employers for their own employees is exempt from personal income tax (PIT) and social contributions within the limit of the Romanian leu (RON)-equivalent of 100 euros (EUR)/year/employee (provided that the threshold of 33% of the base salary of the employee is not exceeded). Amounts incurred for the same purpose by employees themselves will be deductible within the same limit of 100 EUR/year when calculating the salary taxes.


  * As of January 2024, the exemption from PIT and social contributions for the amounts granted to employees who carry out teleworking activities to support utility expenses at the place of work (allowed previously for up to RON 400/month) has been eliminated.
  * The amounts borne by employers for placing their employees’ children in early education units, according to the law, will not be included in the calculation base for PIT and social contributions up to the limit of RON 1,500/month for each child, provided that the threshold of 33% of the base monthly salary is not exceeded.
  * As of January 2024, both meal vouchers and holiday vouchers became subject to health fund contribution of 10%, in addition to the applicable PIT rate of 10%.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 25 April 2024
Romanian citizens domiciled in Romania are considered Romanian tax residents and are taxed on their worldwide income (except for salary income received from abroad for work performed abroad, which is tax exempt) unless they prove by means of tax residence certificates that they qualify as tax residents of a state with which Romania concluded a double tax treaty (DTT).
Romanian citizens domiciled in Romania that prove the tax residency status in a state that does not have in place a (DTT) with Romania continue to be taxable in Romania on their worldwide income for the calendar year in which the change of residence occurs, as well as for the next three calendar years.
Romanian citizens not domiciled in Romania and foreign individuals, regardless of their domicile, are taxed in Romania only on income sourced in Romania, until the moment they become Romanian tax residents taxable on their worldwide income, if the case.
Non-resident individuals become taxable on their worldwide income starting with the date when they become tax residents in Romania (while respecting the provisions of the DTTs, where applicable). _See the_ _section for the residence criteria_.
## Personal income tax rates
A flat PIT rate of 10% is generally in place. However, there are certain exceptions from this rule (e.g. the tax rate for dividends and for capital gains in certain cases, the tax rate for income from the transfer of immovable property, the tax rate for income from gambling activities depends on the income level).
## Local income taxes
There are no local taxes on personal income in Romania.


# Romania
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 25 April 2024
## Taxable period
The Romanian tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December. 
## Tax returns
In case of salary income derived from a Romanian employer, under a local employment contract, the income tax and mandatory social contributions are withheld from the employee’s salary at the time the salary is paid. The taxes have to be reported and paid by the local employer to the tax authorities by the 25th day of the month following the one the salary income relates to.
Individuals deriving income from Romania or from abroad, such as income from the following categories, might have to file the Annual Return (the reporting obligation should be analysed on a case-by-case basis based on the individual's tax residence position and on the income’s source country):
  * Salary income, under certain conditions.
  * Income from independent activities.
  * Income from IP rights.
  * Rental income.
  * Income from partnership with a legal entity.
  * Income from agricultural, forestry, and fishery activities.
  * Income from prizes/gambling.
  * Income from pensions.
  * Income from the transfer of immovable properties.
  * Income from investments.
  * Income from other sources.


Through the Annual Return to be filed, the individual has to declare the final income obtained during the previous year, as well as the estimated income to be obtained in the current year, for both income tax and social contributions purposes. The filing deadline is 25 May.
The individual assesses the income tax and social contribution liabilities due for income by applying the rates for income tax/social contributions on the computation base determined in accordance with the provisions of the Fiscal Code for each type of income.
The payment of tax liabilities due (income tax and/or social contributions) is to be made based on a self-assessment made by the individual, in accordance with the information reflected in the Annual Return, within the same reporting deadline (i.e. 25 May).
Spouses are treated as individual (separate) taxpayers; the concept of joint filing is not regulated in the Romanian tax legislation.
## Payment of tax
The standard procedure in case of a local employment contract is for the Romanian employer to withhold the full amount of income tax and social contributions due from the employee’s monthly salary income.
For the salary income received from abroad by individuals working in Romania based on a foreign employment contract, the 10% flat income tax rate, as well as the social contributions, if the case, are due on a monthly basis. For income tax, it is the personal obligation of the individual to report such income and pay the income tax due on a monthly basis. Social contributions might also fall in the individual’s obligation of reporting and payment provided that it was agreed as such with the foreign employer, in case the foreign employer is located in the EEA or in a country that concluded a social security agreement with Romania.
To ensure the reporting and payment of social contributions in Romania in respect of the salary income derived from foreign employers for employment activities performed in Romania, a specific registration procedure has to be undertaken in Romania.
In case of individuals seconded to Romania by employers located in countries with which Romania does not have a social security agreement in place, the mandatory Romanian social contributions due arise directly for the individual undertaking the employment activities in Romania.
In cases where the EU regulation on the coordination of social security systems or the social security agreements concluded by Romania with other countries apply, no social contributions / limited social security contributions are due in Romania on the salary income received from abroad for activities carried out here (as provided by each agreement) if certificates of coverage are available in this respect; in situations where social security contributions are not due at all in Romania, no registration for Romanian social security purposes should be undertaken.
The general deadline for both reporting and paying the income tax and social contributions, if the case, is the 25th day of the month following the one the salary income relates with. 
For benefits in kind and/or in cash received from third parties based on an employment contract or a contractual relationship between parties, the obligation to compute and withhold the Romanian income tax and social contributions liabilities belongs either to the employer, the income payer, or the individual, _as detailed under Social contributions in the section and Employment income in the section_.
Currently, the level for late-payment interest is set at 0.02% per day of delay. In addition to the late-payment interest, a late-payment penalty of 0.01% per day of delay applies.


# Romania
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 25 April 2024
## Employment expenses
For the primary workplace, the following amounts are currently to be deducted from the gross salary income when calculating the taxable income:
  * Individual mandatory social contributions due according to the provisions of the law and in line with the provisions of the European Union (EU) legislation or any social security agreement to which Romania is a party.
  * Personal deductions corresponding to the respective month. 
  * Contributions made by employees to voluntary pension funds, according to the relevant legislation, to voluntary pension funds classified as such by the Financial Surveillance Authority, made to authorised entities established in the member states of the European Union or the European Economic Area (EEA), up to the RON equivalent of EUR 400 annually/employee.
  * Voluntary health insurance premiums and subscriptions to private healthcare facilities borne by employees, up to the Romanian leu equivalent of EUR 400 annually.
  * Trade union membership fees corresponding to the respective month.
  * Subscription amounts borne in certain conditions by the employees for the use of sports facilities in order to practice sports and physical education for the purpose of maintenance, prophylactic, or therapeutic, up to the equivalent in RON of EUR 100 annually/employee. 


For the salary income obtained in other cases, taxable income is assessed as the difference between the gross salary income and the individual mandatory social contributions, due according to the law, in line with the provisions of the European Union or other social security agreements to which Romania is a party.
Individual taxpayers may generally direct up to 3.5% of their annual income tax to charitable purposes.

## Individual - Other issues
Last reviewed - 25 April 2024
## The right to work and reside in Romania of the nationals of the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and Swiss Confederation nationals
### The right to work in Romania for EU/EEA and Swiss nationals
Nationals of the EU/EEA countries and of the Swiss Confederation working in Romania, either based on a Romanian employment contract or based on a secondment agreement, have free access to the Romanian labour market and no work authorisation has to be obtained for them. Still, they have to comply with the provisions of the Romanian Labour Law when concluding an employment contract in Romania.
Within the framework of provisions of transnational services, the EU/EEA/Swiss Confederation-based employer has the obligation to inform the competent Romanian labour authority whenever their employees are seconded in Romania and their secondment is extended beyond 12 months. In this respect, a specific notification in a format provided by the law has to be filed with the competent authority, within a specific deadline. Failure in fulfilling this obligation is subject to fines.
Also, the Romanian beneficiary of the service has the obligation to have available certain documents related to the individual’s secondment to Romania (e.g. Romanian notarised translation of the employment contract, service contract between companies, secondment letter, A1 certificate) in case of an audit from the labour authorities.
### Right to reside in Romania for EU/EEA and Swiss Confederation nationals, as well as for their family members
EU/EEA and Swiss nationals residing in Romania for a period longer than three months should register with the Romanian immigration authority and apply for an administrative document named 'registration certificate'. Such document is issued by the competent immigration authority within one to two days from the date of filing the application.
The registration certificate is issued with a validity between one to five years, depending on the supporting documentation available.
Depending on the purpose of stay of the individual, different documents may be required to sustain the registration certificate application (i.e. secondment letter, employment contract, proof of family relationship, etc.).
Non-EU family members of EU/EEA/Swiss Confederation nationals/Romanian nationals may be subject to different immigration compliance requirements for entering and staying in Romania, such as:
  * Obtaining Romanian entry visas, if necessary.
  * Obtaining a residency card if their stay in Romania is intended to be longer than three months.


A Romanian permanent residency card could be obtained as well if certain conditions are fulfilled. Such a document has a validity of five years, with the possibility of further extension.
## The right to work and reside in Romania of third country nationals (non-EU)
### Working right in Romania of non-EU nationals
A 'non-EU national' is an individual not holding Romanian, EU/EEA, or Swiss Confederation citizenship.
As a general rule, a non-EU national may perform working activities in Romania, as a local employee or a secondee, only if a work authorisation for employment or secondment is obtained in advance.
Any type of work authorisation is issued by the competent Romanian immigration authorities, based on the official request of the Romanian company, either as employer or beneficiary of the service. 
The work authorisation for employment is issued for several categories of workers: permanent workers, highly skilled employees, seasonal workers, trainee workers, cross-border workers, and au pair workers.
The work authorisation for secondment is issued for secondees performing activities in Romania based on a service agreement concluded between their employer and the Romanian beneficiary of their services or under an intra-corporate transfer (ICT).
As a matter of exception, in certain circumstances and subject to the fulfilment of certain specific conditions, some categories of non-EU nationals may perform working activities in Romania without having previously obtained a work authorisation for employment/secondment, such as: non-EU nationals having a right to reside in Romania as family members of Romanian citizens or non-EU nationals employed by companies based in the EU/EEA or Swiss Confederation and seconded to Romania, students concluding an employment contract with limited working time, etc.
The issuance of the work authorisation is conditioned by the fulfilment of certain general conditions (required for all types of work authorisations), as well as specific conditions applicable to each category of worker. Some of the specific conditions required for the most common work authorisations are listed below.
#### Work authorisation for permanent workers
Some of the main special conditions required for obtaining such work authorisation are:
  * The Romanian employer intends to conclude a full-time employment contract for a defined or undefined period of time.
  * The Romanian employer is conducting a selection process and no Romanian, EU/EEA/Swiss national, or non-EU national holder of a Romanian permanent residency permit is available to occupy the vacant position.
  * The candidate fulfils all the conditions provided by the legislation in force for occupying the vacant position, including but not limited to the educational condition.


#### Work authorisation for highly skilled workers
The main special conditions required to be proved for obtaining the work authorisation for highly skilled workers are:
  * A minimum 12 months employment contract.
  * The non-EU national should prove high professional qualifications sustaining the highly skilled vacant position.
  * A minimum salary level is required (i.e. currently the minimum level is of two Romanian average salaries).


#### Work authorisation for secondment purposes
Such work authorisation could be obtained for non-EU nationals seconded to Romania by their employers headquartered outside the EU/EEA/Switzerland area if:
  * there is a service agreement concluded between the foreign employer and the Romanian beneficiary of the service, or
  * the Romanian beneficiary of the service and the foreign employer are part of the same group of companies, or
  * the Romanian beneficiary of the service is a representative office or a Romanian branch of the foreign employer in Romania, and
  * the duration of the secondment is for maximum 12 months within a five-years period, and
  * the non-EU national has the required qualifications required to perform the activity in Romania.


#### Work authorisation for secondment purposes for ICT workers
Some of the main special conditions required to be fulfilled in order to obtain a work authorisation for an ICT worker are:
  * The individual is subject to an ICT from an employer headquartered outside the EU/EEA/Swiss Confederation to a Romanian entity.
  * The individual will perform work in Romania only as manager, specialist, or trainee.
  * Duration of the transfer is up to three years (for managers and specialists) or up to one year (for trainees).
  * The foreign employer and the Romanian company are part of the same group of companies.
  * The secondment letter contains specific elements provided by the Romanian law.
  * A certain level of education, experience, and qualification is required for managers and specialists.
  * A minimum duration of foreign employment contract is needed.


Foreigners, holders of valid residency permits as ICT workers issued by other EU member states authorities, could be transferred to Romania:
  * Under a short-term mobility structure, for a period up to 90 days in any 180 days.
  * Under a long-term mobility structure, for a period longer than 90 days.


For both the above-mentioned structures, the Romanian beneficiary has the obligation to obtain a work authorisation. However, there are differences in the list of documents required for the applications and the moment when the non-EU national is allowed to start working as an ICT worker.
Additional obligations to inform the labour authorities about the secondment conditions are falling under the Romanian company’s responsibility.
### Right to reside in Romania for non-EU nationals
A non-EU national may travel to Romania and stay here for a period up to a maximum of 90 days within a six-month period, with or without a short-term visa priorly obtained from a Romanian Consulate abroad (depending on the individual’s nationality). However, based on such short-term visa, the non-EU national is not allowed to work in Romania but only to perform specific activities allowed under the visa granted.
Generally, non-EU nationals having a stay in Romania exceeding 90 days within any six-month period need to apply for a long-term visa and subsequently for a temporary residency permit. Nationals of the United States (US), Canada, and Japan are exempted from obtaining Romanian long-term visas.
The documentation required for obtaining Romanian long-term visas/residency permits depends on the type of immigration document required (e.g. secondment, employment, family reunion).
The residency permit may have different names and validity, depending on the purpose for which it was issued. 
Obtaining the status of a Romanian long-term resident and the long-term residency permit depends on fulfilling certain conditions provided by the law, generally related to the duration of the stay in Romania of the non-EU national, the value of one's investment, level of knowledge of Romanian language, etc.
#### Personal numerical code
The personal numerical code granted by the competent immigration authority to non-Romanian nationals, through their residency documents (i.e. registration certificate, single permit, EU Blue Card etc.), also represents their fiscal number.
#### Fiscal registration number
The individuals who are not required to obtain residency documents in Romania may fulfil their fiscal obligations here by registering with the fiscal authorities through a fiscal agent or a representative in order to obtain such a fiscal number.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 25 April 2024
## Taxation of residents
### Employment income
Salary is defined as income in cash and/or in kind received by resident or non-resident individuals, based on an individual employment agreement, a job relation, secondment agreement, or a special statute provided by the law, and is taxed at a flat tax rate of 10%.
Salary assimilated income includes remuneration paid according to non-competition clauses and taxable benefits as provided by the Romanian tax legislation. Moreover, administrators’ fees received by members of the General Meeting of Shareholders, the Management Council, the Board of Director, and the Supervision Council are treated as income assimilated to salaries.
From a salary income tax perspective, taxpayers include:
  * Local employees (and Directors remunerated based on mandate agreements) of Romanian companies, branches, and representative offices of foreign companies. Their employers/income payers are liable to compute, withhold, report, and wire to the State Budget the salary taxes on a monthly basis.
  * Foreign individuals performing activities in Romania based on foreign employment agreements. These individuals are personally liable to submit monthly income statements and pay monthly income tax for salaries obtained from the employer established abroad for activities rendered in Romania.


Mandatory employee social contributions are deductible for Romanian salary income tax purposes.
For benefits in kind and/or in cash received from third parties based on an employment contract or a contractual relationship between parties, the obligation to compute, withhold, and pay the income tax belongs to:
  * resident employers when the benefits in kind and/or in cash are granted by other parties and the payment is made through the employer
  * resident income payers when the benefits in kind and/or in cash are granted and paid by third parties that are tax resident, and
  * individuals when the benefits in kind and/or in cash are granted by third parties that are non-resident, unless the employer tax resident opts for computing and withholding the income tax.


### Income from pensions
Contributive pensions are taxable at a flat tax rate of 10%, the taxable pension income being set by deducting from the pension income (determined as a result of the application of the contribution principle, regardless of its level) the non-taxable amount of RON 2,000 per month.
For other types of pensions, progressive tax rates (10%, 15%, and 20%) are applicable.
### Income from independent activities
Income from independent activities is taxed at a flat rate of 10% and covers income from the activities of production, trade, supplies of services, and incomes from liberal professions, earned individually and/or in a form of association, including incomes from adjacent activities.
Individuals earning income from independent activities, from one or more sources of income, are also liable to pay the social insurance and health insurance contributions (capped) if their income exceeds the thresholds provided by the law as detailed below. 
The individuals deriving income from independent activities are liable to pay social insurance contributions for a chosen amount that cannot be lower than 12 national minimum gross salaries or 24 national minimum gross salaries, depending on the level of income derived. Individuals whose income does not reach this ceiling can still opt to pay social insurance contributions.
Health insurance contributions are also due for income from independent activities, and, for the year 2024, the taxable basis is capped at 60 minimum gross salaries per year.
The following social contributions rates apply during 2024:
  * 25% for the social insurance contribution.
  * 10% for the health insurance contribution.


The value of the national minimum gross salary for 2024 is RON 3,300/month. 
In general, the annual net income is being determined on a real system basis. In order to report the estimated income obtained from independent activities and to pay the estimated income tax and social contributions due on such income, if the case, the individuals have to submit the annual income tax and social contributions return (_Declaratia unica privind impozitul pe venit si contributiile sociale datorate de persoanele fizice_) within 30 days from the start of the activity and to pay the related taxes by 25 May of the following year. The calculation of the tax obligations and their payment is done through the individual’s self-assessment, made based on the information filled in the annual income tax and social contributions return. Additionally, a separate annual return has to be filed by 25 May of the year following the one in which the income was obtained in order to report the actual income obtained. Alternatively, specific categories of income from independent activities are taxed on the basis of a fixed income quota, as communicated yearly by the local tax authorities. The income tax assessed and paid under a fixed income quota is considered as final tax.
The taxable income from freelance activities is assessed based on the bookkeeping ledgers that providers of independent activities are compelled to keep. The taxable income is calculated under the real system as gross income minus deductible expenses.
Certain expenses are non-deductible, as follows: fines, late-payment penalties (other than contractual penalties as per the contractual agreements with the authorities), donations, private scholarships, sponsorship and protocol expenses in excess of the upper limits set by law, 50% of the expenses incurred with company cars that are not used exclusively for business purposes (with certain exceptions), and other expenses exceeding limits provided by current law, as well as the expenses incurred for the personal usage of the taxpayer's family members. The list is not exhaustive.
### Income from independent activities obtained based on sport activity contracts 
Individuals deriving income from independent activities obtained based on sport contracts are subject to income tax, social insurance, and health insurance contributions in Romania. The legal entity or other entity that is paying the income and is required to keep accounting records has the obligation to compute, report, withhold, and wire to the tax authorities 10% income tax applied on the taxable income, the income tax being final. Similar obligations apply for social insurance and health insurance contributions for those cases when the estimated annual gross income is at least equal to 12 national minimum gross salaries in the case of social insurance contributions with the applicable cap for each type of contribution. This obligation exists for income derived from a single income payer or for income derived by individuals from multiple income payers, with the condition that from at least one payer the income derived is at least equal to the above-mentioned level; in case of multiple income payers, the taxpayer designates by contract the income payer required to calculate, withhold, and pay the contributions.
Otherwise, _similar to the provisions mentioned above under Income from independent activities_ , for social contributions purposes, the annual return has to be filed by the individuals in order to report the income obtained based on sport activities contracts and to assess the social insurance and health insurance contributions due on such income. The payment deadline for the annual social contributions due is represented, _as above_ , by the same reporting deadline (i.e. 25 May of the following year for the previous year).
### Income from intellectual property (IP) rights
Income from IP rights is subject to income tax and social contributions. In case the income from IP rights is paid by a legal entity or other entity required to keep accounting records, the income tax is calculated by applying the 10% rate to the taxable income and is withheld at source. In such case, the payer of the income is required to compute, report, withhold, and pay to the tax authorities the following:
  * Income tax of 10% on a calculation base determined by deducting a flat rate of 40% from the gross income.
  * Social insurance and health insurance contributions (capped) if the annual net estimated IP rights income is at least equal to 12 national minimum gross salaries in the case of social insurance contributions or of at least 6 national minimum gross salaries in the case of health insurance contributions. The taxable basis cannot exceed 24 minimum gross salaries. This obligation exists for income derived from a single income payer or for income derived from multiple income payers, with the condition that for at least one payer the income is at least equal to the above-mentioned level; the individual designates by contract the income payer required to compute, withhold, and pay the social contributions.


Individuals who derive IP rights income from other payers than those mentioned above and individuals who chose to determine their net income on a real system basis have to calculate, declare, and pay the income tax and the social contributions through the annual return to be filed by 25 May of the year following the one when the income was derived (_similar to the general provisions mentioned above for Income derived from independent activities_).
Retired individuals and individuals who derive salary income or income treated as such are exempt from paying social contributions on income obtained from IP rights.
### Capital gains
Generally, the net capital gain is subject to income tax at the flat rate of 10%. The taxable amount is calculated based on the difference between the sale price and the acquisition price of the shares. In general, broker/transaction fees in connection with the acquisition or sale are tax deductible.
The individual has to report any sale of shares (i.e. capital gain/loss) through the annual return by 25 May of the year following the one in which the sale was performed and pay the related taxes, based on a self-assessment made considering the information reflected in the annual return, within the same reporting deadline (i.e. 25 May). 
By way of exception, income from the transfer of securities (other than investment gold) shall be subject to income tax withholding if the transfer is made by intermediaries defined according to the relevant legislation, investment management companies, self-managed investment companies, managers of alternative investment funds, Romanian tax residents, or non-residents who have a permanent establishment (PE) in Romania that has the capacity of an intermediary carrying out the transfer of securities. Such intermediary entities shall be required to determine the gain and withhold the income tax both for revenues obtained from Romania and for those obtained from abroad.
The income tax to be withheld is determined by the intermediary entities at each transfer by applying an income tax rate of:
  * 1% on each gain from the transfer of securities that were acquired and disposed of in a period longer than 365 days, inclusive, from the date of acquisition.
  * 3% on each gain from the transfer of securities that were acquired and disposed of in a period less than 365 days from the date of acquisition.


The health insurance contribution (10%, capped) is also due in case the capital gain, alone or together with other categories of income derived by the individual during the year, as provided by the Fiscal Code, reaches the annual threshold of 6 minimum gross salaries, but not more than 24 minimum gross salaries. It is the obligation of the individual to declare the health insurance contribution in the annual return and pay it by 25 May of the year the income relates with.
### Income from real estate transactions
Income from the transfer of real estate is taxed at the following tax rates applicable on the transaction value, depending on the period for which the property was owned/held:
  * 3% for constructions of any kind and their related lands, as well as on lands of any kind without constructions, held for a period of up to three years inclusive.
  * 1% for the buildings described above, held for a period longer than three years.


No income tax is due for ownership of real estate acquired under special laws, for donation deeds between relatives or in-laws up to the third degree inclusively and between spouses, and in cases of inheritance, provided the procedure is finalised within two years as of the date of death of the author of the inheritance (an income tax of 1% of the value of the corpus is levied if the procedure is not completed within those two years).
Income tax due for transfer of real estate ownership is withheld by the notary public and calculated based on the value declared by the parties within the transaction documents. If the value declared by the parties is lower than the estimated minimum value established by the expert appraisal conducted by the Chamber of Public Notaries, the notary public notifies the Romanian tax authorities on this transaction. The tax is to be remitted by the 25th day of the month following that when the income tax was withheld.
### Dividend income
Dividend income is subject to an 8% income tax rate that is to be withheld by the payer of income. This income is considered for assessing the annual minimum cap based on which the health insurance contribution might be due. For example, individuals receiving, in 2024, income from dividends, which, alone or together with other categories of personal income, as provided by the Fiscal Code, are in a value of at least RON 19,800 (6 x minimum gross salary for 2024), have to submit the annual return and pay the health insurance contribution (10% applied on the aforementioned threshold) and the taxable basis is capped at 24 minimum gross salaries per year. 
### Interest income
Interest income is subject to the 10% flat tax rate, withheld by the payer of the income, the tax being final. Similar to income from dividends, health insurance contribution (capped) is due if the annual income, alone or together with other categories of personal income, as provided by the Fiscal Code, is of at least the value mentioned above.
### Rental income
Gross annual rental income, other than lease of land, represents the income earned by the owner for a certain year, as stipulated in the rental agreement concluded between the parties.
Rental income is subject to the 10% tax rate and 20% deductible expenses are allowed for assessing the net rental income to be taxed.
In case of payers of income, legal entities or entities who are required to run a bookkeeping, there is an obligation to withhold the 10% income tax, after deducting the 20% deductible expenses out of the gross rental income.
The withheld tax is final and it is to be paid to the state budget by the payer of income by the 25th day of the month following that in which it was withheld. For all other situations, the individual is required to report one’s annual rental income in one’s annual tax return for income tax purposes. 
Health insurance contribution (capped) is due if the annual net rental income, alone or together with other categories of personal income, as provided by the Fiscal Code, exceeds the minimum threshold set by the law (e.g. for 2024, the threshold is of at least 6 minimum gross salaries amounting to RON 19,800). The annual taxable basis for the health insurance contribution is capped at 24 minimum gross salaries amounting to RON 79,200.
Homeowners deriving income from the renting out of up to five rooms for touristic purposes during a tax year owe income tax established based on an annual income quota. 
Individuals obtaining, during the tax year, income from renting out more than five rooms for touristic purposes, starting the following tax year, will treat the income obtained as income from independent activities, and the taxation rules provided for independent activities have to be considered. The individuals have to report such income and pay the related tax obligations through the annual return to be filed by 25 May.
### Income from prizes
Tax on income from prizes is withheld at source and determined by levying 10% on the amount exceeding RON 600 paid for each prize, the tax withheld as such being considered final.
### Income from gambling
Income tax due on income from gambling activities is withheld at source by the organiser/payer of income of gambling activities, by applying the following income tax rates on each gross income received:

### Other income subject to the 10% flat tax rate
The following types of taxable income are included in this category (the list is not exhaustive):
