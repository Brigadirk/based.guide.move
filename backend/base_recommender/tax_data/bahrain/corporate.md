Last reviewed - 20 March 2024
On 1 September 2024, Bahrain published Decree 11 of 2024, which introduces a Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax for Multinational Enterprises (hereinafter referred to as ‘DMTT Law’). The DMTT Law provides the legislative basis for the introduction and implementation of a DMTT in Bahrain, and it is intended to be consistent with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) Model Rules. The DMTT Law applies to fiscal years commencing on or after 1 January 2025. _See Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax in the_ _section for more information_.
It should be noted that the DMTT Law does not include an Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) or an Undertaxed Payments Rule (UTPR), the other key charging mechanisms as prescribed by the GloBE Model Rules.

Last reviewed - 20 March 2024
## Taxable period
A company's accounting period should normally follow the (Gregorian) calendar year (i.e. 1 January to 31 December).
## Tax returns
The law is silent on the due date for the filing of the final income tax statement. However, an estimated income tax statement must be submitted on or before the 15th day of the third month of the taxable year. Where applicable, a taxpayer may also be required to file an amended estimated income tax statement quarterly thereafter, unless a final income tax statement has been provided.
Approved accountants must prepare a certified tax return for the return to be acceptable to the authorities.
## Payment of tax
Taxes (based on the initial estimated tax statement filed) are payable in 12 equal monthly instalments. Payments are due starting on the 15th day of the fourth month of the taxable year. Income tax as per the subsequent amended estimated income tax statements or the final income tax statement will form the basis of tax payments for the remainder of the 12 monthly instalments that are yet to be paid. The final payment is due on the 15th day of the third month after the end of the taxable year or the date the final income tax statement is filed, whichever is later.
Any excess income tax paid will be credited and used in the first invoice for income tax following the establishment of the credit by the Minister.
## Statute of limitations
The Income Tax Law No. 22 of 1979 does not specify any statute of limitations.
## DMTT tax administration 
### Appointment of a Filing CE
If there are multiple CEs in Bahrain, a Filing CE must be appointed to be responsible for registering with the NBR, making the advance payment, filing the return, and ensuring compliance with other tax requirements.
### DMTT registration
The Filing CE must apply for registration with the NBR within 120 days of the transition year's start, or 30 days following the effective date of the DMTT Law (1 January 2025) if the revenue test is met for two of the past four fiscal years.
The DMTT registration requires submission of details on the MNE, including ownership structure, fiscal year, financial data, disclosures in relation to currency, whether it is expected any DMTT reliefs will be claimed (i.e. safe harbours or _de minimis_), and consent from relevant entities. The NBR will issue a registration certificate once accepted.
The Filing CE can modify the registration details, including the eligibility for DMTT relief, within 30 days from the date of change.
### Advance tax payments
Advance payments of the DMTT must be made on a quarterly basis, with each payment due within 60 days after the end of the quarter. However, for the first advance payment in the transition year at the time of entry into force of the DMTT Law, the payment is due on the same date as the second advance payment.
The Filing CE can choose between the ‘Prior Year Method’ or the ‘Current Year Method’ to calculate advance payments. The election must be made by the due date of the first advance payment and is irrevocable for the fiscal year. For this purpose, the Prior Year Method shall be based on a reasonable estimate of the prior year's tax, adjusted for the current period, and the Current Year Method shall be based on an estimate of the current year's tax due for the period, minus any previous payments.
The Filing CE must maintain documentation showing how advance payments were calculated for a period of five years following the end of the fiscal year to which they relate and provide it to the NBR upon request. Penalties may be imposed for failure to submit such documentation and evidence. 
The balance of tax due must be paid within 15 months of the end of the fiscal year.
### Tax returns
The Filing CE must submit a tax return within 15 months of the fiscal year’s end, including financial details and supporting documents.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 20 March 2024
The law generally allows deductions for all costs associated with taxable activities in Bahrain, such as the cost of production, refinement, remuneration of employees associated with these taxable activities (including social insurance and pensions paid for the benefit of these employees), and other operational losses.
All reasonable and justifiable costs of production and exploration of products sold during the current taxable year are deductible for tax purposes, provided that these expenses have not been deducted elsewhere in calculating net taxable income.
## Depreciation and depletion
Tax deductions may be claimed with respect to reasonable amounts for depreciation, obsolescence, exhaustion, and depletion incurred during the taxable year for properties used by the taxpayer in a trade or business from which income, taxable under the income tax law, is derived. Generally, such amounts may be claimed on a straight-line basis over the estimated remaining useful life of the properties, unless otherwise approved by the Minister of Finance.
## Taxes
All taxes and duties not imposed by the Bahrain income tax law, including customs duties, may be deducted from taxable income as stipulated in Bahrain's income tax law.
## Net operating losses
Unutilised losses may be carried forward and deducted up to an amount equivalent to the net income in future years as defined by the Bahrain income tax law. Carryback of losses is not permitted.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
There are no specific restrictions in the income tax law pertaining to payments made to foreign affiliates.
## DMTT deductions

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 20 March 2024
There is no legislation or mechanism for group relief or the taxation of group activities in Bahrain.
## DMTT transfer pricing
In computing the CE income or loss, CEs in Bahrain must adjust their income or loss in the books of accounts to align with the arm's-length principle when engaging in transactions with CEs located in a different jurisdiction within the same MNE group. The Executive Regulations provide for five transfer pricing methods (i.e. comparable uncontrolled price method, resale price method, cost plus method, transactional net margin method, and profit split method) for applying the arm’s-length principle, in a manner that is consistent with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines.
Further, in case there exists a bilateral or multilateral Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) with the relevant competent authority, the adjustment to the income or loss of the CE in Bahrain would have to be applied consistently per the arm’s-length price agreed under such APA.
In case of any loss on the sale or transfer of asset between CEs located within the Kingdom, the asset value would be required to be adjusted per the arm’s-length principle whilst determining the income or loss of those CEs.
Additionally, as part of the required compliances, CEs must prepare and maintain both a local file and a master file in a manner prescribed by the National Bureau for Revenue (NBR). The Executive Regulations outline the information required to be included in these files, which align with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines.

## Economic substance
### Introduction
Economic substance regulations were issued by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism (MOICT) on 23 December 2018. A guidelines document clarifying certain aspects of the regulations was published on 1 January 2020.
The regulations require entities falling within their scope (which excludes entities with no overseas activities) to satisfy certain economic substance requirements and to report on these matters within three months from their financial year-end. The first reporting was due on 31 March 2020 for entities whose financial year 2019 closed on 31 December. Economic substance submissions for the fiscal year 2020 should have been submitted between 3 May 2021 and 31 May 2021.
### Entities to which the regulations apply
The regulations apply to entities (corporations, branches, and partnerships) formed under MOICT legislation that conduct one or more of the following activities:
  * Distributions and service centres.
  * Headquarters.
  * Holding.
  * Leasing.
  * Shipping.
  * Intellectual property.
  * Banks.
  * Financing companies.
  * Insurance.
  * Investment business firms.
  * Fund administrators.
  * Passive collection of income from one of the above activities.


### Meeting economic substance requirements
In order to meet the economic substance requirements, an entity will have to evidence that:
  * Core income generating activities (CIGA) are conducted in Bahrain. This includes, in particular: 
    * an adequate amount of operating expenses
    * qualified employees, and
    * physical offices.
  * The entity is directed and managed from Bahrain. This includes, in particular, board of director meetings taking place in Bahrain at an adequate frequency with physical presence of a quorum of directors and actual strategic decisions taken during these, as well as keeping records in Bahrain.


### Holding companies
The guidelines clarify that pure holding entities (entities that carry out no other relevant activity than holding equity participations) will be considered to have adequate substance if they meet a simplified test (i.e. compliance with statutory obligations under commercial law, adequate level of qualified full-time employees resident in Bahrain, adequate offices/premises in Bahrain to hold and manage participations).
### What is 'adequate'
The guidelines clarify that 'adequate' should be understood under its ordinary meaning (i.e. 'enough or satisfactory for a particular purpose'). What is adequate for a company will be dependent on the particular facts of the company and its business activity.
### Intellectual property (IP)
Entities holding and managing IP will be facing a rebuttable presumption of failure of the economic substance test if the IP they hold and manage was obtained through purchase or funding of foreign research and development (R&D) and is licensed to foreign parties or monetised by them. Rebutting this presumption requires the provision of certain specific elements evidencing a high level of control exercised from Bahrain (e.g. business plan, employees information).
### Outsourcing to third-party service providers and related companies
The guidelines confirm that a company conducting a relevant activity can outsource core income generating activities to a third party/related company. This acknowledges the reality that many groups have centralised resources and business infrastructure in one (or a few) company(ies) in a country and that many groups use third party service providers to conduct certain activities associated, in particular, with the operations of entities deriving passive income.
The guidelines state that the company that outsources activities must maintain adequate supervision of the outsourced activities and that these activities must be outsourced in Bahrain and not abroad.
### Reporting
Reporting will take place via the National Bureau for Revenue's online International Tax Information Exchange System. Regulated entities might also have to report separately to their regulator (e.g. Central Bank of Bahrain).
## United States (US) Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA)
On 23 January 2017, the United States and Bahrain entered into a Model 1 FATCA IGA. The United States and Bahrain had previously agreed in substance to an FATCA IGA with effect as of 30 June 2014.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
On 29 June 2017, Bahrain signed the CRS Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA), committing to make its first exchange of information for CRS purposes by September 2018.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 20 March 2024
There are no specific rules in Bahrain on the calculation of specific items of income, such as inventory valuation, capital gains, dividend income, interest income, or foreign income.
## DMTT income determination
The CE income or loss under the DMTT law refers to the financial accounting net income before applying any consolidation adjustments to eliminate intra-group transactions, in line with the local financial accounting standards of the CEs. Additionally, the DMTT Law and its Executive Regulations outline specific adjustments to be factored into the determination of CE income or loss, including excluded dividends, excluded equity gains and losses, transfer pricing adjustments, and other relevant items in line with the GloBE Model Rules.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 20 March 2024
There are no general corporate income taxes in Bahrain on income, sales, capital gains, or estates, with the exception, in limited circumstances, to businesses (local and foreign) that operate in the oil and gas sector or derive profits from the extraction or refinement of fossil fuels (defined as hydrocarbons) in Bahrain. For such companies, a tax rate of 46% is levied on net profits for each tax accounting period, irrespective of the residence of the taxpayer.
## Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (DMTT)
The DMTT Law introduces a jurisdictional level top-up tax aimed at large multinational enterprise (MNE) groups, ensuring that a minimum effective tax rate (ETR) of 15% is met. Under the DMTT Law, if the aggregated results of Bahraini Constituent Entities (CEs) of an MNE group do not result in a 15% ETR, Bahrain will impose an additional tax to meet the 15% minimum ETR.
The DMTT Law will only apply to MNEs with global consolidated revenues (in at least two of the preceding four fiscal years) of at least 750 million euros (EUR). This includes MNEs headquartered in Bahrain, as well as any other MNEs (headquartered in other countries) with operations in Bahrain. The DMTT Law will not apply to local businesses with no operations outside Bahrain.
To simplify administration, the following safe harbour rules are provided in the DMTT Law:
  * Transitional Country-by-Country Reporting Safe Harbour (_de minimis_ test, ETR test, routine profits test).
  * Simplified Computation Safe Harbour (which incorporates similar tests as above, albeit under an alternative simplified income calculation methodology). Detailed rules and conditions for applying this safe harbor will be issued in due course.


The DMTT Law also provides for the following exclusions:
  * De Minimis Exclusion: The DMTT due is expected to be ‘nil’ if the following conditions are met: 
    * Average CE revenue (for the current and two preceding fiscal years) of all the CEs in Bahrain of an MNE group is less than EUR 10 million.
    * Average CE income or loss (for the current and two preceding fiscal years) of all the CEs in Bahrain of an MNE group is a loss or less than EUR 1 million.
  * Initial Phase of International Activity Exclusion: The DMTT will be reduced to nil, for a maximum period of five years, if the MNE group meets the following conditions: 
    * CEs are located in no more than six jurisdictions.
    * The net book value of tangible assets across all jurisdictions does not exceed EUR 50 million, excluding the jurisdiction where the MNE group has the highest value of tangible assets when the global minimum tax rules first apply to that MNE group.
    * No ownership interests in the CEs are held by a parent applying the Income Inclusion Rule.


The DMTT Law is effective for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2025.

## Value-added tax (VAT) and excise duty
VAT was implemented in Bahrain on 1 January 2019.
The standard VAT rate was 5% from 1 January 2019 until 31 December 2021. From 1 January 2022, the rate was increased to 10%, but transitional provisions applied in certain circumstances under which the 5% rate could apply on certain supplies made after 1 January 2022 until 31 December 2022 at the latest. The standard rate applies to most goods and services, with a number of exceptions where certain goods and services may be subject to a 0% rate or be exempt from VAT.
The mandatory registration threshold is 37,500 Bahraini dinars (BHD) for businesses resident in Bahrain, and the voluntary registration threshold is BHD 18,750. Non-resident businesses are required to register upon making the first supply subject to VAT in Bahrain.
Transitional provisions existed that increased the mandatory registration threshold to BHD 5 million from 1 January 2019 until 30 June 2019. The threshold was reduced to BHD 500,000 from 30 June 2019 until 31 December 2019. Thereafter, the standard threshold set out above apply.
