## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 20 July 2024
Introduction of a new Value-added Tax (VAT) Law, new Property Tax Law, and new Excise Duty Law, as well as an amendment to the Income Tax Law (ITL), in September 2023 has resulted in the following significant changes to corporate taxation, to mention a few:
  * Reduction of the corporate income tax (CIT) rate from 30% to 28%.
  * Inclusion of online supplies within the scope of taxable goods and services for VAT.
  * Sale of business assets for going concern is exempt from VAT provided that the transferring entity is engaged in supplying or providing exempted goods or services.
  * Goods falling under the exemption umbrella for VAT attain a zero-rated status upon export.
  * Locally assembled electric automotive vehicles, hybrid automotive vehicles, pertinent batteries, and their electric charging station equipment are zero-rated for VAT purposes.
  * Introduction of tax on sale of immovable property for commercial use applicable on its sale value in excess of 5 million Rwandan francs (RWF) at the rate of 2% or 2.5%, depending on whether the seller is registered for income tax or not.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 20 July 2024
## Taxable period
The normal taxable period is between January and December. However, a different tax period can be allowed on approval by the Minister of Finance.
## Tax returns
Companies are assessed with reference to accounting periods. This refers to the period for which a company prepares its accounts. However, an accounting period for CIT purposes cannot exceed 12 months, so companies preparing statutory accounts for longer than 12 months need to prepare more than one CIT return.
Rwanda operates a self-assessment regime. Quarterly tax returns are due on 30 June, 30 September, and 31 December (or by the sixth, ninth, and 12th month of the tax period). The annual tax return/declaration must be filed within three months after the tax period. The tax declaration must include audited financial statements, transfer pricing documentation, and any other documents that may be requested by the tax administration.
## Payment of tax
Advance CIT is payable in three instalments. Tax payments are due on 30 June, 30 September, and 31 December (or by the sixth, ninth, and 12th month of the tax period). Each instalment is arrived at by taking the tax liability as calculated in the tax return/declaration of the previous tax period times current quarter turnover over previous year annual turnover. This amount can be reduced by WHT paid during the tax period. The final payment of CIT for taxpayers with a December year-end is 31 March of the following year. In the case of other accounting year-ends, the final CIT payment is due by the last day of the third month following the accounting year-end.
## Tax audit process
Large taxpayers are selected for audit by the RRA on a regular basis. The RRA tends to audit two tax periods, but this can be extended on request by the taxpayer. Most audits are carried out on site. The RRA may conduct a desk audit of the taxpayer's tax affairs where they note discrepancies on tax returns filed by the taxpayer, anomalies with turnover, or any other situations that justify an audit.
Under normal in-depth audits, the RRA is required to issue a taxpayer with a draft notice of assessment following the completion of the field audit. The draft assessment is referred to as a rectification note. The taxpayer is granted 30 days within which to respond. In case the tax issues are not resolved, a final notice of assessment is issued. The taxpayer is allowed 30 days within which to appeal. Once an appeal is submitted to the Commissioner General, the RRA has 30 days within which to respond to the objection. This can be extended by another 30 days but not beyond this period. At this stage, the appeal is handled by the appeal committee, and the taxpayer and the taxpayer's agent are invited for a meeting to provide explanations.
Once the final assessment is issued, the tax due is payable, although the Commissioner General suspends the collection until the conclusion of the appeal if a taxpayer has paid the undisputed portion of the tax assessed.
There is a provision for resolving the dispute through an amicable settlement process. Taxpayers can opt for this approach while at the same time exploring the next stage of the appeal process.
A taxpayer that disagrees with the response on the final assessment can appeal to the high court within 30 days.
## Statute of limitations
The RRA has powers to audit a taxpayer for a period going back five years, although this can be extended to ten years in case it is established that the taxpayer has concealed information with intent to evade tax. Taxpayers are required to keep their records for a period of ten years.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Topics of interest for the RRA include:
  * Deduction of WHT on payments to non-resident persons and reverse VAT.
  * Treatment of capital gains on disposal of assets.
  * Recovery of reverse VAT on services that are regarded as being available in the local market.
  * Reconciliation of turnover per financial statements to receipts as per taxpayer bank statements.
  * Reconciliation of cost of sales to importations.
  * Reconciliation of turnover per financial statements to turnover declared in the VAT returns.
  * Reconciliation of employment/staff costs per financial statements to staff costs declared in the PAYE returns.
  * Transfer pricing arrangements
  * Supporting expenses with proper, sufficient documents.
  * Carry forward of tax losses.
  * Categorisation of business assets for tax depreciation purposes.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 20 July 2024
Rwanda incorporated companies or associations are treated as Rwanda resident entities. In addition, companies incorporated overseas are also treated as Rwandan resident companies if they have a place of effective management in Rwanda at any time during the tax period. The entity is deemed to have its place of effective management in Rwanda in one of the following circumstances:
  * Its day-to-day control and management are done in Rwanda.
  * Its shareholdersâ€™ meetings are held in Rwanda.
  * Its books of accounts are prepared and kept in Rwanda.
  * Its main shareholders or directors are residents of Rwanda.


Rwandan government companies are also considered to be residents in Rwanda.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The definition of a PE for Rwanda is largely based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Tax Convention definition. According to Rwandan tax law, a PE means a fixed place of business through which the business of a person is wholly or partially carried on.
For non-resident companies, CIT liability will arise if they have a PE in Rwanda through which a trade is carried on. The profits attributable to the PE will be taxed in Rwanda. However, there are no rules or guidance on how the PE's profit should be evaluated for Rwanda tax purposes. The general understanding is that entities are required to use transfer pricing methods to determine the level of profits that should be attributable to the PE based on the functions it performs.
In particular, the existence of the following triggers a PE:
  * A place of management.
  * A branch.
  * A factory or workshop.
  * A mine, quarry, or any other place for the exploitation of natural resources.
  * A site set for construction, construction site, or a place where supervision or assembly works are carried out.
  * A place of provision of services, including consulting services, carried on by a person, with the support of employees or other personnel, for more than 90 days in a 12-month period, either continuously or intermittently.


There are a number of specific exceptions from the definition of a PE. A person is deemed not to have a PE if that person:
  * uses facilities solely for the purpose of storage of their goods or merchandise
  * maintains a stock of their goods or merchandise solely for the purpose of storage
  * maintains a stock of their goods or merchandise solely for the purpose of processing by another person
  * has a place of operation aimed purposely at purchasing goods or merchandise or collecting information related to their business, or
  * has a place of operation solely for the purpose of performing, within the context of their activities, any other activities of a preparatory nature or intended to make them more effective.


A person is considered not to have a PE if they only carry out activities through an independent broker in the capital market, general commissionaire agent, or any other private agent in accordance with procedures of the ordinary course of the activities of such an agent. However, when the activities of the independent broker in the capital market or an agent are carried out wholly or almost wholly on behalf of the person referred above and conditions imposed between the person and the agent in their commercial and financial relations differ from those that would have been made between independent persons, that person is considered to have a PE.
An insurance entity, except in regard to re-insurance, is considered to have a PE if it collects premiums or insures risks through a person other than a broker in the capital market or an agent of an independent status. 
A company that controls or is controlled by another company does not, of itself, constitute either company to be a PE of the other.


# Rwanda
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 20 July 2024
A trading company is generally permitted to deduct expenses that are incurred wholly and exclusively for purposes of the company's trade, provided these costs are not capital in nature and are charged to the profit and loss account.
The Rwandan tax law stipulates that deductible expenses should fulfil the following conditions:
  * Incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of business and directly chargeable to the income.
  * Correspond to a real expense and can be substantiated with proper invoice or receipts accepted by the tax administration.
  * Lead to a decrease in the net assets of the business.
  * Used for activities related to the tax period in which they are incurred.


## Depreciation and amortisation
Accounting depreciation of fixed assets is not allowable as a deduction for tax purposes. The same applies in the case of amortisation of assets. However, businesses are allowed specified deductions, referred to as tax depreciation in respect of specified classes of assets. This is deducted in arriving at taxable income.
Tax depreciation allowance is granted to persons who own depreciable assets at the end of the tax period and use such assets in the production of income.
Land, fine arts, antiquities, jewellery, and any other assets that are not subject to wear and tear or obsolescence are not depreciated. Buildings, heavy industrial equipment, and machineries are depreciated annually, each on its own, at a depreciation rate of 5% of the cost of acquisition, construction, refining, rehabilitation, or reconstruction. This is done using a straight-line method.
Intangible assets that are purchased from a third party are depreciated annually, each on its own, at a depreciation rate of 10% of the cost of acquisition or value addition. Information and communication systems whose life is over ten years are depreciated annually at the rate of 10% of the cost of acquisition. Both intangible assets and information and communication systems with over ten years of useful life are depreciated using a straight-line method.
Computers and accessories, as well as information and communication systems whose life is under ten years, are granted tax depreciation at 50% on a reducing-balance method.
Tax depreciation allowance is available on any other business asset at the rate of 25% on a reducing-balance method.
## Goodwill
As mentioned above, intangible assets purchased from third parties (inclusive of goodwill) will attract tax depreciation at the rate of 10%, which is an allowable deduction. However, amortisation of goodwill is not tax deductible.
## Start-up expenses
There is no clear guidance on the tax treatment of start-up expenses. However, in practice, start-up expenses of a capital nature are not deductible for tax purposes. Where they relate to purchase of assets, respective tax depreciation is claimed. Start-up expenses of a revenue nature are tax deductible.
## Interest expenses
Interest on borrowed money used for earning business profit or interest in respect of an amount payable for property acquired to earn income is deductible, provided the interest paid is pursuant to a legal obligation and is reasonable under the circumstances.
Thin capitalisation rules can limit interest deductions when debt owed to related entities exceeds four times the amount of the corporation's paid-up equity, which excludes provisions/reserves and retained earnings according to the balance sheet (_see Thin capitalisation in the_ _section_).
## Bad debt
A deduction is allowed for bad debt if it fulfils the following conditions:
  1. The amount corresponding to the debt was previously included in the income of the taxpayer.
  2. Debt is written off in the books of accounts.
  3. Taxpayer has taken all possible steps in pursuing payment and has shown a court decision declaring the insolvency of a debtor.


However, for an individual whose debt is less than RWF 3 million, in addition to the conditions referred to in (i) and (ii), the taxpayer must provide proof that one has taken all reasonable steps over a period of three years to recover the debt.
Further, banks, a similar entity, and a leasing entity duly licensed as such are allowed to deduct from taxable income any increase of the mandatory reserve for non-performing loans as required by the directives related to management of loans of the National Bank of Rwanda. Similarly, the business profit is increased by the entire amount recovered from bad debts deducted from such reserves.
## Charitable contributions
Donations and gifts to charitable organisations and other non-profit making organisations are tax deductible to the extent of 1% of turnover. Consequently, donations to profit making organisations, irrespective of the amount, and any donations above 1% of turnover to non-profit making organisations are not allowed as deductions for CIT purposes.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and similar penalties imposed for breaking the law or for statutory offences, such as late payment of taxes, are not tax deductible.
The law does not specify which type of non-statutory fines or penalties are not allowed for tax. For example, there is no guidance on whether fines or penalties paid for breach of contract are deductible or not.
## Taxes
Income tax paid on business profit and recoverable VAT are not deductible for tax purposes. This includes any back taxes paid by the business.
## Net operating losses
Tax losses can only be carried forward for five tax periods, earlier losses being deducted before later losses. However, on application, the tax administration may authorise the taxpayer to carry forward the tax loss for more than five tax periods. This is subject to fulfilment of certain conditions.
If the direct or indirect ownership of the share capital or the voting rights of an unlisted company changes more than 25% by value or by number during a tax period, such a company is restricted from carrying forward losses incurred during the tax period and previous tax periods. However, this provision will cease to apply if the change is a result of restructuring that maintains all the shareholders, provided that they have been shareholders for at least three years.
There are no provisions for carrying back tax losses.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Management, technical, and royalty fees paid to related non-residents are deductible expenses to the extent that:
  * they do not exceed 2% of the turnover of the taxpayer, and
  * they are incurred to earn income of the Rwandan company, adhere to the arm's-length principle, and comply with transfer pricing requirements.




# Rwanda
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 20 July 2024
There is no provision for group taxation in Rwanda. Each individual corporate group member is required to submit their own tax return on a stand-alone basis.
## Transfer pricing
Rwandan transfer pricing legislation and the prescribed transfer pricing methods are generally consistent with OECD guidelines. The law requires that transactions between related parties be carried out under the arm's-length principle.
The tax law empowers the Commissioner General to adjust profits earned between related parties if the Commissioner General considers that the trading arrangements between related parties do not adhere to the arm's-length principle. The arm's-length principle requires that transfer prices charged between related parties are equivalent to those that would be charged between independent parties in the same circumstances.
Rwanda operates a self-assessment system; consequently, taxpayers are obligated to self-assess their compliance to the tax legislation, which includes transfer pricing policy. According to the transfer pricing ministerial order, related persons involved in controlled transactions are required to have documents justifying that their prices are applied according to the armâ€™s-length principle. This means that companies are expected to have transfer pricing policies and documentation. The newly issued Tax Procedures Law (TPL) also requires that documentation be submitted to the revenue authority along with the annual CIT return.
Failure to do so would result in the tax administrationâ€™s adjustment of transaction prices in accordance with general rules on transfer pricing issued by an Order of the Minister as well as imposition of penalties and interest.
## Thin capitalisation
The interest paid on loans and advances from related entities is not tax deductible to the extent that the total amount of loans/advances exceeds four times the amount of paid-up equity, which excludes provisions/reserves and retained earnings according to the balance sheet during the tax period. This provision does not apply to commercial banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no provisions in Rwanda for CFCs.


# Rwanda
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 20 July 2024
The tax law does not prescribe special provisions for taxation of branches; consequently, tax rates on the profits of PEs are the same as for domestic corporations. PEs are subject to tax at a rate of 28% and treated as domestic companies.
A branch is considered a PE for the parent company; consequently, it is taxed on the income that is sourced from Rwanda only.


# Rwanda
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 20 July 2024
There are tax incentives in the form of lower CIT rates (_see in the_ _Taxes on corporate income_ _section_) for registered investors.

There are, however, certain conditions that have to be fulfilled to obtain the incentives above.
## Foreign tax credit
Rwanda allows a foreign tax credit on income generated from business activities performed abroad by a tax resident. The income tax payable is offset by the foreign tax paid on that income. However, the foreign tax credit is limited to the amount of tax that would have been applicable on that income in Rwanda.
The credit is allowed where it is supported by appropriate evidence, such as a tax declaration, a WHT certificate, or any other similar acceptable document.


# Rwanda
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 20 July 2024
WHT of 15% of the total amount, excluding VAT, is required to be accounted for on payments or other methods of extinguishing an obligation made by resident individuals, including tax-exempt entities. The WHT is due where such payments or other methods of extinguishing an obligation are made to a person not registered with the tax administration or to a registered person who does not have recent income tax declaration.
Payments or other methods of extinguishing an obligation subject to WHT of 15% are related to the following:
  * Dividends, except dividends paid between resident companies and income distributed to the holders of shares or units in collective investment schemes.
  * Financial interests, except interests on deposits in financial institutions for at least a period of one year; interests on loans granted by a foreign development financial institution exempted from income tax under applicable law in the country of origin; and interests paid by banks or deposit-taking micro-finance institutions operating in Rwanda to banks or other foreign financial institutions.
  * Royalties.
  * Service fees, including management and technical service fees, except transport services.
  * Performance payments made to a crafts person, a musician, an artist, or a player in sports, cultural, or leisure activities, irrespective of whether paid directly or indirectly.
  * Goods sold in Rwanda.


  * Profit after tax or retained earnings that are converted into shares, except for financial institutions with paid-up capital below the minimum requirement set by the National bank of Rwanda.
  * Profits repatriated from Rwanda.
  * Payments made in cash or in kind by a resident person in Rwanda on behalf of a non-resident in Rwanda contracted person provided for under the contract in addition to contractual remuneration.
  * Reinsurance premiums paid to non-resident insurers except premiums paid to insurers that have signed agreements with the Government of Rwanda.


However, money that is recorded in the books of accounts as a liability of a taxpayer to creditors and that reduces the taxable income is deemed a payment if it has exceeded six months following the tax period.
WHT is also applicable to non-resident persons for such payments on behalf of their PEs. This means that the local entity/PE is now required to declare and pay WHT at the time when the non-resident pays the foreign supplier on its behalf and not when the non-resident recharges for the costs.
As mentioned above, a WHT of 15% is required to be accounted for on a number of payments. However, the WHT shall be 5% if levied on:
  * dividends and interest on securities listed on capital market when the beneficiary of the dividends or interest is a resident taxpayer of Rwanda or of the East African Community, and
  * interests derived from treasury bonds with a maturity of at least three years.


There is also a WHT of 5% that is applicable on goods imported for commercial use. Public institutions are required to retain 3% on payments to winners of public tenders; however, the same is increased to 15% if the winner of the public tender is not registered with the tax administration or when registered does not have their previous income tax declaration. Note that businesses that possess a tax clearance certificate are exempted from deduction of all above WHT.
The ITL is also imposing WHT at the rate of 15% on the difference between winnings of the player and the stake invested by the player of gaming activities. The same has to be withheld by the gaming activities operator.
The WHT deducted should be remitted to the RRA within 15 days following the month of deduction.
## Tax treaties
Rwanda has DTTs with Barbados, Belgium, the People's Republic of China, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jersey, Luxembourg, Mauritius, Morocco, Qatar, Singapore, South Africa, Turkey, and The United Arab Emirates. The WHT rates are as follows:
Recipient | WHT (%)  
---|---  
Dividends | Interest | Royalty | Management or professional fees  
Non-treaty | 15 | 15 | 15 | 15  
Treaty:  
Barbados | 7.5 | 10 | 10 | 15  
Belgium | 0/15 | 10 | 10 | 10

Turkey | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10  
United Arab Emirates | 7.5 | 10 | 10 | 10  
The DTTs contain conditions to be complied with for the preferential rates to apply; consequently, it is recommended that professional advice is sought before application.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 20 July 2024
## Inventory valuation
Trading stock is valued at cost; however, damaged stock is valued at lower of cost price or market price on the last day of the tax period. Work in progress is valued at cost.
## Capital gains
_See Capital_ _gains tax (CGT) in the section_.
## Dividend income
Dividend income includes income from shares in any societies, other similar income that may be generated by all entities that pay CIT, as well as the outstanding balance after the taxation of income from the correction made by the tax administration in the transfer pricing.
Dividend income is subject to withholding tax (WHT) at the flat rate of 15%. Where there is a double taxation treaty (DTT) between the recipient country and Rwanda, a lower rate as per the DTT will apply.
If dividend distribution has been subjected to WHT, this becomes the final tax. Dividends paid between resident companies are exempt to WHT and are not included in taxable income for CIT purposes.
## Financial income
Financial income includes income from loans, debentures, or other debt securities; income from deposits; income from guarantees; and income from government securities, negotiable securities issued by the government, securities issued by companies or other persons, and income from cash negotiable securities.
Financial income is subject to WHT at a flat rate of 15%. Where there is a DTT between the recipient country and Rwanda, a lower rate as per the DTT will apply.
However, the following financial interests are not subject to the 15% WHT:
  * Interests on deposits in financial institutions for at least a period of one year.
  * Interests on loans granted by a foreign development financial institution exempted from income tax under applicable law in the country of origin.
  * Interests paid by banks or deposit-taking micro-finance institutions operating in Rwanda to banks or other foreign financial institutions.

  * as the price or consideration of using, or of the right to use, industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment or for using information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific knowledge or formula, and
  * on the right to exploit or explore natural resources.


Royalty income is subject to WHT at a flat rate of 15%. Where there is a DTT between the recipient country and Rwanda, a lower rate as per the DTT will apply.
## Rental income
Rental income includes all revenue derived from rent of machinery and other equipment, including agriculture and livestock equipment, in Rwanda. This is reduced by 10% of gross revenue as deemed expenses, interest paid on loans, and depreciation expenses.
## Foreign income
Resident companies and enterprises are taxed on their worldwide income. However, a foreign tax credit is granted in respect of taxes paid on the foreign income, subject to the limit of the tax that would have been paid in Rwanda on the same income.
There are no provisions in Rwanda for tax deferral of income earned abroad.


# Rwanda
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 20 July 2024
Rwanda operates both a source and residence-based taxation system. This means that any income that is deemed to be from sources within Rwanda is liable to tax in Rwanda. In addition, resident entities are taxed on their worldwide income. However, where such income is taxed in another country, a tax credit is allowed, which does not exceed the tax that would have been payable on the same income in Rwanda.
Non-resident entities are taxed on income sourced in Rwanda through a permanent establishment (PE).
The standard CIT rate is 28%. However, micro-enterprise companies (with turnover of less than RWF 12 million in a tax period) pay flat tax amounts depending on their turnover amounts, and small businesses (whose turnover is between RWF 12 million and RWF 20 million in a tax period) pay a lump sum tax at the rate of 3% of turnover.
Flat tax amounts payable by micro-enterprise companies are as per the table below:
Annual turnover (RWF) | Annual flat tax amount (RWF)  
---|---  
2 million to 4 million | 60,000  
4 million to 7 million | 120,000  
7 million to 10 million | 210,000  
10 million to 12 million | 300,000  
Also, road transport activities of persons and goods are imposed a flat amount of tax that is calculated depending on the passenger or goods carrying capacity.
## Special CIT regimes
There are special CIT rates for certain industries or sectors of the economy.
Newly listed companies on capital markets are taxed as follows for a period of five years:
  * If a company sells at least 30% of their shares to the public, the CIT rate is 25%.
  * If a company sells at least 40% of their shares to the public, the CIT rate is 20%.


Income accruing from savings in the collective investment schemes or Rwandan employeesâ€™ share-based scheme, provided that employees' shares in the company do not exceed 10% of companyâ€™s share capital, is exempt.
Agriculturalists and pastoralists are exempt from CIT if turnover from their activities does not exceed RWF 12 million in a tax period.
Deposit-taking micro-finance institutions approved by competent authorities pay CIT at the rate of 0% for a period of five years from the time of their approval.
Registered investors in priority sectors can enjoy reduced CIT rates and tax holidays where certain conditions and thresholds are fulfilled (_see the_ _section for more information_).
## Local income taxes
Rwandan legislation does not provide for any provincial or local taxes on income.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 20 July 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is levied on the supply of taxable goods and services, including online services, in Rwanda as well as on the importation of taxable goods and services into Rwanda.
The threshold for VAT registration is taxable turnover of RWF 20 million in any relevant year or RWF 5 million in a calendar quarter.
The standard VAT rate is 18% and applies to goods and services that are neither exempt from VAT nor zero-rated.
Services supplied are taxable if:
  * The service recipient and the service provider are residents of Rwanda.
  * The service recipient is a resident of Rwanda and the service is useful to the recipient in Rwanda.
  * The service provider is a resident of Rwanda and the service is useful to the recipient in Rwanda.


Exports of goods and services are subject to VAT at 0%. Supplies to privileged persons, such as goods imported for official purposes of diplomatic missions, supplies made under special arrangements between the government of Rwanda and donors, and supplies or importation made under special technical aid agreements, are subject to VAT at 0%. Persons entitled to zero rating of goods or supplies received by them are required to pay VAT at the time of receiving the supply and then apply for a refund of the VAT paid or rather engage a revenue authority so they can affix a signature and a stamp on the VAT invoices so that the VAT is not paid on such invoices.
Some supplies are exempt from VAT, the main categories being supply of clean water service; goods and services for health purposes; educational materials and services; transport services; books, newspapers, and journals; financial and insurance services; lending or leasing interests in land or building for residential purposes; funeral services; energy supplies; lease of exempted goods; all unprocessed agricultural and livestock products; agricultural insurance services; gaming activities; goods and services for a special economic zone; mobile handsets; equipment for information, communication, and technology; goods sold in customs; aircraft and its spare parts/maintenance tools; and imported electric vehicles and accessories.
Suppliers who provide zero-rated services or goods are entitled to recover input VAT incurred in making the supply. This is unlike exempt supplies, where input VAT recovery is not allowed. Therefore, zero rating is preferable to exemption.
The VAT returns and relevant payment are due to the Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA) on a monthly basis by the 15th day of the following month. However, for taxpayers whose annual turnover is equal to or less than RWF 200 million, the VAT declaration is done quarterly and the payment of the tax due is within 15 days after the end of the quarter. Voluntary VAT declaration on a monthly basis is, however, still admissible for taxpayers in this bracket.
## Customs duties
Rwanda is a member of the East African Community (EAC), Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), and African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). Common External Tariffs (CET) levied by all those economic blocks where Rwanda is part of are generally as follows:
  * 0% for raw materials and capital goods.
  * 10% for intermediate goods.
  * 25% for finished goods.


Goods will only enjoy the preferential community tariffs if they meet the EAC Customs Union Rules of Origin.
Certain industries and items are also entitled to exemptions under the customs law (e.g. certain hotel equipment, solar equipment, computer software, and electric vehicles, spare parts, batteries, and charging station equipment).
Enterprises established in Free Trade Zones are exempt from customs duty on imports for exported products. There also exists an import duty remission scheme, where import duty may be waived for raw materials used to manufacture goods for export. This is subject to a requirement for proof of export and execution of the bond.
All imported goods, except those listed as exempt, are also subject to the 1.5% Infrastructure Development Levy (IDL) and the 0.2% African Union Levy (AUL). Additionally, imported goods, regardless of whether they are exempted, are subject to a 0.2% Quality Inspection Fee (QIF). The levies are computed on the customs value of imported goods.

## Immovable property tax
The immovable property tax is assessed and paid by the owner, the usufructuary, or any other person considered to be the owner. The immovable property tax is levied on the market value of a building and surface of a plot of land.
If the immovable property consists of a plot of land that is not built, the tax on immovable property is calculated on each square metre of the whole surface of the plot of land. Where the immovable property consists of a plot of land, a building, and its improvements, the tax on immovable property for a plot of land is calculated separately on each square metre, while the tax on the building and its improvements is based on the market value.
The tax rate on buildings is determined as follows:
  * 0.5% of the market value of both the building and a related plot of land for residential use. However, the Law offers special rates for residential buildings with the following features:


    * A plot and a building of three floors that is used for residential purposes is taxed at the rate of 0.25% of its market value.
    * A plot and a building for residential use with more than three floors is taxed at the rate of 0.1% of its market value.


  * 0.3% of the market value of both the building and a related plot of land for commercial use.
  * 0.1% of the market value of both the building and a related plot of land for industrial use, as well as buildings and plot belonging to micro enterprises and small business.


The tax rate on plots of land varies between RWF 0 and RWF 80 per square metre. Any undeveloped plot of land is subject to additional tax of 100% of what is arrived at using the rates per square metre.
For the first assessment cycle of five years, declaration of immovable property tax is made to the tax administration not later than 31 December of the first tax period. A new declaration of immovable property tax for the second assessment cycle and going forward will be filed not later than 31 December of the last year of each tax assessment cycle.
## Transfer taxes
The sale of immovable property that is for commercial use results in immovable property tax at the rate of 2% where the seller is a registered taxpayer or at the rate of 2.5% where the seller is an unregistered taxpayer. This tax is on the amount in excess of the first RWF 5 million of the selling price.
## Stamp taxes
There are no stamp duties in Rwanda.
## Capital gains tax (CGT)
CGT is charged on the direct or indirect sale or transfer of shares. The CGT is charged at the rate of 5% of the capital gain. The capital gain on sale or transfer of shares is determined as the difference between the acquisition value of the shares and their selling or transfer price.
CGT is required to be collected and remitted to the revenue authority by the company in which the share sale or share transfer transaction occurred.
CGT is required to be declared and paid within 15 days following the month in which the sale or transfer of shares occurred.
However, the following transactions are exempted from capital gains tax:
  * Capital gains from the sale or transfer of listed shares and other securities on the capital market.
  * Capital gains from the sale or transfer of shares or units of collective investment schemes.
  * Capital gains resulting from restructuring of companies.


Corporate restructuring is defined to include the following:
  * A merger of two or more resident companies into a separate company.
  * The acquisition or a takeover of 50% or more of shares or voting rights by number or value in a resident company.
  * The acquisition or transfer of 50% or more of the assets and liabilities of a resident company by another company.
  * The acquisition or transfer of the entire companyâ€™s shares, assets, or liabilities so that its existence is replaced by the purchasing company.

## Social security contributions
All people working in Rwanda, both nationals and foreigners, are required to contribute to a national social security contribution fund managed by the Rwanda Social Security Board (RSSB). The rate of contribution under the mandatory pension scheme is fixed at 12% of the employee's gross salary. The employer and the employee are each required to contribute 6% of the employeeâ€™s gross salary to the scheme..

## Trading licence fee
Districts charge a trading licence fee, which is paid by any person who commences a profit-oriented activity in Rwanda. The tax year starts on 1 January and ends on 31 December, and the trading licence fee must be paid for a whole year. If such activity starts after January, the taxpayer must pay a trading licence fee equivalent to the remaining months, including the one in which the activities started.
The tax declaration is made not later than 31 January of the year that corresponds to the tax period. The trading licence fee is calculated on the basis of turnover, and the amount of the fee varies between RWF 100,000 (for turnover of more than RWF 2 million) and RWF 2 million (for turnover of over RWF 50 billion).
The turnover applied is as per the amount approved in the previous year by the RRA. Every year, not later than 31 January, the RRA submits the necessary data to the concerned decentralised entity.
There are also different trading licence fee rates for other small traders. These include profit-oriented activities that are not registered on income tax that are in urban and rural zones, transporters of people and goods on vehicles, boats, and motorcycles.
