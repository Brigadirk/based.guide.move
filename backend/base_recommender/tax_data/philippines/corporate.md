## Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises to Maximize Opportunities for Reinvigorating the Economy (CREATE MORE) Act
On 8 November 2024, President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. signed the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises to Maximize Opportunities for Reinvigorating the Economy (CREATE MORE) Act into law (Republic Act No. 12066). The CREATE MORE Act aims to generate jobs and spur economic growth. It builds on the earlier CREATE Act by enhancing the tax regime and incentive framework to attract both domestic and international investments, particularly, in strategic industries. The CREATE MORE Act took effect on 28 November 2024.
Here are the salient features of the law:
  * Registered business enterprises under the Enhanced Deduction Regime are subject to the 20% corporate income tax rate
  * Sales to export-oriented enterprises (70% export sales) are treated as Value-Added Tax (VAT) zero-rated if directly attributable to export activities
  * Export sales, as defined under Executive Order No. 226, are generally omitted from enumeration of VAT zero-rated sales
  * Sales to bonded manufacturing warehouses of export-oriented enterprises are VAT zero-rated
  * Additional due process requirements in the processing of input VAT refund claims
  * Mandatory issuance of electronic invoices (e-Invoices) for certain taxpayers
  * Additional deduction for micro/small taxpayers and medium/large using e-Invoices
  * The 5% Special Corporate Income Tax is in lieu of all taxes including local fees and charges
  * Additional deductions for export and domestic market enterprises under the Enhanced Deduction Regime
  * Local government units may impose local taxes on Registered Business Enterprises up to 2% of gross income


## Digital Services Tax Act (DSTA)
Republic Act No. 12023 or the Digital Services Tax Act (DSTA) was enacted last 2 October 2024 and became effective on 18 October 2024. This law imposes 12% VAT on digital services supplied by non-resident digital services providers (NDSPs) whose products are consumed in the Philippines.
Here are some salient provisions of the law:
  * Digital service shall refer to any service that is supplied over the internet or other electronic network with the use of information technology and where the supply of service is essentially automated. All NDSPs whose gross annual sales are expected to exceed the VAT threshold (which is currently P3 million) are required to register for VAT.
  * Non-residents are only liable to remit the VAT on their supply of digital services in business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions, and in case they are classified as an e-marketplace (with respect to sales of non-resident sellers that go through their platform).
  * Business-to-business (B2B) transactions, under a reverse charge mechanism, should be accounted for and remitted by the Philippine resident business consumer.
  * In determining a contracting party’s business status (i.e., engaged in business or not), both the DSPs and consumers may rely on the documents submitted by their contracting parties.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 25 February 2025
## Taxable period
The accounting period must follow a 12-month fiscal period but may or may not follow the calendar year. Most Philippine companies have a fiscal year that ends in December, March or June.
## Tax returns
Corporations should file their returns and compute their income on the basis of an accounting period of 12 months.
Corporate taxpayers file self-assessed returns. Electronic filing and payment of taxes are available under the Electronic Filing and Payment System (eFPS) of the BIR. Additionally, under the Ease of Paying Taxes (EOPT) Act, taxpayers can now file their tax returns and pay their taxes, either electronically or manually, with any Authorized Agent Bank, Revenue District Office (through its Revenue Collection Officers), or Authorized Software Provider. This file-and-pay anywhere system provides flexibility and convenience for taxpayers. 
The following corporate taxpayers who are not covered by eFPS are required to use Electronic BIR Forms (eBIRForms) in filing their tax returns:
  * Accredited tax agents/practitioners and all their client-taxpayers who authorised them to file on their behalf.
  * Accredited printers of principal and supplementary receipts/invoices.
  * One-time transaction taxpayers.
  * Those who shall file a ‘No Payment’ return, except senior citizens or persons with disabilities filing their own return, employees deriving purely compensation income and the income tax of which has been withheld correctly, employees qualified for substituted filing but opted to file for an income tax return and are filing for purposes of promotion (Philippine National Police and Armed Forces of the Philippines), loans, scholarships, foreign travel requirements, etc.
  * Government-owned or controlled corporations.
  * Local government units, except barangays.
  * Cooperatives registered with the National Electrifications Administration and Local Water Utilities Administrations.


Taxpayers who are required to file their returns using eFPS or eBIRForms but fail to do so shall be subject to a penalty of PHP 1,000 per return and civil penalties equivalent to 25% of the tax due.
A domestic or resident foreign corporation is required to file cumulative income tax returns on a quarterly basis. Within 60 days from the close of each of the first three quarters of its taxable year, the corporation must file a return summarising its gross income and deductions for the year to date. A final annual income tax return must be filed on or before the 15th day of the fourth month following the close of the taxable year.
Corporate taxpayers must file their income tax returns using one of three different forms, depending on their tax regime (i.e. subject only to the regular income tax, tax exempt, or with mixed income subject to multiple tax rates or special/preferential rates).
## Payment of tax
The Philippines follows a pay-as-you-file system for income tax, so the quarterly and annual income tax payments would fall due on the same filing deadlines discussed above. The balance of the tax due after deducting the quarterly payments must be paid, while the excess may be claimed as a refund or tax credit. Excess estimated quarterly income taxes paid may be carried over and credited against estimated quarterly income tax liabilities for succeeding taxable years. Once the option to carry over has been made, such option is irrevocable, and no cash refund or tax credit certificate (TCC) is allowed, except upon liquidation of the company.
Since additional modes of payment of taxes are now available through credit, debit, and prepaid cards under recently issued Revenue Regulations, taxpayers may choose from the available online payment facilities provided by the Electronic Payment Service Provider (EPSP) to process tax payments. However, only accredited Authorised Agent Banks (AABs) may accept such payments, and accreditation of AABs is subject to compliance with certain conditions under existing Regulations.
Payment of taxes through the Card Payment Facility shall be deemed made on the date and time appearing in the system-generated payment confirmation receipt issued to the taxpayer-cardholder by the AAB-acquirer, provided that the payment was actually received by the BIR. The taxpayer is not relieved of, and has a continuing liability for, such taxes until the payment is actually received by the BIR.
## Annual statutory audit
An annual statutory audit is required by the Securities and Exchange Commission for all corporations which meet the threshold: (1) any stock and non-stock corporation whose total assets or total liabilities are PHP 600,000 or more, as prescribed under the Revised Corporation Code of the Philippines; and (2) branch offices or representative offices of stock foreign corporations with assigned capital of PHP 1,000,000 or more, and (3) branch offices or representative offices of non-stock foreign corporations with total assets of PHP 1,000,000 or more; and (4) regional operating headquarters of foreign corporations with total revenues worth PHP 1,000,000 or more.
On the other hand, the National Internal Revenue Code requires that corporations, companies, partnerships, or persons whose gross annual sales, earnings, receipts or output exceed PHP 3,000,000 must have their books of accounts audited and examined yearly by an independent Certified Public Accountant (CPA).
## Statute of limitations
There is no statutory obligation on the Tax Commissioner to make an assessment for internal revenue taxes, and most taxes are collected based on the taxpayer’s self-calculation. If an assessment is to be issued, however, it must be done within three years from the deadline or the date of actual filing of the return, whichever is later. The taxpayer and the Commissioner can, however, agree in writing to extend this period.
In the case of a false or fraudulent return or of failure to file a return, the tax may be assessed or a proceeding in court for collection may be commenced without assessment at any time within ten years from the discovery of the falsity, fraud, or omission.
Any internal revenue tax that has been assessed within the period of limitation may be collected by distraint or levy or by a proceeding in court within five years following the assessment of the tax.
The prescription periods are suspended in certain circumstances, such as when the offender is absent from the Philippines, when the Commissioner grants a taxpayer’s request for a reinvestigation, or when the taxpayer and the BIR agree to extend the prescriptive period for assessment through a written waiver.
The BIR has a period of 180 days to decide on a refund claim for overpaid taxes. In case of denial of the claim for tax refund, or the failure on the part of the CIR to act on the application within the 180-day period, the taxpayer may appeal the decision with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) within 30 days.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
During audits, the BIR generally covers all applicable internal revenue taxes. In recent years, the BIR has been separately auditing VAT in certain cases in an effort to collect more. A bit more attention and scrutiny is placed on taxation of cross-border transactions, particularly in terms of VAT and WHT implications. Additionally, the BIR has increased its focus on digital businesses and the taxation of e-commerce transactions.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 25 February 2025
A domestic corporation is a corporation that is created or organised under Philippine laws. A foreign corporation that is duly licensed to engage in trade or business within the Philippines is referred to as a ‘resident foreign corporation’.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The business profits provision in most Philippine treaties permits the Philippines to tax only those profits attributable to a PE. While Philippine treaties adopt the United Nations (UN) Model Convention, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) commentaries have often been cited by tax authorities to support their interpretation of treaty provisions. The main implication is that most Philippine treaties contain a rule deeming a PE to arise when services are performed in the Philippines for a specified period of time.


# Philippines
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 25 February 2025
Corporate taxpayers can avail themselves of the optional standard deduction computed at 40% of gross income. The optional standard deduction is _in lieu_ of the itemised operating expenses.
## Depreciation and depletion
Depreciation is generally computed on a straight-line basis, although there are a variety of acceptable depreciation methods. Management should select the method regarded as most appropriate, based on the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits, so as to allocate depreciation on a systematic basis over the asset's useful life. Gain on the sale of depreciated property is taxable as ordinary income. Generally, tax depreciation should conform to book depreciation, unless the former includes incentives.
Properties used in petroleum operations may be depreciated over a period of ten years using the straight-line or declining-balance method, at the option of the service contractor. Properties used in mining operations with expected life of more than ten years may be depreciated over any number of years between five years and their expected life.
A cost depletion allowance is available as follows:
  * For oil and gas wells, depletion is based on actual reduction in flow and production ascertained, not by flush flow, but by the settled production or regular flow.
  * For mines, depletion is allowable up to an amount not to exceed the market value, as used for purposes of imposing the mining _ad valorem_ taxes, of the products mined and sold during the year.


## Goodwill
Amortisation of goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses are deductible when incurred.
## Interest expenses
The allowable deduction for interest expense shall be reduced by an amount equal to 20% of interest income that is subject to final tax, if any. 
## Bad debts
Bad debts are deductible expenses when written-off, subject to certain requirements.
## Charitable contributions
The deduction for charitable contributions ordinarily may not exceed 5% of taxable income. However, contributions to certain institutions are 100% deductible, subject to certain conditions.
## Entertainment expenses
Entertainment, amusement, and recreation expenses should not exceed 0.5% of net sales for taxpayers engaged in the sale of goods or properties, or 1% of net revenue for taxpayers engaged in the sale of services, including professionals and lessors of properties.
## Special deductions
Special deductions are allowed for certain businesses (e.g. insurance, mining, petroleum, and real estate investment trust).
Labour training expenses incurred for skills development of enterprise-based trainees enrolled in public senior high schools, public higher education institutions, or public technical and vocational institutions are subject to additional deduction of 50% of such expense, subject to certain conditions.
## Fines and penalties
Interest penalties are deductible. Surcharge and compromise penalties imposed for non-payment or late payment of taxes are not deductible for tax purposes.
## Taxes
Corporate taxpayers can claim a deduction for all taxes paid or accrued within the taxable year in connection with their trade or business, except for the following:
  * Philippine CIT.
  * Income taxes imposed by authority of any foreign country, unless the taxpayer elects to take a deduction _in lieu_ of a foreign tax credit. For a resident foreign corporation, the only option is to deduct; foreign tax credit is not allowed to be claimed (_see Foreign tax credit in the section for more information_).
  * Donor’s tax and estate tax.
  * Taxes assessed against local benefits of a kind tending to increase the value of the property assessed.


In the case of a foreign corporation, deductions for taxes are allowed only if they are connected with income from sources within the Philippines.
## Net operating losses
A net operating loss for any taxable year immediately preceding the current taxable year, which had not been previously offset as a deduction from gross income, may be carried over as a deduction from gross income for the next three consecutive taxable years immediately following the year of this loss (except losses during the period when the taxpayer was tax-exempt), provided there has been no substantial change in the ownership of the business or enterprise where 75% of the paid up capital or nominal value of the shares are held by the same persons.
Under Republic Act No. 11494 or the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act, net operating loss for the taxable year 2020 and 2021 may be carried over for the next five consecutive taxable years following such loss.
For mines, other than oil and gas wells, a net operating loss calculated without the benefit of incentives provided for under EO No. 226, or the Omnibus Investments Code of 1987, as amended, incurred in any of the first ten years of operation may be carried over as a deduction from taxable income for the next five years immediately following the year of such loss.
Loss carrybacks are not allowed.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
A Philippine corporation can claim a deduction for royalties, management service fees, and interest charges paid to foreign affiliates, under arm's-length terms, where the appropriate WHTs are withheld and remitted.
## Head office expense allocations
A resident foreign corporation is allowed to claim allocated head office expenses as a deduction, subject to certain requirements.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 25 February 2025
There is no group taxation in the Philippines.
## Transfer pricing
Transfer Pricing Regulations govern the cross-border and domestic transactions between associated enterprises. The Regulations state that the 'arm’s-length principle' shall be adopted in determining the transfer price in related-party transactions. The application of the arm's-length principle may follow a 'three-step' approach prescribed by the BIR under the Regulations, which are: (i) the conduct of a comparability analysis, (ii) the identification of the tested party and the appropriate transfer pricing method, and (iii) the determination of the arm's-length results.
Taxpayers must keep adequate documentation supporting their transfer prices so that they can defend their transfer pricing analysis, mitigate the risk of transfer pricing adjustments arising from tax examinations, and support their applications for Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP). There is also a 'contemporaneous' requirement that transfer pricing documents must exist or be brought into existence at the time the taxpayers develop or implement any arrangements that may raise transfer pricing issues. Certain taxpayers are also required to file BIR Form No. 1709 (Information Return on Transactions with Related Party) with their annual income tax returns while transfer pricing documentation should be maintained and submitted to the BIR when required or requested during an audit/investigation.
The BIR has issued a Revenue Audit Memorandum Order that provides guidelines to BIR examiners in relation to the audit of transfer pricing of related-party transactions.
These guidelines apply to, but are not limited to, controlled transactions between related parties/associated enterprises, where at least one party is assessable or chargeable to tax in the Philippines on transactions between a PE and its head office or other branches. Based on this, the PE will be treated as a separate and distinct enterprise from its head office or other related branches/subsidiaries for tax purposes.
Under BIR Regulations, a taxpayer should file BIR Form No. 1709 (Related Party Transactions Form) if it is required to file an Annual Income Tax Return (AITR), it has transactions with a domestic or foreign related party during the concerned taxable year, and it falls under any of the following categories: (i) large taxpayers, (ii) taxpayers enjoying tax incentives, (iii) taxpayers reporting net operating losses for the current taxable year and immediately preceding two consecutive taxable years, or (iv) a related party that has transactions with either (i), (ii), or (iii).
Those required to file the Related Party Transactions Form are required to prepare Transfer Pricing Documentation should they breach any of the following materiality thresholds namely: (i) annual gross revenue for the taxable year exceeding PHP 150 million and the total amount of related party transactions exceeds PHP 90 million, (ii) sale of tangible goods involving the same related party exceeding PHP 60 million within the taxable year, (iii) service transactions, interest payments, utilisation of intangible goods, or other related party transactions involving the same related party exceeding PHP 15 million within the taxable year, and (iv) if Transfer Pricing Documentation was required to be prepared during the immediately preceding taxable year for exceeding (i), (ii), or (iii).
## Thin capitalisation
There are generally no thin capitalisation rules in the Philippines.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no CFC rules in the Philippines.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 25 February 2025
The income tax rate on branch profits is the same as on corporate profits. In general, profits remitted abroad by a branch office are subject to a 15% tax rate, based on the total profits applied or earmarked for remittance, without any deduction for the tax component thereof. A lower rate may apply under certain tax treaties. Profits from qualified activities remitted by a branch registered with the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) are tax exempt.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 25 February 2025
## Foreign tax credit
Domestic corporations are allowed to claim a credit for any income taxes paid to a foreign country, provided that the taxes are not claimed as deductions. Foreign corporations are not allowed foreign tax credits.
Credits for foreign taxes are determined on a country-by-country basis. The amount of foreign tax credit in respect of the tax paid in a country shall not exceed the same proportion of the tax against which the tax credit is taken, which the taxpayer’s income from the country bears to its entire taxable income. There is, however, a further limitation based on the total amount of foreign-sourced income that the taxpayer earns. The total amount of foreign tax credits shall not exceed the same proportion of the tax against which the tax credit is taken that the taxpayer’s foreign-sourced income bears to its entire taxable income.
## Incentives
Export-oriented enterprises and domestic market enterprises (DMEs) engaged in strategic activities as defined under the Strategic Investment Priority Plan (SIPP) are eligible for various incentives.
### Availment Period of Incentives Approved by Investment Promotion Agencies
Export enterprises under the SIPP may be entitled to either (1) an income tax holiday (ITH) of 4 to 7 years followed by 5% special corporate income tax (SCIT) or enhanced deductions regime (EDR) for 10 years, or (2) SCIT or EDR for a maximum period of 14 to 17 years. DMEs under the SIPP may be entitled to (1) an ITH of 4 to 7 years followed by EDR for 10 years, or (2) EDR for a maximum period of 14 to 17 years.
The application for extension of availment of incentives shall only be allowed for the same registered project or activity if the latter employs at least 10,000 direct local employees and maintains such number during registration. The extension shall not exceed 5 years. The period of availment of the above income tax-based incentives shall commence from the actual start of commercial operations with the RBE availing of the tax incentives within 3 years from the date of registration, unless otherwise provided in the SIPP.
Tier III activities shall include those that are critical to the structural transformation of the economy and require substantial catch-up efforts including cyber-security, artificial intelligence and data-center facilities.
RBEs may continue to avail of the VAT zero-rating on local purchases, VAT exemption on importation and duty exemption on importation for the entire registration period as an RBE commencing from the date of registration provided that the RBEs continue to meet the terms and conditions of registration and maintain at least 70% of total annual production/output as export sales.
Registered DMEs may avail of duty exemption from the date of registration until the expiration of their income tax-based incentives.
After the expiration of entitlement to VAT zero-rating on local purchases and VAT exemption of importations, REEs may avail of the VAT zero-rating on local purchases and VAT exemption on importations under Sections 106, 108 and 109 of the Tax Code.
RBEs may institute telecommuting programs as defined under Republic Act No. 11165 including work-from-home arrangements which shall not cover more than 50% of the total workforce and shall be subject to the rules and regulations of the IPA.
### Availment Period of Incentives Approved by Fiscal Incentives Review Board
Export enterprises under the SIPP may be entitled to either (a) an ITH of 4 to 7 years followed by SCIT or EDR for 20 years, or (b) SCIT or EDR for a maximum period of 24 to 27 years. Extension shall not exceed 10 years. No ITH for REEs that applied for extension of availment for the same project or activity. A qualified expansion project or activity may qualify for EDR for 13 years. Existing registered projects or activities prior to the CREATE MORE Act may avail of the incentives, subject to the criteria and conditions in the SIPP.
DMEs under the SIPP may avail of either (a) an ITH of 4 to 7 years followed by EDR for 20 years, or (b) EDR for a maximum period of 24 to 27 years. Extension shall also be up to 10 years. No ITH for DMEs that applied for extension of availment for the same project or activity. A qualified expansion project or activity may qualify for EDR for 13 years. Existing registered projects or activities prior to the CREATE MORE Act may avail of the incentives subject to the criteria and conditions in the SIPP. The qualified expansion project or activity may be entitled to VAT/duty exemption on importation and VAT zero-rating on local purchases.
The period of availment of income tax-based incentives shall commence from actual start of commercial operations with the RBE availing of the tax incentives within 3 years from date of registration, unless otherwise provided in the SIPP. The FIRB shall decide on applications for tax incentives within 20 working days from the receipt of all requirements.
**Options** |  **Approved by IPAs** |  **Approved by FIRB**  
---|---|---  
**REE** |  **DME** |  **REE** |  **DME/High Value DME**  
1 |  ITH 4-7 years + SCIT/EDR 10 years |  ITH 4-7 years + EDR 10 years |  ITH 4-7 years + SCIT/EDR 20 years |  ITH 4-7 years + EDR 20 years  
2 |  SCIT/EDR 14 to 17 years* |  EDR 14 to 17 years* |  SCIT/EDR 24 to 27 years |  EDR 24 to 27 years  
_*depending on location and industry priorities_
### Enhanced Deduction Regime
Subject to certain conditions, the additional deductions or Enhanced Deduction Regime (“EDR”) list are as follows:
  * Depreciation of qualified capital expenditure (10% for buildings and 20% for machinery and equipment)
  * Labor expense (50%)
  * Research and development (100%)
  * Training expense (100%)
  * Domestic input expense (50%)
  * Power expense (100%)
  * Expenses on exhibitions, trade missions, or trade fairs (50%)
  * Reinvestment allowance for manufacturing industry (maximum of 50% and can be deducted within a period of five [5] years from the time of such reinvestment). This also applies to tourism RBEs until 31 December 2034, according to the CREATE MORE Act.
  * NOLCO during the first three (3) years from the start of commercial operations may be claimed for the next five (5) consecutive years immediately following the last year of the ITH entitlement period of the project


### Income Tax Holiday and Exemptions
There shall be customs duty exemption for importations of capital equipment, raw materials, spare parts, or accessories, and VAT exemption on importation and VAT zero-rating on domestic purchases.
Additional two (2) years ITH shall be granted to projects or activities of registered enterprises located in areas recovering from armed conflict or a major disaster. Additional three (3) years ITH shall be granted to projects or activities of registered entities prior to the effectivity of CREATE, or under the incentive system when such entities relocate from the NCR. For the second classification, the ITH period shall only commence at the completion of the relocation of operations.
The VAT exemption on importation or the VAT zero-rating of local purchases only applies to goods and services directly attributable to the registered project or activity of an REE or of a registered high-value DME including incidental expenses.
Local sales of goods and services by an RBE, regardless of income tax incentives regime and location, shall be subject to the 12% VAT unless otherwise VAT-exempt or VAT zero-rated. The term “local sales” covers sales to DMEs or non-RBEs, regardless of where the sales take place.
Any REE that fails to meet the 70% export sales threshold in the immediately preceding year or any high-value DME that fails to meet the export sale or investment capital requirement shall be disqualified from availing the duty exemption on importation and the VAT zero-rating of local purchases.
### Other available incentives
ITH applies to all RBEs with respect to their registered project or activity. Double registration for purposes of availing of other incentives under special laws is prohibited.
Local government units (LGUs) may impose a local tax on RBEs not to exceed 2% of gross income. This RBE local tax (RBELT) is in lieu of all local taxes and local fees and charges imposed by LGUs. The RBELT shall not apply to RBEs under the SCIT regime.
The President of the Philippines has the power to craft the appropriate fiscal and non-fiscal support package for a highly desirable project or a specific industrial activity based on defined development strategies for creating high-value jobs, building new industries and attracting capital or investment.
Certain provisions under Income Tax have been introduced or amended by the CREATE MORE Act:
  * RBEs under EDR are now subject to the 20% corporate income tax rate.
  * Income exempt under treaty includes income exempt under agreements entered by the President with economies and administrative regions.
  * Allowable deductions from gross income now expressly include input tax paid on local purchases that are attributable to VAT-exempt sales.
  * Creditable withholding taxes cannot exceed 15%.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 25 February 2025
Corporations and individuals engaged in business are required to withhold the appropriate tax on income payments to non-residents, generally at the rate of 25% in the case of payments to non-resident foreign corporations and for non-resident aliens not engaged in trade or business (_see the section for discussions about WHT on resident corporations_).

Notes
  1. The lower rate generally applies if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a company with a substantial ownership in the dividend paying company.
  2. Interest derived by a foreign government or its agencies is typically exempt from Philippine tax. Many treaties also contain special rules for both Philippine and home country taxation of interest paid on instruments secured by a government agency of one of the countries. Such provisions have been excluded from the analysis.
  3. A 15% rate applies under domestic law if the home country exempts the dividend from tax or permits a 15% or greater credit for corporate taxes paid by the company paying the dividend.
  4. Entitlement to the lower rate depends on how the dividend will be taxed in Australia.
  5. The 10% rate applies to interest paid in respect of the public issues of bonds, debentures, or similar obligations.
  6. The lower rate applies to royalties paid by an enterprise registered with the Philippine BOI and engaged in preferred areas of activity.
  7. The threshold for substantial ownership is 10%.
  8. The 10% rate also applies to interest paid by a company registered with the BOI and engaged in preferred pioneer areas of investment in the Philippines.
  9. The treaty also contains a most-favoured-nation rule, limiting the Philippine tax on royalties to the lowest rate of Philippine tax that may be imposed on royalties of the same kind paid in similar circumstances to a resident of a third state.
  10. The 15% rate applies to royalties arising from the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic, or scientific work including cinematograph films or tapes for television or broadcasting.
  11. The threshold for substantial ownership is 25%.
  12. For a description of when each rate applies, _see Dividend income in the section_.
  13. The 10% rate applies to the use of, or the right to use, any patent, trademark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or from the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment, or for information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific experience. Strictly, application of the rate is generally at the discretion of the Philippine Competent Authorities, but the BIR has never raised this as an issue.
  14. The 10% rate applies to royalties arising from the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic, or scientific work (other than copyright of cinematograph films), any patent, trademark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or from the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment, or for information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific experience.
  15. The 15% rate applies to royalties paid by an enterprise registered and engaged in preferred areas of activities, and to royalties in respect of cinematographic films or tapes for television or broadcasting, and for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright.

  21. The 10% rate applies to royalties paid by an enterprise registered with the BOI and engaged in preferred pioneer areas of activity. The 15% rate applies to rentals from cinematographic films and tapes for television or broadcasting. The 25% rate applies to all other royalties.
  22. The threshold for substantial ownership is 15%.
  23. The 10% rate applies to royalties paid by an enterprise registered with the BOI and engaged in preferred pioneer areas of activity. The 20% rate applies to rentals from cinematographic films and tapes for television or broadcasting. The 15% rate applies to all other royalties.
  24. The threshold for substantial ownership is 70% for the 5% rate to apply.

## Inventory valuation
Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Last in first out (LIFO) is not allowed for tax purposes. Generally, the inventory valuation method for tax purposes must conform to that used for financial reporting purposes.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are not generally subject to CIT but may be subject to capital gains tax.  _See Capital gains tax in the_ _section for more information._
## Dividend income
Dividends received by a domestic or resident foreign corporation from another domestic corporation are not subject to tax. These dividends are excluded from the taxable income of the recipient.
Dividends received by a non-resident foreign corporation from a domestic corporation are subject to a general final WHT at the rate of 25%. A lower rate of 15% applies if the country in which the corporation is domiciled either (i) does not impose income tax on such dividends or (ii) allows a tax deemed paid credit of 10% or the difference between the CIT and 15% tax on dividends. Treaty rates ranging from 10% to 25% may also apply if the recipient is a resident of a country with which the Philippines has a tax treaty (_see the section_).
### Stock dividends
A Philippine corporation can distribute stock dividends tax-free, proportionately to all shareholders. The subsequent cancellation or redemption of such stocks, however, shall be taxable to the extent that it represents a distribution of earnings.
## Interest income
Interest on bank savings, time deposits, deposit substitutes, and money market placements received by domestic or resident foreign corporations from a domestic corporation are subject to a final tax of 20%, while interest income derived from FCDU deposits is subject to a final tax of 15%. Such income is excluded from gross income reportable in CIT returns.
Interest income of FCDUs from foreign currency loans granted by depository banks to residents other than OBUs or other FCDUs of depository banks shall be subject to 10% tax. The preferential tax for OBUs is repealed under the CREATE Law.
## Royalty income
Royalties received by domestic or resident foreign corporations from a domestic corporation are subject to a final tax of 20%. 
## Other significant items
Other items exempt from CIT include the following:
  * Proceeds of life insurance policies.
  * Return of policy premium.
  * Gifts, bequests, and devises.
  * Interest on certain government securities.
  * Income exempt under a treaty.
  * Gains from sale, exchange, or retirement of bonds, with a maturity of five years.
  * Gains from redemption of shares of stock in mutual fund companies.


## Foreign income
A Philippine (domestic) corporation is taxed on its worldwide income. A domestic corporation is taxed on income from foreign sources when earned or received, depending on the accounting method used by the taxpayer.
Income earned through a foreign subsidiary is taxed only when paid to a Philippine resident shareholder as a dividend. Under the CREATE Law, such dividend may be exempt from Philippine tax, subject to the following conditions:
  * The funds from such dividends actually received or remitted into the Philippines are reinvested in the business operations of the domestic corporation in the Philippines within the next taxable year from the time the foreign-sourced dividends were received and shall be limited to funding the working capital requirements, capital expenditures, dividend payments, investment in domestic subsidiaries, and infrastructure project.
  * The domestic corporation directly holds at least 20% of the outstanding shares of the foreign corporation for at least two years at the time of the dividend distribution.


Meanwhile, income earned through a foreign branch is taxed as it accrues. The losses incurred by the foreign branch are deductible against other income earned by the Philippine corporation.
For Filipino citizens and domestic corporations, foreign taxes may either be credited against income tax due or claimed as a deduction against gross income for income tax purposes.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT applies to practically all sales of services and imports, as well as to the sale, barter, exchange, or lease of goods or properties (tangible or intangible). The tax is equivalent to a uniform rate of 12%, based on the gross selling price of goods or properties sold, or gross receipts from the sale of services. On importation of goods, the basis of the tax is the value used by the Bureau of Customs (BOC) in determining tariff and customs duties plus customs duties, excise taxes, if any, and other charges. Where the valuation used by the BOC is by volume or quantity, the VAT basis is the landed cost-plus excise taxes, if any.
Certain transactions are zero-rated or exempt from VAT. Export sales by VAT-registered persons are zero-rated. Certain sales of services exempt from VAT, including services provided by financial intermediaries, are subject to percentage taxes based on gross sales, receipts, or income.
Certain VAT provisions have been amended by recent legislation. Salient provisions are the following:
### VAT Refund
The EOPT Act classifies VAT refund claims into low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk categories based on factors such as the amount of the claim, tax compliance history, and frequency of filing. Medium-risk and high-risk claims are subject to audit or other verification processes by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR).
Under the CREATE MORE Act, the procedure for input VAT refunds requires the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to grant refunds of creditable input taxes within 90 days of receiving certified true copies of invoices and other prescribed documents. If a refund claim is denied, the taxpayer must be informed in writing of the legal and factual basis for the denial, including any deficiencies in the claim. The taxpayer has 15 days to file a request for reconsideration; otherwise, the denial becomes final. Upon receiving the request for reconsideration, the Commissioner has 15 days to make a decision.
### VAT Invoicing
Under the EOPT Act, VAT invoices are deemed sufficient to substantiate input VAT arising from the purchase of both goods and services. The invoicing requirements have been updated, eliminating the need for a VAT official receipt for the sale of services or lease of property; instead, a VAT invoice must be issued. Additionally, the requirement to indicate 'business style' on the invoice has been removed.
If a VAT invoice lacks certain information required under the invoicing rules, the issuer will be liable for non-compliance. However, the purchaser can still claim the input tax if the invoice includes the sales amount, VAT amount, names and TINs of both parties, a description of the goods or services, and the transaction date.
Taxpayers are required to issue duly registered invoices for sales valued at PHP 500 or more when requested by the buyer or if the seller is VAT-registered. The removal of 'business style' as a VAT invoicing requirement further simplifies the process.
### VAT Imposition
The imposition of VAT on services is now based on gross sales rather than gross receipts, as stipulated by the EOPT Act. The CREATE MORE Act introduces the term "directly attributable," which refers to goods and services incidental to and reasonably necessary for the export activities of export-oriented enterprises. These services include janitorial, security, financial consultancy, marketing and promotion, and administrative operations such as human resources, legal, and accounting services.
Export sales, as defined under Executive Order (EO) No. 226 (Omnibus Investment Code of 1987), have been removed from the list of VAT zero-rated export sales under Section 106(A)(2)(a). However, sales to bonded manufacturing warehouses of export-oriented enterprises, previously classified as "export sales" under EO No. 226, have been added to the list of VAT zero-rated export sales. Additionally, sales of goods and services subject to zero percent VAT under special laws have been included in the enumeration of VAT zero-rated sales.
The CREATE MORE Act also amends VAT-exempt transactions under Section 109. The importation of fuel, goods, and supplies used for international shipping or air transport operations is VAT-exempt, regardless of whether the importer is engaged in both domestic and international operations, as long as the imports are used solely for international operations. Furthermore, the importation of goods by export-oriented enterprises with at least 70% of their total annual production from the preceding taxable year being export sales is VAT-exempt if the goods are directly attributable to the export activity of the enterprise.
### Digital Services Tax Act (DSTA)
Persons liable to pay the 12% VAT include any individual or entity engaged in trade or business that sells, barters, exchanges, or leases goods or properties, including digital goods, and renders services, including digital services. For Nonresident Digital Service Providers (NDSPs) without a physical presence in the Philippines, their services are considered rendered in the Philippines if consumed there. NDSPs must register for VAT if their customers are non-VAT registered, making them liable for remitting the VAT. If customers are VAT-registered, a reverse charge mechanism applies, where the consumer withholds and remits the VAT. VAT-registered NDSPs classified as e-marketplaces must withhold and remit VAT on transactions through their platforms if they set any terms and conditions for the supply of goods or are involved in the ordering or delivery of goods.
Persons required to register for VAT are those with gross sales exceeding the VAT threshold, which is currently PHP 3 million, in the past twelve months or reasonably expected to exceed said threshold in the next twelve months. The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) will establish a simplified automated registration system for NDSPs. Noncompliance with registration requirements can result in penalties such as temporary closure for at least five days, lifted only upon full compliance, and blocking of digital services by the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) via the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC). NDSPs cannot claim creditable input tax.
Under Section 109 of the Tax Code, VAT-exempt transactions include educational services such as online courses, seminars, and trainings rendered by private institutions accredited by DEPED, CHED, TESDA, and government educational institutions, as well as the sale of online subscription-based services to these institutions. It also covers services of banks, non-bank financial intermediaries performing quasi-banking functions, and other non-bank financial intermediaries rendered through digital platforms.
VAT-registered NDSPs must issue digital sales invoices indicating the date of transaction, transaction reference number, customer identification, brief description of the transaction, total amount including VAT, and a breakdown of sales between taxable, zero-rated, and exempt components with VAT calculations. They are not required to maintain regular accounting records and subsidiary journals. Digital service providers will be automatically subject to 12% VAT 120 days after the effectivity of the Digital Services Tax Act’s Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR), which is effective on February 1, 2025, making the 120-day mark June 1, 2025.
### VAT Refund for Tourists
Under Republic Act No. 12079, non-resident tourists are eligible for a VAT refund on locally purchased goods if the goods are bought in person from duly accredited stores, taken out of the Philippines within sixty days from the date of purchase, and the value of goods per transaction is at least PHP 3,000. The VAT refund can be processed either electronically or in cash, and the system will be managed by reputable, globally recognized, and experienced VAT refund operators providing end-to-end solutions to the government. The Secretary of Finance, in consultation with other administrative agencies and departments, is responsible for establishing the rules and regulations to implement the law effectively. 
## Customs duties
Applicable customs duties are determined based on the tariff classification of the import product. As with the rest of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, tariff classification in the Philippines is based on the ASEAN Harmonised Tariff Nomenclature (AHTN), which is patterned after the Harmonised Commodity Classification and Coding System (HS) Convention and its 2002 revisions, and the latest edition is HS Code 2017 under the Customs Modernization and Tariff Act. 
In 2024, the Tariff Commission issued 889 rulings to address commonly raised valuation and tariff classification issues. Despite this, it is still advisable that tariff classification rulings from the Philippine Tariff Commission be secured prior to importation of goods into the Philippines in case of uncertainty as to the correct classification or valuation. Note that while the tariff classification rulings issued by the Philippine Tariff Commission do not prevent the BOC from conducting its own verification, these rulings carry persuasive references in support of the classification and duty rate used by an importer.
The Philippines adopts the World Trade Organization (WTO) Valuation Agreement, where the declared invoice price is used as the basis for determining customs duties.
As a protective measure, the Philippines retains higher tariff rates (20% to 50%) on certain sensitive agricultural products, such as livestock and meat products, sugar, vegetables, and coffee. A few agricultural commodities are subject to minimum access volumes, but these represent less than 1% of all tariff lines.
In view of the existing free trade agreements in the region, such as the ASEAN-China Free Trade Area (ACFTA), the ASEAN-Korea Free Trade Area (AKFTA), the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area (AANZFTA), the ASEAN-Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (AJCEPA), the ASEAN-INDIA Free Trade Area (AIFTA), the Philippine-European Free Trade Association (PH-EFTA), the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA), the ASEAN Hong Kong China Free Trade Area (AHKFTA), the Philippine-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement (PJEPA), and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the Philippines has taken steps to progressively eliminate tariffs. Tariff reductions for the Philippines range from 10% to 35% for most products included in the Normal Track list.

Capital gains arise from the sale or exchange of ‘capital assets’. Capital assets are property held by the taxpayer (whether or not connected with its trade), other than the following:
  * Inventories or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business.
  * Real property or depreciable property used in trade or business.
  * Property of a kind that would be included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the taxable year.


Capital losses are deductible only to the extent of capital gains.
There are no holding period requirements for capital assets of corporations.
A 6% final tax is imposed on the higher of the gross selling price or fair market value upon the sale, exchange, or disposition of land or buildings not actually used in the business of a corporation.
Net capital gains derived by domestic and foreign corporations from the sale, exchange, transfer, or similar transactions of Philippine shares of stock not traded through a local stock exchange are taxed at a flat 15% rate.
Sales of shares of stock listed and traded on a local stock exchange, other than the sale by a dealer in securities, are subject to a stock transaction tax of 0.6% based on the gross selling price, provided the listed corporation observes a minimum public ownership of at least 10% based on the company’s issued and outstanding shares, exclusive of any treasury shares or such percentage as may be prescribed by the SEC or Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE), whichever is higher. Otherwise, the 15% capital gains tax shall apply.
Capital gains from the sale of bonds, debentures, or other certificates of indebtedness with a maturity of more than five years are exempt from tax.
## Payroll taxes
The compensation and benefits of employees of employers are subject to WHT based on graduated rates. The employer shall be the designated withholding agent of the government.
## Social security contributions
Corporations doing business in the Philippines must be registered with social institutions, such as the Social Security System (SSS), Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF), and Philippine Health Corporation (PHIC), upon employment of any employee and prior to the due date of the remittance of any social contributions.
Employee contributions for social security are deducted from the employee’s salary payments. The maximum monthly deductions are PHP 1,000 for SSS plus a maximum of PHP 750 mandatory provident fund under the Workers’ Investment and Savings Program (WISP), PHP 200 for HDMF, and PHP 2,500 for PHIC.
Employers are also required to make contributions. Employers’ maximum contribution for each employee is PHP 2,000 per month for SSS plus PHP 1,500 mandatory provident fund and PHP 30 for Employees' Compensation Program. Employer contributions for HDMF and PHIC are generally of the same amount as the employee contributions.
## Fringe benefits tax
A final tax of 35%, payable by the employer, is imposed on the grossed-up monetary value of fringe benefits (e.g. housing, expense accounts, vehicles of any kind, household personnel, interest on loans at lower than market rates [the current benchmark rate is 12%], membership dues for social and athletic clubs, foreign travel expenses, holiday and vacation expenses, educational assistance, insurance) furnished or granted to managerial or supervisory personnel by the employer. An exception is for fringe benefits required by the nature of or necessary to the trade, business, or profession of the employer, or when the fringe benefit is for the convenience or advantage of the employer.
The following fringe benefits are not subject to the tax:
  * Those authorised and exempted from tax under special laws.
  * Contributions of the employer for the benefit of the employee to retirement, insurance, and hospitalisation benefit plans.
  * Those granted to rank-and-file employees (however, the employees may be subject to WHT on compensation).
  * Those of relatively small value or _de minimis_ benefits.


The fringe benefits tax is payable on a calendar quarter basis and is an additional deductible expense for the employer. Fringe benefits already subjected to fringe benefits tax will no longer form part of the employee’s taxable income.
The grossed-up monetary value of the fringe benefit is generally computed by dividing the actual monetary value of the benefit by 65%.
## Donor’s taxes
Donor’s tax is a tax on a donation or gift and is imposed on the gratuitous transfer of property. It shall apply whether the transfer is in trust or otherwise, whether the gift is direct or indirect, and whether the property is real or personal, tangible or intangible.
The donor’s tax rate is fixed at 6% based on total gifts in excess of PHP 250,000 made during the calendar year. However, a sale, exchange, or other transfer made in the ordinary course of business (i.e._bona fide_ transaction, at arm’s-length, and free from donative intent) shall be considered as made for an adequate and full consideration and is exempt from donor’s tax.
## Local government taxes
Local government units impose local business taxes, which are generally based on the gross sales or gross receipts of the prior year, and real property taxes, which are levied annually on the basis of a fixed proportion of the value of the real property (taxable value). The local business tax rate varies depending on the location of the business, but generally shall not exceed 3%. Real property located in a province may be subject to real property tax of not more than 1% of its taxable value, while real property in a city (or municipality in Metro Manila) may be subject to real property tax of not more than 2% of its taxable value. In addition, an annual tax of 1% of the taxable value of real property shall accrue to the special education fund.
