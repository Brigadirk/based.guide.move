## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 12 January 2025
## Social taxes
Social taxes in the Philippines consist of contributions to the following government agencies:
  * Social Security System (SSS)
  * Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth), and
  * Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF) or Pag-IBIG Fund


SSS issued Circular 2024-06 on 19 December 19 2024 mandating a 1% increase in the contribution rate starting January 2025. This change increased the contribution rate from 14% to 15% in accordance with Republic Act No. 11199, also known as the Social Security Act of 2018. The new minimum Monthly Salary Credit (MSC) is set at PHP 5,000, while the maximum MSC is 35,000 Philippine Peso (PHP). With the increase in contribution, the minimum employee and employer share is PHP 250 and PHP 510 per month, respectively. The employer’s share includes a PHP 10 Employees' Compensation (EC) contribution. Meanwhile, the maximum monthly employee contribution is PHP 1,750, and the employer’s share is PHP 3,530, which includes an EC contribution of PHP 30.
HDMF has issued Circular No. 460 on 15 January 2024 prescribing the increase in contribution effective February 2024. Based on the circular, the Maximum Fund Salary (MFS) increased from 5,000 to 10,000 Philippine pesos (PHP). The rate for MFS of PHP 1,500 and below shall be 1% for the employee and 2% for the employer. For MFS over PHP 5,000, the rate shall be 2% for both the employer and the employee. The maximum HDMF contribution for both employers and employees will be PHP 200. 
In addition, PhilHealth’s premium rate is retained at 5% and the income ceiling is PHP 100,000, which is in accordance with Section 10 of the Universal Health Care (UHC) Law, as implemented by PhilHealth Circular 2019-009.
In line with this, the minimum and maximum PhilHealth contribution for both employers and employees will be PHP 500 and PHP 2,500, respectively, effective January 2024.
## Tax filing and payment
Following the enactment of Republic Act No. 11976 (Ease of Payment Taxes or EOPT Act) on 5 January 2024, which took effect on 22 January 2024, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) provided the file-and-pay anywhere mechanism. This mechanism was further clarified by the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of the Act, which took effect on 27 April 2024. Under the IRR, the filing of tax returns shall be done electronically in any of the available electronic platforms of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). However, in case of unavailability of the electronic platforms, manual filing may be allowed. 
Moreover, for tax payments, the same shall be made either electronically in any of the available electronic platforms or manually to any Authorised Agent Bank (AAB) and Revenue Collection Office (RCO). The RCO can accept check payments regardless of amounts but only up to a maximum amount of PHP 20,000 for cash payments. AABs and RCOs shall only accept payments after the taxpayers have already electronically filed their tax returns, unless an advisory is issued allowing manual filing.
Meanwhile, in case of filing of an income tax return by married individuals, the husband and the wife, whether citizens or aliens, who are both self-employed, either engaged in business or practice of profession, shall file their return jointly. However, if it is impracticable to file one return, each spouse shall file separate income tax returns.
Further, a Filipino citizen who is an Overseas Contract Worker (OCW) or an Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) working and deriving income solely from abroad shall not be required to file an income tax return.
## Business tax
Pursuant to Republic Act (RA) 11534, also known as the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises Act (CREATE), any person whose sales or receipts are exempt from the payment of value-added tax (VAT) and who is a non-VAT registered person shall pay a percentage tax equivalent to 1% of one's gross sales or receipts (previously 3%) for the period beginning 1 July 2020 until 30 June 2023. Starting 1 July 2023, the rate shall revert to 3%.


# Philippines
## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 12 January 2025
The Philippines taxes its resident citizens on their worldwide income. Non-resident citizens and aliens, whether or not resident in the Philippines, are taxed only on income from sources within the Philippines.
Rates of tax on income of aliens, resident or not, depend on the nature of their income (i.e. compensation income, income subject to final tax, or other income).
## Compensation tax rates
For resident aliens and non-resident aliens doing business and receiving compensation income, the tax rates are as follows:
Beginning 1 January 2023:
Taxable income (PHP) | Tax on column 1 (PHP) | Tax on excess (%)  
---|---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 250,000 | - | 0  
250,000 | 400,000 | - | 15  
400,000 | 800,000 | 22,500 | 20  
800,000 | 2,000,000 | 102,500 | 25  
2,000,000 | 8,000,000 | 402,500 | 30  
8,000,000 | 2,202,500 | 35  
### Fringe benefits tax (FBT)
Fringe benefits furnished to managerial and supervisory-level employees by the employer are subject to a final FBT of 35%* (in general) on the grossed-up monetary value of the benefits. Managerial employees are those who may mandate and execute management policies to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, discharge, assign, or discipline employees. Supervisory employees are those who effectively recommend such managerial actions if the exercise of authority on behalf of the employer is not merely routine or clerical in nature but requires the use of independent judgement. The FBT is a final tax payable on a calendar quarterly basis by the employer and deductible as part of fringe benefit expense. Benefits subjected to FBT are no longer included in the employees’ taxable income. _See the section for a description of fringe benefits for FBT purposes_.
* 25% for non-resident alien not engaged in trade or business.
## Tax rates for income subject to final tax
For resident and non-resident aliens engaged in trade or business in the Philippines, the maximum rate on income subject to final tax (usually passive investment income) is 20%. For non-resident aliens not engaged in trade or business in the Philippines, the rate is a flat 25%. _See Capital gains and investment income in the section for more information_.
## Tax rates for business income
An individual, whether citizen or resident alien, who is self-employed or practices a profession, is also subject to the graduated income tax rates above.
However, an individual who has gross sales/receipts and other non-operating income not exceeding the VAT threshold (which is currently pegged at PHP 3 million) may opt to be taxed either at:
  * 8% tax* on gross sales/receipts and other non-operating income in excess of PHP 250,000 in lieu of the graduated income tax rates and percentage tax (business tax), or
  * the graduated tax rates.


Business income subjected to graduated tax rates shall also be subject to business tax (i.e. 12% VAT or 3% percentage tax, as applicable).
* Only applicable if the individual is not VAT-registered. If VAT-registered, graduated rates shall apply regardless of the gross sales/receipts.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 12 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December.
## Tax returns
Unless impracticable, a husband and wife must file one consolidated income tax return, but the tax is computed separately. Income that cannot be definitely attributed or identified as exclusive income of either spouse is divided equally between them. Generally, this results in lower combined tax liability than when the tax is jointly computed.
Substituted filing is available for qualified employees. In such case, the Certificate of Compensation Payment/Tax Withheld (BIR Form 2316) filed by the employer and duly stamped 'received' by the BIR shall be tantamount to substituted filing of the Annual Income Tax Return of the employees.
Substituted filing shall apply only to employees who meet all of the following conditions:
  * the employee receives purely compensation income (regardless of amount) during the taxable year,
  * the employee receives the income only from one employer in the Philippines during the taxable year,
  * the amount of tax due from the employee at the end of the year equals the amount of tax withheld by the employer, and
  * the employee’s spouse also complies with all three mentioned conditions.


Substituted filing, however, will not apply to non-resident aliens engaged in trade or business in the Philippines.
All individual taxpayers who do not qualify for substituted filing are required to file their returns on a calendar-year basis. The return must be filed on or before 15 April of the succeeding year.
## Payment of tax
Generally, the income tax withheld from the salaries or compensation of aliens, resident or not, should equal their final tax liability on such compensation. If not, the balance must be paid at the time the annual return is filed. However, if the tax due exceeds PHP 2,000, income tax liability may be paid in two equal instalments. The first instalment is due on 15 April while the second and final instalment is due on 15 October.
Any payment of the remaining tax liability beyond the due date shall be subject to certain penalties.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 12 January 2025
## Employment expenses
Aliens, whether residents or not, who are receiving only salary or compensation income are not allowed any deduction against such income.
## Personal deductions
Home mortgage interest, medical expenses, contributions, and other personal expenses cannot be claimed as deductions for income tax purposes. However, social security contributions, up to the prescribed amount of maximum mandatory contributions, are excluded from gross income.
## Business deductions
In the case of individuals engaged in business or the practice of a profession, and who opted to be taxed at the regular graduated income tax rates, the following expenses are allowed as deductions from gross income:
  * All ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in connection with the trade, business, or profession, including raw materials, supplies, and direct labour.
  * Wages and other forms of compensation for personal services actually rendered, including the grossed-up monetary value of fringe benefits and travel expenses incurred in the pursuit of the trade or profession.
  * Business rentals.
  * Interest paid or incurred within a taxable year in connection with the conduct of a taxpayer’s profession, trade, or business, less an amount equal to a certain percentage of the interest income subject to final tax.
  * Entertainment, amusement, and recreation expenses, not to exceed the following ceilings: 
    * 0.50% of net sales for taxpayers engaged in sale of goods or properties.
    * 1% of net revenue for taxpayers engaged in sale of services, including professionals and lessors of properties.
  * Taxes.
  * Losses.
  * Bad debts.
  * Depreciation.
  * Charitable and other contributions, subject to certain limitations.
  * Research and development (R&D) expenditures.


In lieu of these allowable deductions, an individual, other than a non-resident alien, may elect an optional standard deduction (OSD) not exceeding 40% of gross business or professional income.
Individuals who opt to use itemised deductions are required to keep additional documents as support to the deductions claimed in the tax return. The EOPT Act repealed the requirement to withhold tax as a requisite to claim the cost as a tax deduction, provided that such cost is necessary, ordinary, and duly substantiated. This new rule applies from 1 January 2024.

---|---|---  
Gross income:  
Salary (1) | 652,000 | 68,000  
Living allowances | 100,000  
Total taxable income | 752,000 | 68,000  
Tax due:  
On first 400,000 | 22,500  
On remainder of 352,000 at 20% | 70,400  
On first 250,000 | 0

Less:  
Tax withheld by employer per Form 2316 (2) | (92,900) | 0  
Net tax due | 0 | 0  
Notes
The following items were not included in the income tax return because they are subject to final tax:
Interest on peso bank account | 20,000  
---|---  
Capital gain on sale of shares | 5,000  
Dividend income | 10,000  
Housing benefit (3) | 300,000  
  1. Philippine social tax contributions, if any, made by the resident alien and/or his wife to the Philippine social security agencies shall be allowed as deductions from gross income in calculating their tax liabilities for the year.
  2. For individuals receiving salary and other allowances from one employer only, the tax due is usually equal to tax withheld since the employer is required to compute and withhold the total tax due on the employee's compensation earned during the year, using the annual graduated income tax table, before paying the last payroll for the year.
  3. As a managerial employee, the housing benefit provided to the husband shall be subject to FBT rather than income tax.


The above individual tax calculation also applies to non-resident aliens engaged in trade or business in the Philippines for their Philippine-source income.


# Philippines
## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 12 January 2025
## Employment income
An alien, whether resident or not, is taxed on compensation income earned from services rendered in the Philippines regardless of where payment is made and whether it is remitted into the Philippines. A non-resident alien is not taxed on compensation income for services performed outside the Philippines. Employment income, from the point of view of a non-resident alien engaged in trade or business in the Philippines, includes all payments for services rendered in the Philippines, such as salaries and bonuses, regardless of where payment was made.
Social security contributions, up to the prescribed amount of maximum mandatory contributions, and union dues paid by employees are not included in gross income and are exempt from taxation.
### Fringe benefits
Fringe benefits furnished to managerial and supervisory-level employees by the employer are subject to FBT (_see the section_). Benefits subjected to FBT are no longer included in the employees’ taxable income.
‘Fringe benefits’ are defined as any goods, services, or other benefits furnished or granted in cash or in kind by an employer to an individual employee, except rank and file employees, such as, but not limited to, the following:
  * Housing.
  * Expense account.
  * Vehicles of any kind.
  * Household personnel (e.g. maid, driver).
  * Interest on a loan at less than the market rate (currently set at 12%) to the extent of the difference between the market rate and the actual rate granted.
  * Membership fees, dues, and other expenses borne by the employer for the employee in social and athletic clubs and similar organisations.
  * Expenses for foreign travel.
  * Holiday and vacation expenses.
  * Educational assistance to the employee and dependants.
  * Premiums for life insurance, health and other non-life insurance, and similar amounts in excess of what the law allows.


The monetary value of benefits in the form of housing and motor vehicles used for both personal and business purposes is equal to 50% of the lease payment or the depreciation value of the property, whichever is applicable. However, if the housing unit is situated in or adjacent (within 50 metres) to the business premises, the benefit is not taxable. Likewise, a motor vehicle used normally for business purposes is not taxable.
The following fringe benefits are not taxable:
  * Fringe benefits required by the nature of or necessary to the trade, business, or profession or for the convenience or advantage of the employer.
  * Benefits authorised by and exempted from tax under special laws.
  * Employer contributions for the benefit of the employee to retirement, insurance, and hospitalisation benefit plans.
  * Benefits given to rank and file employees, whether or not granted under a collective bargaining agreement. However, these are subject to withholding tax (WHT) on compensation, unless otherwise tax exempt.
  * _De minimis_(small value) benefits as defined and enumerated in the rules and regulations.


In general, if a fringe benefit is granted in money or directly paid for by the employer, the value of the fringe benefit is the amount granted or paid for. If furnished in property and ownership thereof is transferred to the employee, the value of the fringe benefit is the fair market value of the property as determined by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, pursuant to the Commissioner’s power to prescribe real property values. If the fringe benefit is granted or furnished by the employer in the form of a property but ownership is not transferred to the employee, the value of the fringe benefit is equal to the depreciation value of the property.
## Capital gains and investment income
Non-resident aliens are taxed on Philippine-source capital gains, irrespective of their period of stay in the Philippines. The rates are 0.6% of the gross selling price for shares of stocks listed and traded in the stock exchange; 15% of the net capital gains for unlisted shares of stock, including shares of publicly listed companies that failed to comply with the minimum public ownership (MPO) requirement; and 6% of the higher of the gross sales price or fair market value of real property sold, withheld at the time of sale. Capital losses are deductible only from capital gains. In computing net capital gains or losses from other capital assets, only 50% of the gain or loss is to be taken into account if the capital asset has been held for more than 12 months; otherwise, 100% of the gain or loss is to be considered.
A non-resident alien is also taxed on Philippine-source investment income, such as interest, dividends, and royalties, at the rate of 20% (for those engaged in trade or business in the Philippines) or 25% (for those not engaged in trade or business in the Philippines) as a final tax (or a lower treaty rate). The tax is withheld at source, and the income is not subject to the graduated rates.
Resident aliens are taxed on their Philippine-source income at graduated rates. However, Philippine-source interest and royalties are taxed at 20%. Interest on residents’ deposits under the expanded foreign currency deposit system (FCDU) accounts is taxed at 15%, while interest on long-term deposits or investment in the form of savings, common or individual trust funds, and other investments evidenced by certificates, and so on, is exempt from tax, subject to certain conditions. Interest income on FCDU accounts of non-residents is exempt from tax. Royalties on literary works and musical compositions are subject to a final tax of 10%. Dividend income received from a domestic corporation is taxed at 10% for resident aliens. Tax rates for capital gains from shares of stock and real property are the same as those for non-resident aliens.

# Philippines
## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 12 January 2025
A resident alien is an individual who is stateless or is a national of another country and who lives in the Philippines with no definite intention as to length of stay, but who is not a mere transient or sojourner. An expatriate working in the Philippines on a contract for an indefinite period potentially falls into this category.
Most expatriates will be classified as non-resident aliens because their contract will be for a specified period of engagement. A non-resident alien individual who comes to the Philippines and stays for more than 180 days during any calendar year will be deemed a non-resident alien engaged in trade or business in the Philippines. If the aggregate stay in the Philippines during any calendar year covered by the assignment period does not exceed 180 days, the individual may be deemed a non-resident alien not engaged in trade or business in the Philippines.
Expatriates assigned in the Philippines for a definite period are generally regarded as non-residents engaged in trade or business in the Philippines.

### Value-added tax (VAT)
A 12% VAT is imposed on services performed in the exercise or practice of profession or calling, including entertainers, musical, radio, movie, and television and stage directors; and professional athletes, as well as services rendered by customs, real estate, stock, immigration, and commercial brokers. The VAT is based on the gross sales representing the contract price, compensation, service fee, rental, or royalty, including the amount charged for materials supplied with the services and deposits and advanced payments actually or constructively received during the taxable period/quarter for the services performed or to be performed for another person, excluding VAT.
