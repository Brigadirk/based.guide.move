## Increase in annual personal income tax-free threshold
The Government of Jamaica announced an increase in the personal income tax (PIT) threshold available to Jamaican tax-resident individual taxpayers from 1,500,096 Jamaican dollars (JMD) _per annum_ to JMD 1,700,088 _per annum_ with effect from 1 April 2024.
## Increase in annual pension income exemption and age allowance
The Income Tax Act historically provided an exemption from income tax (generally referred to as the pension relief) in respect of JMD 80,000 of pension income for pensioners aged 55 years and over. Individuals 65 years and older have also been entitled to a further exemption (generally referred to as age relief) in respect of JMD 80,000 of income from any source.
The Government of Jamaica announced its intention to increase each of these amounts to JMD 250,000 _per annum_ with effect from 1 April 2024.
## Increase in duty-free inbound passenger allowance / _de minimis_ import value 
With effect from April 2024, the duty-free inbound passenger allowance for personal/household effects was increased from 500 to 1,000 United States dollars (USD), while the _de minimis_ value of imported goods for customs purposes (on which import charges may be imposed) was increased from USD 50 to USD 100.
## Reverse income tax credit for individual taxpayers 
The Government of Jamaica announced the implementation of a reverse income tax credit amounting to JMD 20,000 applicable to Jamaican individual taxpayers (whether employed or self-employed) who earn less than JMD 3 million annually and meet the annual income tax filing/payment requirements for the 2023 Year of Assessment. Tax Administration Jamaica (TAJ) is to establish a system to facilitate the application, processing, and payment of this reverse credit programme, which is slated to become operational during the current fiscal year.
## Tax credit for investment in residential solar installations
An income tax credit has been introduced to encourage the purchase and installation of residential solar photovoltaic systems. The tax credit is available to employed and self-employed taxpayers and is calculated at 30% of the cost of the system, up to a maximum system cost of JMD 4 million. The credit takes effect from the year of assessment 2023.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 02 August 2024
In general, Jamaican residents and domiciled individuals are taxed on their worldwide income, while non-resident individuals are taxed on Jamaican-sourced income. A non-Jamaican domiciled individual is generally not taxable on foreign-sourced income unless one remits this to Jamaica. Notwithstanding this, a non-domiciled individual working in Jamaica is taxed on the compensation attributable to services rendered in and in relation to Jamaica (subject to certain exceptions) as well as Jamaican-sourced income.
## Personal income tax rates
Individuals are generally liable to income tax at the rate of 25% on their chargeable income (not exceeding JMD 6 million _per annum_) less an annual tax-free threshold (where applicable). Chargeable income derived in excess of JMD 6 million _per annum_ is subject to income tax at a rate of 30%.
An annual tax-free threshold of JMD 1,500,096 is available to Jamaican tax-resident individual taxpayers (JMD 1,700,088  _per annum_ with effect from 1 April 2024).
## Local income taxes
Tax is imposed on individuals at the national level. Income tax is not separately imposed at the local level.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 02 August 2024
## Taxable period
An individual is subject to tax on one’s income for a calendar year; however, a taxpayer may obtain the approval of the Commissioner General, TAJ to file on a fiscal-year basis.
## Tax returns
Income tax returns are due for filing on 15 March in the year following the year of assessment and are based on a system of self-assessment of the tax payable. However, an individual who expects that income tax will be payable by one’s self only in respect of emoluments is not required to file an income tax return.
Husbands and wives generally file separately and must elect in writing to be jointly assessed.
Individual income tax returns must be filed electronically.
## Payment of tax
Tax is payable in quarterly instalments on the 15th day of March, June, September, and December of each tax year. Quarterly instalments are based on an estimate of the year's liability or the actual tax payable for the previous year. The balance of income tax payable for a taxation year, after deduction of the instalments of estimated tax, is due on 15 March of the following year. Interest is charged on unpaid tax at a rate of 16.62% _per annum_ while the amount remains unpaid. A penalty of up to 50% may also be imposed if TAJ issues an assessment.
Income tax (PAYE) is withheld from emoluments; however, where withholding is not possible (e.g. because the employer is not resident in Jamaica), the taxpayer will be required to make payment of estimated tax in quarterly instalments.
## Tax assessments and audits
The Commissioner General is empowered to conduct audits on selected tax returns or to assess a taxpayer for additional tax at any time prior to the expiration of the statute of limitation, which is six years, except in certain cases. Tax audits can be carried out whether or not notices of assessment have been issued. Tax assessments may be raised where the Commissioner General is of the opinion that a taxpayer has been assessed for less tax than one ought to have been charged, or where the taxpayer failed to file a tax return.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 02 August 2024
## Personal deductions
Social security and contributions to pension schemes approved under the Income Tax Act are deductible in determining taxable income, as is interest paid on capital employed in acquiring income.
Approved charitable contributions, restricted to 5% of taxable income, are also deductible.
## Standard deductions
There are no standard deductions in Jamaica.
## Personal allowances
There are no personal allowances in Jamaica. However, the first JMD 1,500,096 of a Jamaican tax resident individual’s statutory income is tax free (JMD 1,700,088 with effect from 1 April 2024). 
There are also exemptions from income tax on the first JMD 80,000 (JMD 250,000 from 1 April 2024) for an individual who is aged 65 and over. A person who is 55 years and over who is in receipt of income from an approved superannuation fund or an approved retirement scheme also enjoys an exemption of JMD 80,000 (JMD 250,000 from 1 April 2024) of income from that source and any other source. If the individual is younger than 55 years of age, the exemption is limited to income from the approved scheme not exceeding JMD 80,000 (JMD 250,000 from 1 April 2024).
## Business deductions
To the extent not reimbursed, individuals (resident or non-resident) can deduct all expenses that are incurred wholly and exclusively by them in earning their income (e.g. business-related travel, automobile, and entertainment expenses), provided these expenses are not of a capital nature or specifically mentioned in the tax legislation as non-deductible. Expenses for travel to and from work are not deductible.
## Fines and penalties
Fines, penalties, and interest arising from tax arrears are not deductible.
## Net operating losses
Any claim for deduction of tax losses incurred in a prior year will be capped at 50% of the taxpayer’s chargeable income (before deduction of tax losses carried forward) of the year in which the claim is being made.
This cap will not apply:
  * for the five years of assessment following the first year of operation of a new trade, profession, or business, or
  * where the taxpayer’s gross revenue from all sources for the relevant year of assessment is less than JMD 10 million _per annum._

## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
As part of Jamaica's participation in the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes, the Island implemented the CRS under local law in December 2020. The CRS requires jurisdictions to obtain information from their financial institutions and automatically exchange that information with other jurisdictions on an annual basis. The CRS sets out the financial account information to be exchanged, the financial institutions required to report, the different types of accounts and taxpayers covered, as well as due diligence procedures to be followed by these financial institutions.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 02 August 2024
## Employment income
An individual who is resident but not domiciled in Jamaica is taxed on the emoluments (salary, living allowances, benefits in kind, use of company cars, etc.) received for work done for or relating to Jamaica, regardless of where payment is made and regardless of whether the emoluments are remitted to Jamaica.
Benefits provided to employees, whether in cash or kind, are taxable. The taxable benefit arising from the private use of a company car ranges from JMD 30,000 to JMD 140,000 _per annum_ and is determined by reference to the cost, the age, and the relative percentage of private use.
Reimbursement of excess tax paid over the tax that would be chargeable on the same amount of income in the recipient's home country (tax equalisation) is exempt from tax.
### Housing accommodation benefit
Housing accommodation provided to an employee by an employer is a taxable benefit. The taxable value of benefit varies, subject to certain conditions being met.
### Uniform and other non-cash benefits
The charge to income tax in respect of uniform and other non-cash benefits is to be determined by reference to the full cost of providing the uniform and other benefits in kind. Previously, the Income Tax Act did not prescribe a basis for the valuation of non-cash benefits derived by employees, with certain exceptions (e.g. the provision of accommodation benefit, company cars, or preferential loans by specified financial institutions). Nominal tax-free allowances of up to JMD 5,739 _per annum_ in respect of the provision of uniforms and JMD 3,395 _per annum_ in respect of laundry still apply for specified categories of workers.
## Capital gains and investment income
An individual who is resident but not domiciled in Jamaica is taxed in Jamaica on investment income arising outside of Jamaica to the extent that the income is remitted to Jamaica.
### Capital gains
There is no tax on capital gains in Jamaica. There is, however, a transfer tax on the market value of certain assets transferred and stamp duty payable on the transfer/disposal of shares or real property.  _See the section for more information_.
### Dividend income
Ordinary dividends paid by Jamaican tax-resident companies to Jamaican tax-resident shareholders are liable to tax at the rate of 15%. The tax is to be deducted on payment by the distributing company and represents the final tax on such dividends. Additionally, the dividend income on which tax is payable may not be offset by tax losses, and expenses incurred to earn the dividend are no longer deductible in arriving at chargeable income.
Preference dividends that qualify as tax deductible expenses of the paying company (_see below_) continue to be liable to tax at applicable rates (25%/30%) where the recipient is an individual. Dividends paid to non-resident shareholders are subject to income tax thereon at the default rate of 25% in the case of an individual (subject to any treaty protection or incentive relief available).
Subject to certain conditions being met, a company may claim an income tax deduction in respect of preference dividends paid during the year of assessment. However, to the extent that these preference dividends do not qualify for this income tax deduction, they will be treated in the manner indicated above.
### Interest income
Income tax at the rate of 25% is deducted at source from gross interest paid to Jamaican residents (i.e. individuals and companies) by a ’prescribed person‘. Prescribed persons include commercial banks and other financial institutions. The interest is taxable at applicable rates (25%/30%) with a credit for withholding tax (WHT) borne.
Interest paid by a resident person to a non-resident individual is subject to WHT of 25% (unless a lower rate of withholding is applicable by virtue of tax treaty protection available).

## Employment tax credit (ETC)
The ETC is a non-refundable tax credit that is available to tax-compliant employers, including individuals, in computing their income tax liability.
ETC is capped at the lower of eligible payroll taxes (excluding PAYE) remitted on time or 30% of the income tax payable on profits derived by the individual from the conduct of one's trade. The tax credit therefore provides tax-compliant individuals with an opportunity to reduce the effective income tax rate on their trading profits.
The ETC may not be claimed against any income tax chargeable on non-trading income (e.g. passive investment income) nor can it be claimed in the year of assessment where the taxpayer incurred a tax loss on business operations. The amount must be utilised in the year that the statutory payments are made. Unutilised amounts are not available to be carried forward or back to be utilised in the other years of assessment.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 02 August 2024
Individuals may be treated as being resident in Jamaica for a tax year (being the calendar year) if they satisfy any of one of several conditions:
  * They spend at least six months in Jamaica in the tax year or visit Jamaica with the intention of establishing tax residence and actually do so.
  * They (or their spouses) have a place of abode available for their use in Jamaica, and they visit the island at any time during the tax year, no matter how short the stay.
  * They habitually visit Jamaica for substantial periods. The Commissioner General, TAJ generally regards periods totalling three months as substantial and visits occurring in four consecutive years as habitual.

## Transfer tax
A transfer tax of 2% is applicable on the consideration payable (or market value in certain instances) on the transfer of land, buildings, securities, and shares (provided that a refund is available where the transfer tax charged exceeds 37.5% of the capital gain made). Listed securities transferred on the Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE) (including the Junior Stock Exchange) are exempt from transfer tax.
A form of transfer tax is also imposed on the estate of any individual who is domiciled in Jamaica at the date of his or her death.
There is no inheritance tax or capital gains tax regime in Jamaica.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is imposed at varying rates depending on the legal instruments involved.
Listed securities transferred on the JSE are exempt from stamp duty.
