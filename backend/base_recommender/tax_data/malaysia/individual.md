## Dividend tax
It is proposed that, with effect from year of assessment 2025, annual dividend income exceeding 100,000 Malaysian ringgits (MYR) received by resident individuals, non-resident individuals, and individuals holding shares through nominees is subject to a 2% tax on the chargeable dividend income after eligible tax deductions.

## High value goods tax
A high value goods tax at the rate of 5% to 10% on certain high-value items, such as jewellery and watches, was originally planned to be implemented on 1 May 2024. Its implementation has since been deferred to allow the review of the proposed high value goods tax alongside with the planned expansion of the sales tax and service tax.
## Increase in service tax rate from 6% to 8%
Effective from 1 March 2024, the service tax rate has increased from 6% to 8% for all taxable services previously subject to tax at 6%, except for:

# Malaysia
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
## Taxable period
The Malaysian tax year is the calendar year (i.e. 1 January to 31 December).
## Tax returns
Separate returns are issued to husband and wife and filed separately by each spouse. The income of a wife who is living with her husband is assessed separately from that of the husband. However, a wife who is a resident or a Malaysian citizen can elect to be taxed jointly with her husband. A husband who has no income may also elect to be assessed jointly with his wife under the wife’s name.
### Self-assessment for individuals
Malaysia adopts the self-assessment system where the taxpayer is responsible for computing one’s own chargeable income and tax payable, as well as making payments of any balance of tax due. The amount of tax payable for the year must be self-computed, and the tax return is deemed to be a notice of assessment upon its submission. The tax return is submitted not later than 30 April (without business income) and 30 June (with business income) in the following calendar year. E-filing or online filing of tax returns via the Internet is available for those who wish to file their returns using this method. Those who have chosen to file their returns for a year of assessment by way of e-filing will not be issued a tax return form for subsequent years.
Individuals whose total income tax is equivalent to the amount deducted under the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system can elect not to submit a tax return, subject to certain conditions being fulfilled.
## Payment of tax
Tax payments by employees are collected through compulsory deductions from salary. All deductions are made on a PAYE basis. If tax deemed assessed on an individual upon the submission of one’s return exceeds the total amount deducted from the individual’s salary, the difference must be paid on or before the submission date. Tax for a year of assessment is due and payable on the following dates in the year following that year of assessment:
  * 30 April for individuals deriving non-business income, and
  * 30 June for those having business income.

## Employment income
An employee is taxed on employment income earned for work performed in Malaysia regardless of where payment is made. Employment income includes salary, allowances, perquisites, benefits in kind, tax reimbursements, and rent-free accommodation provided by the employer.
Valuations of some types of employment income are as follows:
  * Cars or other household items provided for private use are valued at prescribed rates that could be lower than the actual cost incurred by the employer.
  * Rent-free accommodation provided by the employer is valued at the lower of 30% of the employee’s total cash remuneration or the actual rental value.


The following are exempt in the hands of the employee:
  * Medical benefits, as well as childcare benefits provided by the employer.
  * Leave passages, restricted to one overseas trip, up to a maximum amount of MYR 3,000, and three local trips (including meals and accommodation) per year.

### Exemptions and concessional tax treatment for expatriates
Exemptions or concessions are given in certain situations, such as:
  * Income from employment exercised in Malaysia for short-term visiting non-resident employees (other than public entertainers) if the period of employment does not exceed 60 days in a calendar year. If the period of employment straddles two calendar years, they are exempt if the total period of their employment over the two years does not exceed 60 days. If a short-term visiting employee is resident in a country that has a double tax treaty (DTT) with Malaysia, the qualifying period is generally extended to 183 days, provided certain other prescribed conditions are satisfied.
  * Exemption for an expatriate receiving fees as a director of a Labuan entity (until year of assessment 2025).
  * Expatriates working in regional operation centres in Malaysia that are accorded specified tax incentives are taxed only on the portion of chargeable income attributable to the number of days the employment is exercised in Malaysia.

## Social security contributions
### Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF)
The Malaysian EPF is a compulsory pension scheme for all Malaysians. The EPF receives and manages retirement savings, encompassing compulsory contributions by all Malaysian citizens and permanent residents who are working in Malaysia. It is not compulsory for non-Malaysian citizens and non-permanent residents to contribute to the EPF, but they may elect to do so.
Contribution by | Malaysian citizens and permanent residents (mandatory) | Expatriates and foreign workers (without permanent resident status) (voluntary)  
---|---|---  
% of contribution of employee’s wages (minimum)  
Employer | Employee | Employer | Employee  
Below age 60:  
Income > MYR 5,000 | 12.0% | 11.0% | MYR 5 per person | 11.0%  
Income ≤ MYR 5,000 | 13.0%  
Age 60 and above:

### Social Security Organisation
Malaysia also has a Social Security Organisation (SOCSO) who administers the Employment Injury Scheme (EIS) and the Invalidity Scheme (IS). SOCSO coverage and protection is limited to Malaysian citizens and permanent residents. A monthly contribution must be made and may fall under one of two categories:
  * Both the employer and employee make monthly contributions to EIS and IS. The sum is based on the employee’s monthly wages and is restricted to a maximum of MYR 104.15 for the employer and MYR 29.75 for the employee.
  * The employer makes a contribution to EIS only for employees who are not eligible to be covered under the IS, with the amount restricted to a monthly maximum of MYR 74.40. Malaysian employers are required to contribute to SOCSO on a monthly basis for all their employees (including foreign employees). However, the employment or assignment arrangement could impact the applicability of the requirement on the employee. As a result, each case needs to be examined individually to determine the applicability.


## Employment Insurance System (EIS)
The EIS provides certain benefits and a re-employment placement programme for insured persons in the event of loss of employment to promote active labour market policies. The EIS covers only Malaysian citizens, permanent residents, and temporary residents.
Both the employer and employee make monthly contributions of 0.2% of employee's wage, restricted to a maximum of MYR 11.90, respectively.
## Real property gains tax (RPGT)
RPGT is charged upon gains from disposals of real property or shares in a real property company. _See the section in the Corporate tax summary._ RPGT is imposed on individuals as follows:
Disposal | **Citizens and permanent residents** | Non-citizens/non-permanent residents  
---|---|---  
Up to 3 years | 30% | 30%  
In the 4th year | 20% | 30%  
In the 5th year | 15% | 30%  
Exceeding 5 years | 0% | 10%
