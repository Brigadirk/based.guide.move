## Thin capitalisation rules
An amendment has been made to the Icelandic Income Tax Act no. 90/2003. The rules, which are applicable from the income year 2019, state that interest deduction limitation rules do not apply when the whole company group bears full and unlimited tax liability in Iceland and the companies meet the requirements for joint taxation in Iceland.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year is the calendar year. However, in certain circumstances and upon application, the Internal Revenue Directorate can allow a different fiscal year from the calendar year.
## Tax returns
At the beginning of every year, the Internal Revenue Directorate determines the time limit for taxpayers to submit their tax returns and supporting documentation. The deadline for receipt of tax returns from corporations is generally 31 May each year. This deadline is extended upon application. Those who have their tax returns prepared by professional services can generally have the deadline extended until 30 September each year.
The final assessment must be completed no later than ten months after the end of the income year. Tax assessments for corporations will be available at the end of October.
## Payment of tax
Advance tax payments are due on the first day of every month, except January and October. Corporations pay income tax in advance, which is in turn deducted from the final tax assessment in October each year. The advance tax is collected in the months of February to September and amounts to 8.5% of the income tax on each due date. In total, the advance tax payments amount to 68% of the income tax. Any deficit remaining when final tax is assessed must be paid in equal instalments by 1 November and 1 December.
Income tax payments on dividends and interest income are due every quarter. Due dates are 20 January, 20 April, 20 July, and 20 October, and the final deadline for payment is 15 days later.
## Tax audit process
The Icelandic tax authorities select returns for examination using a variety of methods. Some returns are selected based on electronic selection; some are selected based on a formal supervisory plan. A tax audit can also be traced to information obtained by the tax authorities through efforts to identify participants of tax avoidance transactions.
The examination generally takes place by formal, written communication. The rules of the procedure are very strict, and the process can take from a few weeks to a year/years.
Appeal rights involve two administrative levels and also two judiciary levels.
## Statute of limitations
Tax authorities in Iceland have the right to reassess tax returns for CIT six years prior to the year of the assessment (i.e. the statutory period of limitation is six years). The statutory period only reaches a maximum of two years in time if tax returns have been filled out properly and all necessary information presented for tax authorities to establish a correct assessment. This means that in the year 2024, tax authorities can, in theory, reassess the company's tax back to income year 2018.
However, the limitation has been prolonged to ten years in case of income and assets in low-tax jurisdictions.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The topic of focus for tax authorities in Iceland is tax avoidance in general. It has been stated that they will increasingly focus on issues related to transfer pricing.


# Iceland
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
In general, all corporations incorporated and registered in Iceland are considered to be tax residents in Iceland. The same applies to corporations that have their home address in Iceland according to their articles of association or if the management of the company is carried out in Iceland.
Foreign corporations are regarded as Icelandic tax residents if the effective management is carried out in Iceland.
The Internal Revenue Directorate can decide with a ruling whether a corporation’s residence is in Iceland. The ruling can be appealed to the Internal Revenue Board or to a court of law.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The definition of a 'permanent establishment' is in order with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) definition of a PE in Article 5. The main difference is that a building site or construction or installation project constitutes a PE only if it lasts more than six months, not 12 months as in the OECD Model Treaty. Another difference is that if a foreign company owns servers or similar computer systems to support the business’s primary field of business, that in itself does not constitute a PE if used in relation to data storage and gathering.


# Iceland
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
Deductible operating expenses are comprised of all the expenses and costs needed to provide, insure, and maintain income (e.g. interest expense, employee expense, travel expense, insurance expense).
## Depreciation
Assets | Depreciation rate (%)  
---|---  
Ships, ship equipment, and personal vehicles | 10 to 20*  
Aircraft and accessories | 10 to 20*  
Heavy machinery, industrial machinery, and equipment | 10 to 30*  
Rigs, pipeline systems, and more for the use of research and production of hydrocarbons | 10 to 30*  
Office equipment | 20 to 35*  
Machinery, equipment, and vehicles that are not covered in the above categories | 20 to 35*  
Residential, commercial, and office accommodation | 1 to 3  
Factory buildings, garages, warehouses, etc. | 3 to 6  
Greenhouses, piers, and lots connected to these assets | 6 to 8  
Boreholes, powerlines, and temporary work camps | 7.5 to 10  
Purchased proprietary rights for ideas and trademarks, such as copyrights, publishing rights, information rights, patents, and logos | 15 to 20  
Purchased goodwill | 10 to 20  
* The depreciation base for these assets is their purchase value less earlier depreciations (book value).
The method used to calculate depreciation is the straight-line method.
## Goodwill
Purchased goodwill can be written down at 10% to 20% per year.
## Start-up expenses
Purchased fishing rights (quotas) cannot be depreciated.
Start-up costs for agricultural production rights can be depreciated without revaluation over five consecutive years. The following assets can be depreciated in full in the year they are initiated or paid with steady payments over five years:
  * Start-up costs, such as enterprise registration and obtaining operation licences.
  * Cost of research, developments, marketing, and obtaining patents and trademarks. If the use of individual assets does not fall into the same depreciation category, the depreciation base will be dependent on how much of it is used, so that if an asset is used for three-quarters or more for the same operation, the whole asset will have the same depreciation percentage.


## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are deductible, provided that the loan was taken for business purposes. It shall be kept in mind that interest limitation rules apply between related parties if certain conditions are fulfilled. _See Thin capitalisation in the section for more information_.
## Bad debt
As a general rule, 5% of bad debt can be written off. Certain conditions must be met in order to write off a higher percentage of bad debts.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions at up to 1.5% of total income are deductible.
## Pension expenses
Payments to obligatory pension funds for employees at a minimum of 11.5% of wages (or according to the minimum contribution in a collective agreement) are deductible.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are not deductible.
## Taxes
Taxes levied on business profit are not considered to be deductible; consequently, CIT is not deductible. However, social security contributions and other labour taxes are deductible.
## Net operating losses
Operating losses may be deducted from income from business and independent economic activity. Tax losses can be carried forward for ten years and utilised over ten years from the year that the loss was incurred.
No carryback of losses is allowed.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
An Icelandic corporation can claim a deduction for royalties, management fees, and similar payments made to foreign affiliates, provided that such amounts are made on an arm’s-length basis and reflect services received. Interest at normal commercial rates paid to foreign affiliates generally will be allowed as a deduction on the condition that the loan terms are comparable to those that would have been agreed upon by unrelated parties.


# Iceland
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
Companies may opt for consolidated taxation if a company owns at least a 90% share in another company. Consolidated taxation means, among other things, that losses of one company can be offset against profits of other companies. Consolidated taxation cannot be extended to non-resident companies or PEs of foreign companies.
## Transfer pricing
When pricing or terms of business or financial arrangements between related parties are different from what might be expected to be in similar transactions between unrelated parties, tax authorities have the power to evaluate what the correct pricing should be and reassess taxes of the party in question. This applies to the general purchase and sale of goods and services, tangible and intangible assets, and any financial instruments. Tax authorities can reassess taxes for up to six years prior to the year in which the reassessment takes place.
Legal entities are considered related when they are part of a group, when they are under the direct and/or indirect majority ownership or management control of two or more legal entities within the group, when majority ownership of one legal entity over another is present in a direct or indirect manner, or when they are entities directly or indirectly majority owned or under the administrative control of individuals who have family ties (e.g. individuals in a marriage or registered partnership, siblings and persons related to each other in a direct line).
If a legal entity’s operating revenues in one fiscal year, or total assets at the beginning or at the end of the fiscal year, exceeds ISK 1 billion, it is bound to documentation duties from the next fiscal year regarding transactions with related legal entities abroad. The legal entity in question must then record information about the nature and extent of transactions with the related legal entity and information on what the price is based on.
The legal entity is obligated to keep data regarding transactions with related legal entities for seven years. If the tax authorities request access to documentation, the legal entity has 45 days to respond.
In addition to specific rules regarding transfer pricing in domestic law, it should be noted that there are also certain provisions in domestic law that contain the so-called ‘arm's-length principle’, which states that when a deal or transaction between the parties significantly differs from the norm in such transactions, the tax base can be determined and reassessed according to what the tax authorities consider to be normal in such circumstances.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting regime
A parent company registered in Iceland that owns subsidiaries abroad, thereby forming a multinational enterprise (MNE), is required to submit to the tax authorities a CbC report. A CbC report need only be provided if the MNEs revenue exceeds 750 million euros (EUR). If applicable, CbC reports have to be filed no less than 12 months after the end of the company’s fiscal year.
## Thin capitalisation
Thin capitalisation rules are included in the Income Tax Act. The rules limit interest deduction to 30% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA). The rules apply in excess of ISK 100 million of interest expenses. 
The rules do not apply if:
  * interest expenses are paid because of intra-loan transactions within a group that is authorised for joint taxation in accordance with the Icelandic Income Tax Act or if the group fulfils the requirements for joint taxation, when all companies are resident in Iceland
  * it is demonstrated that the equity ratio does not deviate more than 2% from the equity ratio of the group, or
  * the taxpayer is a financial institution or insurance company or a company owned by such parties and conducts similar operations.


## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Any individual who either directly or indirectly owns a share in any kind of a company, fund, or organisation domiciled in a low-tax jurisdiction must pay income tax on the profit of such corporations in direct proportion to one's own share, regardless of distribution.
The same applies to taxpayers chairing companies, funds, organisations, or associations in a low-tax jurisdiction from which they receive direct or indirect benefits. In order for the above to apply, the foreign party must be domiciled in the low-tax jurisdiction, half the ownership of the foreign party must be directly or indirectly in the hands of Icelandic taxpayers, or they must have effective management and executive control within the income year.
CFC regulations do not apply if a fund or an organisation is protected by a double tax treaty (DTT) between Iceland and the low-tax country or if such entities are registered in another EEA member country where they have legitimate business operations and the countries have assigned a DTT between them.


# Iceland
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
A branch is treated as an extension of a trading activity of the overseas parent company incorporated in another jurisdiction and is not a separate legal entity.
Due to the fact that a branch acts in the name of the overseas parent company, a branch's income is taxable in accordance with the parent company (i.e. if the parent company is an LLC, the branch is subject to a CIT rate of 21%; otherwise, it is subject to tax at 38.4%).
Tax treaties may allow Icelandic CIT as a credit against foreign income tax imposed on the parent company.
There is no branch profits remittance tax on the repatriation of profits to the parent company.


# Iceland
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Foreign tax credit
The Income Tax Act offers a foreign tax credit to mitigate the potential for double taxation. The credit applies only to taxes of a nature similar to the tax being reduced by the credit (i.e. taxes based on income). This credit is limited to the amount of tax attributable to foreign-source income.
## Temporary reimbursements in respect of filmmaking in Iceland
On account of Act No. 43/1999 on Temporary Reimbursement in Respect of Filmmaking in Iceland, it is possible to have 25% of production expenses incurred in the production of films or television material in Iceland reimbursed. When more than 80% of the total production cost of a motion picture or television programme is incurred in Iceland, the reimbursement shall be calculated from the total production cost incurred within the EEA. Production costs refer to all costs incurred in Iceland deductible from the revenues of enterprises pursuant to the provisions of the Income Tax Act. Payments pertaining to employees and contractors are only to be included in production costs if they are verifiably taxable in Iceland.
Application for reimbursement of production costs shall be submitted to a committee of reimbursements in respect of filmmaking. The application, with supporting documentation, shall be submitted before production commences in Iceland.
Act No. 43/1999 on Temporary Reimbursements in Respect of Filmmaking in Iceland expires at year-end 2025. All projects approved by that date will be reimbursed in accordance with the law.
## Temporary reimbursements in respect of music recording in Iceland
On account of Act No. 110/2016 on Temporary Reimbursement of Recorded Music, it is possible to have 25% of cost incurred reimbursed when recording music in Iceland that has been released and made accessible to the general public. When more than 80% of the total recording cost is incurred in Iceland, the reimbursement shall be calculated from the total production cost incurred within the EEA. Reimbursable cost refers to all costs that may be used for calculating the refund amount, cf. Article 6 of Act No. 110/2016.
Application for reimbursement of production costs shall be submitted to the Ministry. The application, with supporting documentation, shall be submitted lo later than six months after the latest audio file for which a refund is applied for.
Act No. 110/2016 on Temporary Reimbursements of Recorded Music expires at year-end 2027. All applications received by the Ministry prior to that time shall be processed.
## Support for innovation enterprises
Innovative companies are entitled to a special deduction from CIT amounting to 35% of expenses incurred on the projects, provided certain conditions are met (25% for large companies).
For the years 2023 and 2024, the maximum amount on which the deduction is calculated within each company shall not exceed ISK 1.1 billion for each operating year. In the case of purchased research and development (R&D) services, maximum expenses shall not exceed ISK 200 million.
## Act on incentives for initial investments in Iceland
Incentives are offered to companies that are investing in commercial operations in Iceland. The investment projects need to meet requirements, such as being beneficial for the Icelandic economy and society, in terms of job creation, rural development, exports, and tax revenues and knowledge.
Approved investment projects will receive benefits in return, including derogations from taxes and charges. In addition, authorisation to fix the rate of income tax, in line with the current rate of income tax, for ten years can be granted, as well as exemption from customs and excise duties on importation or domestic purchase of construction materials, machinery, and equipment for the building and operation of the investment project.
Act. No. 41/2015 on incentives for initial investments in Iceland expired at the end of June 2020. Incentives granted prior to that time shall remain in force for the period according to the agreement in question.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
Dividends paid to a resident company are subject to 22% WHT. Dividends paid to a non-resident company are subject to 20% WHT. The final taxation of dividends paid to a company within the EEA is nil, as WHT will be reimbursed in the year following payment upon filing a tax return.
Interest paid to a resident company is subject to 22% WHT, and interest paid to a non-resident company is subject to 12% WHT.
Gross royalties paid to a non-resident are taxable at the standard 22% CIT rate and subject to withholding.
Iceland has signed a draft of a treaty with both Andorra and Australia that are expected to be ratified in coming years.

## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Foreign currency financial statements/Accounting in foreign currencies
Companies can apply to the Registry of Annual Accounts for an authorisation to keep their books and prepare their annual accounts in a foreign currency. An application must be filed no later than two months before the beginning of the company’s fiscal year. The authorisation is valid for five years, and the Registry of Annual Accounts is responsible for ensuring that the authorised companies continue to fulfil one or more of the following necessary conditions:
  * The company’s main business operations take place abroad or the company is a part of a foreign company group.
  * The company owns foreign subsidiaries or shares in foreign companies, and its main business transactions are with those companies.
  * The company’s main place of business is Iceland, while a considerable number of their transactions are in foreign currencies.
  * A considerable portion of the company’s investments and related debts are in foreign currencies.
  * The functional currency is registered at the Central Bank of Iceland or the company’s commercial bank.


If the company deems that it no longer fulfils the conditions, it must notify the Registry of Annual Accounts. The Registry can postpone its decision of the authorisation’s discontinuance for two fiscal years if the situation that is causing the fact that the company does not continue to fulfil the necessary conditions is deemed to be temporary.
The average exchange rate for the fiscal year must be used when converting income and expenses, depreciations included, into Icelandic króna. The exchange rate at the end of the fiscal year must be used when converting assets, debts, and capital. Exchange rate differences that may arise do not affect income on profit and loss accounts.
## Rules of Foreign Exchange
In 2008, the Central Bank of Iceland issued rules on foreign exchange in order to restrict or temporarily prevent certain types of cross-border capital movements or foreign exchange transactions related thereto, which, according to the Central Bank of Iceland, can cause serious and considerable instabilities in exchange rates and financial matters. These rules were later added to Act No. 87/1992 on Foreign Exchange.
The Act on Foreign Exchange defines capital movements as:
  * The issue, sale, or purchase of shares, debt instruments, drafts, unit shares in mutual funds, and other long-term and short-term securities.
  * Deposits in and withdrawals from accounts with depository institutions.
  * Lending, borrowing, and the issue of securities not related to international transactions with goods and services.
  * The import and export of share certificates and domestic and foreign currencies.
  * Forward contracts, options, currency and interest-rate swaps, and other related foreign exchange transactions in which the Icelandic króna is one of the denominated currencies.
  * Presents, grants, or other transactions equivalent to the ones detailed above.


With new rules, which entered into effect on 14 March 2017, the restrictions on foreign exchange transactions and cross-border movement of domestic and foreign currency have largely been lifted. Restrictions on the following will remain in place, however: (i) derivatives trading for purposes other than hedging, (ii) foreign exchange transactions carried out between residents and non-residents without the intermediation of a financial undertaking, and (iii) in certain instances, foreign-denominated lending by residents to non-residents.
## Cross-border mergers
Rules regarding taxation in relation to cross-border divisions and cross-border mergers between Icelandic LLCs and LLCs from EEA and EFTA countries are now in the Icelandic Tax Act. Tax will be levied on uncapitalised profit, which can be postponed for five years.
## Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)
The Icelandic government participated in full in formulating and approving the G20/OECD BEPS Action Plan.
The government has implemented Action 4 on interest limitation, Action 7 on definition of permanent establishment, and Action 13 on transfer pricing documentation and CbC reporting. Additionally, Iceland participated in the creation of the multilateral instrument (MLI) as represented in Action 15, and the MLI was been signed by the Icelandic government on 7 June 2017.
Although Iceland is not a European Union (EU) member state, it is a member of the European Economic Area, so its legislation must comply with EEA rules and avoid infringement of the four freedom principles as provided in the EEA Agreement.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
Icelandic authorities have implemented the CRS in its domestic legislation. The Standard is in accordance to The Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information as developed by the G20/OECD in the year 2014.


# Iceland
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Inventory valuation
The valuation method of raw materials and finished goods is on a first in first out (FIFO) basis or via the average cost method. When computing the value of produced goods, both direct and indirect production cost must be taken into account. For tax purposes, inventories can be further written down at a rate of 5% of calculated value.
Last in first out (LIFO) is not permitted.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are treated as taxable income in the year that transfer of ownership occurs and, as such, taxed as part of the general corporate income. Capital gains are generally not subject to withholding tax (WHT). There are rules that allow full deduction of net capital gains from the sale of shares, so, in general, corporations are not subject to taxation on capital gains from sale of shares.
## Dividend income
Dividend income is treated as taxable income and taxed as a part of corporate income. There are extensive rules that allow full deduction of the dividend, so, in general, corporations are not subject to taxation on dividends. Dividends are subject to WHT (currently 21%), which is a temporary payment towards the final tax assessment. However, dividends paid between resident limited liability corporations are not subject to WHT.
## Interest income
Interest income derived from bank deposits, mutual and investment funds, bonds, or other financial deeds; any kind of exchange rate profit; and any other income from monetary assets are subject to 22% tax.
Interest income of foreign parties is subject to 13% WHT in Iceland.
## Royalty income
Royalties paid to residents are taxed at the standard CIT rate. Gross royalties paid to a non-resident are taxable at the standard 22% CIT rate and subject to withholding.
## Profit from derivatives
Profits from derivatives are treated as profits/losses from sales and are subject to 22% tax. Losses from derivatives can be used against profits from derivatives within the calendar year.
## Foreign income
Income earned abroad is generally taxed as a part of corporate income since a resident company is subject to CIT on its worldwide income.
Controlled foreign company (CFC) rules stipulate that profits of companies in low-tax jurisdictions must pay income tax of such a profit in direct proportion to shares, regardless of distribution. A low-tax jurisdiction is defined as a jurisdiction where the CIT rate is less than two-thirds of Iceland’s CIT rate (i.e. 14%, being two-thirds of 21%). _See Controlled foreign companies (CFCs) in the section for more information_.
Double taxation of foreign income is avoided either through tax treaties or domestic tax provisions.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
Resident corporations pay tax on their worldwide income less operating expenses. Deductible operating expenses are comprised of all the expenses and costs needed to provide, insure, and maintain income.
Corporate income tax (CIT) for limited liability companies (LLCs) and limited partnership companies is assessed at a rate of 21%. CIT for other types of legal entities (e.g. partnerships) is assessed at a rate of 37.6%.
Non-resident corporations receiving payments for services or business operations carried out in Iceland, as well as corporations operating a permanent establishment (PE) in Iceland or receiving a profit from such establishments, are subject to CIT for their Icelandic income at the same rate as applies to resident corporations.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is a consumption tax levied on all stages of domestic business transactions. VAT is levied on all goods and services, as well as on the imports of goods and services, unless specific exemptions apply.
### VAT rates
The general VAT rate is 24%.
The following goods and services are subject to a reduced VAT rate of 11%:
  * Rental of hotel and guest rooms and other accommodation.
  * Campground facilities. Access to electricity, toilets, and showers at a campground is considered part of the property service and is therefore subject to VAT at the reduced rate whether the service is included in the entrance fee for camping or sold separately to guests of the camp site.
  * Transportation of passengers, such as for whale watching, horseback riding, and snowmobile tours.
  * The services of travel agencies and tour operators for services used in Iceland.
  * Subscription to radio and television.
  * Newspapers, periodicals, and magazines.
  * Books, both Icelandic and translated, musical notation as well as their audio recordings. Same applies to compact discs and other similar media as well as electronic media.
  * Geothermal hot water, electricity, and fuel oils used for heating houses and swimming pools.
  * Food and other consumables for people as detailed in an addendum to the VAT Act.
  * Access to roads and other transport-related constructions.
  * Compact discs, records, audio cassettes, and other equivalent mediums for music only and not videos. Same applies to electronically published music without video.
  * Condoms, reusable cloth diapers, and diapers inserts.
  * Admission fees to baths, saunas, and spa areas that are not subject to exemption due to sporting activities.
  * Guiding services.


Certain services and goods are zero-rated, which means that there is, in fact, no VAT charge. Zero-rated VAT mainly applies to exported goods and services provided abroad.
### VAT entities
Businesses engaged in the trade of taxable goods and services for business purposes must register and collect VAT.
### Services exempt from VAT
The VAT Act details certain services that are exempt from the tax, such as healthcare services, social services, the operation of schools, various education services, cultural activities, athletic activities, public transportation, postal services, sale of real estate (not including the rental of hotel and guest accommodation), rental of car parking lot, insurance activities, services of financial banks (as well as securities trading), lotteries and betting pools, artistic activities, funeral services, and all services of ministers of the church.
Those selling taxable goods and services totalling less than 2 million Icelandic króna (ISK) per 12-month period are also exempt from collecting and remitting VAT.
### Agent for non-resident parties
Non-residents who are engaged in taxable transactions in Iceland but are neither domiciled nor have permanent residence in Iceland must appoint a VAT agent with residence in Iceland to report on their behalf. Both parties are liable for the VAT payments (responsible for ensuring remittance of VAT). If a non-resident does not appoint a VAT agent, the purchaser of the services/goods is responsible for paying the VAT (reverse charge).
If the non-resident is only providing e-services, one can apply for an Icelandic ID number to report/pay the VAT oneself (i.e. without a VAT agent).
### VAT accounting periods and due dates
VAT is generally filed and paid on a bimonthly basis. The due date for payment of VAT is one month and five days after the end of the settlement period. For example, the due date for the January and February payments is 5 April.
If the VAT is not paid on the due date, a 1% penalty charge is added for every day up to a total of 10%. Late penalty interests also apply as of one month after the due date.
A special fee for late filing, ISK 5,000, applies if the tax authorities have estimated the VAT due to non-filing.
### VAT reimbursement
Foreign enterprises, which are neither residents of Iceland nor have a PE, may obtain reimbursement of VAT paid on goods and taxable services that have been purchased or imported for the commercial purposes of such enterprises in Iceland.
Such reimbursement can be effected to foreign enterprises that would be subject to registration in Iceland according to Article 5 and Article 6 of the VAT Act if the enterprises in question were engaged in such business in Iceland. This means that such enterprises as travel agencies, insurance companies, banks, and other financial institutions cannot obtain such reimbursement.
Another prerequisite is that the enterprise shall neither have sold goods nor taxable services in Iceland during the period to which the application refers.
Parties domiciled abroad can get partial VAT reimbursement on goods they have bought in Iceland if they take them abroad with them within three months from the date of purchase. They then must provide the goods, along with any necessary documents, to the appropriate reimbursement company or to the customs authorities on the date of departure, and the purchase price must amount to at least ISK 4,000.
## Customs duties
The Directorate of Customs controls import, transit, and export and also collects duties, taxes, and various state revenue. The general rule is that import duties (customs, excise duties, VAT, and various other charges) are to be paid on imported goods unless otherwise stated in the law. For import of some products, other conditions, such as an import licence, may need to be submitted.
Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland are members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). The EFTA Convention established a free trade area among its member states. In addition, the EFTA states have jointly concluded free trade agreements with a number of countries in Central and Eastern Europe as well as in the Mediterranean region, Mexico, and Singapore. Also, three of the EFTA states (Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway) entered into the Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA) in 1992. The current contracting parties are, in addition to the three EFTA states, the European Community (EC) and the 25 EC member states. Iceland also has a bilateral agreement with its two neighbouring countries, Greenland and Faeroe Islands.
