## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
Resident individuals are fully liable for tax payments in Iceland on their worldwide income.
Non-resident individuals staying temporarily in Iceland, who derive income from employment during their stay, are subject to national income tax on such income. They are also subject to municipal income tax in the same manner as residents. Other non-resident individuals are subject to national income tax and municipal income tax on their income from Iceland. Non-residents are allowed the same deductions for expenses as residents.
## Personal income tax rates
Personal income is a net income tax base with a progressive state income tax rate and municipal tax.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year for individuals equals the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Individuals must file their tax returns before the end of 14 March in the consecutive year after the tax year. Extensions may be granted for up to five days.
## Payment of tax
Individual income taxes are withheld at source each month. Any difference between income tax withheld and the assessed income tax (national and municipal) is refunded, increased by 2.5% of the difference; any deficit is collected, increased by 2.5%, on five due dates each year. The due dates are the first day of July to December. Payments must be made within 30 days from the due date.
### Withholding requirements for sale of property, dividends, interest, and royalties
Gains from sale of property and royalties are not subject to WHT in Iceland.
Dividends and interest income are subject to WHT withheld at source and filed/returned on due date. The payment periods are three months, January to March, April to June, July to September, and October to December. Due dates are 20 April, 20 July, 20 October, and 20 January. Payments must be made within 15 days from the due dates.
## Tax audit process
Individuals receive a pre-drafted tax return from the tax authorities to be confirmed or corrected.
Dividends and interest income are capital gains and liable to WHT. Rental income, capital gains, and other income from assets are not liable to WHT.
When the tax return deadline has expired, the Internal Revenue Directorate calculates a taxpayer’s income tax according to the tax return submitted. WHT on salary and capital income is deducted from the final tax assessment. If these items are higher than the final tax assessment, the difference is used towards tax debt repayment and/or the taxpayer is refunded.
The final tax assessment for each year should be completed no later than ten months after the end of the income year, but, in general, the assessment will be finalised on 31 May.
Most of the filing process is electronic. The assessment notice is also electronic in most cases, but individuals can also file in paper. Tax authorities place a general notice of the assessment in the local gazette.
A complaint regarding the assessment can be sent to the Internal Revenue Directorate within 60 days, and the final ruling of that authority can be appealed to the State Internal Revenue Board within three months.
## Statute of limitations
Tax authorities in Iceland have the right to reassess tax returns for six years prior to the year of the assessment, i.e. the statutory period of limitation is six years. The statutory period only reaches a maximum of two years in time if tax returns have been filled out properly and all necessary information presented for tax authorities to establish a correct assessment. This means that in the year 2024, tax authorities can, in theory, reassess the tax of individuals back to income year 2018.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The topic of focus for tax authorities in Iceland is tax avoidance in general.


# Iceland
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
Certain deductions, authorised by law, can be deducted from individual’s income. In some cases, work-related expenses may be deducted if substantiated with the appropriate documents.
## Employment expenses
Employees’ verifiable operating costs of their car used in the service of their employment are deductible from the car allowance provided by their employers. To qualify for the deduction, the employee needs to keep a daily driving log and detail total costs and usage.
The maximum available deduction from the car allowance is ISK 83 to ISK 141 per km. Please note that this amount may vary during the year.
_Per diem_ payments are paid for employees’ occasional travels outside of their contractual place of work. The payments should cover the employee’s expenses incurred by being away from home, including costs for accommodation, food, and other travel related expenses. Employees can report deductions against the _per diem_ payments as stated in the Principal Tax Rates published by the Internal Revenue Directorate. Tax does not have to be withheld from _per diem_ payments as long as the payments are not higher than stipulated in the Principal Tax Rates. If the payments are higher, the difference is liable to WHT.
## Personal deductions
Parents or supporters of dependent individuals between 16 and 21 years of age who are students or have such low income that they are not able to support themselves can apply to the Internal Revenue Directorate for a reduction of their income tax base. No deduction is available if the dependant is in a field of study eligible for student loans. 
The Internal Revenue Directorate can also, in other circumstances, reduce an individual’s income and municipal tax base. Those special circumstances are:
  * Sickness, accident, old age, and death, if it reduces the taxpayer’s ability to pay tax.
  * Sickness or disability of a child suffering from a chronic disease. A condition for deduction is production of verifiable records of expenses incurred by supporting the child that exceed the normal costs of raising a child.
  * Caring for parents or other family members. A condition for deduction is production of verifiable records of expenses to corroborate incurred costs of supporting parents or other family members.
  * Damage of property if the taxpayer has suffered considerable damage to one’s property for which one did not receive compensation.
  * Non-business related bad debt (e.g. non-refundable securities that have expired).


The tax base reduction application needs to be submitted with the tax return along with documents that are needed to support the application.
## Personal allowances
In Iceland, personal allowances take the form of personal tax credits (_see the section for more information_).

Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Individuals with limited tax liability
Limited tax liability applies to individuals who are not domiciled in Iceland but are liable to pay income tax derived from income earned in Iceland, irrespective of any income they may be earning elsewhere at the same time or within the same calendar year. Double taxation treaties (DTTs) incorporate various clauses that allow for the exemption of income tax on such income, which, without such treaties, would be taxable in Iceland.
### Tax rates/tax collection
Non-residents who stay in Iceland temporarily and earn an income are subject to local income tax on those earnings. The income tax rate is the same as for local taxpayers, which is 16.55% to 31.35%, depending on income. In addition to income tax, a municipal tax of 14.93% is levied. These individuals are entitled to personal allowance in direct proportion to the days they reside in Iceland.
Individuals in Iceland involved in operating a permanent business or receive a share from the profit of operating such a business pay 16.55% to 31.35% income tax on the income tax base. Municipal tax is paid to the municipality where the majority of the earnings were earned. No personal tax credits are available.
A 22% capital income tax is levied on capital gains from real estate, capital gains from shares, and dividends.
A 12% capital income tax is levied on interest income. No tax is levied on the first ISK 300,000.
Rental income from residential properties and liquid assets is subject to a 22% tax rate. However, no tax is levied on 50% of an individual’s income deriving from renting a residential property.
### Directors’ fees
There is a 20% income tax, as well as municipal tax, levied on remuneration for directors, remuneration for financial advisors acting in a management position or other committee work, severance pay, funding, or equivalent payments for services or business in Iceland.
Pensions and payments from the national insurance fund are taxed as income (i.e. 16.55% to 31.35%) plus municipal tax. Personal tax credits may be used for income tax on pensions and insurance payments. If the personal tax credits are not used in full, the unused part can be used against municipal tax levied on the same income. Any personal tax credits remain unused become invalid and cannot be transferred between spouses unless both of them are receiving pensions or social insurance payments.
### Entertainment income
Individuals who receive payments for entertainment or sporting activities as profit shares pay a 15% income tax on gross payment, plus municipal tax.
### Tax release on grounds of a DTT
To apply for exemption from tax liability in Iceland on grounds of provisions in a DTT, form RSK 5.42 must be completed and returned to the Internal Revenue Directorate.
In cases where taxes have already been withheld in spite of grounds for exemption, an application under DTTs for a refund of taxes paid in Iceland can be made by completing and submitting application form RSK 5.43 to the Internal Revenue Directorate.
### Withholding tax collection
Income tax for individuals is divided into state income tax and municipal tax. Both state income tax and municipal tax are withheld at source monthly. Dividends, interest, and capital gains are also subject to WHT at source.
### Assessment and payment of tax
Individuals working in Iceland as employees subject to limited tax liability must file a tax return when leaving the country and are subject to a tax assessment.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
In the Icelandic tax system, individuals are subject to tax on all personal income and capital income. Taxable income is divided into three main categories:
  * Category A is comprised of wages and salaries, including presumptive employment income of self-employed individuals, employment-related benefits, retirement pensions, social security payments, grants, payments to copyright holders, royalties, etc.
  * Category B is comprised of income from a business and income from an independent economic activity.
  * Category C is comprised of capital income such as dividends, interest, and capital gains.


The concept of taxable income includes all kinds of payments made in cash and by other means where the monetary value can be ascertained.
## Capital gains
Gains from the sale of privately owned property are subject to 22% capital income tax.
Gains from sales of private residential property are tax-exempt if the property has been in the taxpayer’s ownership for over two years.
In general, an individual’s capital gains from the sale of privately owned liquid assets are tax-exempt.
## Dividend income
Dividends are subject to capital income tax. In the event of share decrease or the liquidation of the company, payments to shareholders exceeding the purchase price are treated as dividends and, as such, are subject to 22% tax.
## Interest income
Interest income derived from bank deposits, mutual and investment funds, bonds or other financial deeds, any kind of exchange rate profit, and any other income from monetary assets are subject to 22% capital income tax. No tax is calculated on the total interest revenue up to ISK 300,000 per year for an individual. This personal allowance is not applicable for withholding tax (WHT) but applies in the final tax assessment.
## Rental income
Rental income from residential properties and liquid assets is subject to 22% capital income tax. Note that only 50% of rental income is subject to taxation. Individuals renting out residential property for a limited period of time can deduct the rental cost of the property by netting the cost they incur for personal housing against the income generated.
## Exempt income
No significant items of compensation are tax exempt in Iceland.

## Pension fund contributions
Every employee from 16 to 70 years of age and every employer must contribute to a pension fund. The minimum contribution is 15.5% (4% for employees and 11.5% for employers) of all employees’ and self-employed persons’ remunerations. The employee’s contribution (4%) is deducted from their taxable income.
In addition to the minimum contribution, an employee can contribute and deduct up to an additional 4% from one's taxable income, as long as the contribution is used to increase one's pension rights. This additional contribution can be paid into a private pension fund.
Should the employer’s contribution to the pension fund exceed 12.5% of the employee’s remuneration, and also exceed ISK 2 million per year, the excess shall be calculated as taxable income.
By supplying a completed A1 (former E-101) certificate, individuals from European Economic Area (EEA) member countries are not bound to contribute to an Icelandic pension fund. An employer of an individual supplying an A1 certificate is subject to a lower rate of social security contribution. Those exemptions are dependent on equivalent payments being made in the individual’s country of residence.
## Contribution to the elderly fund
Iceland maintains a special fund for the elderly, aside from pension contributions. Every taxable individual from the age of 16 to 69 must make a contribution to the elderly fund. The payment for the assessment year 2024 is ISK 13,749.

The tax base is the net value of all financial assets and properties owned by the deceased at the time of death (after debts and expenses have been deducted). The value is decided by the market value of the asset in question. Property value is based on the official Property Register price.
If assets are left to a surviving spouse or cohabitant, no inheritance tax is levied. The same applies to any pension that the inheritors receive.
## Property taxes
A municipal property tax is applied on real estate in Iceland.
