Applicability of these provisions must be requested from the General Tax Manager prior to the incorporation of the company.
## Interest expenses
Interest paid directly or indirectly to shareholders with respect to the sums made available by them to the company is only deductible within the limit of those calculated on the intervention rate on invitation to tender (TIAO) of the Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) raised by 2%, provided that the share capital is fully paid up in case of incorporation of the company as well as in case of increase of the said share capital.

The interests on loans granted in view of the production of fixed assets are included into the cost of acquisition of these assets and are not admitted as deductible expenses. 
## Bad debt
Bad debt can be deducted from the result of the fiscal year during which the debt became completely unrecoverable, subject to the irrecoverable character of the compromised debt being justified due to the situation of the debtor.
## Provisions
To be tax deductible, provisions must relate to existing liability or loss. General provisions are not deductible.
## Expenditures on rent
The amount of the rentals granted to a company is allowed as a deductible expense under the condition that it does not exceed the average rentals applied for similar buildings and amenities.
However, an exception is provided with regard to the renting of premises by a shareholder directly or indirectly owning at least 10% of the shares of the company.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions do not, in principle, constitute expenses deductible from the taxable result. However, contributions for charity can be deducted, provided that the donation is made to the profit of organisms of public interest located in Gabon and that the donation is justified.
The deduction is limited to 1/1,000 of the company’s turnover for the considered fiscal year.

Fines and third-party taxes borne by companies are not tax deductible.
## Social security contributions paid to foreign retirement funds

## Taxes
Only professional taxes for which the recovery proceeding has started in the current fiscal year and for which the company is effectively liable due to operations carried out in Gabon can be deducted.

The Gabonese Tax Code does not provide the possibility to carry back losses. It does, however, provide for a five-year carryforward for net operating losses.
Regarding depreciation deferred in the accounts, they can be carried forward indefinitely.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Management fees paid to a foreign parent company are deductible if they meet all of the following conditions:

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 04 March 2024
## Specific group tax regime
There is a specific tax regime derogatory to the common law tax regime that is applicable, under conditions, to groups of companies.
According to the provisions of Article 11 b. of the tax measures applying to groups of companies, groups of companies are those constituted by companies subject to CIT, or a foreign equivalent tax, united between them through direct or indirect capital links of at least 50% and that allow one of them or several companies, jointly, to control the others.
The control is defined as:
  * either the direct or indirect holding of the majority of the vote in another company or
  * the nomination, during two consecutive years, of the majority of the members of the board of directors of another company.


To be eligible for this specific tax regime, and without any prejudice of other activities performed to the profit of third parties, the head of the group of companies must perform to the profit of other companies of the group an activity relating exclusively to the following fields:
  * Provisions of services of any kind, notably technical, accounting, financial, administrative, data processing, legal, human resources, and commercial corresponding to functions of management, coordination, and control of the group's companies.
  * Research and development (R&D) to the sole profit of the group.
  * Management of the intra-group finance.


Each company subject to CIT that is a member of the group and fulfils the conditions provided by the law will be subject to a separate taxation of its results according to the rules of common law and subject to amendments expressly provided by the law for the determination of the taxable result.
The express amendments provided in the scope of the specific tax regime applicable to groups of companies are the following:
### Capital gains
Net capital gains are taxed at a reduced rate of 20% when they are realised in the scope of intra-group operations.
### Expenses deductible from the taxable result subject to CIT
The following expenses are deductible within the group:
  * Head office fees and management fees determined on a lump sum basis, according to the conditions of allocation of the expense between the companies’ members of the group defined in a previous ruling with the tax authorities.
  * The whole of the interests on partners' current accounts (i.e. on the sums put, by the partners, at the disposal of a company of the group) within the sole limit of the intervention rate TIAO of the BEAC raised by 2%.
  * Rents of movables carried out within the group by the mother company or between companies of the same group.


### 20% WHT
Sums subject to CIT according to the provisions of Article 206 of the Gabonese Tax Code paid by a Gabonese debtor member of a group of companies to a foreign company member of the same group are exempted from the 20% WHT even though no DTT aiming to avoid double taxation has been concluded between Gabon and the country of residence of the beneficiary of the remunerations.
### Transferable securities income tax (IRCM)
Companies of the group that benefit from transferable securities income originating from Gabon are exempted from IRCM when the said revenues are paid by a company member of the group.
In return, payments carried out by the head of the group of companies to the profit of its partners (individuals or legal entities) are subject to IRCM at a unique and at source rate of 10% (instead of 20%).
It is to be noted that the transferable securities incomes having their source abroad and which gave rise to taxation in their country of origin give the right in Gabon to a tax credit of the amount of the taxation that is deductible from the CIT of the fiscal year of perception of the incomes. The aforesaid tax credit applies even though no DTT aiming to avoid double taxation has been concluded between Gabon and the country of origin of the incomes.
### VAT
The head of the group of companies is liable for VAT.
Members of a group of companies could, however, on option, consider the following provisions of services performed within the group as being out of the scope of application of VAT:
  * Provisions of services of any kind, notably technical, accounting, financial, administrative, data processing, legal, human resources, and commercial.
  * Studies costs.
  * Supplying personnel.
  * Management of finance.


The option for the subjection of the above-mentioned operations must be formulated by the concerned taxpayers on express request addressed to the General Tax Manager.
### Registration duties
Deeds relating to incorporation, increase or reduction of share capital, breaking up with or without clearance, merger, scission, partial contribution of assets, and transfer of shares of a company member of a tax group, are subject to a fixed duty of XAF 20,000.
In the absence of a more favourable duty provided by the common law of registration, the changes of ownership and use that are not provided at Article 6 of the Gabonese Tax Code are subject to a proportional rate of 1% when carried out by members of the same tax group.
### Requirements relating to declaratory obligations
The adherence to the group tax regime must be notified in writing by the head of the group of companies to the General Tax Manager accompanied by the list of the companies included in the tax perimeter of the group.
Each company remains liable for the periodical returns applicable to its activity.
For the purpose of calculation and verification of the returns, each tax return relating to the CIT of each company of the group will be gathered and filed at the same time by the head of the group of companies before the Tax Office.
## Transfer pricing
The Gabonese Tax Code provides rules regarding transfer pricing issues.
According to these rules, any payment considered to be a result of mismanagement will be subject to the CIT rate at 30% (35% for companies operating in the oil and mining sectors) plus penalties.
Indeed, Article 12 of the Code provides that "By virtue of law or in fact, for companies which are dependent of companies or groups of companies located outside the CEMAC area, or for those which possess the control of companies located outside the CEMAC area, payments or expenses realised by any mean whatsoever or any kind of advantages or help granted to third parties without equivalent counterpart for the company, comparable to abnormal act of management, constitute transfer of profits subject to corporate income tax".
It is applicable for the following:
  * Payments constituting an increase or decrease of purchases or sales.
  * Payments of excessive royalties or royalties without compensation.
  * Relinquishment of revenues (underestimated sale price, free of charge service provision, granting of a free loan or a loan with low interests).


The abnormal act of management is not limited to expenses; it also includes any form of advantages or allowances granted to third parties without any equivalent compensation for the company.
Article 13 of the Gabonese Tax Code provides that "The advantages or assistance granted by companies belonging to the same group can only be considered as resulting from a normal management if the company which grants these advantages or assistance demonstrates the existence of its own interest in acting as such. The general interest of the group is not sufficient to justify such practices".
Further to the Financial Act for 2017 implementing the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) regulation, a Master file containing information about the group structure and a Local file in relation to the structure, transfer pricing policy, and group transactions of the local entity must be provided to the tax authorities on a yearly basis, at the same time as the Annual Tax Return (DSF).
The Financial Act for 2017 has also introduced penalties, in case of failure to provide the Master and Local files, corresponding to 5% of the transactions realised with companies of the group with a minimum of XAF 65 million per year.
In addition, a Country-by-Country (CbC) report must be filed by the ultimate parent company of the group before the tax administration of which it depends.
## Thin capitalisation
Thin capitalisation rules have been introduced by the Finance Act 2018.
When the company paying the interest is deemed to be thinly capitalised, only a portion of that interest may be deductible from the taxable result.A company is deemed thinly capitalised when the amount of interests paid on inter-company loans exceeds, simultaneously, the three following limits during the same fiscal year:
  * The product of interest payments on inter-company loans x ((1.5 x equity)/loans granted to group affiliates).
  * Interests received by the company by affiliates.
  * 25% of the profits before tax + interests paid + depreciation taking in consideration to be deducted from the considered tax profit + share of the rents of leasing taken into account for determining the transfer price of the property at the end of the contract.


In a thinly capitalised company, the fraction of interests exceeding the highest of the above-mentioned ratios would not be tax deductible in the course of the considered fiscal year.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There is no specific tax rule under Gabon legislation related to CFCs.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 04 March 2024
Taxation of branch income is the same as for corporate income. However, a 20% WHT on profit is due at the time the profit is taken by the head office (located abroad) of the branch. This rate is reduced to 10% in case of the existence of a tax treaty.
## Simplified tax regime for oil subcontractors
The simplified tax regime for oil subcontractors is abrogated from 1 January 2022. 
## Specific regime for regional offices (_quartiers généraux_)
A regional office is a company or a branch that renders various administrative services, such as management or accounting, exclusively to other companies of the same group based in a given geographical area (usually a group of countries).
The derogatory tax regime that was applicable to the said regional offices has been abrogated by the amended Financial Act for 2021. The tax base of such offices is then determined in accordance with the common law regime.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives

This tax credit is equal to 20% of the gross salary paid to new employees and is subject to the creation of a minimum number of jobs, according to the size of the company as follows:
  * Two jobs, for companies with less than 20 employees.

Note that the tax credit is granted only on newly created jobs since the preceding fiscal year. Contracts concluded with the employees must also be for an undetermined duration, and the new jobs must not result from the diminution of existing jobs.
## Inbound investment incentives
Due to the provisions of the Investments Law, any private investment in Gabon can benefit from:
  * A common law framework.

  * Specifically agreed frameworks.


Depending on the frameworks it is eligible for, a company can benefit from customs privileges and tax breaks.
Industrial companies already set up in Gabon and wishing to increase their production capacity can be admitted to a preferential tariff framework. This entails the application of a global reduced rate of 5% for duties and taxes paid on imports of equipment (excluding materials, furniture, and spare parts), provided that these correspond to an investment schedule and their value is in excess of XAF 100 million.
New industrial companies can also benefit from this framework, provided they are not subject to any of the other privileged frameworks outlined by current legislation.
The granting of this privileged tariff framework occurs on the basis of a decision by the Minister of Finances, following a proposal from the Director of Customs and Indirect Taxes.
## Capital investment incentive
New companies are exempt from the IMF, the minimum taxation of CIT, during the first two years of operations.
## Capital investment companies

The concerned companies may apply before the customs authorities in order to benefit from the above-mentioned regime.
The concerned companies are those authorised for the planning of urban lands intended for social habitat and the building of housings of a socio-economic nature and industrial units of manufacturing of materials and other inputs used for the building of social housings. The above-mentioned tax exemptions relate to CIT, VAT, and business license tax.
## Tourism incentive
Companies having hotel activity in the tourism sector are exempted from CIT during the first three years of existence, provided that the amount of the investment equals or exceeds XAF 300 million. If not (i.e. investment of less than XAF 300 million), aforesaid authorised companies investing in the tourism sector can benefit, during a five-year period, from a 5% tax credit.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 04 March 2024
## Inventory valuation
Stocks are estimated at cost price. If the market price is lower than the cost price, the company has to make provisions for depreciation of inventory.
## Capital gains
Capital gains arising from the transfer of assets must be used for the calculation of taxable profits. However, the tax on capital gains can be deferred if a company reinvests an amount equal to the capital gain and the sale price of the transferred asset back into its fixed assets within three years.
Capital gains realised on the transfer of legal rights of persons or entities, whose asset is, in its majority, constituted of such rights or rights directly or indirectly owned in a company located in Gabon, are subject to CIT in Gabon. In this context, the Gabonese company must collect and remit to the tax administration a discharge levy of 20% made on the capital gains of the transfer of legal right within one month from the date of transfer.
## Dividend income
The rate of transferable securities income tax (_Impôt sur le Revenu des Capitaux Mobiliers_ or IRCM) is 20% on distributed dividends.
IRCM charged on the beneficiaries of the earnings is withheld at source by the distributing company. It is paid over to the Registration Officer within 30 days from the payment of the dividends.
### Inter-company dividends
Inter-company dividends are taxed at a reduced rate in full discharge of the 20% WHT if paid and received by or from companies with their registered office in a CEMAC country, shares were allotted at the time of issue or kept for two years, and the Gabonese company owns more than 25% of the share capital of the subsidiary.
## Interest income
Interest income paid to companies is subject to a 20% WHT in Gabon. When paid in respect of bonds of five years or more, it is subject to a 10% WHT.
## Royalty income
Royalty income is subject to CIT at a rate of 30% (35% for companies operating in the oil and mining sectors).
## Foreign income
Foreign interest, royalties, and dividends are included in taxable income, subject to international tax treaties. Note that tax treaties provide that certain/all types of income are not includable in Gabon taxable income. Gabon has tax treaties with Belgium, France, the other countries of CEMAC, and some countries that continue to apply the provisions of the African and Malagasy Common Organisation (OCAM) tax treaty.
The concept of deferred tax is not applicable in Gabon.


# Gabon
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 04 March 2024
Subject to the provisions of double tax treaties (DTTs), profits subject to corporate income tax (CIT) in Gabon are those obtained by companies exploited in Gabon or those relating to operations carried out in this country.
As the Uniform Act of the Organisation for the Harmonisation of Business Law in Africa (OHADA) relating to the law of companies and economic interest groups has introduced the simplified stock company (SAS) in the OHADA area, the General Tax Code has enlarged the application of the CIT to include the SAS. The application of the CIT has been extended, on an optional manner, to companies of owners of ships or built and unbuilt properties, for the part of the shareholders indefinitely liable and whose identity is known by the administration.
The CIT rate is fixed at 30%.
The CIT rate is 35% for companies operating in the oil and mining sectors.
CIT is assessed on profits minus deductible expenses and charges. Profits are composed of all operations carried out in Gabon by companies during the period of taxation, including, notably, capital gains on fixed assets.
In the absence of any supporting document to determine the result taxable to CIT, the said taxable result will be determined after deducting from the turnover out of taxes automatically reconstituted a lump-sum discount equal to:
  * 70% for the companies which activities relate to purchase, resale, or production of goods destined to resale.
  * 50% for the companies providing services.
  * 40% for liberal professions and assimilated.


Capital gain realised in the scope of the transfer of social rights of persons whose assets are mainly constituted of such rights or rights held directly or indirectly in a company located in Gabon is subject to CIT in Gabon. The company located in Gabon whose rights are transferred must collect and remit to the tax administration, within one month from the realisation of the transfer, the amount corresponding to a discharge levy of 20% carried out on the capital gains resulting from the transfer of social rights.
Non-resident companies shall be taxed via withholding tax (WHT) at the rate of 20% for income raised in Gabon if they have no permanent establishment (PE) in Gabon.
In cases where non-resident companies have PE in Gabon, they shall be subject to CIT on the income raised in Gabon via the Gabonese PE.
## _Impôt Minimum Forfaitaire_ (IMF)
The IMF is a lower limit to the CIT and is calculated as 1% of the global turnover carried out during the fiscal year of taxation.
The turnover on which the IMF is calculated corresponds to all the revenues resulting from the operations carried out during the fiscal year, including the financial and exceptional profits.
## _Minimum de Perception_ (Minimum of Perception)
The Minimum of Perception is the ultimate lower limit to the CIT, as the amount of CIT paid by a taxpayer cannot be less than XAF 1 million, even in the absence of profit.
Companies exempted from CIT, as well as new companies, are exempted from the IMF and the Minimum of Perception.
The duration of exemption is three years for small and medium enterprises.
## Local income taxes
There are no local government taxes on income in Gabon.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is a cumulative tax levied on the sale of goods and the provision of services rendered or used in Gabon.
There are four VAT rates:

    * 5%, which applies to the production and the sale of specific products listed.
  * Zero-rate: 0%, which applies to exports, international carriage, refuelling, operations, maintenance and repair operations carried out on aircraft and ships that are assigned to international traffic.


Taxable persons are individuals or legal entities carrying out, usually or occasionally, in an independent manner, taxable operations in the scope of an economic activity and for an onerous consideration.
The aforesaid persons, subject to CIT or personal income tax (PIT), being registered or not, are liable to VAT should their turnover out of taxes reach XAF 60 million.
### VAT on real estate
Operations in relation to the construction or sale of real estate, such as sales of lands to build on, delivery of new buildings, or self-delivery of some buildings, carried out by persons subject to VAT in the scope of their economic activities are subject to VAT on real estate.
The taxpayer of the VAT on real estate is the builder of the building.
The VAT is payable on the delivery date.
The deeds relating to the transfer of buildings subject to VAT on real estate are subject to registration formalities.
The VAT on real estate is calculated based on the sale price as determined by the parties or on the real value of the real estate in case it is superior.
The applicable rate is 18%.
### Deferred payment of VAT on importations
Industrial and exporter companies are allowed to proceed to a deferred payment of VAT due on importations of goods, notably materials, equipment, industrial machinery, and spare parts where the total value exceeds XAF 100 million, subject to the fulfilment of the following required and cumulative conditions:
  * Being compliant with their obligations with regard to declaration and payment of taxes.
  * Being compliant with their customs obligations.
  * Benefiting from a credit removal in relation to a commission agent authorised by the customs services.


Operations that do not give rise to VAT deduction are excluded from the benefit of the deferred VAT payment mechanism.

## Special Solidarity Contribution (SSC)
SSC is a tax levied on the sale of goods and the provision of services rendered or used in Gabon based on similar principles as VAT.
The SSC must be invoiced by the taxpayers (natural and legal persons) carrying out, on as usual or occasional basis, taxable transactions whose annual turnover, excluding taxes, is at least XAF 30 million.
The arrangements for the taxation of the said contribution are similar to those applicable to VAT.
This contribution aims to replace the contribution to Health Insurance (ROAM) that was formerly due by operators of the mobile telecommunication sector.
The SSC is calculated based on the amount invoiced, out of taxes.
The applicable rate is 1%.
## Customs duties
Gabon is member of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC), a customs union that comprises countries from Central Africa.
Merchandise entering into the CEMAC customs territory is subject to importation duties registered into the Customs Tariff.
Four customs regimes are available in Gabon, notably one standard regime and three specific regimes (an exemption regime, a temporary admission regime, and a reduced tax regime).
Apart from customs duties, the importation of merchandise in Gabon is subject to the community tax of integration (CCI) at a rate of 0.4% and to the OHADA withholding (duty) at a rate of 0.05% of the customs value of the imported merchandise.
A contribution to the African Union (CAF) is due on the importation within the custom territory of products originating from states that are not members of the African Union.
The CAF is paid at a single rate of 0.2% of the customs value of the products originating from states that are not members of the African Union.
The Amended Financial Act 2020 has provided a six-months period of exemption of customs duties and taxes due in the scope of the importation of some goods related to the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The list of the goods shall be published in a Decree.
