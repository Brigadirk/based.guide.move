# Gabon
## Overview
Last reviewed - 04 March 2024
Gabon, located on the Atlantic coast of Central Africa, is bordered by Equatorial Guinea to the northwest, Cameroon to the north, and the Republic of the Congo to the east and south. Gabon gained its independence from France in 1960 and is a republic with a presidential form of government. It is divided into nine provinces, with Libreville as the capital. The official language of Gabon is French, while 32% of the people speak the Fang language. Gabon’s currency is the _Coopération financière en Afrique Centrale_ (Central African CFA) franc (XAF).
A small population, abundant natural resources, and considerable foreign support have helped Gabon become one of the more prosperous and stable African countries. The Gabonese economy depended on timber and manganese until oil was discovered offshore in the early 1970s. The oil sector now accounts for more than 50% of gross domestic product (GDP). Gabon continues to face fluctuating prices for its oil, timber, and manganese exports.
