## Amendments to the tax laws from 2025
The following amendment to the Law on Corporate income tax (CIT) will enter into force as of 2025.
### Car purchase and rental costs
From 1 January 2025, the part of the purchase price of a passenger car that is considered as an asset of a unit can be deducted from income, not exceeding: 
  * 75,000 euros (EUR) when purchasing a passenger car with carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions equal to 0 g/km.
  * EUR 50,000 when purchasing a passenger car with CO2 emissions not exceeding 130 g/km. 
  * EUR 25,000 when purchasing a passenger car with CO2 emissions exceeding 130 g/km but not exceeding 200 g/km.
  * EUR 10,000 when purchasing a passenger car with CO2 emissions exceeding 200 g/km. 


The part of the purchase price of a passenger car that exceeds the established limitations will have to be attributed to non-deductible expenses during the period that the passenger car will be depreciated.
There are no restrictions on the cost of the purchase of passenger cars, if these cars are used only for rental activities, for the provision of driving training services or for the provision of transport services.
The monthly rental costs of a passenger car that is not considered as an asset of a unit are deducted from income within (i) the limit set above and (ii) the applicable depreciation normative ratio (in years) divided by 12 of the fixed asset group to which the leased passenger car should be assigned if it were considered as an asset of a unit. This shall not apply to leases with a total period of no longer than 30 days during the tax period.
## Amendments to the tax laws from 2023/24
The following amendments to the laws on CIT, personal income tax (PIT), and social security contributions (SSC) entered into force as of 2023/24.
### Corporate income tax (CIT)
From 1 January 2023, the new amendments to the Law on CIT relating to anti-hybrid rules have come into force.
With the new amendments, it is aimed to prevent non-taxation of income achieved by the foreign shareholders of Lithuanian hybrid entities, i.e. to prevent situations when the income is neither taxed as being that of a Lithuanian hybrid entity nor as being that of foreign shareholders.
The tax base of a Lithuanian hybrid entity shall include the part of income (attributable to the foreign shareholder[s] of the Lithuanian hybrid entity) that is not otherwise subject to CIT or an equivalent tax in accordance with the legislation of the Lithuanian Law on CIT or any other country whose resident is a participant of the Lithuanian hybrid entity for tax purposes.
More detailed information explaining the application of this rule is currently not available (should be provided by the tax authorities later). However, the provision does not apply to collective investment vehicles meeting certain criteria.
### Payroll taxes
Starting from 1 January 2024, the threshold when the higher PIT rate is applicable increased for employment related income from EUR 101,094 per calendar year to EUR 114,162. A 32% PIT rate for the income exceeding this threshold is applied.
### Social security contributions (SSC)
Starting from 1 January 2024, the ceiling for SSC withholding increased from EUR 101,094 to EUR 114,162 per calendar year. The ceilings are not applicable to the health insurance contributions and employer's contributions.
## Other significant amendments
### Implementation of Pillar I and Pillar II
From 1 July 2024, the Lithuanian Law of ensuring the minimum level of taxation of groups of entities entered into force, which partially transfers and implements the 14 December 2022 Provisions of the Council Directive EU 2022/2523 on ensuring the universal minimum level of taxation of international corporate groups and large groups of local entities in the Union (hereinafter referred to as the Directive). 
The changes are related to the comprehensive international tax reform plan and its implementation, based on two pillars:
  * **Pillar I** gives the right to tax the profits of large international corporate groups not only to the country where the units and permanent establishments (PEs) of such corporate groups are located but also to the countries where consumers are located.
  * **Pillar II** includes agreements on the minimum level of taxation worldwide, thus ensuring that the profits of large multinational corporate groups are taxed at an effective tax rate of at least 15% (minimum level of taxation). 


The law applies to international groups of entities and groups of Lithuanian entities, whose location is in Lithuania, and whose annual consolidated income is at EUR 750 million or higher for least two out of four financial years, if the minimum effective rate for such groups of entities in any jurisdiction is less than 15% (minimum level of taxation). According to the general rule, the effective tax rate is calculated at the level of the jurisdictional territory, i.e. by summing up the profit earned (loss incurred) by the taxable entities located in that jurisdiction and the profit tax paid or payable from it. The special cases of calculation of the income limit of EUR 750 million when groups of entities are merged or divided are also included in the law. 
With the exception of the initial stage of activity, the additional tax that should be calculated and paid by the main parent entity of an international group of entities located in Lithuania on the profits earned by such group in Lithuania, as well as the additional tax that would be assigned to international entities located in the territories of third countries for taxable entities of the group, whose location is in Lithuania, is reduced to zero in each financial year in which such group implements the initial stage of activity, but not longer than five financial years. The additional tax, which would be calculated for the group of Lithuanian entities, is reduced to zero for the entire transition period, i.e. also for five financial years. 
The law does not apply to entities deemed to be exempt entities, i.e. public interest entities (e.g. government entities, international organisations, non-profit organisations), tax-neutral investment entities (e.g. mutual funds and real estate investment entities when they are part of a chain of ownership of a group of entities above, as well as pension funds), and certain entities controlled by excluded entities that substantially complement the activities of those excluded entities or are established for the purpose of managing their assets. 
The law, however, transposes the Directive only partially, taking into account the fact that Lithuania has chosen to apply the exception set out in Article 50 of the Directive (postponing mandatory taxation rules for no more than six years), the application of the income inclusion rule, and the rule of undertaxed profit. This means that the law transposes and implements the provisions of the Directive governing its scope, the procedure for determining the location of a unit, and the procedure for providing the information necessary to ensure the minimum level of taxation of profits earned by large groups of units in each jurisdiction.
However, at this moment the Lithuanian parliament () is considering a draft law to fully transfer and implement the Directive. As drafted, the law for the full implementation is to enter into force on 1 January 2025.
### Temporary solidarity contribution
From 16 May 2023, the Law on Temporary Solidarity Contribution came into force. 
According to the provisions of the Law on Temporary Solidarity Contribution, this contribution is paid by banks established in the Republic of Lithuania in accordance with the Law on Banks, branches of banks licensed in the member states of the European Union (EU) and member states of the European Economic Area (EEA) and foreign banks, and financial groups of central credit unions operating in accordance with the Law on Central Credit Unions. 
The base of this contribution consists of net interest income, calculated by applying the principles established by the Law on Temporary Solidarity Contribution. The contribution payment period used for calculating the contribution for the year 2023 is the period from 16 May 2023 (Enforcement of the Law on Temporary Solidarity Contribution) until 31 December 2023, and the payment period used to calculate the contribution for the year 2024 is the calendar year ending on 31 December 2024 and for the year 2025 is the calendar year ending on 31 December 2025.
The contribution must be declared (using form KIT713) and paid (only the calculated difference of the amount of the contribution stated in the annual contribution return and the paid amount of advance contributions for that payment period, if any) after the end of the payment period until 15 June of the following year.
The Law on Temporary Solidarity Contribution also stipulates an advance contribution. The advance contribution return must be submitted and the advance contribution is paid after the end of the quarter of the payment period, until the last day of the second month of the next quarter.
The Law on Temporary Solidarity Contribution is valid until 16 June 2026.
### The Law on Implementation of Regulation 2022/1854
From 1 January 2023, the Law of the Republic of Lithuania on the Implementation of Regulation 2022/1854 No. XIV-1680 came into force as a limited measure to mitigate the effects of high energy prices.
The obligation to pay solidarity contribution is established for entities and PEs of the European Union defined in point 17 of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2022/1854 performing activities in the crude oil, natural gas, coal, and oil refinery sectors. 
The base for calculating the solidarity contribution and the solidarity contribution are calculated for the tax year starting in 2023. The calculation of the excess profit of the entities subject to solidarity contribution and/or the amount of their solidarity contribution to be paid is guided by the provisions of the Law on CIT. 
The application of Article 6(1) of Regulation (EU) 2022/1854 shall be ensured by collecting excess revenue from the market revenues of electricity generators producing electricity from resources referred to in Article 7(1) of Regulation (EU) 2022/1854. The excess revenue is collected from the market revenues received in relation to the electricity produced and actually delivered during the period referred to in Article 22(2)(c) of Regulation (EU) 2022/1854 (i.e. 1 December 2022 - 30 June 2023), exclusive of those referred to in paragraph 6 of this Article.
### Provision of information about the activities carried out on online platforms
From 1 January 2023, online platform operators are required to collect and, once a year, submit information on sellers using the platforms (name, address, current accounts, country of residence, income received, etc.) for the previous calendar year to the tax authorities (with some exceptions). The requirement applies to all operators of online platforms (including mobile apps).
Information must be provided if income is received from one of the following activities:
  * Rent of real estate.
  * Personal services.
  * Sale of goods.
  * Rent of vehicle.


For the first time, platform operators will have to submit data for the previous calendar year until 31 January 2024. Standardised information collection requirements will be applied throughout the EU internal market, and a common EU register will be created. Tax administrators of all EU member states will participate in this system and exchange information about the platforms.
If the platform operator (except for the foreign platform operator) does not fulfil the obligation to provide information, there is a possibility for the tax authorities to cancel access to the platform operator's website until the platform operator eliminates the violation. If the foreign platform operator does not fulfill the obligation to provide information, the tax authorities cancel the registration of the foreign platform.
### Provision of data on international payment transactions
From 1 January 2024, in accordance with Council Directive (EU) 2020/284, payment service providers will have to store and provide to the tax authorities data on international payments made through them every calendar quarter.
Data will have to be provided by the following payment service providers specified in the Law on Payments of the Republic of Lithuania:
  * Credit institutions.
  * Electronic money institutions.
  * Payment institutions.
  * Postal money transfer system institutions, which have the right to provide payment services in accordance with the law.


Payment service providers will have to provide information only on international payments when:
  * The payment service provider performs more than 25 international payment transactions for the same recipient during a calendar quarter.
  * The payment is received from another member state of the European Union or the payment is made to a third territory or a third country.


Payment service providers must submit the collected information for the calendar quarter no later than the end of the month following the end of the calendar quarter. When the tax authorities receive information from payment service providers, it will submit this data to the Central Electronic System of Payment information (CESOP). Payment service providers will be required to store data for at least three calendar years from the end of the calendar year in which the payment transaction was completed, and the data will be able to be revised/adjusted for the same period (three calendar years).
### CIT information report
From 22 June 2023, the requirement for companies to prepare the CIT information report, to submit it to the manager of the Register of Legal Entities, and to publish it on the company's website entered into force.
The CIT information report contains all the information related to the company's activities (company name, list of corporate groups, number of employees, brief information on activities, income, profit, etc.). These reports would be prepared for reporting periods starting on 22 June 2024 and later (the template of this report is set by the European Commission).
The requirements will apply to:
  * Groups of companies (including when the parent company is established outside the European Union), their companies or individual companies, whose annual consolidated or annual revenue in each of the last two consecutive financial years has exceeded EUR 750 million, and which are established or have a permanent place of business in more than one tax jurisdiction.
  * Branches (opened in Lithuania by legal entities established outside the European Union) whose net sales revenue in each of the last two consecutive financial years exceeds EUR 8 million.


### **Provision of taxi dispatch data**
In order to reduce the conditions for the shadow economy in the passenger transport sector by light vehicles for a fee, from 6 May 2024 the obligation for taxi dispatch centers to collect, store, and provide the data to the Tax Authority (at the frequency and in the manner specified by it) and to law enforcement and state road transport supervision institutions (on their request) came into effect.

The mentioned data must be submitted no later than 15 February for the previous reporting period (the data for the period from 6 May 2024 to 31 December 2024 must be submitted by 15 February 2025).
### Fines and penalties
From 1 May 2023, if the tax administrator determines during the tax inspection that the taxpayer did not calculate the undeclared tax (including the tax calculated in the customs declarations) or did not declare the declared tax or illegally applied a lower tax rate and for these reasons illegally reduced the tax payable, in addition to the amount of tax payable, a fine from 20% to 100% (up till then, 10% to 50%) of the unpaid taxes may be imposed, unless the relevant tax law provides otherwise.
Late payment interest applied from 1 May 2023 to 31 October 2023 is 0.029%, from 1 November 2023 to 30 April 2024 is 0.03%, from 1 May 2024 to 31 October 2024 is 0.029% and from 1 November 2024 is 0.027% per day.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
## Taxable period
The Lithuanian tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December. However, a corporation may apply to adopt a substitute year of reporting (e.g. 1 July to 30 June).
## Tax returns
According to Lithuanian legislation, all the tax returns (except annual PIT returns for a Lithuanian resident) are submitted electronically, excluding cases when it is not possible to submit tax returns by electronic means due to objective reasons or the submission of a return by electronic means would cause disproportionate administrative burden.
### CIT
CIT returns must be submitted by the 15th day of the sixth month of the following tax period (15 June for companies using the calendar year).
Advance CIT returns due based on activity results for the previous year should be calculated and declared as follows:
  * The advance CIT due for the first six months of the tax period should be calculated based on results of the tax period before the last tax period (e.g. the advance CIT for the first six months of 2024 would be calculated based on the appropriate portion of the actual amount of CIT for 2022).
  * The advance CIT return for the first six months of the tax period should be submitted by the 15th day of the third month of the tax period (usually 15 March).
  * The advance CIT due for the remaining six months of the tax period should be calculated based on results of the last tax period (e.g. the advance CIT for the last six months of 2024 would be based on the appropriate portion of the actual amount of CIT for 2023).
  * The advance CIT return for the remaining six months should be submitted by the 15th day of the ninth month (usually 15 September) of the tax period.


The taxpayer may choose to pay the advance amount based on the projected amount of CIT calculated for the current year. The advance amount of CIT calculated on the basis of the projected amount of CIT for the tax period shall account for not less than 80% of the actual amount of the annual CIT; otherwise, late payment interest shall be calculated in respect of each amount of advance CIT that was not paid for the quarter.
If the taxpayer had chosen to pay the advance amount based on the projected amount of CIT for the current year, the return must have been submitted by the 15th day of the third month of the tax period (15 March for companies using the calendar year).
### WHT 
A tax-withholding entity must submit to the tax authorities a special form of a return reporting the amounts of payments paid and taxes withheld during the calendar month no later than 15 days after the end of the month in which the amounts were paid. When a Lithuanian entity pays dividends to the foreign entity and these dividends are not taxed, these paid amounts are declared in the annual CIT return.
## Payment of tax
### CIT
The final payment deadline for CIT is aligned with the annual CIT return submission deadline, i.e. the 15th day of the sixth month of the following tax period.
The advance CIT must be paid no later than the 15th day of the last month of the respective quarter.
If the amount of tax indicated in the annual CIT return exceeds the amount actually paid during the tax period (i.e. the advance CIT), the taxpayer is obligated to transfer the additional amount no later than the annual CIT return submission deadline (i.e. by the 15th day of the sixth month of the following tax period). Overpaid tax can be offset with other tax dues or refunded in accordance with the law on tax administration.
### WHT
WHT on payments to foreign companies is to be calculated, withheld, and remitted by a Lithuanian company or a PE of a foreign company in Lithuania within 15 calendar days after the end of the month when the payment was made (i.e. no later than the return submission deadline).
## Tax audit process
The Lithuanian tax system for companies is based on self-assessment; however, the tax authorities undertake ongoing compliance activity to ensure corporations are meeting their tax obligations. The tax authorities take a risk-based and materiality approach to compliance and audit activities, with efforts generally focused on taxpayers with a higher likelihood of non-compliance and/or material consequences of non-compliance. Compliance activities take various forms, including general risk reviews, questionnaires, reviews of specific issues, and tax audits.
## Files and data reported to the tax authorities
### Accounting data reporting: Standard Audit File for Taxes (SAF-T)
Full accounting data reporting in xml format (SAF-T) was implemented in Lithuania as of 1 January 2017.
Entities are obligated to be ready to submit accounting data upon request of the tax authorities as follows:
  * If net sales revenue for the 2015 financial year exceeded EUR 8 million, then an entity has to be ready to submit the file for periods starting from 1 January 2017.
  * If net sales revenue for the 2016 financial year exceeded EUR 700,000, then an entity has to be ready to submit the file for periods starting from 1 January 2018.
  * If net sales revenue for the 2017 financial year exceeded EUR 300,000, then an entity has to be ready to submit the file for periods starting from 1 January 2019.


An entity has to be ready to submit the file for periods starting from 1 January 2020 (and subsequent periods) when its net sales revenue for the financial year preceding the previous year exceeds EUR 300,000.
After the obligation to submit the file has arisen (according to the criteria described above), the obligation remains if the net sales revenue of the entity for the financial year for which the file is required exceeds EUR 300,000.
The requirement to be ready to submit the file does not apply to certain entities (e.g. foreign entities registered for VAT purposes in Lithuania, branches, representative offices, PEs).
### Invoice data reporting (i.SAF)
All VAT-registered taxable persons are required to report monthly data on invoices issued and received to the tax authorities' i.SAF subsystem.
### Transport data reporting (i.VAZ)
The transport document data for the dispatch of goods to other entities within the territory of Lithuania (local dispatches) has to be reported to the tax authorities' i.VAZ subsystem (certain exceptions apply) before the dispatch occurs.
### DAC6 implementation
The EU Directive on the mandatory disclosure and exchange of reportable cross-border tax arrangements (referred to as DAC6 or the Directive) has been introduced into Lithuanian law. Under DAC6, taxpayers and intermediaries are required to report cross-border reportable arrangements from 1 January 2021. 
Cross-border reportable arrangement is an arrangement that meets at least one or more hallmarks, the presence of which indicates a potential risk of tax evasion. It includes all taxes, except VAT, customs duty, excise duty and mandatory social security contributions. 
Interested taxpayers must provide information on the reportable cross-border agreement for each year, when they use or have used it, after the end of the calendar year, until June 15 of the following calendar year, by filling out the special form (PRC914).
## Statute of limitations
As of 1 January 2020, the tax authorities may investigate the current and three previous tax periods. However, in some cases, a longer period may be applied.
The statute of limitations of the current tax period and five previous tax periods will be applied:
  * when (re)calculating PIT (with the exception of PIT paid by an individual on income from an individual activity)
  * when the tax administrator is (re)calculating taxes of a taxpayer who does not meet the minimum criteria for reliable taxpayer
  * when the tax administrator is (re)calculating taxes on the basis of information received from the automatic exchange of information
  * when the tax administrator is (re)calculating taxes in accordance with transfer pricing regulations as well as when (re)calculation is related to patent box relief and investment project relief application
  * when proving bad debts and efforts to recover these bad debts
  * when (re)calculating taxes of the taxpayer who has been announced bankrupt and bankruptcy fraud was recognised by the court, and
  * when an entity applies VAT deduction on fixed assets, other than immovable property.


The limit of ten previous tax periods will be applied when an entity applies VAT deduction on immovable property, when the mutual agreement procedure (MAP) is being carried out, or when damage to the state in a penal case has to be calculated. 
## Minimum criteria for reliable taxpayers
As of 1 January 2019, new minimum criteria for reliable taxpayers have been introduced. A taxpayer meets minimum criteria for reliable taxpayers if:
  * within three years, it has not received any fines or penalties for tax-related violations resulting in unreported taxes exceeding EUR 15,000
  * within three years, it (or other responsible person) was not convicted for illegal work
  * within three years, it (or/and its director) was not convicted of fraud, unjust enrichment, criminal economic or business activities, or a criminal activity in the financial system, and
  * within one year, its director or other responsible person was not subject to administrative liability for particular offences leading to a penalty of not less than EUR 1,500 or for repeated particular administrative offences. 


The list of taxpayers that do not meet the minimum reliability criteria for taxpayers is announced publicly on the website of the Lithuanian tax authorities. Additionally, such taxpayers are not allowed to participate in public procurements or receive support and will also be subject to extended statute of limitations.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The Lithuanian tax authorities are focusing on the following areas of corporate taxpayers’ compliance:
  * Topics driven by OECD movement on BEPS (e.g. economic substance of companies, business reasons of transactions).
  * Obligation to register PE in Lithuania (investigations of foreign companies that perform activities in Lithuania without registering as local taxpayers).
  * Compliance with transfer pricing rules and thin capitalisation rules.
  * Applications of tax reliefs (e.g. investment project incentive, relief for R&D).
  * Proper recognition of costs for non-business related assets and expenses.
  * Social security contributions' optimisation schemes.




# Lithuania
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
A company is a tax resident in Lithuania if it is incorporated there. It may also be subject to taxation if its activities create a PE for tax purposes or if it in Lithuania earns income subject to WHT in Lithuania. 
## Permanent establishment (PE)
According to local legislation, a foreign company is deemed to have a PE in Lithuania when:
  * it permanently carries out commercial activities in Lithuania in whole or in part
  * it carries out its activities through a dependent representative (agent)
  * it uses a building site or construction, assembly, or equipment objects, or
  * it uses equipment or structures, including drilling installations and ships, for exploration or extraction of natural resources.


DTTs may establish different rules of PE recognition. According to domestic law, where there is a DTT, the provisions of the treaty take precedence.
A PE must be registered as a taxpayer with the tax authorities in the territory where its activities are carried out. Its profits are subject to CIT at the rate of 15% (16% from 1 January 2025).


# Lithuania
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
Allowable deductions include all the usual costs that an entity actually incurs for the purpose of earning income or receiving economic benefit unless the Law on CIT provides otherwise.
## Depreciation
Tangible and intangible assets may be depreciated using a directly proportional (straight-line) depreciation method, a production depreciation method, or a double-declining-balance depreciation method. Depreciation may not exceed maximum rates established by the law. For certain typical assets, depreciation rates relevant for tax purposes are shown in the chart below:
Asset | Depreciation period (years)  
---|---  
New buildings used for business activities | 8  
Residential buildings | 20  
Electrical transmission and communication equipment (excluding computer networks) | 8  
Furniture | 6  
Plant and machinery | 5  
Trucks, trailers, semi-trailers, buses (not older than 5 years) | 4  
Computer and communications equipment | 3  
Software | 3  
## Goodwill
Goodwill can be amortised for tax purposes using a straight-line method over 15 years after a merger of a purchasing company and an acquired company, provided that certain conditions are met.
## Start-up expenses
Generally, start‑up expenses are deductible for tax purposes provided that the expenses are related to the activities carried out or planned to be carried out in the future by the company incurring such expenses. However, expenses directly related to the establishment of the entity and the issuance of shares, incurred during the establishment or reorganisation of the entity, or the distribution of a new issue of shares (e.g. preparation and registration of articles of association, registration of shares, services of consultants, brokers, printing of shareholder certificates, notary, etc.) are considered as non-deductible expenses as related to the entity's shareholder(s), and not directly to the entity's activities.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are generally deductible for tax purposes. Interest expenses should be generally recognised as non-deductible for tax purposes if, after acquisition, a purchasing company and an acquired company are merged and debt used for acquisition of shares is pushed down to the acquired company (possibility to deduct interest after merger remains only if certain conditions are met, e.g. economic benefit for surviving entity from such exercise is substantiated).
Interest paid to related parties may be non-deductible for tax purposes if thin capitalisation rules are infringed, limits of the EBITDA rule are exceeded, or the interest rate on a debt from the related party does not correspond to a fair market interest rate (_see Thin capitalisation and EBITDA rules and Transfer pricing in the section_).
## Charitable contributions
Generally, double the amount of donation/sponsorship can be deducted for tax purposes (i.e. 200% deduction is available) but only if donation/sponsorship was provided to registered recipients and only up to a limit of 40% of taxable result before deduction of donation/sponsorship and utilisation of tax losses carried forward.
## Taxes
All taxes, fees, and other compulsory payments to the state budget are deductible for CIT purposes, except VAT and CIT paid to the budget. Note that VAT can be treated as deductible for CIT purposes if it is treated as fully or partly non-deductible for VAT purposes and this input/import VAT relates to deductible expenses.
## Other significant items
Limited deductible expenses also include the following:
  * Maintenance, repair, and reconstruction expenses of tangible fixed assets: If the repair or reconstruction increase the service period and improve the qualities (useful characteristics of the fixed assets), the value of repair or reconstruction shall be added to the acquisition value of the tangible fixed assets.
  * Business travel expenses: Deductible with restrictions.
  * Advertising and representation expenses: 50% of representation expenses not exceeding 2% of the company’s income for the tax period are deductible.
  * Natural losses: Deduction limited to not more than 1% (3% for fresh fruits, vegetables, and some other cases) of turnover.
  * Contributions and expenses for the benefit of employees: Deductible with restrictions.
  * Special provisions of credit institutions and insurance companies: Deductible when calculated according to the methods established by the Bank of Lithuania and the Commission of Insurance Supervision.
  * Membership fees, contributions, and premiums: Deductible with restrictions.
  * Bad debts: Deductible only if proved that they cannot be recovered and specific criteria are met (provisions are non-deductible).
  * Costs of purchasing and renting passenger cars, except in cases where these cars are used only for rental activities, driving training services, or providing transport services (from 1 January 2025).


Non-deductible expenses also include the following:
  * Default interest (forfeit), fines, and late interest paid to the state budget as well as other sanctions imposed for violations of laws and regulations of Lithuania.
  * Interest or any other indemnity paid due to non-performance of contractual obligations by related parties.
  * Amount of the limited deductible expenses in excess of the established limits.
  * Expenses attributed to allowable deductions more than 18 months past, although the payments for goods or services supplied by the entities registered or otherwise organised in blacklisted territories (_see below_) have not been made.
  * Sponsorship and gifts that do not correspond to the requirements of the Law on CIT.
  * Payments to blacklisted territories (_see below_) if they are not verified and payments are not subject to WHT.
  * Indemnification for damages inflicted by the entity.
  * Dividends or otherwise distributed profits.
  * Other expenses not related to the deriving of income and not attributed to operating activities of the entity, as well as the expenses that are not considered allowable deductions under the Law on CIT.
  * Amounts resulting from adjustments and corrections of errors of previous tax periods.
  * Expenses related to revaluation of fixed assets and securities, except for financial instruments acquired for hedging purposes.
  * Expenses incurred while earning non-taxable income.
  * Expenses related to income from certain international maritime activities if a maritime entity chose to apply a fixed CIT.
  * Expenses incurred while carrying out the activities prohibited by Criminal Code (including bribes).
  * Solidarity contribution, paid in accordance with the procedure established by the Law of the Republic of Lithuania "On the Implementation of Regulation (EU) 2022/1854".


## Net operating losses
Operating losses may be carried forward for an indefinite period, provided that certain requirements are met.
Losses incurred due to the transfer of securities and/or derivative financial instruments may be carried forward for five years (indefinitely for financial institutions) and can offset only profit from transfer of securities and/or derivative financial instruments.
Reduction of taxable profit by accumulated tax losses is limited to 70% of the taxable profit for the current year (except for entities that are subject to the reduced CIT rate of 5% (6% from 1 January 2025)). The rest of the accumulated tax losses can be carried forward for an unlimited period of time. However, such transfer shall be terminated if the entity ceases to carry on the activities that caused these losses, unless the entity ceases to carry on the activities for reasons beyond its control.
No limitation for carry forward due to the change of direct or indirect ownership of the entity arises, unless legal status of the entities is changed. 
Current year operating losses can be transferred to another legal entity of the group if certain conditions are met.
No carryback of losses is available in Lithuania.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments to foreign affiliates (e.g. interest, royalties, management fees, fees for other services) are deductible for tax purposes if the payment serves a business purpose, provides a benefit to the payer, is at arm’s length, and is substantiated by sufficient documentation. Payments to foreign affiliates may also be subject to various WHTs. Certain payments to affiliates located in tax haven (blacklisted) countries are subject to a 15% (16% from 1 January 2025) WHT rate.
## Blacklisted territories
A blacklisted territory is a foreign country or territory that is included on a list of offshore territories established by the Minister of Finance that meets at least two of the following criteria:
  * Similar tax rate in such territory is below 75% of that set in the Lithuanian Law on CIT.
  * In such territory, different rules for levying a similar tax are applied, depending on the country where the parent company (controlling entity) is registered or otherwise organised.
  * In such territory, different rules for levying a similar tax are applied, depending on the country where the business is conducted.
  * The company (the controlled taxable entity) has entered into agreement with the tax administrator of that territory with regard to the application of a tax rate or tax base.
  * There is no effective exchange of information in such territory.
  * There is no financial and administrative transparency in such territory, the tax administration rules are not quite clear, and the application thereof is not communicated to tax administrators of other countries.


A list of 49 offshore territories (including the newly listed Russian Federation since 1 December 2023) has been published. With certain exceptions specified in the law, all payments to offshore companies or their branches for any work or services, commodities, interest on funding, insurance premiums, guarantees, etc. are non-deductible for CIT purposes unless the Lithuanian entity provides evidence to the state tax authorities that:
  * the payments are related to usual activities of the paying and the receiving business entities
  * the receiving foreign business entity manages the property necessary to carry out such usual activities, and
  * there is a connection between the payment and the economically grounded business operation.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
Group taxation legislation and regimes are not available in Lithuania. Each Lithuanian entity is regarded as a separate taxpayer and may not deduct tax losses accumulated from previous tax periods at the level of any other group entity.
Transfer of current year operating tax losses incurred to an entity of the same group of companies is allowed if certain requirements are met.
## Transfer pricing
All transactions between associated parties must be performed at arm’s length. The tax authorities have a right to adjust transaction prices if they do not conform to market prices.
The Lithuanian rules refer to the Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations established by the OECD to the extent that they do not contradict with the domestic rules.
According to the Lithuanian transfer pricing regulations, companies may apply the following methods, although traditional methods should be given preference:
  * Comparable uncontrolled price method.
  * Resale price method.
  * 'Cost plus' method.
  * Profit split method.
  * Transactional net margin method.


Transfer pricing documentation consists of two files: (i) Master File, which describes inter-company transactions in the worldwide context of an entity’s group, and (ii) Local File, which includes more detailed information and analysis about the local entity's inter-company transactions.
Local File should be prepared by all Lithuanian entities and foreign entities’ PEs with annual previous period’s revenue exceeding EUR 3 million, as well as all banks, insurance companies, and credit institutions (disregarding revenue).
Master File is mandatory if an entity belongs to the international group of companies and its previous period’s revenue in Lithuania exceeds EUR 15 million.
Intra-group transactions that exceed a threshold of EUR 90,000 per year must be documented in the Local File. If an entity enters into multiple similar transactions with one associated party, the threshold is applicable for the total amount of all transactions with that party. If the transaction is inextricably linked to another transaction, the same threshold of EUR 90,000 for the two transactions is applied jointly. No threshold is applied on transactions with associated parties that are registered or otherwise organised in blacklisted territories.
Starting from 1 January 2020, transfer pricing documentation requirements are not applicable to controlled transactions of a Lithuanian entity or a foreign entity operating through a PE in the Republic of Lithuania that are concluded with another Lithuanian entity or a foreign entity operating through a PE in the Republic of Lithuania, a permanent resident of Lithuania, and/or a non-permanent resident of Lithuania carrying out individual activities under a business certificate on a permanent basis if such transactions are related to their activities in Lithuania.
Starting from 1 January 2021, the possibility of applying a simplified transfer pricing approach for low value-adding intra-group services transactions was enacted. Under this simplified approach, a 5% mark-up on costs related to the provision of services that can be defined as low value-adding could be applied without requiring a formal benchmarking study. Domestic legislation regarding low value-adding intra-group services is in line with the Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations established by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
Transfer pricing documentation can be prepared in any language; however, tax authorities may request to provide translations to Lithuanian.
Transfer pricing documentation should be prepared by the 15th day of the sixth month after the end of the tax period when such transaction between associated parties took place. At the request of the tax administrator, documentation must be submitted within 30 days.
Information about the transactions provided in the documentation should be updated annually. If the economic circumstances of the controlled transactions remain the same and the relevant market situation does not change significantly, the benchmarking studies/comparative transaction data may be updated every three years; however, information on the controlled intra-group transactions still must be documented annually.
Penalties, amounting from EUR 1,820 to EUR 6,000, for non-compliance with the transfer pricing documentation requirements for transactions between associated persons could be imposed. Penalties are imposed on the head of the company or an authorised person.
Advance pricing agreements (APAs) and binding rulings are available in Lithuania. Taxpayers can apply for an APA or a binding ruling from the Lithuanian tax authority in respect of future transactions for the current and next five financial periods. 
Decisions in the form of a binding ruling or APA will be issued by the Lithuanian tax authority regarding the application of tax legislation provisions and pricing principles. The above-mentioned decisions will be particularly relevant to companies planning to undertake new transactions where the taxation principles of such transactions are not clearly defined in the tax legislation and to international companies planning to perform significant transactions with associated parties.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
The CbC reporting obligation applies for multinational groups of companies with consolidated revenue of not less than EUR 750 million. According to the approved rules, the CbC report must be submitted electronically within 12 months after the last day of the taxpayer’s financial year.
The CbC report can be submitted in parts and it will be considered to be submitted when the last part of the CbC report is submitted.
Effective November 20, 2024, the Head of the State Tax Inspectorate under the Ministry of Finance has implemented new guidelines for the preparation and submission of CbC notification. These guidelines stipulate that all notifications must be prepared, submitted, and revised electronically through the Mano VMI system. It is mandatory for each company within a multinational enterprise (MNE) group to file a notification for every financial year by the end of that fiscal period.
## Thin capitalisation and EBITDA rules
The Lithuanian thin capitalisation rules apply in respect to borrowings from related parties as well as borrowings from third parties guaranteed by related parties. The controlled debt-to-fixed-equity ratio is 4:1. Interest expenses calculated on the exceeding part of the controlled debt are non-deductible unless a Lithuanian company (borrower) can prove that the same loan under the same conditions would have been granted by a non-related entity. The rule does not apply to financial institutions providing financial rental (leasing) services.
Additionally, as of 1 January 2019, a new interest limitation rule has been introduced. An entity is given the right to deduct interest costs exceeding interest revenue up to 30% of taxable EBITDA or up to EUR 3 million. If an entity belongs to the group of entities, the above criteria shall be applied jointly for all Lithuanian entities and PEs of foreign entities in Lithuania that belong to the same group. Restrictions do not apply if an entity's financial results are included in the consolidated financial results of a group, and the equity-to-asset ratio of that entity is not more than 2 percentage points lower than the equivalent ratio of the group. Interest costs exceeding interest revenue could be carried forward without time limitation. The mentioned rules do not apply to financial institutions and insurance companies.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Positive income of a CFC, i.e. income not derived from operating activity (including interest, royalties, leasing, dividend income, etc.), shall be included in the taxable income of a controlling Lithuanian company if:
  * a CFC is established or organised in a country that is a blacklisted territory (_see Blacklisted territories in the section_), or
  * the passive income of a CFC exceeds 1/3 of the total taxable income, and
  * the effective CIT of a CFC in its country of residence is less than 50% of the actual CIT that would be calculated on the income of that CFC based on the provisions of the Lithuanian Law on CIT.


An entity is treated as a CFC if more than 50% of its voting rights or shares are owned, directly or indirectly, by the Lithuanian entity.
A Lithuanian company may reduce tax payable in Lithuania by the tax paid in a foreign country on the positive income of CFC included in the tax base of that Lithuanian company.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
A branch of a foreign company is defined as a structural subunit of a foreign company that has an establishment in Lithuania and is entitled to engage in commercial activities in Lithuania as well as conclude contracts and undertake obligations according to the power of attorney issued to the branch by its founder. A branch does not have the status of a legal person. It is taxed in the same manner as a PE (_see the section_).


# Lithuania
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
## Foreign tax credit
A company may reduce tax payable on certain foreign-sourced income in Lithuania by taxes paid on that income in a foreign country if that Lithuanian company has received appropriate notice from that foreign country. The tax credit may not exceed the CIT rate payable in Lithuania.
## Investment project incentive
Entities involved in an investment project can reduce their taxable profits by up to 100% of the actually incurred acquisition costs of long-term assets meeting certain requirements. Please note that depreciation (amortisation) expenses of such assets shall be deducted in a common manner.
Taxable profits can be reduced by such costs incurred from 2009 to 2028.
This relief is applied to the following categories of fixed assets:
  * Machinery and equipment.
  * Installations (structures, wells, etc.).
  * Computer and communication equipment.
  * Software and acquired intellectual property (IP) rights.
  * Lorries, trailers, and semi-trailers (relief for these investments is capped at EUR 300,000 per year).


The assets must be not used and produced not earlier than two years ago (as calculated from the date when such fixed assets were put into use).
The costs exceeding the above-mentioned 100% limit can be carried forward for four years.
There are certain criteria defining what could be considered an investment project. The project should be precisely described to meet the criteria allowing a company to use the tax relief.
## Tax relief for research and development (R&D)
Expenses, except for fixed assets’ depreciation (amortisation) expenses, incurred for R&D purposes can be deducted three times in the tax period when they are incurred, provided that R&D works performed are related to ordinary business activities. The entity also may apply accelerated depreciation rates to fixed assets used in R&D activities.
A company applying tax relief for R&D has to prepare R&D documentation. This documentation has to cover the performed project, substantiate conformity with certain tax requirements, and specify the amount of expenses for R&D activities.
As of 1 January 2018, a new tax incentive for companies investing into R&D was introduced. Such companies have the possibility to not only deduct the expenses incurred for R&D works from the taxable income three times, but they are also entitled to apply the reduced 5% (6% from 1 January 2025) CIT rate on the profit deriving from the commercial exploitation of patented inventions (it is similar to 'patent box' regimes available in other countries).
A company can apply the reduced CIT rate of 5% (6% from 1 January 2025) if:
  * the income from the use of the property, sale of it, or other transfer of ownership is obtained only by the Lithuanian unit or PE that created the property and only they incur all expenses due to the income generation, and
  * the property is a copyright-protected computer programme or an invention complying with the criteria of patentability (new, complies to the level of invention, and is industrially applicable) that is protected by patents or supplementary certificates of protection issued by the European Patent Office or in the member state of the EEA or in a country with which a DTT has been concluded.


## Funds granted for producing a film or a part of a film
Funds granted for producing a film or a part of a film can be deducted from taxable income and from CIT payable due during the period from 2019 to 2028 if the following conditions are met:
  * The film meets the criteria of cultural substance and evaluation of the production.
  * Not less than 80% of the film production expenses are incurred in Lithuania, and the amount exceeds EUR 43,000.
  * Total amount of funds granted by all companies may not exceed 30% of total expenses of the film production.


Not more than 75% of funds granted free of charge for production of film or of a part thereof in Lithuania can be deducted from taxable income.
Certain restrictions for reduction of taxable income and tax due apply.
## Large project relief
Starting from 1 January 2021, revenue an entity earned in the course of carrying out a large investment project may be exempt from CIT for a period of 20 years (or until the maximum state aid is reached). The relief applies only if at least 75% of the entity’s revenue for the relevant tax period consists of revenue from (i) manufacturing, (ii) data processing, or (iii) internet server services (hosting) and related activities. The requirements for the application of the relief are one of the following:
  * The average number of employees involved in the implementation of a large project in Lithuania during the tax year should not be less than 150 (200 if business is established in Vilnius or its district), and each created workplace must be maintained for at least five years. Additionally, capital investment of the entity should be not less than EUR 20 million (EUR 30 million if business is established in Vilnius or its district; EUR 100 million after receiving the approval of the European Commission), and an auditor’s confirmation on the actual amount of capital investment is required.
  * The average number of employees involved in the implementation of a large project in Lithuania during the tax year should be from 20 to 149 (from 20 to 199 if business is established in Vilnius or its district), and each created workplace must be maintained for at least five years and the average gross salary of 20 employed persons for the relevant tax period would be at least 1.25 of the average monthly gross salary of the municipality in which the investment is made, and the persons employed in the new workplace created above this number would have the average gross salary of the relevant tax period not less than the average monthly gross salary of the municipality in which the investment is made. Additionally, capital investment of the entity should be not less than EUR 20 million (EUR 30 million if business is established in Vilnius or its district; EUR 100 million after receiving the approval of the European Commission). All the criteria specified in this point apply only to manufacturing investment projects.


An investment agreement with the government of the Republic of Lithuania for the application of large project relief is required. This agreement must be signed by 31 December 2025.
The relief starts to apply from the tax period when the above-mentioned thresholds are reached. The application of the relief is suspended for the tax periods in which the amount of capital investment and/or the average number of employees and/or amount of salaries falls below the required threshold. The exemption will be renewed for the tax period when the required thresholds are reached again. Moreover, the exemption will not be granted to companies established in and benefiting from the preferential taxation in an FEZ.
It should be mentioned that if the investment agreement is signed, there are other benefits for the investor (green corridor initiative):
  * Governmental project coordinator.
  * Rapid construction permits.
  * The migration process is easier.
  * Administrative decisions are made within three days.
  * Accelerated territorial planning.
  * Faster infrastructure development.
  * Other benefits.


## Free economic zones (FEZs)
There are seven FEZs in Lithuania: in Kaunas, Klaipėda, Akmenė, Kėdainiai, Marijampolė, Panevėžys, and Šiauliai.
As of 1 January 2018, entities operating in an FEZ and fulfilling certain requirements are entitled to FEZ relief (i.e. do not pay CIT for the first ten years and apply 50% lower CIT rate for further six years). Also, no real estate tax has to be paid in an FEZ.
FEZ relief is applicable to the entities registered and actually performing its activities in the FEZ, if all of the following requirements are met:
  * Capital investment is not less than EUR 1 million or capital investment is not less than EUR 100,000 and the average number of employees in the tax year is at least 20.
  * At least 75% of annual income is earned from activities performed in the FEZ.
  * Auditor’s written confirmation regarding capital investment is required.
  * There are specific limitations following the EU legislation governing the provision of state aid.


All aforementioned requirements shall be met each year. The exemption will not apply to the tax period in which the amount of private capital investment and/or number of employees or annual income from activities in the FEZ fall below the required thresholds. The exemption will be renewed for the tax period when the required thresholds are reached again, i.e. the calculation of ten and six years period is stopped if the capital investment and/or number of employees criterions is not met; however, calculation of ten and six years period is not stopped if 75% income from activities criterion is not met (but tax relief does not apply during the tax periods when the condition is not met).


# Lithuania
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
## Domestic legislation
Generally, income of a foreign entity in Lithuania not derived through a PE is deemed to be Lithuanian-source income and is subject to WHT at the following rates:
  * Interest on any type of debt obligations, including securities: 10%.
  * Proceeds from the sale, transfer (with title), or lease of immovable property located in Lithuania: 15% (16% from 1 January 2025).
  * Income derived from sports activities or performers’ activities: 15% (16% from 1 January 2025).
  * Income from distributed profits: 15% (16% from 1 January 2025).
  * Royalties: 10%.
  * Annual payments (_tantiems_) to the members of the board or supervisory board: 15% (16% from 1 January 2025).
  * Indemnities received for the infringement of copyrights or neighbouring rights: 10%.


0% WHT is applied on royalties paid to related parties meeting requirements of the European Commission (EC) Interest and Royalty Directive.
Lithuanian WHT on interest paid to entities established in the European Economic Area or DTT countries is 0%.
WHT is not applied on government securities issued on international financial markets, interest accumulated and paid on deposits, and interest on subordinated loans that meet the criteria established by legal acts adopted by the Bank of Lithuania.
Dividends distributed by a resident company to another resident company are subject to a 15% (16% from 1 January 2025) CIT, which is withheld by a distributing company.
The dividends distributed by a resident company (for both Lithuanian and foreign companies) are exempt from WHT if the recipient company has held not less than 10% of the voting shares in the distributing company for at least a 12-month period without interruption and the distributing entity is subject to 5% or 15% Lithuanian CIT rate. However, this relief is not applied if the foreign entity (recipient) is registered or otherwise organised in blacklisted territories (_see Blacklisted territories in the section_), as specified by the Ministry of Finance. Please note that the requirement of the 12-month holding period does not necessarily have to be fulfilled on the day of dividend distribution.
Dividends distributed by a foreign entity are generally subject to a 15% (16% from 1 January 2025) CIT if they are to be paid by the receiving Lithuanian entity.
Dividends distributed by a foreign company to a Lithuanian company are exempt from CIT if the distributing foreign entity is established in the European Economic Area and related profit is properly taxed in the domiciled country.
The dividends are also exempt from WHT if the recipient company has held not less than 10% of the voting shares in the distributing company for at least a 12-month period without interruption and the profit of a distributing entity is subject to CIT or similar tax. This participation exemption satisfies the requirements of the EC Parent-Subsidiary Directive. The exemption also applies to dividends paid by non-EU foreign companies, except those registered or organised in blacklisted territories.
Dividends paid out to foreign companies or received from foreign companies are not subject to tax exemption in cases where tax benefit is the main or one of the main objectives of a particular structure of companies. Dividends received from foreign companies are also not subject to tax exemption if they were deducted from taxable profit at the distributing company level.
According to the changed provisions of the Law on CIT, the payments received by a foreign entity for the activities of the members of the supervisory board in Lithuania are recognised as income of the foreign company in Lithuania, regardless of the frequency of such payments and whether they are paid as _tantiemes_ or as other types of payments. These payments are subject to 15% (16% from 1 January 2025) WHT, which should be withheld by the paying company in Lithuania. The tax is applicable only if the member of the supervisory board is a foreign company (not an individual).
## Tax treaties
Where a treaty for the avoidance of double taxation and prevention of fiscal infringement with the country in question contradicts the local regulations, the treaty provisions prevail. Lithuania now has 58 DTTs in force with foreign countries.
The following WHT rates apply to dividends, interest, and royalties paid to a recipient or beneficial owner resident in a tax treaty country. The lower of the domestic or the treaty rate is given.
Recipient | WHT (%)

Notes
  1. Dividends are exempt from WHT if the recipient company has held not less than 10% of the voting shares in the distributing company for at least a 12-month period without interruption. However, this relief is not applied if the foreign entity (recipient) is registered or otherwise organised in blacklisted territories (_see Blacklisted territories in the section_), as specified by the Ministry of Finance. If participation exemption criteria are not met, the standard WHT rate of 15% (16% from 1 January 2025) should be applied. However, some of the DTTs allow applying WHT at a reduced rate of 5% or 10%.
  2. Under the domestic law, the rate is nil if interest is paid to a company established in a country that has a DTT with Lithuania or is a member of a European Economic Area. In other cases, еxcept for Cyprus, Latvia, and the United Arab Emirates where 0% WHT is established in the DTT, a 10% WHT rate should be applied.
  3. Under the domestic law, 0% WHT is applied on royalties paid to related parties meeting requirements of the EC Interest and Royalty Directive.
  4. Royalties for the use of industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment: 5%; other royalties: 10%. 
  5. Based on the most-favoured nation principle established in the DTTs or their Protocols with indicated countries, and as a result of Lithuania signing the DTT with Japan, royalties paid to these countries are not subject to WHT in Lithuania (DAS-1 form should be completed by the recipient).


Reduction of, or exemption from, WHT under a DTT may be obtained if a special residence certificate (Form DAS-1) is completed and approved by the tax authorities before a taxable payment is transferred. If a payment that would have been subject to a tax treaty has already been made and WHT at the local rate was withheld, it is possible to obtain an appropriate refund (reduction) by completing a special claim for a refund of the Lithuanian tax withheld at source (Form DAS-2) and obtaining the approval of the tax authorities.
In addition, the tax authorities may require completion of a special certificate giving information about income received and taxes paid in Lithuania (Form DAS-3).

## Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) agreement with the United States (US)
Lithuania signed an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) with the United States under the framework of FATCA. Lithuania and the United States will exchange information about the accounts of foreign (US or Lithuania, respectively) residents held in local financial institutions or local branches of foreign financial institutions.
## Implementation of base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) provisions
The OECD has announced a package of BEPS recommendations aiming to increase transparency of international taxation and prevent tax evasion and aggressive tax planning. Many OECD countries, including Lithuania, have already started shifting certain provisions related to implementation of the BEPS recommendation package into their tax legislation (_see below_).
### Hybrid mismatch arrangements
Hybrid mismatch rules aim to prevent obtaining a double non-taxation benefit by exploiting differences between the tax treatment of entities and instruments across different countries. Lithuanian rules state that when the payment is deductible in two countries, or deductible in one country and non-taxable in another, tax discrepancies are neutralised by treating such payment as non-deductible expense or taxable income in Lithuania.
From 1 January 2023, the new amendments to the Law on CIT relating to anti-hybrid rules have come into force (_please see_ _Amendments to the tax laws in the section_).

The CbC reporting obligation applies for multinational groups of companies with consolidated revenue of not less than EUR 750 million. According to the approved rules, the CbC report must be submitted electronically within 12 months after the last day of the taxpayer’s financial year.
### Multilateral Instrument
Lithuania signed the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting ('Multilateral Instrument' or MLI) and deposited its instrument of ratification on 11 September 2018. The Multilateral Instrument entered into force on 1 January 2019 for Lithuania.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
## Inventory valuation
Under domestic accounting legislation, stock used in the production and included in the cost of produced goods is valued in the financial statements by the first in first out (FIFO) method. The last in first out (LIFO), weighted-average, progressive-average, actual-price, or another method that corresponds to the stocks’ movement can also be used. Usage of another method than FIFO is not required to be separately approved by the tax authorities; however, the method used must be disclosed in the notes to the annual accounts.
## Capital gains

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
The standard CIT rate is 15% (16% from 1 January 2025). However, small companies and agricultural companies can apply a reduced CIT rate of 0% or 5% (0% or 6% from 1 January 2025) if certain conditions are met.
An amendment to the Law on CIT entered into force on 1 July 2022, which ensured that an increased CIT rate of 20% (15% and additional 5%; 21% (16% and additional 5%) from 1 January 2025) is applied on taxable profits of credit institutions exceeding the threshold of EUR 2 million for an indefinite period (previously, it was applicable only for a limited time period, starting from 1 January 2020 and ending with 2022). Special rules for calculation of taxable profit apply.
Generally, CIT is applied on taxable income received by a Lithuanian tax resident from its local and worldwide activities. Taxable income is calculated by reducing general income of a certain tax period with deductible expenses and non-taxable income, also increasing it with amounts of additional taxable income, and adjusting it according to tax reliefs and other tax attributes.
The deductible expenses should include all the usual costs that an entity incurs for the purpose of earning taxable income or receiving economic benefit.​
Income of a tax resident company is not subject to taxation in Lithuania if it was received from activities through a PE in a foreign country that is in the European Economic Area or that has a double tax treaty (DTT) with Lithuania and if the income was subject to taxation there.
Furthermore, CIT may be reduced or even not applied if foreign-sourced income received not through a PE is taxed with a withholding tax (WHT) in a foreign country and this country has a DTT with Lithuania.
Non-resident companies are generally taxed on Lithuania-sourced income received through a local PE and reduced by deductible expenses or on income subject to WHT in Lithuania.
## Reduced CIT rate for small companies
Entities with fewer than ten employees and less than EUR 300,000 in gross annual revenues can benefit from a reduced CIT rate of 0% for the first year of operations and 5% (6% from 1 January 2025) for the following periods if certain conditions are met.
## CIT regime for certain maritime activities
The rate of CIT on certain maritime activities is 15% (16% from 1 January 2025), with the base set by reference to the functional capacity of the ship. This fixed CIT may be applied to maritime entities that fulfil certain conditions indicated in the law. In order to apply this regime, it is necessary to inform the local tax authority.
## Local income taxes
