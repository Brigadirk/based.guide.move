## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 18 July 2024
## Foreign tax relief
Foreign taxes paid may be deducted as an expense from taxable income.
The specific process to enforce foreign tax credits either in Mauritania or abroad (depending on the payments directions) is stipulated within the specific DTT with the relevant country. Nonetheless, as far Mauritania is concerned, the practice consisting of enforcing foreign tax credits locally is very rare.
## Tax treaties
Mauritania has entered into DTTs with France, Senegal, and states of the Arab Maghreb Union (Algeria, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia).
The treaties generally provide the following relief:
  * The treaties with France and Senegal provide that royalties and remuneration paid to a non-resident for services rendered in Mauritania are taxable in the state of residence of the beneficiary of the sums paid.
  * Profits are taxable in the treaty country where a foreign firm performs its activities through a permanent establishment (PE).
  * Interest is taxable in the state of residence of the beneficiary, but the state of source may withhold tax if provided by its domestic law.
  * Employment income is taxed in the treaty country where the activity is performed, except in the case of a short assignment.

The General Tax Code (GTC) was modified from fiscal year (FY) 2020. Under the new Code, from January 2020, individuals performing gainful activity for themselves are subject to a personal income tax (PIT), covering industrial and commercial, as well as non-commercial, incomes.
This PIT includes the following three tax regimes:
  * A normal regime for an annual turnover exceeding 5 million Mauritanian ouguiya (MRU).
  * An intermediary regime for an annual turnover between MRU 3 million and MRU 5 million.
  * A lump-sum tax regime for an annual turnover less than MRU 3 million, excluding importers.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 18 July 2024
## Employment income
Under Article 111 of the GTC, the tax is due for employees receiving income from public and private salaries, wages, and related allowances:
  * when the employee's activity is carried out in Mauritania
  * when the employee's tax residence is in Mauritania, even though the remunerated activity is carried out in Mauritania or outside Mauritania or that the employer is domiciled or established outside Mauritania, or
  * when the employee is domiciled outside Mauritania, whether or not the employer is domiciled or established in Mauritania, on condition that the paid activity is carried out in Mauritania.


Employment income is taxed at progressive rates (_see the section_). Gross salary includes public and private wages, salaries, bonuses, expatriation indemnities, benefits in kind, and supplement salaries (payments made in addition to salary, such as rental subsidies and overtime pay).
The following types of income are exempt from tax:
  * Compensation and allowances relating to governmental or local representative duties.
  * Family allowances, family assistance allowances, and all other allowances added or paid depending on the family situation.
  * A fixed amount of MRU 6,000.
  * Up to MRU 1,000 per month for all compensation and allowances except those relating to housing, transportation, liability, and office (allowances relating to liability or office are allowances paid to employees with administrative or financial responsibilities, such as those who are on call or must remain late at the office).
  * Social security and health insurance contributions.
  * Benefits in kind that don’t exceed 20% of the salary received (gross salary). Otherwise, when benefits in kind exceed 20% of gross salary, they are taxed up to 40% of their total amount.

  * The beneficiary is domiciled in Mauritania.
  * The beneficiary is domiciled outside Mauritania, and the debtor is established in Mauritania.

  * Legal payments paid to war victims as well as their successors.
  * Allowances for professional accidents (allowances for accidents caused by working tools or the handling of products in the workplace).
  * Combatant retirement benefits.


## Equity compensation
The GTC does not provide specific rules applicable to the taxation of employer-provided stock options.
## Business income
For the tax regimes based on the actual income (normal and intermediary regimes), the tax due will correspond to 30% of the tax base or to 2.5% of the taxable revenues, whichever is higher
However, the minimum tax payable will depend on the type of tax regime (MRU 125,000 for the normal tax regime and MRU 75,000 for the intermediary tax regime).
The tax base will correspond to profits less expenses.
However, taxpayers will not be allowed to do the following:
  * Deduct or take into account exchange gains and losses.
  * Deduct headquarter expenses.
  * Deduct donations and subsidies.
  * Deduct deemed deferred depreciation.
  * Use accelerated or decreasing methods of depreciation.
  * Deduct provisions.


It will be possible for the individuals subject to the intermediary tax regime to opt for the normal tax regime before 1 February of each year. The option becomes effective from 1 January of the year of the opting for the normal tax regime and should be applied for at least two fiscal years.
However, an individual subject to the normal tax regime cannot opt for the intermediary tax regime or for the lump-sum tax regime.
Taxpayers subject to the lump-sum tax regime will be liable to pay a tax of 3% of their annual turnover.
Under the lump-sum tax regime and where individuals perform simultaneous activities in the same location or several activities in different locations, each business will be considered as a different activity taxable on a separate basis, assuming that the total turnover is less than MRU 3 million.
## Dividend income
Dividends are taxed at 10%. When the company pays the dividend, it should apply the WHT. There is a complex system of quarterly instalment payments.

There are no other significant tax credits or incentives for individuals in Mauritania.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 18 July 2024
Mauritanian and foreign individuals are considered to be tax residents if they meet with the following:
  * They maintain a home in Mauritania as owner or leaseholder.
  * They have their primary residence or vital interest in Mauritania.
  * They perform a professional activity in Mauritania, excluding accessory activities (if they are not the principal income source).


The criteria above are used to define the tax domicile. Indeed, with regard to the concept of a primary, permanent home, it is considered that the residence of an individual person is located where it has possession (owner) or enjoyment of a dwelling-house, provided that the dwelling-house is permanent (i.e. the person has arranged and reserved it for his or her use in a permanent manner, as opposed to a temporary one).
It should be noted that any form of dwelling can be taken into account in the concept of a dwelling-house (house or apartment owned or rented; furnished room rented). However, the permanence of the dwelling is essential, which means that the person concerned makes the necessary arrangements to have the dwelling at one’s disposal at all times, on a continuous basis, and not occasionally for a stay that, given the reasons that motivated it, is necessarily linked to a short duration (pleasure trip, travel, business trip, study trip, internship in a school, etc.).
The centre of vital interests corresponds to the closest personal and economic ties.
This definition of tax domicile in terms of wages and salaries cannot prevail, where applicable, over a definition provided for in an applicable international convention related to a double taxation treaty (DTT).
