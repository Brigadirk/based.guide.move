# Guatemala
## Overview
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
Guatemala, a constitutional democratic republic located in Central America, is bordered by Mexico to the north, the Pacific Ocean to the west, Belize and the Caribbean Sea to the east, and Honduras and El Salvador to the south. It is divided into 22 geographic departments, with Guatemala City as the capital. The official language of Guatemala is Spanish, and its currency is the quetzal (GTQ).
Guatemala, which won its independence in 1821, is the most populous of the Central American countries. The agricultural sector accounts for nearly 15% of gross domestic product (GDP) and half of the labour force. Key agricultural exports include coffee, sugar, and bananas. The Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) that entered into force in July 2006 spurred increased investment and diversification of exports, with the largest increases in ethanol and non-traditional agricultural exports.
