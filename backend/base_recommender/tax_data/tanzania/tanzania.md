## Overview
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
Tanzania is a country in East Africa bordered by Kenya and Uganda to the north; Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west; Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique to the south; and the Indian Ocean to the east. The United Republic of Tanzania came into being in 1964 following the union of the Republic of Tanganyika (formed in 1961) and Zanzibar. Its official languages are Kiswahili and English. Dodoma is the national capital of Tanzania, and the Tanzanian shilling (TZS) is the official currency.
Tanzania's major export industries include agriculture, mining, and tourism. A significant proportion of the population are employed in agriculture. Longer term, Tanzaniaâ€™s significant gas reserves are expected to generate significant export earnings. Other significant sectors of the economy include construction, financial services, manufacturing, telecommunications, and utilities.
