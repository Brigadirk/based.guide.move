Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Finance Act 2024
Some of the significant changes brought in by the Finance Act 2024 include the following:
### Tax administration 
  * The deemed date of admission of an objection is now clarified to be the date the taxpayer has paid the tax deposit required to validate the objection.
  * Document service to the commissioner or taxpayer to include those sent via emails, fax, or any other electronic means in accordance with written laws governing electronic transactions.
  * Introduction of a new definition for the below term:
    * 'Cargo consolidator’ to mean ‘a person licensed by a competent authority to operate cargo consolidation and deconsolidation business’. The cargo consolidator is required to comply with customs and other laws and procedures governing deconsolidation of cargo to its owners at the time of importation of goods in the country. Failure to comply leads to a fine equal to 30% of the customs value of imported cargo.


  * ‘Currency point’ increased from 15,000 to 20,000 Tanzanian shillings (TZS).
  * Penalty for the failure to use an electronic fiscal device (EFD) or issue a fiscal receipt has been capped to a fine of 200 currency points (currently TZS 4 million).


  * Applications of/for (i) value-added tax (VAT) refund and (ii) remission of interest and penalties can now be done online through the Taxpayer Portal effective November 2023.


  * The due date of filing income tax return for entities audited by the Controller and Auditor General (CAG) changed to nine months from the end of year of income (previously six months from the end of year of income).


### Income tax 
  * The definition of ‘asset’ to now include ’digital asset’.
  * New definitions introduced for ’artisanal miner‘, ’digital content‘, and ’digital content creator’.
  * Deductibility of expenditure for tax purposes to be supported by fiscal receipts (exemption for goods/services provided by non-residents with no permanent establishment [PE] and those not required to issue fiscal receipts).
  * Limitation of the offset of tax losses to 60% (previously 70%) of the current year chargeable income where the entity has consecutive tax losses for previous four years.
  * Change in control provisions (section 56 ITA 2004) will not apply where the change is a result of allotment of new membership interest in a resident entity. 


  * The Finance Act 2023 had introduced a single instalment tax of 3% of the greater of the incomings or approved value of the asset (instead of 10% on the profits) to resident persons realising interest in land or building with no records of the cost. The Finance Act 2024 has restricted the applicability of this provision to resident individuals (i.e. it will not apply to resident entities).
  * The scope of charitable organisations is extended to institutions dealing with the advancement of health services and environmental protection.
  * Entities engaged in processing of tea are exempt from payment of alternative minimum tax (AMT) for a three-year period from 1 July 2024 to 30 June 2027.

### Value-added tax (VAT)
  * VAT scope expanded to cover ‘online data services’ provided by a non-resident supplier to an unregistered customer. ‘Online data services’ is defined as “any form of monetisation of user data, including the sale or licensing of, or access to, user data or information collected through user engagement with an online platform. This applies whether the data is sold or licensed directly or indirectly, aggregated or disaggregated, anonymised, or used in any other form”.
  * New definitions for the terms ’gaming supply‘ (which is an exempt supply) and ’serviced apartment‘ (which is a taxable supply).
  * Expansion of VAT deferral to capture capital goods under HS Code 8701.21.90.
  * An introduction of a requirement to notify the Commissioner General within a period of 90 days after the end of the period in which a person registered as an ‘intending trader’ is expected to start making taxable supplies lapses and has not commenced making the supplies.

# Tanzania
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Taxable period
While the year of income for tax purposes is the calendar year, an entity may apply to use its own accounting period rather than the calendar year.
## Tax returns
A statement of estimated tax payable, which contains an estimate of the chargeable income and the tax payable thereon, is due for submission within three months from the beginning of the accounting period. A final tax return must be furnished within six months from the end of the accounting period or within nine months from the end of the accounting period for public sector entities.
WHT returns must be submitted every month. The due date for filing the WHT return is the seventh day of the month following the month to which the tax relates. 
## Payment of tax
Instalment tax is payable in four equal instalments not later than three months, six months, nine months, and 12 months from the beginning of the accounting period. Final tax is payable on the date on which the final return is due for submission, namely six months after the end of the accounting period or within nine months from the end of the accounting period for public sector entities.
WHT is due seven days after the month of deduction.
### Penalties
A late filing penalty applies monthly at an amount equal to the higher of (i) 15 currency points (currently TZS 300,000) or (ii) 2.5% applied to unpaid tax. If estimated tax is significantly underestimated, a penalty may also apply.
Interest on late payment is charged at the Bank of Tanzania discount rate on a compounding basis.
## Tax audit process
The normal practice is for the TRA to carry out a review every two or three years.
### Time limit set for the Commissioner to determine an objection
If no determination is issued within six months of an admission of an objection, the underlying tax assessment or decision will be treated as final/confirmed, and the taxpayer can appeal to the Board.
### A 100% tax deposit on objection to tax decisions where there is a flight risk
The Commissioner can demand a deposit of 100% of assessed tax where the Commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that the objector intends to permanently leave the country.
## Statute of limitations
There is a five-year time limit for the TRA to adjust an income tax return filed by a taxpayer (unless there is an instance of fraud, wilful neglect, or serious omission by the taxpayer, in which case there is no time limit). The five years runs from the due date of filing the final tax return.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Currently, the topics of particular focus for the TRA include transfer pricing, VAT compliance, WHT on payments to both residents and non-residents, compliance on payroll taxes, and post clearance audits for importers and exporters of goods. They generally perform various reconciliations, including (i) sales declared in the VAT returns compared to the revenue in the financial statements and the sales per the EFDMS, (ii) payroll costs per financial statements compared to the amount of pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) remitted, (iii) expected WHT per the expenses in the financial statements compared to the amount remitted, and (iv) deposits in the bank account compared to the sales per the financial statements.
## Functional currency
Taxable income and deductible expenditure is quantified in Tanzanian shillings. Upon request by the taxpayer, the Commissioner has the power, by notice in writing, to permit quantification in a foreign currency convertible to Tanzanian shillings.


# Tanzania
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
A company is tax resident if it is incorporated or formed under the laws of Tanzania or if the management and control of its affairs is exercised in Tanzania, whether physically or through any electronic means.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
A non-resident entity has a PE in Tanzania if it carries on business in Tanzania. This includes a place where a person:
  * is carrying on business through an agent, other than a general agent of independent status acting in the ordinary course of business as such, provided that, where an agent other than an independent agent is acting on behalf of another person, that other person shall be deemed to have a PE if:
    * the agent, other than an independent agent, has and habitually exercises authority to conclude contracts or issue invoices on behalf of that other person, unless their activities are limited to the purchase of goods or merchandise for that other person


    * the agent, other than an independent agent, has no authority to conclude contracts but habitually maintains stock of goods or merchandise from which they regularly deliver goods or merchandise on behalf of that other person, or
    * the agent, other than an independent agent, habitually secures orders, wholly or almost wholly for that other person or for the enterprise and other enterprises controlling, controlled by, or subject to the same common control, as that of that other person
  * has used or installed, or is using or installing, substantial equipment or machinery, and

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
In calculating taxable profit, deductions are allowed for revenue expenditures incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of income, with some statutory exceptions. For capital expenditures, there are specific tax depreciation allowances.
The expenditures have to be supported by fiscal receipts, except for goods/services provided by non-residents with no PE and those not required to issue fiscal receipts.
There are special rules with regard to the valuation of trading stock and long-term contracts and in relation to the treatment of instalment sales and finance leases.
There is ring-fencing of mining or petroleum operations by reference to the relevant mining or petroleum licence area.
## Depreciation
The categories of depreciable assets and their tax depreciation rates are set out in the table below.
Expenditures on plant and machinery are generally written off on a reducing-balance basis at rates of 37.5%, 25%, or 12.5%, depending on the category of the asset. Certain plant and machinery for manufacturing, fish farming, and tourist hotels benefit from a 50% allowance equally enjoyed in the first and second years, with the normal rates applying to the remaining balance in subsequent years. There is an immediate write-off of expenditures on plant and machinery used in agriculture.
Expenditures on buildings qualify for a depreciation allowance of 5% per year on a straight-line basis. For intangible assets, the write-off is over the useful life of the asset.
Apart from the immediate write-off of plant and machinery, agricultural businesses also benefit from the immediate write-off of agricultural improvement expenditures (including the costs of clearing land, excavating irrigation channels, and planting perennial crops or tree bearing crops). Buildings, structures, dams, water reservoirs, fences, and similar works of a permanent nature used in agriculture, livestock, or fish farming are written off on a straight-line basis over five years.
Expenditure incurred in respect of mineral or petroleum operations during a year of income qualifies for depreciation allowance at the rate of 20% per year on a straight-line basis.
### Depreciation allowances rates
Class | Depreciable assets | Rate (%)  
---|---|---  
1 | Computers and data handling equipment, together with peripheral devices; automobiles, buses, and minibuses with a seating capacity of less than 30 passengers; goods vehicles with a load capacity of less than seven tonnes; construction and earth-moving equipment. | 37.5  
2 | Buses with a seating capacity of 30 or more passengers, heavy general purpose or specialised trucks, trailers, and trailer-mounted containers; railroad cars, locomotives, and equipment; vessels, barges, tugs, and similar water transportation equipment; aircraft, other self-propelling vehicles; plant and machinery (including windmills, electric generators, and distribution equipment) used in agriculture or manufacturing; specialised public utility plant, equipment, and machinery or other irrigation installations and equipment. | 25  
3 | Office furniture, fixtures, and equipment; any asset not included in another class. | 12.5  
5 | Buildings, structures, dams, water reservoirs, fences, and similar works of a permanent nature used in agriculture, livestock farming, or fishing farming. | 20  
6 | Buildings, structures, and similar works of permanent nature other than those mentioned in Class 5. | 5  
7 | Intangible assets. | 1 divided by the useful life of the asset in the pool and rounded down to the nearest half year  
8 | Plant and machinery (including windmills, electric generators, and distribution equipment) used in agriculture and electronic fiscal devices purchased by a non-VAT-registered trader. | 100  
## Interest in land
Interest in land does not qualify for depreciation allowance as it is excluded from the definition of 'depreciable asset'.
## Goodwill
Goodwill does not qualify for depreciation allowance as it is excluded from the definition of 'depreciable asset'.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses are deductible to the extent that they meet the general deduction criteria (i.e. they are revenue in nature and were incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of income). The definition of 'business' includes a prospective business.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are deductible on an accrual basis, subject to thin capitalisation rules _as detailed in the section_.
## Bad debt
In order to claim relief for a bad debt, it is necessary to demonstrate that all reasonable steps have been taken to pursue payment and that there is a reasonable belief that the debt claim will not be satisfied.
## Charitable contributions
The Income Tax Act allows deduction for contributions made:
  1. to charitable institutions (approved by the Commissioner to operate as such) and social development projects
  2. under Section 12 of the Education Fund Act 2001
  3. to local government authorities under statutory obligations to support community developments projects
  4. to the AIDS Trust Fund established under the Tanzania Commission for AIDS Act, or
  5. to the government in the fight against COVID-19.


The deduction available under item (i) above is restricted to 2% of the company's taxable income before such deduction.
The deduction available under item (v) shall cease to have effect when the Minister may determine by notice in the Gazette.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and similar penalties payable to a government or a political subdivision of any country for the breach of any law or subsidiary legislation are not deductible.
## Taxes
Taxes payable under the Income Tax Act 2004 are not deductible.
### WHT paid by withholder
WHT paid by the withholder is not deductible.
## Net operating losses
There is no limit on the carryforward period for tax losses. However, there is ring-fencing of tax losses as follows:
  * Losses from agricultural business can only be offset against profits derived from agricultural business.
  * Losses from one mining licence area can only be offset against profits from the same mining licence area.
  * Losses from one petroleum licence area can only be offset against profits from the same petroleum licence area.
  * Foreign-source losses can only be offset against foreign-source profits.
  * Losses on investments can only be offset against investment income.
  * Foreign-source losses on investments can only be offset against foreign-source investment income.
  * Losses incurred on speculative transactions can only be offset against income derived from speculative transactions.


In addition, the following restrictions apply to tax losses:
  * The deductibility of the losses carried forward is restricted (for holders of a petroleum exploration licence, mineral licence, and licence in respect of midstream and downstream activities) such that only 70% of the taxable profits of the company can be sheltered by losses brought forward (with any excess losses carried forward to future years).
  * For businesses other than agriculture, health, and education services, the deductibility of the losses carried forward is restricted after a period of four years of continuous losses such that only 60% of the taxable profits of the company in the fifth year can be sheltered by losses brought forward (with any excess losses carried forward to future years).


In certain circumstances, tax losses may be forfeited on a change in the underlying control of an entity.
Tax losses can be carried back only in long-term contracts in a case where a contract is completed and a person has unrelieved losses for that period or a previous period that is attributable to the long-term contract. These losses can then be carried back to a previous year of income and treated as unrelieved loss for that year.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments to foreign affiliates are deductible to the extent they are wholly and exclusively incurred in the production of the company's income. The deduction is subject to transfer pricing provisions _as detailed in the section_.


# Tanzania
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
There are no provisions for tax consolidation or group relief in Tanzania.
## Transfer pricing
With respect to transactions between related parties, there is an obligation to 'quantify, apportion, and allocate amounts' for income tax purposes on an arm's-length basis. The Transfer Pricing Regulations and Guidelines require:
  * Any taxpayer whose transactions with associates exceed TZS 10 billion to file the CIT returns together with transfer pricing documentation.
  * Any other taxpayer with related-party transactions to have transfer pricing documentation in place and provide this within 30 days from the date of request by the TRA.
  * The penalty for any adjustment made during an audit is 100% of the underpaid tax. 


## Thin capitalisation
There is a thin capitalisation restriction on the amount of deductible interest for what are termed 'exempt-controlled resident entities', where the debt-to-equity ratio exceeds 7:3. There are specific definitions of 'debt' and 'equity' for the purposes of thin capitalisation.
## Controlled foreign trusts and corporations
There are provisions that relate to the treatment of unallocated income of controlled foreign trusts and corporations.
## Change in control provisions
The change in control provisions are triggered at the moment the underlying ownership of an entity changes by more than 50% as compared to any time during the previous three years. Where there is such a change, the consequences are that:
  * the accounting period of the entity is split at the point of such a change, so that the parts of the year of income before and after the change are treated as separate years of income, and
  * there is deemed realisation of assets and liabilities at market values.


In certain cases, such a change can also result in the forfeiture of unutilised tax losses and tax credits.
The Commissioner has to be notified immediately before and after the change in control has occurred.
### Exemptions
The change of control provisions do not apply in the following circumstances:
  * Where the change is a result of allotment of new membership interest in the resident entity.
  * A sole result of transfer of membership interest of a resident entity to another resident person.


## Other anti-avoidance provisions
Other anti-avoidance provisions exist to address the following:
  * Income or dividend stripping arrangements.
  * Income splitting.


### Taxing right on an agent of a non-resident person or of a beneficial owner
A taxing right on a 'representative assessee' will apply in respect of income of a non-resident person or 'beneficial owner' for whom the 'representative assessee' acts as an agent.
Activities that can create the categorisation of 'agent of a non-resident person or of a beneficial owner' include employment, any 'business connection', receipt of income for the other party, or acting as a trustee.
The definition of the term 'beneficial owner' includes reference to aspects (whether direct or indirect) of 'substantial control', 'substantial economic interest in or … substantial economic benefit'.
The term 'business connection' includes reference to:
  * Conclusion of or significant role leading to conclusion of contracts.
  * Maintenance of stock of goods or merchandise.
  * Habitually securing orders.
  * Carrying on business or investment through an entity or an arrangement for the benefit of the other party (directly or indirectly).




# Tanzania
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
The income tax liability of a person with a PE in Tanzania is calculated as if the person and the PE are independent but as if the PE is resident in Tanzania. The income of the PE is taxed at the normal income tax rate for entities, namely 30% on net income or 5% of turnover for technical and management service providers to mining, oil, and gas entities.
The PE is also subject to a tax on 'repatriated income', which applies at a rate of 10% (the same rate as a company would withhold on dividends).
In certain circumstances, business activities of the head office may be attributed to the branch. Arrangements between a PE and head office are generally not recognised, other than the transfer of an asset or liability between the two. Amounts derived (or payments received) and expenditures incurred (or payments made) that relate to assets held by, or liabilities owed by, the business of the PE are attributed to the PE.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
Subject to any provision to the contrary in the Income Tax Act, income is to be calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Local GAAP is in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Corporations must apply an accrual basis of accounting.
## Inventory valuation
Trading stock is valued at the end of the year at the lower of cost and market value. No explicit method is stated for determining inventory cost, and, so far, for tax purposes, such cost will match the cost determined in accordance with GAAP. Special rules apply for the valuation of long-term work in progress.
## Capital gains
There is no separate capital gains tax in Tanzania. Instead, income tax is charged on the taxable profit arising on a gain arising from the realisation of an 'investment asset' (a term that [subject to certain exceptions] includes shares, interests in land and buildings, and a beneficial interest in a trust). The gain is determined as the difference between costs incurred and sale proceeds.
## Dividend income
Dividend income will be included in calculation of taxable income unless it is exempt or a final withholding payment.
Dividend payments are taxed by way of WHT, and this is a final tax. The normal rate of WHT on dividends is 10%.
Where a dividend is paid by a resident corporation to another resident corporation holding 25% or more of shares and voting rights in the corporation paying the dividend, the WHT rate is 5%.
Dividends paid by a company listed on the DSE are subject to 5% WHT (regardless of whether they are paid to a resident or non-resident).
## Interest income
Interest income will be included in calculation of taxable income unless it is exempt or a final withholding payment.
The term 'interest' is defined as payment for the use of money and includes payment made or accrued under a debt obligation that is not a repayment of capital, as well as any gain realised by way of a discount, premium, swap payment, or similar payment.
Interest payments made by residents are taxed by way of WHT at 10%.
## Royalty income
Royalty income will be included in calculation of taxable income unless it is exempt or a final withholding payment.
Royalty payments made by residents are taxed by way of WHT at 15% (regardless of whether it is paid to a resident or non-resident), except for payment relating to the use of cinematography film, videotape, sound recording, or any other like medium, where the applicable rate is 10%, and payment to resident sports entities or the Tanzania Football Federation, where the applicable rate is 5%. WHT on royalty payments to a non-resident is a final tax.
The term 'royalty' means any payment made by the lessee under a lease of an intangible asset and includes payments for:
  1. the use of, or the right to use, a copyright, patent, design, model, plan, secret formula or process, or trademark
  2. the supply of know-how, including information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment or experience
  3. the use of, or right to use, a cinematography film, videotape, sound recording, or any other like medium
  4. the use of, or right to use, industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment
  5. the supply of assistance ancillary to a matter referred to in paragraphs (i) to (iv), or
  6. a total or partial forbearance with respect to a matter referred to in paragraphs (i) to (v), but excludes a natural resource payment.


## Foreign income
A resident person's foreign-source income or loss (from employment, business, and investment) is calculated as that person's worldwide income or loss less any income sourced in Tanzania and plus any loss sourced in Tanzania.
A resident person may claim a foreign tax credit on any foreign tax paid by the person on foreign income. However, such credit should not exceed the Tanzanian tax rate applicable to that income. Any unrelieved amount of foreign tax credit may be carried forward (subject to 'change in control' provisions _as detailed in the section_). An election may be made to relinquish foreign tax credit and claim a deduction for the amount of foreign income tax.
There are no provisions for the deferral of the taxation of foreign income.

Certain payments to non-residents are subject to tax at the relevant non-resident WHT rates (_see the section for the relevant rates_).
Gain from the disposal of investments in Tanzania is subject to income tax where such investments fall within the source rules, and, in such a case, the gain will be taxed at a rate of 30%.
## Reduced rate for newly listed companies
A reduced corporate income tax (CIT) rate of 25% applies for three consecutive years for companies newly listed on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE). To qualify, at least 30% of the company's shares must be issued to the public.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is chargeable on all taxable goods and services supplied in, or imported into, the United Republic of Tanzania. The standard rate of VAT is 18% in Mainland Tanzania and 15% in Tanzania Zanzibar, except for banking, postal, telecommunication, insurance, and digital services where an 18% rate is applicable. Additionally, the export of goods and certain services is eligible for zero rating. Generally, businesses with or expecting to generate an annual taxable turnover of more than TZS 200 million in Mainland Tanzania and TZS 100 million in Tanzania Zanzibar must register for VAT. The Commissioner has the discretion to register (as intending traders) investors whose projects have not commenced production of taxable supplies but wish to be VAT-registered in order to reclaim the tax they incur on start-up costs. A business that only makes exempt supplies is unable to register for VAT and, consequently, unable to recover the VAT incurred on inputs.
Registered businesses must submit VAT returns, and pay any tax due, monthly.
There is also mandatory registration for professional service providers (e.g. lawyers and accountants) and government entities/institutions carrying out economic activities. A non-resident who carries on an economic activity in Mainland Tanzania without a fixed place (e.g. non-resident suppliers of B2C electronic services) and makes taxable supplies in excess of the VAT registration threshold (no threshold for non-resident suppliers of B2C electronic services) is required to appoint a VAT representative unless it is impractical to do so due to business circumstances, in which case the non-resident would be required to apply for a simplified registration in accordance with procedures prescribed in regulations.
For imported goods, VAT is payable at the time of importation together with any customs and excise duties. VAT payable with respect to specific capital goods (as defined) may be deferred, subject to certain procedures being followed. However, VAT deferment on imported capital goods will cease to apply from 30 June 2026.
For imported services, VAT is accounted for by registered businesses through a 'reverse-charge' mechanism, and such accounting is only relevant where a taxpayer has exempt supplies of 10% or more of the total supplies.
Depending on the industry, there are a number of exempt supplies. These include (this list is not exhaustive):
  * Agricultural implements, agricultural inputs, livestock, basic agricultural products and food for human consumption; implements for fisheries; bee-keeping implements; dairy equipment; and medicine or pharmaceutical products. 
  * Import of food, clothing, and shoes donated to non-profit organisations for free distribution to orphanages or schools for children with special needs in Mainland Tanzania.
  * Goods imported by non-profit organisations for the provision of emergency and disaster relief (conditional).

  * Educational services provided by a relevant approved educational institution; education materials.

  * Goods eligible for relief under the East African Customs Management Act (where imported by a registered and licensed explorer or prospector for exclusive use in oil, gas, or mineral exploration or prospecting activities).
  * Various goods imported by a natural gas distributor (including compressed natural gas [CNG] plants equipment, natural gas pipes, transportation and distribution pipes, CNG storage cascades, CNG special transportation vehicles, natural gas metering equipment, CNG refuelling of filling, gas receiving units, flare gas system, condensate tanks and leading facility, system piping and pipe rack, and condensate stabiliser).

  * Video assistant referee (VAR) technology equipment and accessories upon approval by the Minister responsible for sports.

The VAT Act contains restrictions on claiming of input tax. For example, one cannot claim VAT incurred on entertainment; membership to sporting, social, or recreational clubs or associations; and spare parts and repair or maintenance costs in respect of passenger vehicles. 
The input tax claim time limit is six months. However, this time limit starts to run by reference to the date of the fiscal receipt.
Input tax incurred on goods in the six months prior to VAT registration can be claimed no later than in the third VAT return submitted following registration. 
A company with taxable supplies of more than 90% of total supplies is entitled to full input tax credit while a company with taxable supplies less than 10% of total supplies is not entitled to claim any input tax incurred.
A company with taxable supplies between 10% and 90% of total supplies is entitled to partial input tax recovery. Two methods of apportionment, namely the average method and direct attribution method, can be used. Imported services are not taken into account as supplies when determining the allowance of input tax for partial exemption purposes.
Businesses entitled to VAT refunds can claim any remaining credit six months after the refund first became due, subject to all intervening returns being rendered. Any claim for a VAT refund must be supported by an auditor's certificate of genuineness. Businesses in a consistent refund position (e.g. exporters) may apply for approval to lodge their refund claims monthly.
The VAT Act includes specific requirements to be met by a fiscal receipt to facilitate a refund claim. This includes claims made by diplomats and international organisations. A fiscal receipt is defined to include receipt issued by a fiscal device, by the Government Electronic Payment Gateway, and any other electronic system approved by the Commissioner General.
VAT in Tanzania Zanzibar is administered under a separate but similar legislation. 
## Digital service tax
A non-resident involved in digital transactions (i.e. providing electronic services) is required to account for tax of 2% on the turnover (excluding VAT). The Regulations (Income Tax (Registration of Non-Resident Electronic Service Suppliers) Regulations, 2022) provide for procedures to be followed by non-residents providing electronic services, covering matters including scope of services, registration (online), filing simplified income tax returns (online), and payment requirements.
There is a monthly filing requirement of digital service tax returns to be done by the 20th day of the month following the month to which the payment relates.
## Customs duty
Tanzania is a member of the East African Community, which became a Customs Union on 1 January 2005 on the implementation of the East African Customs Union Protocol. This protocol provides for a common external tariff (CET), elimination of internal tariffs, rules of origin, anti-dumping measures, a common customs law, and common export promotion schemes.
Generally, the import duty rates applicable under the CET are as follows:

Additionally, following the ratification of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which was officially launched in July 2019, goods imported in Tanzania may enjoy preferential tariff rates provided that they originate from state parties of AfCFTA.
Most imports are also subject to RDL of 2% (except goods that are exempted from import duty, pharmaceutical goods, fertilisers as defined in the EAC Common External Tariff, and kerosene type jet A1 fuel classified under HS Code 2710.19.21) and Destination Inspection Fee of 0.6% of the FOB value.
