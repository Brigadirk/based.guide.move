# Cayman Islands
## Overview
Last reviewed - 29 November 2024
The Cayman Islands, located in the western Caribbean Sea, were colonised from Jamaica by the British during the 18th and 19th centuries and were administered by Jamaica after 1863. In 1959, the islands became a territory within the Federation of the West Indies. When the Federation dissolved in 1962, the Cayman Islands chose to remain a British dependency. The Cayman Islands are an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. They are divided into six districts, with Georgetown as the capital. The official language of the Cayman Islands is English. The currency in the Cayman Islands is the Cayman Islands dollar (KYD).
With no direct taxation, the islands are a thriving offshore financial centre. More than 99,000 active companies were registered in the Cayman Islands as of 2016, including almost 300 banks, 750 insurers, and 10,500 mutual funds. A stock exchange was opened in 1997. The tourism and financial services industries create a significant majority of gross domestic product (GDP). The tourism industry is aimed at the luxury market and caters mainly to visitors from North America. The Caymanians enjoy one of the highest outputs per capita and one of the highest standards of living in the world.
PwC has been established in the Cayman Islands for over 30 years and has significant local experience with the financial services sector, utility providers, and other institutions. The PwC practice in the Cayman Islands provides a range of assurance, tax, and advisory services.
