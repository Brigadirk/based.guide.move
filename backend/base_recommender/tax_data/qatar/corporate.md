## Amendments to the Executive Regulations to the Tax Law
Following the issuance of the Law No. 11 of 2022 (‘amended Tax Law‘) on 2 February 2023, Qatar has now published amendments to the Executive Regulations to the Tax Law (‘amended ERs‘) in the official Gazette. The amended ERs are effective from 16 May 2023 (i.e. the date of their publication in the official Gazette).
The amended ERs have introduced several important changes to the Executive Regulations, and we have summarised some of the amendments below.
### Significant changes to the permanent establishment (PE) criteria
#### Preparatory and auxiliary activities and registration requirements
The amended ERs introduce new exclusions for preparatory and auxiliary activities that do not constitute a PE. These exclusions are accompanied by anti-fragmentation and anti-avoidance provisions.
It is important to note that, in certain circumstances, entities engaged in preparatory and auxiliary activities (even in the absence of a PE) will be required to comply with registration and notification requirements. This is a significant change, as such entities will be required to register for tax purposes with the General Tax Authority (GTA) and obtain a Taxpayer Identification Number through Dhareeba.
#### Changes to Dependent Agency in connection with a PE
The regulations lay a strong emphasis on ’exclusivity‘ and ’semi-exclusivity‘ tests in determining the existence of a ‘Dependent Agent’ PE. Since there is no definition of ‘semi-exclusivity’, it can create considerable uncertainty in determining ‘dependency’ in certain circumstances.
#### Insurance activities
The amended ERs state that, except for reinsurance activities, certain foreign insurance companies collecting premiums from Qatar or insuring Qatari risks may now be considered to have a PE in Qatar. This change can have a significant impact on non-Qatari insurance companies.
#### Others
There are also certain changes to the fixed place PE concept. In addition to the list included in the existing ERs, the amended ERs expand the scope and now include ’sales outlet‘ and ’warehouse providing storage facilities’.
### Deductibility of expenses for a PE / branch 
The amended ERs have revised the expense deductibility criteria for a Qatari PE / branch. Going forward, a PE / branch will be allowed to deduct expenses incurred for the purposes of the PE's / branch's business as long as the expenses are ’real expenses‘. In addition, the amended ERs also provide a list of items that are not deductible for a PE or branch if paid to its head office or any other related party.
### Reporting of core activities in the annual income tax return 
The amended Tax Law introduced a new requirement to submit a report to the GTA as part of the annual income tax return in relation to the details regarding Core Income Generating Activities (CIGA) in Qatar. The amended ERs specify the criteria for this reporting based on revenue, assets, and operational management.
### Substantial activity 
The amended ERs mandate that residents may not facilitate structures or arrangements aimed at making profits that do not reflect a substantial activity in Qatar. This provision appears to ‘discourage’ any ‘proxy’ type of arrangements or where ‘concealment’ of real economic activity may take place.
## Double tax treaties (DTTs) with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and United Arab Emirates (UAE)
On 30 May 2024, the State of Qatar signed DTTs with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. However, the treaties will enter into force after the exchange of the ratification instruments.
## Amendments to the Tax Law
On 2 February 2023, Qatar published Law No. 11 of 2022 amending several provisions of the Income Tax Law No. 24 of 2018 in the official Gazette. The amendments are effective from 2 February 2023 (i.e. the date of their publication in the official Gazette).
The amendments have introduced a number of important changes to the Tax Law. The details of some of these key changes are issued by the GTA as amendments to the Executive Regulations of the Tax Law.
We have summarised some of the amendments below.
### Global minimum tax
The GTA has indicated an intention to implement a Qualified Minimum Domestic Top-up Tax (QDMTT) and has engaged various stakeholders in a consultation in this regard. The process is ongoing, and it is anticipated that further communication will follow with regards to the QDMTT, its scope, and the framework for a Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) Information Return (GIR).
### Expansion of the scope of income tax
The amendments specify various types of income generated outside Qatar that will now be subject to income tax in Qatar, including income generated from real estate, immovable property, dividends, royalties, interest, and technical service fees, as long as it is not attributable to a foreign PE of the Qatari Project. Additionally, there is an indication that income derived by a Qatari Project from a broad range of services provided outside Qatar will now be subject to income tax in Qatar.
### Reporting of substantial / core activities
The amendments introduced a new requirement for entities to submit a report to the GTA regarding the minimum indicators of their core activities in Qatar. Non-compliance with the substance requirements will result in a penalty equal to 15% of net income.
### Changes to the definition of PE
PE is now defined as ’having a fixed place of business‘ and ’the realisation of income or profit‘. This definition deviates from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD’s) PE definition to a certain extent and significantly expands the scope of a PE, which needs to be carefully assessed.
### Other amendments
Other key amendments include:
  * changes to the residency criteria
  * changes in the tax status of private charitable organisations, private associations and foundations, and private foundations of public interest (these are now within the scope of tax law as tax-exempt entities), and
  * certain new definitions added (providing guidance on new provisions introduced in the amendments as well as clarifying some provisions of the Tax Law).


## Social and Sports Contribution Fund for listed entities
Companies listed on the Qatar Stock Exchange are required to pay a 2.5% levy imposed under Law No. 13 of 2008 to support social and sport activities. This levy was previously administered by the Social and Sports Contribution Fund, established by way of Amiri Decree No. 44 of the year 2010.
On 2 November 2022, a circular was issued stating that starting from the financial year ended 31 December 2022, the GTA will be responsible for the collection of this 2.5% levy. The procedure and deadlines contained in the Law No. 24 of 2018 and its executive regulations are expected to be applicable.
## Economic Substance Requirements
On 17 October 2021, the Ministry of Finance in the State of Qatar issued Decision No. 20 of 2021 (concerning economic substance regulations in Qatar, ’the Regulations/ESR‘), requiring ’qualifying entities‘ that carry on specified activities to demonstrate economic substance in Qatar from 4 November 2021 if they want to benefit from a preferential tax regime.
Note the following:
  * Depending on the date of incorporation, qualifying entities would be required to comply on an immediate basis.
  * Sanctions for non-compliance and filing requirements will be determined in due course.
  * All entities in Qatar should perform an analysis to assess whether they fall into ESR scope and take immediate steps for compliance.


All Qatari entities will need to assess whether and which of their activities fall within the scope of the ESR and how to ensure they meet the ESR requirements in respect of each relevant activity. This is both a qualitative and quantitative assessment that would involve consideration of operational, financial, tax / transfer pricing, legal, and governance matters.
## Potential implementation of a value-added tax (VAT)
The GCC countries have signed a VAT common framework, which forms the legal basis for the introduction of a VAT system in each of the GCC member states (Kingdom of Bahrain, State of Kuwait, Sultanate of Oman, State of Qatar, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates).
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have implemented VAT as of January 2018. Bahrain has implemented VAT as of January 2019. Oman implemented VAT in April 2021. The other GCC member states are also expected to issue their own VAT legislation. The Cabinet of Qatar had previously approved a draft law on VAT and its Executive Regulations as put forth by the Qatar Ministry of Finance. The laws and respective executive regulations have not been published yet. While the GTA has not made any communication in this regard, given the recent resolution of the blockade on Qatar, there is an increase in the expectation in the market that the introduction of VAT in Qatar may occur in the near future.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 03 April 2024
## Dhareeba registration and implementation
The GTA, via Circular 5, has announced the formal closure of the previous Tax Administration System (TAS). With effect from 1 November 2020, all tax returns are required to be filed and other tax submissions (e.g. WHT, contract notifications) made using Dhareeba. The GTA has emphasised that taxpayers should make the required arrangements to ensure submission of their tax obligations through Dhareeba are fully compliant with the procedures described in the user guides available on the Dhareeba portal.
## Taxable period
The tax year is generally the same as the calendar year, although advance approval may be sought from the GTA to use an accounting year-end other than the calendar year.
## Tax returns
The tax return is due within four months from the end of a company's accounting period.
## Payment of tax
The tax payable is based on the tax declaration and should be paid on the same day that the tax return is due.
### Late filing penalties
The Qatar tax law contains a penalty regime, which imposes a penalty for the late filing of a tax return. In addition, a penalty applies where there is a late payment of tax.
## Objection and appeals process
It is possible for a taxpayer to initially object directly to the GTA regarding a decision related to a tax position. If the objection is unsuccessful with respect to altering the GTA’s decision, an appeal may be made by the taxpayer to the Tax Appeals Committee. Based on the Tax Appeals Committee's decision with respect to the appeal, a final appeal may be made by either the GTA or the taxpayer to the administrative chamber of the court. The law prescribes time limits for each stage of the appeal process.
There is a mandatory requirement to use Arabic language in all the correspondences with the GTA after 13 July 2019.
## Accounting and audit requirements
A company's CIT return is required to be accompanied by audited financial statements if any of the following cases apply:
  * The capital exceeds QAR 200,000.
  * Total income exceeds QAR 500,000.
  * The head office is situated outside of Qatar.


Qatar tax law requires accounts to be prepared in accordance with IFRS. For taxable years starting on or after 1 January 2020, there is a requirement to submit the financial statements in the Arabic language.
### Accounting record retention
All accounting books, registers, and documents relating to activities in Qatar are required to be retained in Qatar for a ten-year period.
## Anti-avoidance provision
The Qatar tax law contains anti-avoidance provisions that give the GTA wide powers to counteract transactions that have been carried out with a tax avoidance purpose. These powers include substituting an arm’s-length value or re-characterising transactions.
## Topics of focus for the GTA
The following areas appear to be the focus of the GTA from a tax compliance perspective:
  * Representative offices of non-residents are being required to file tax returns, notwithstanding the fact that they may only be promoting their business.
  * The GTA is closely examining the taxpayer’s activities to establish whether or not a PE exists. This is a particular area of focus where a taxpayer submits a claim for a refund of WHT on the basis of application of the provisions of a DTT. If a taxpayer has a PE, the Foreign Investment Law requires that PE to be formally registered as a company or a temporary branch.
  * Related-party transactions and large and unusual items of expenditure are being scrutinised by the GTA. _See the section for comments on the anti-avoidance provision, thin capitalisation, and transfer pricing_.
  * The allocation of head office general and administrative expenses to a Qatar branch of a foreign company.
  * Capital gains generated on the sale of shares by a non-resident in a Qatari company.
  * Compliance with the requirements of contract notification and WHT.
  * In terms of relief claimed under DTTs, the GTA is very keen in understanding the beneficial ownership of payments before granting a relief. There is a pay and reclaim mechanism for availing treaty benefits, and the payee has to file a refund application to the GTA in order to avail the treaty benefits.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 03 April 2024
It is important to recognise that residence is not the basis used to determine whether an entity is taxable for CIT purposes in Qatar. Accordingly, a CIT exposure in Qatar may arise even if a company is not resident in Qatar. However, residence is relevant when considering whether WHT will apply on payments received rather than CIT.
A company is resident in Qatar if it is incorporated in accordance with Qatari laws, its head office is situated in Qatar, or its place of effective management and control is in Qatar.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
On 2 February 2023, Qatar published Law No. 11 of 2022 amending several provisions of the Tax Law. Following this, amendments to the ERs were also published recently on 16 May 2023. The amendments are effective from the date of publication.
The following are the key changes related to PE that were introduced in the amendments.
### Fixed place
The amendments expand the scope of a fixed place PE to include ’sales outlet‘ and ’warehouse providing storage facilities‘, which would create a PE in Qatar.
### Preparatory and auxiliary activities
The amendments introduce new exclusions for preparatory and auxiliary activities that should not constitute a PE. It is important to note that in certain circumstances, entities engaged in preparatory and auxiliary activities (even in the absence of a PE) will be required to comply with registration and notification requirements. This is a significant change, as such entities will be required to register for tax purposes with the GTA and obtain a Taxpayer Identification Number through Dhareeba.
### Dependent Agent PE
The regulations introduced ’exclusivity‘ and ’semi-exclusivity‘ tests in determining the existence of a ‘Dependent Agent’ PE. Since there is no definition or clarity available regarding the concept of ‘semi-exclusivity’, there would be significant uncertainty in determining the ‘Dependent Agent’ PE in certain circumstances.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 03 April 2024
Taxable income is determined after deducting all expenditures, costs, and losses incurred to generate gross income. A deduction is usually available for expenses that are not considered to be 'capital' in nature and are incurred in generating Qatar-source revenue.
## Depreciation
Depreciation should be calculated in accordance with rates specified by the Tax Law and Regulations.
For certain assets, depreciation is calculated on the cost on a straight-line basis. The rates of depreciation are provided in the Regulations. Under the ERs, more asset categories have been introduced with different permissible depreciation rates.
## Goodwill
There are no specific provisions dealing with the taxation of goodwill. Accordingly, the accounting treatment should be followed from a tax perspective.
## Interest expenses
Interest on loans used for the purpose of the taxpayer’s activity is tax deductible, except where the loan is between a Qatar branch and its head office or a party related to the head office. Other limitations may apply.
## Bad debt
Bad debts approved by the GTA in accordance with the criteria set out in the tax law are deductible.
## Charitable contributions
Donations, gift aid, and subscriptions to charitable, humanitarian, scientific, cultural, or sporting activities paid in Qatar to government authorities or public bodies are deductible, provided the value does not exceed 3% of the net profit in the year in which the deduction is claimed.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties for breaching the laws of the State are not deductible for Qatar tax purposes.
## Taxes
Taxes and duties, other than the income tax, provided for in the law are deductible.
## Other significant items
Other deductible expenditures include the following:
  * Employee costs (including salaries, wages, gratuities, and other end of service benefits).
  * Losses resulting from the sale of assets.
  * Rents.
  * Insurance premiums.


## Net operating losses
Losses may be deducted from net income during the year. Under the Tax Law, losses can be carried forward for five years after the year in which they were incurred. Losses cannot be carried back.
## Allocations of overhead costs to branches
The amended ERs have revised the expense deductibility criteria for a Qatari PE / branch. Going forward, a PE / branch will be allowed to deduct expenses incurred for the purposes of the PE's / branch's business. It is important to note that these deductible expenses shall be ’real expenses‘ related to the business of the PE or branch.
As an exception to the deductibility criteria mentioned above, certain items are specifically not deductible in case these are paid by a PE or a branch to its head office or any other related party (e.g. royalties, interest).


# Qatar
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 03 April 2024
There is no concept of group taxation for Qatar tax purposes.
## Transfer pricing
Historically, transactions between related parties were expected to be undertaken on an arm’s-length basis and in accordance with the comparable uncontrolled price (CUP) method or any other OECD acceptable pricing method. However, there was no specific requirement for filing transfer pricing documentation with the GTA. The Regulations have outlined the following specific transfer pricing requirements:
  * The CUP methodology is referred to as the primary methodology. In case the CUP method is not applicable, the taxpayer should lodge a request to the GTA for the application of a different transfer pricing methodology.
  * A requirement for performing a 'functional analysis' describing a taxpayer’s position and economic role with related entities, identifying the functions performed, risks assumed, and the tangible and intangible assets owned and used.
  * A requirement to update the analysis supporting the arm’s-length character of the inter-company transactions every three years.
  * Arequirement of a transfer pricing declaration as part of the annual income tax return, of which the form and content should be specified by the GTA.
  * Tax deductibility of interest on loans paid to related parties shall be dependent on such loans being economically beneficial to taxpayers. On this basis, a 'commercial purpose' test has been introduced. The loan amount and interest charge shall also not exceed three times the equity of the Qatar tax paying entity and shall be documented in an inter-company agreement between the parties.
  * A requirement to prepare transfer pricing documentation (Local File and Master File) by the time of filing the tax return for the period during which the respective related party transaction(s) occurred or at any other date that the GTA may specify otherwise if the following conditions are met.


    * The threshold (to be established by the GTA) on revenues or assets of the taxpayer is met.
    * One of the related parties of the Qatari taxpayer is established outside of Qatar.


## Country-by-Country Reporting (CbCR) Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA)
Qatar became a signatory of the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters on 10 November 2017 and the CbCR MCAA on 20 December 2017.
On 16 June 2019, the GTA in Qatar, which is the ‘competent authority’ in matters related to CbCR, issued a notice with respect to CbCR obligations in Qatar, which will now be effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The notice requires mandatory CbCR submission for Ultimate Parent Entities (UPEs) that are a tax resident in Qatar and reported consolidated revenues equal to or more than 3 billion Qatari riyal (QAR) in the preceding financial year. The CbCR submission will need to include all qualifying constituent entities. For the time being, no CbCR or notification obligations apply to a constituent entity that is tax resident in Qatar if the UPE is resident outside Qatar.
The GTA, in collaboration with the Qatar Financial Centre (QFC) Tax Department where applicable, will monitor the non-compliance with the CbCR obligations and apply penalties in accordance with the Income Tax Law.
The notice by the GTA on 16 June 2019 comes soon after the suspension and goes back to include mandatory CbCR submission for entities that fulfil the following requirements:
  * Resident in Qatar.
  * The UPE of a multinational enterprise (MNE) group.
  * Reported consolidated revenues equal to or more than QAR 3 billion in the preceding financial year.


On 16 September 2019, the QFC issued a notice (‘QFC September Notice’) referring to the GTA June Notice and provided certain additional information with respect to the CbCR obligations for QFC entities, as well as potential penalties for non-compliance. QFC entities are subject to the CbCR obligations in Qatar and are required to submit the CbCR, subject to qualifying under the Qatari CbCR requirements.
The QFC September Notice outlines that non-compliance with the CbCR obligations triggers the application of financial sanctions/penalties, as outlined below:
  * A financial penalty of QAR 100 per day or per false or incomplete information would apply, as the case may be, in instances of a failure to submit on time the CbCR notification or submission of false or incomplete information in the CbCR notification.
  * A financial penalty of QAR 500 per day of delay or per false or incomplete information, as the case may be, in instance of a failure to submit on time the CbC report or submission of false or incomplete information in the CbCR.


## Thin capitalisation
Any loan between related parties should be at arm’s length, and interest expense should not exceed three times the equity of the entity.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no CFC provisions in Qatar.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 03 April 2024
The profits of a branch owned by a foreign parent entity are subject to the same tax rules as the ones that apply to other forms of taxable entities.


# Qatar
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 03 April 2024
## Foreign tax credit
The executive regulations of Qatar’s tax law provide that income tax paid outside Qatar is deductible as an expense for the purposes of determining taxable income, provided such income is taxable in Qatar.
## Other tax exemptions
Under the State regime, an application for a tax exemption may be made for certain projects that are considered to be strategically significant to the Qatar economy. The exemptions are generally granted for a period of five or ten years. Applications for an exemption are assessed based on certain criteria set out in the Qatar tax law.
Notwithstanding the fact that an exemption is granted, an entity that is exempt is still required to file a tax return under the Qatar tax law.
In addition to the above, Qatar has two special regimes that provides tax exemptions to entities that fulfil certain criteria:
### Qatar Science and Technology Park (QSTP)
Qatar has established the QSTP, which is aimed at entities with research and development (R&D) activities. QSTP entities can be fully exempt from Qatar tax; however, tax-exempt entities are still required to file tax returns and apply WHT on payments to non-residents.
### Qatar Free Zones
In 2018, the Qatar Free Zone Authority (QFZA) was set up as an independent entity to develop Free Zones in Qatar. It currently oversees two Free Zones: an Airport Free Zone (Ras Bufontas) and a Port Free Zone (Um Al Houl). The Airport Free Zone focuses on light manufacturing, international business services, the aviation sector, emerging technologies, and logistics hubs. The Port Free Zone focuses on maritime industries, heavy manufacturing, industrial sectors, emerging technologies, and logistics hubs.
Benefits of setting up in one of the Free Zones include 100% foreign ownership and a 20-year tax holiday (i.e. zero corporate tax, zero customs duties, and no personal income tax).


# Qatar
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 03 April 2024
A unified 5% WHT applies to all services that are used, utilised, or benefited in the State of Qatar even if they are carried out in whole or part outside the State.
WHT also applies to, among others, interest, royalties, technical fees, commissions, brokerage fees, and other payments for services. The Regulations have excluded certain payments from the scope of WHT. Dividends are not subject to WHT.
New provisions have also been introduced whereby certain unpaid amounts are 'deemed' as having been paid for WHT purposes if they remain unpaid for a certain specified period.
WHT only applies if the payment is made to non-resident individuals or companies with respect to activities not connected to a PE in Qatar. Since residents and non-residents with a PE in Qatar should have a tax card, in practice, the WHT only applies if payments are made to service providers who do not hold a valid tax card.
The company or a branch that makes the payment to its foreign supplier is required to withhold the tax and remit to the GTA the funds that were withheld by the 16th day of the following month. In the event that the company does not make a payment to the GTA, the company will be liable for penalties.
All monthly WHT statements will have to be filed online in Dhareeba.
## Retention system
A retention system is in place whereby certain final contract amounts are required to be retained from payments made to a temporary branch in Qatar. Companies resident in Qatar and permanent branches are effectively not subject to the retention rules because they can secure a release of the final payment by presenting a tax card.
The retention is equivalent to the higher of 3% of the contract value (less the value of supply and work carried out abroad) or the final contractual payment until the temporary branch produces a no objection letter from the GTA.
In October 2022, the GTA issued a publication providing much needed guidelines on the procedure and requirements in order to obtain a no objection certificate (NOC) for the release of these retentions. As per the publication, taxpayers are required to provide certain information and documents as a part of their NOC request (including several accounting details, details of the relevant contract, and a contract completion certificate).
## Tax treaties
In case a relief from WHT is available under a double tax treaty (DTT), Qatar has a pay and reclaim mechanism (i.e. the payer is required to withhold and pay to the GTA). The payee will have to file a refund application to the GTA in order to avail the relief provided under the DTT.
The WHT rates under these treaties in respect of dividends, interest, and royalties are as follows:
**Recipient** | **WHT (%)** | Effective**date**  
---|---|---  
**Dividends *** | **Interest** | **Royalties**

## Economic substance requirements
On 17 October 2021, the Ministry of Finance in the State of Qatar issued Decision No. 20 of 2021 (concerning economic substance regulations in Qatar [’the Regulations’ or ESR]), requiring ’qualifying entities‘ that carry on specified activities to demonstrate economic substance in Qatar from 4 November 2021 if they want to benefit from a preferential tax regime.
Note the following:
  * Depending on the date of incorporation, qualifying entities would be required to comply on an immediate basis.
  * Sanctions for non-compliance and filing requirements will be determined in due course.
  * All entities in Qatar should perform an analysis to assess whether they fall into ESR scope and take immediate steps for compliance.


All Qatari entities will need to assess whether and which of their activities fall within the scope of the ESR and how to ensure they meet the ESR requirements in respect of each relevant activity. This is both a qualitative and quantitative assessment that would involve consideration of operational, financial, tax / transfer pricing, legal, and governance matters.
## Contract notification
Taxpayers are required to notify the GTA of contracts that they enter into with residents and non-residents (subject to certain monetary thresholds) within 30 days of signing such contract. The New Tax Law and Regulations have introduced a penalty of QAR 10,000 per contract that is not reported as per statutory requirements. With the introduction of Dhareeba, contract notifications are also required to be submitted in Dhareeba. 
## The Qatar Financial Centre (QFC)
The QFC was established in 2005 to attract companies in the financial services sector. The QFC has its own tax regulations and rules, and the State of Qatar tax laws do not apply to the licensed activities of entities established in the QFC.
The QFC is an onshore regime that operates within its own legal, tax, and regulatory framework, which is independent of, but runs parallel to, the existing framework in the State of Qatar. The QFC has its own Civil and Commercial Courts, as well as an independent Regulatory Tribunal. The legal framework is modelled closely after the English common law and existing major financial centres.
QFC-established entities can access the local market, be 100% foreign owned, are subject to no currency restrictions, and can repatriate 100% of their profit. Whilst entities can currently be based at any of the QFC’s designated premises in Qatar (which are not confined to a specific zone), the QFC has recently announced an initiative to move all existing and future QFC entities to Msheireb Downtown Doha, a special designated area.
### Regulated activities
Regulated activities include activities such as financial, banking, and investment business; insurance and reinsurance business; funds administration; fund advisory; fiduciary business; and other financial-related business.
### Non-regulated activities
Permitted non-regulated activities were originally limited to professional services in support of financial firms (e.g. services generally provided by accounting, audit, and legal firms). The QFC subsequently expanded the scope of permitted non-regulated activities to include services such as intellectual property (IP) management and treasury for all sectors and consultancy services in relation to information technology (IT), real estate, recruitment, and sports and event management. The above-mentioned services are not exhaustive, and the QFC authority continues to consider novel types of professional 'business-to-business (B2B) services' on a case-by-case basis, to the extent that the envisaged business is a strategic fit for the QFC. The opportunity now exists for a non-regulated business to incorporate a 100% foreign owned entity within the QFC. The QFC is also available to Qatari investors, and they can enjoy benefits similar to those awarded under the State Tax Law (i.e. exemption from CIT), provided the business is 90% Qatari owned.
The QFC also offers the possibility for investors to set up special purpose companies for the purpose of a transaction or a series of transactions. There is a streamlined and quicker process for setting up such vehicles, which are also not subject to the same corporate compliance obligations as the other QFC entities.
In addition, single-family offices can be incorporated in the QFC for the sole purpose of providing services to and carrying on activities in relation to a 'single family' (i.e. investment and financial activities or services, arranging or providing custodian of fiduciary services). The single family must have a minimum of investable or liquid assets of USD 5 million and must be under the management of a single family.
### Tax environment
The key features of the QFC tax environment are as follows:
  * Unregulated QFC LLCs with a minimum 90% Qatari ownership benefit from a 0% concessionary CIT rate.
  * Low general CIT rate of 10% on locally sourced profits.
  * Extensive tax exemptions for qualifying activities, dividends, and capital gains.
  * No WHT on payments from Qatar.
  * Access to Qatar’s DTT network with over 60 jurisdictions.
  * VAT may be introduced in the future, but is currently not applicable.
  * No PIT for expatriate employees.
  * Online tax administration system.
  * Advance ruling services providing QFC entities with a high degree of certainty.
  * Statutory protection for investors, whereby QFC tax authority must review tax returns within 12 months of filing.
  * Group loss relief available.
  * No tax exemption for profits of Qatari partners in joint ventures where the Qatari ownership is less than 90%.


### ‘Local source’ income definition
If certain conditions are met, profits derived by a QFC non-regulated entity from the provision of services for use outside Qatar would not form a part of local source taxable profits and would not be subject to tax.
## Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
To implement FATCA in Qatar, Qatar and the US government concluded a Model 1B Inter-governmental Agreement (IGA) in 2015.
Financial institutions based in Qatar should not be subject to a 30% WHT on their US-source income, provided they meet the requirements established by the Agreement.
Qatar Central Bank (QCB) Regulated Financial Institutions are required to provide the information to the QCB FATCA Unit. The information should be further transferred to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) through the Ministry of Finance.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
On 10 November 2017, Qatar signed the CRS Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (CRS MCAA) re-confirming its commitment to implement the automatic exchange of financial account information pursuant to the OECD / G20 CRS in time to commence the exchanges in 2018.
This instrument is an automatic exchange of information regime that obligates reporting financial institutions to report on certain account holders on an annual basis. In September 2020, the GTA amended the sanctions for non-compliance.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 03 April 2024
CIT is levied on a company's Qatar-source income. Some examples of Qatar-source income include the following:
  * Income derived from an activity carried on in Qatar.
  * Income derived from contracts wholly or partially performed in Qatar.
  * Income from real estate situated in Qatar, including income from the sale of shares of companies with assets consisting of mainly real estate situated in Qatar.
  * Income from shares in companies resident in Qatar.


## Inventory valuation
Inventory must be valued in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
## Capital gains
Any chargeable gains on the sale of capital assets are taxed as ordinary income. Specific rules exist in respect of gains realised on the disposal of real estate. Capital gains generated by non-residents are an area of increased focus for the GTA.
Under the Regulations, capital gains tax returns should be submitted within 30 days from the sale of the asset or concluding the contract, whichever is earlier.
## Dividend income
Dividends are not taxable in Qatar if received from profits that have been subject to Qatar tax or from companies that are exempt from Qatar tax. However, any dividend received by a Qatari entity from a foreign entity that is not linked to a PE of the Qatari entity is taxable in the State of Qatar.
## Interest income
Interest arising in Qatar and bank interest realised outside Qatar, if it results from the taxpayer’s activity in Qatar, are taxed as ordinary income. In addition, any interest received by a Qatari entity from a foreign entity that is not linked to a PE of the Qatari entity is taxable in the State of Qatar.
## Royalty income
Royalty income is taxed as ordinary income.
## Foreign income
On 2 February 2023, Qatar published Law No. 11 of 2022, amending several provisions of the Tax Law in the official Gazette.
The amendments have preserved the overarching principle of taxing income arising from sources in Qatar. However, the amendments specify various types of income generated outside Qatar that will now be subject to income tax in Qatar. This includes income generated from real estate, immovable property, dividends, royalties, interest, and technical service fees, as long as such categories of income are not attributable to a foreign PE of the Qatari Project.
There is also an indication that income derived by a Qatari Project from a broad range of services provided outside Qatar (e.g. marketing services, procurement and financial intermediation services, fees paid to obtain guarantees or similar financial support, communication services, broadcasting services) will now be subject to income tax in Qatar.


# Qatar
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 03 April 2024
An entity that is wholly or partially foreign owned and that derives income from sources in Qatar is taxable in Qatar. In the case of a joint venture, the tax liability of the joint venture is dependent upon the foreign partners’ share of the joint venture's profit. Currently, no corporate income tax (CIT) is levied on a corporate entity that is wholly owned by Qatari nationals and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nationals that are resident in Qatar.
Unless specifically exempt from tax, an entity will be taxable in Qatar if it has generated Qatar-source income, regardless of the place of its incorporation.
Taxable income generally is subject to a flat (CIT) rate of 10%, with certain exceptions available.
The following tax rates apply in the specific circumstances noted:
  * If a special agreement was reached with the government of Qatar prior to 1 January 2010, the rate specified in the agreement continues to apply. If no rate is specified in the agreement, a rate of 35% will be used.
  * The rate applied with respect to oil operations, as defined in Law No. 3 of 2007, may not be less than 35%.
  * Payments made to non-residents with respect to certain service activities not connected with a PE in Qatar are subject to WHTs (_see the_ _section_).


  * In addition to the above, fully owned subsidiaries of listed entities are now taxable to the extent of non-exempt ownership (i.e. foreign or non-exempt Qatari / GCC ownership). Previously, there was a perception amongst taxpayers that such subsidiaries were tax exempt.


## Local income taxes
There are no local, state, or provincial government taxes on income in Qatar.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
Currently, Qatar imposes no VAT or sales tax on operations in Qatar. However, the introduction of VAT in Qatar under a common GCC framework is expected to be introduced in the near future. The anticipated tax rate is 5%.
## Customs duties
Customs duties are applied to goods with an origin outside the GCC countries, normally at a rate of 5%. Higher rates sometimes apply for specific types of goods, such as tobacco products. Import exemptions are sometimes available.
In March 2020, the State of Qatar issued a COVID-19 response package including customs duties exemptions for food and medical goods for a period of six months, provided that this is reflected in the selling price to the consumer.
## Excise taxes
Qatar has introduced excise tax from 1 January 2019. Excise tax is applicable on the following goods ('excise goods') at their respective tax rates:
  * Tobacco products: 100%.
  * Carbonated drinks (non-flavoured aerated water excluded): 50%.
  * Energy drinks: 100%.
  * Special purpose goods: 100%.


Special purpose goods are understood to include alcohol and pork items, and excise tax is currently applied on them. Persons engaged in the import and export of excise goods, as well as the operation of a tax warehouse, will be required to register for excise tax purposes.
In November 2022, the Ministry of Finance issued the Ministerial Decision No. 12 2022 on excise tax refund, providing a list of additional cases of refund of excise tax paid on excisable goods released for consumption but not consumed in Qatar. These cases include damaged, lost, or stolen excise goods and excise goods that are sold locally but are intended to be consumed outside Qatar (e.g. goods to be sold in the duty-free shops, on-board consumption).
## Property taxes
There are no property taxes in Qatar. However, fees may be payable to the government by the owner on the registration of property and by the landlord on the registration of leases.
## Transfer taxes
There are no transfer taxes in Qatar. However, share transfers of state entities require a formal ‘No Objection Confirmation’ from the General Tax Authority prior to the transfer being updated in the commercial register.
## Stamp taxes
There are no stamp taxes in Qatar.
## Payroll taxes
Employed individuals' salaries, wages, and allowances are not subject to personal income tax (PIT) in Qatar.
## Social security contributions
Employers have to pay social insurance in respect of Qatari employees but have no obligations for employees of other nationalities.
