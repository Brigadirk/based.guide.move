## Double taxation relief
Any person ordinarily resident in Gibraltar who is liable to pay tax in Gibraltar in respect of income also taxed abroad is eligible to claim double taxation relief in respect of the tax paid abroad. On furnishing evidence of the payment made abroad, the claimant is entitled to a credit equivalent to the lesser of the:
  * tax payable on that income in Gibraltar or
  * tax payable or paid abroad in respect of the same income.


If relief from the double taxation is given abroad, the relief then given in Gibraltar is reduced accordingly.
A claim for double taxation relief has to be made within the six years after the end of the year of assessment to which it relates. The time limit is extended where any adjustment or assessment made in Gibraltar or abroad renders any relief previously given excessive or insufficient. In those circumstances, a claim may be made within the six years after the adjustment or assessment.
## Spain Tax Agreement
On 4 March 2019, an International Tax Agreement between the United Kingdom (which retains constitutional responsibility for Gibraltar’s external relations) and the Kingdom of Spain was signed, which entered into force on 4 March 2021.
The Tax Agreement principally seeks to improve cooperation in the field of taxation and assist in the resolution of disputes as to the proper tax residence of companies and individuals where their place of residence between Gibraltar and Spain may be in issue.
The Agreement also provides for Gibraltar to keep legislation equivalent with EU law on matters related to transparency, administrative cooperation, harmful tax practises, and Anti-Money Laundering after Gibraltar has left the European Union.
## UK Tax Agreement
On 1 October 2019, the United Kingdom government and the government of Gibraltar signed a Double Taxation Agreement based on the OECD Model Tax Convention with the purpose of eliminating double taxation with respect to taxes on income and capital and preventing tax evasion and avoidance.

## Budget summary
Below is a summary of the key taxation changes to existing legislation as a result of the Chief Minister’s and Minister for Taxation's budget speeches in July 2024.
### Personal tax rates
The tax rates on all bands under both the Allowance Based System and Gross Income Based System will reduce by 1% for individuals with gross assessable income not exceeding 100,000 British pounds (GBP) _per annum_.
Tax rates will reduce by 2% for individuals with gross assessable income exceeding GBP 100,000 _per annum_.
The reduction is a reversal of tax rate increases announced in the Chief Minister’s Budget in June 2022, where he announced the rates increased temporarily by 2%.
### Taxation on the profits or gains derived from property sales 
The Minister for Taxation announced a new tax measure under which any entity or person who holds an interest in three or more residential properties will be subject to tax on the gain upon disposal of any of the properties. Specified properties are exempt from this measure, including properties used as the primary residence of the beneficial owner and in an estate of a deceased person.
Anti-avoidance measures will be implemented where any individuals undertaking professional conveyancing activities on behalf of another will have a reporting obligation to notify the Income Tax Office.
### Home purchaser allowances 
First- and second-time home purchaser allowances are now restricted to properties under GBP 800,000.
A first-time home purchaser allowance has been introduced for those selling after the age of 65 and moving to smaller properties.
### Stamp duty
It was confirmed that the special stamp duty introduced previously in respect of sales of government affordable homes will not apply to sales after an acquisition of an affordable home on the open market.
New purchase agreements and assignments of off-plan purchases will be registrable instruments with a 0.5% special stamp duty payable on Assignment of Purchase Agreement (by the assignor). This will not include sales on subsidised estates.
### Import duty
The following measures relating to import duty were announced:
  * Mild hybrid electric vehicles (MHEVs) will pay import duty at the rate of 10% (previously 0%).
  * Full hybrids and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) will pay import duty at the rate of 5% (previously 0%).
  * Pleasure crafts will pay import duty at the rate of 5% (previously 0%). The cap will be fixed at 35,000 British pounds (GBP) as it is for vehicles.
  * The above duty increases will not apply to importations where the vehicle/vessel was ordered before 30 September this year, even if delivered after.


### Statutory minimum wage
The statutory hourly minimum wage increased from GBP 8.60 to GBP 8.90 (a 3.5% increase) from 1 July 2024.
### Green procurement 
A tax deduction of an additional 50% in respect of any cost or expense of achieving net zero is available. This is subject to the Commissioner of Income Tax considering the deduction reasonable and directly associated with achieving the net zero objective. The deduction will be capped at a maximum of GBP 10,000 _per annum_.
### Living accommodation exemption
The Minister for Taxation announced a review of the accommodation exemption per Schedule 7 of the Income Tax Act 2010. The review will include changing the seven-year exemption period, the Minister noting that the average stay of employees relocating to Gibraltar is not beyond three to four years. In addition, the review will seek to implement flexibility in allowing an employee to continue using the exemption when changing the address or employment during the applicable period. 
### Student exemption
A clarification was announced regarding the tax status of full-time students in part-time employment. Income received by full-time students in part-time employment will continue to be tax-exempt, albeit the Income Tax Office will apply a tax-exempt threshold of GBP 11,450. As such, employment income above the threshold will be subject to income tax.
Notwithstanding, this does not change the other criteria by which students are tax-exempt.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
Income tax is charged on income accruing in or derived from Gibraltar. The 'accrued in and derived from' principle is softened for individuals who carry out activities in Gibraltar for a period of less than 30 days in aggregate during the year of assessment, so that such individuals will be reimbursed for taxes paid on the income from their activities in Gibraltar.
Income tax is also charged on certain income accruing in, derived from, or received in any place other than Gibraltar by any person ordinarily resident in Gibraltar.
## Personal income tax rates
Individuals have the choice of being taxed under either an Allowances Based System or under a Gross Income Based System and will be assessed under the system that results in the lower tax.
### Allowances Based System
Under the Allowances Based System, the individual will be taxed on their income less allowances (_see the_ _section_). For the 2024/25 tax year, the applicable tax rates are:
Taxable income | Rate of tax (%)   
---|---  
First GBP 4,000 | 14  
Next GBP 12,000 | 17  
Balance | 39  
Persons whose taxable income does not exceed GBP 11,450 _per annum_ are exempt from tax.
A tapering relief is available for individuals whose taxable income is between GBP 11,451 and GBP 19,500.
### Gross Income Based System
Under the Gross Income Based System, the applicable income bands and tax rates for the 2024/25 tax year are as follows for income up to GBP 25,000:
Taxable income | Rate of tax (%)  
---|---  
First GBP 10,000 | 6  
Next GBP 7,000 | 20  
Balance | 28  
The income bands and tax rates for income above GBP 25,000 are:
Taxable income | Rate of tax (%) (gross assessable income GBP 100,000 or less)  
---|---  
First GBP 17,000 | 16  
Next GBP 8,000 | 19  
Next GBP 15,000 | 25  
Next GBP 65,000 | 28  
Remainder of assessable income | 25  
Persons under the Gross Income Based System may also benefit from a deduction from their assessable income (_see the section_).

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
## Taxable period
The taxable period for individuals runs from 1 July, or the commencement of the source of income (if later), to 30 June in the year of assessment.
## Tax returns
Individuals are required to file returns and calculate their tax liability for the year. The return, together with the estimated liability, needs to be accompanied by payment of the tax due.
The due date for filing is 30 November. Individuals liable to tax or having assessable income for a year of assessment must make a full and complete return of their income for that year by 30 November immediately following the end of that year of assessment. Failure to submit a return by this date will result in a GBP 50 fine, which will increase by a further GBP 300 after three months. If the failure continues beyond six months, an additional penalty of GBP 500 is payable.
## Payment of tax
For employees, the collection of tax is initially through a pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system. Every employer paying emoluments to an employee is required to deduct a specified amount of tax from the amount of emoluments.
At the end of the year of assessment, the employer is obligated to make a return of the employees' emoluments and tax deducted together with the payment of any outstanding tax.
Where the source of income is not collected under the PAYE system, individuals are required to make two payments on account, on 31 January and 30 June, in each year of assessment based on the previous year's assessment. Each payment should be equal to 50% of the previous year's tax payable. The balance of tax due (i.e. the actual liability less payments on account) is due on the date of filing of the return.
Late payment will result in a penalty of 10% of the amount of tax due. This will increase to 20% after a further 90 days.

## Allowance Based System: Personal allowances and deductions
### Allowance Based System allowances
Personal relief is granted on submission of a claim to the tax office when applying for a tax code under the Allowance Based System (_see the section_). The main allowances (which are reduced by 1/12 for each complete calendar month that the individual is not resident in Gibraltar during the year of assessment) for the 2024/25 tax year are as follows:
Allowance | GBP  
---|---  
Personal allowance | 3,455  
Spouse | 3,455  
One parent family | 5,800  
Child | 1,190

Additional home purchase allowance (2) | 4,000

Mortgage interest (4) | 100%  
Notes:
  1. This is a one-off allowance.

  4. Interest payable on a loan to acquire a Gibraltar property to be used as a taxpayer’s principle residence is allowable on loans up to a value of GBP 350,000. Loan arrangements entered into before 1 July 2008 are eligible for relief on 100% of the loan as long as the loan continues to be secured on the current property and is in the name of the current borrower. The interest on these loans are subject to ‘tapered grandfathering’, whereby the relief on the amount of the loan in excess of GBP 350,000 will be reduced by 1/10 _perannum_.
