In the case of other activities, or where the paying company is located in a tax haven, other rates would apply.
## Local income taxes 
There are no local income taxes to be paid in Chile, only central government taxes.

## Tax returns
Yearly tax returns need not be filed if the employee receives only salary income paid from one employer. If taxable income from another source is received, such as interest income, and/or if the individual wants to claim certain tax benefits, a yearly tax return should be filed.
## Payment of tax
In case of employees, there is a mandatory monthly withholding by the employer, as long as the compensation is paid by a local employer. If the compensation is not paid by a local company, the employee has the personal liability to declare, withhold, and pay the monthly tax.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
## Employment expenses
Resident foreigners are taxed on their salary, deducting social security contributions. Non-resident foreigners cannot deduct social security contributions before acquiring Chilean residence.
In general, all expenses incurred that are in the employer’s sole interest are duly deductible. Among these are travel and lodging expenses and documented entertainment. No blanket or standard deductions, such as representation allowances, are allowed for dependant employees.
## Personal deductions
### Mortgage interest expenses
Individuals resident in Chile may deduct from their respective taxable base the amount of the interest paid for mortgage loans destined to the purchase or construction of one or more dwellings. The annual deduction may not exceed 8 annual tax units; this limit is proportionally reduced according to the taxpayer’s income. The deduction is reduced to zero for taxpayers who have an annual income greater than 150 annual taxable units. The deduction should be claimed on the annual tax return (form 22).
### Voluntary pension contributions (APV)
A deduction can be taken for APV, up to a monthly limit of 50 UF or annual limit of 600 UF for resident employees. In the case of a dependent worker, such savings can be made monthly if the contribution is deducted by the employer or annually if the worker pays it directly to an authorised institution. In this situation, the worker should claim the deduction on the annual tax return (form 22). In practice, this contribution may only be made if the employee contributes to the ordinary Chilean Pension Scheme.
If the employee decides to withdraw one’s contribution, such amount will be provisionally taxed at a 15% rate, which will be used as a credit against the tax to be paid, which will be calculated considering the amount withdrawn and other incomes earned during the same year.
As of 1 January 2017, this tax benefit for individuals is eliminated due to the Tax Reform.

## Employment income
Items such as reimbursements of travel expenses and housing provided in the employer’s sole interest, moving expenses, and a reasonable relocation allowance are considered non-taxable income and are excluded from the tax calculation.
Items such as cost-of-living allowance, area allowances, car allowance, vacation travel expenses, and utilities are taxable.
## Capital gains
There is no capital gains tax in Chile. Capital gains are taxed as normal income unless they are qualified by law as non-taxable income.
Certain gains on the sale of traded shares of Chilean corporations are tax exempted.
## Dividend income
Dividend income is taxed as normal income.
## Interest income
In the case of interest, only ’real interest’ (i.e. interest effectively paid less cost-of-living increase) is taxed as normal income.
## Exempt income
Specific tax treatment of exemption could be applied for share sales, dividends, mutual funds withdrawals, voluntary pension contributions (APV) withdrawals, and other capital gains obtained by a resident if the employee has only obtained dependant salary income.
As of 1 January 2017, the Tax Reform eliminates all benefits established under Article 57 bis of the Chilean Income Tax Law.
However, as of 1 October 2014, new Article 54 bis of the Chilean Income Tax Law is in force, providing a series of benefits that encourage savings by individuals, as it provides that the profits obtained due to the investment in certain securities are not subject to taxation as long as they (i) are not withdrawn, (ii) continue invested in such instruments or are reinvested in instruments of the same type, and (iii) other requirements are met.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
Domicile is defined as physical presence with the intent to remain in the country. Residence is mere physical presence.
Residence for tax purposes is acquired upon remaining six consecutive months in the country in one calendar year, or more than six months, whether consecutive or not, in two consecutive calendar years. If domicile is acquired before residence and the intention is to stay in Chile permanently or for a significant period of time, normal taxation applies as of the date of entry into the country.

## Social security contributions
Foreign individuals may be exempt from some local social security payments, provided they belong to a foreign social security entity system covering at least pension, disability, illness, and death. If not exempt, salaries are subject to Chilean social security contribution of 20%, computed on the monthly salary capped at 75.7  _unidades de fomento_ (UF, which is a determined amount of Chilean pesos duly adjusted for inflation on a daily basis), which is approximately USD 3,048.65 per month, deductible for tax purposes as well.
Additionally, there are necessary contributions, not covered by the exemption mentioned above, of 3% in connection with unemployment insurance (0.6% contributed by the employee and 2.4% contributed by the employer) with a cap of UF 113.5 (approximately USD 4,570.96) and insurance that covers labour accidents and professional illness. The latter amount payable is calculated by taking into consideration the activities developed by the company and the duties of the employees.
In practice, non-residents normally are not subject to social security contributions in Chile.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is payable on transfers and services at a rate of 19%. _See the section in the Corporate summary for more information_.
