## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
## Foreign tax relief
If a double tax treaty (DTT) exists, double taxation is usually avoided by exempting the foreign income with progression. Foreign income taxes can only be credited against German income tax if a tax credit is provided in the applicable DTT or a DTT does not exist. A tax credit is only possible up to the amount of German income taxes on the specific foreign income.
## Tax treaties
German national income tax law has been modified and superseded by various tax treaties with foreign countries to ensure that income is not taxed by more than one country. Germany has concluded DTTs, applicable for income taxes, with nearly 90 countries, amongst them most of the industrialised countries. However, DTTs have not been concluded with, for example, Brazil and Hong Kong. The DTT with the United Arab Emirates expired on 31 December 2021 and has not been renewed.
Germany currently has double-taxation agreements with the below mentioned countries:

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
## Social security contributions
As of 1 January 2024, the income ceiling for mandatory pension insurance has increased from 87,600 euros (EUR) to EUR 90,600 (EUR 89,400 in the new federal states). The adjustment of the contribution ceiling is also applicable to unemployment insurance.
Additionally, the income ceiling for mandatory health and long-term care insurance in 2025 has increased to EUR 5,512.50 per month (EUR 66,150 per year).
The 2025 contribution rate to German state unemployment insurance will remain 2.6% compared to 2024. The rate for pension insurance is 18.6%. The contribution rate to the health insurance system is fixed at 14.6% and the rate for nursery care insurance at 3.4%. All mentioned rates are shared equally between employer and employee.
## COVID-19 reliefs
A number of COVID-19 relief measures were enacted in 2020. The maximum amount of loss carryback for income tax purposes was increased to EUR 10 million (single filing) / EUR 20 million (married filing) for tax years 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. In 2024, the amount limits were returned to the legal status prior to 2020 of EUR 10 million to EUR 1 million (single filing) / of EUR 20 million to EUR 2 million (married filing).
A home office lump sum expense of EUR 6 per day for a maximum of 210 days per calendar year may be claimed for tax purposes in 2023, 2024, and 2025. The limit for the entire year of EUR 1,260 can also be applied as a flat rate for a full year of home office. Deadline changes due to COVID-19 are only applicable for the submission of the 2023 and 2024 income tax returns. If a tax advisor is instructed, the deadline for tax return 2024 is 30 April 2026 (without a tax advisor, the submission deadline is 31 July 2025).
## Property tax
As the current system of the property tax has been declared unconstitutional by the German Federal Constitutional Court, property tax will be levied on the basis of the new law from 1 January 2025 onwards. The property tax reform of 2025 replaces the previous unconstitutional system from 1935/1964 with a new valuation model that takes into account the current value of the property. From 2025, new assessment rates will apply, and property tax notices will be based on the new valuations. The reform leads to individual shifts in the tax burden but aims to keep the overall tax revenue constant.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
All resident individuals are taxed on their worldwide income. Non-resident individuals are taxed (in case of investment and employment income usually by withholding) on German source income only.
Taxable income covers income from the following categories:
  * Agriculture and forestry.
  * Trade or business.
  * Independent professions.
  * Employment.
  * Capital investment.
  * Rents and royalties.
  * Other income (as defined by tax law).


### Net income
Net income is based on all gross earnings received during a calendar year and reduced by income related expenses during the same period for each of the above categories. Losses from one of the seven basic income categories (except capital investment) can fully be offset against positive income from another income category (exceptions for 'other income' may apply).
### Taxable income
The total income after deductions in each category, which may be further reduced by lump-sum deductions or, within limits, by actual payment for special expenses defined by tax law, represents the taxable income.
## Personal income tax rates
Germany has progressive tax rates ranging as follows (2025 tax year):
Taxable income range for single taxpayers (EUR) | Taxable income range for married taxpayers (EUR) | Tax rate (%)  
---|---|---  
Over | Not over | Over | Not over  
0 | 12,096 | 0 | 24,192 | 0  
12,096 | 68,429 | 24,192 | 136,858 | 14 to 42*  
68,430 | 277,825 | 136,860 | 555,650 | 42  
277,826 | and above | 555,652 | and above | 45  
* Geometrically progressive rates start at 14% and rise to 42%.
The figures are adjusted on a regular basis.
## Surcharges on income tax
To improve the economic situation and infrastructure for certain regions in need, the German government has been levying a 5.5% solidarity surcharge tax. The surcharge is imposed as a percentage on all individual income taxes.
As of 1 January 2021, the application of the solidarity surcharge tax has been substantially reduced. In general, no solidarity surcharge is levied any longer for individuals filing separately and having an income tax burden of not more than EUR 19,950 (approximately equivalent to a taxable income of EUR 73,463) as well as for married filing jointly taxpayers with an income tax burden of not more than EUR 39,900 (approximately equivalent to a taxable income of EUR 146,926). Where the aforementioned thresholds are exceeded, a sliding scale is used so that the top 5.5% solidarity surcharge would eventually only apply in full for individuals filing separately and having a taxable income of approximately EUR 105,500 or married filing jointly and having a taxable income of approximately EUR 211,000. The full rate of solidarity surcharge is applied on capital investment income subject to lump sum taxation and on employment income taxed at lump sum rates. The figures are adjusted on a regular basis.
Members of officially recognised churches pay church tax as a surcharge on their income tax. The rates are either 8% or 9% of the income tax, depending on the federal state where the individual resides.
## Trade income tax
Trade income tax is levied on business income, whereas for individuals and partnerships a tax-free amount of EUR 24,500 has to be considered (i.e. not for corporations).
The respective municipality is responsible for the final tax assessment. The rate fixed by the municipality ('_Hebesatz_ ') is for larger cities between approximately 250% and 580% of the basic amount, which is 3.5% of the business income.
## Local and state income taxes
There are no local or state income taxes levied in Germany.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Married couples file joint returns unless they are legally separated or one spouse requests otherwise. Annual returns must be filed by 31 July of the year following the tax year. The filing deadline expires on 28 (29) February of the second year following the tax year if the income tax return is prepared by a certified tax adviser. For the 2023 income tax returns, the deadline is 2 September 2024 (2 June 2025 if tax advisor is instructed).
There is no self-assessment. The tax office issues a final assessment notice after having reviewed the income tax return.
A non-resident taxpayer will have to file a return and receive an assessment only if the German income is not subject to wage tax withholding. Where income is subject to wage tax withholding, the income tax liability is normally settled through the withholding system and no returns or assessments are required. However, there is a tax filing obligation with progression effect for non-resident taxpayers who benefited from the so-called 'one-fifth' rule in payroll on multi-year income (e.g. long-term incentive payments) or on severance payments.
## Payment of tax
In general, taxes are payable within one month of the date that the final assessment is issued. Tax on wages and salaries is withheld at source. The same applies for capital investment income with domestic banks. The amounts withheld are treated as a payment on account of the final income tax liability. If taxpayers have additional income not subject to withholding, they will usually be asked to make quarterly instalments. Assessed quarterly instalments are due on 10 March, 10 June, 10 September, and 10 December.
A self-employed person must prepay income tax that will be offset on filing an annual return. The advance payment is determined on the basis of the return made for the previous year. In the event of a new business, the advance will be calculated on the basis of estimates made by the owner of the business. The advance payment is made on the dates mentioned above.
## Tax audit process
The supreme tax authority in Germany is the Federal Ministry of Finance (_Bundesministerium der Finanzen_), whereas the taxpayer usually deals with the local tax offices. Employees are usually not audited as the annual income tax return is already subject to review (all income tax returns are subject to an internal review with the tax authorities prior to issuing the tax assessment). However, employees with income exceeding EUR 500,000 per year might be subject to additional audits.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitation for income tax returns usually amounts to four years. An extension up to five years is possible in cases of tax evasion or up to ten years in cases of tax fraud, with even longer periods for criminal prosecution. Further prescriptions have to be considered regarding the start date and suspension of the statute of limitation.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Tax authorities in the meanwhile focus on international mobile employees and assignees. Specific forms within the annual income tax return have to be filed to provide the tax office with more detailed information about the assignment.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
## Employment expenses
Various properly documented and necessarily incurred income related expenses may be deducted by an individual unless they are, in cases of employment relationship, reimbursed by the employer.
For employees, common tax deductions include:
  * costs of travelling to and from work
  * business literature
  * professional dues, and
  * work equipment.


Starting from the assessment period 2023, employees who have switched to remote work are allowed to deduct EUR 6 for each calendar day working from home, whereby the total sum is limited to EUR EUR 1,260 per calendar year and thus the limit of days to be claimed is 210.
There is a blanket employee allowance for business deductions of EUR 1,230 per year. To the extent actual employment connected expenses exceed the lump sum of EUR 1,230, they are deductible if they can be substantiated.
## Personal deductions
### Alimony payments
Individual taxpayers may take deductions up to EUR 13,805 for the alimony paid to a divorced partner.
### Charitable contributions
Contributions to German charities and certain international charities are deductible up to 20% of adjusted gross income. Church tax is also fully deductible.
### Childcare expenses
Fulfilling certain requirements, a portion of the actual expenses for childcare can be deducted up to a maximum of EUR 4,000 (EUR 4,800 as of 2025) per year/child for children younger than 14 years or for handicapped children.
### Education expenses
30% of tuition fees (except for housing, care, and food) for qualifying dependent children is deductible if a recognised private school located in the EU/EEA countries or a German school is attended and if graduation is approved by the government. The special expenses that can be claimed are limited to EUR 5,000 _per annum_ per child.
### Social security contributions
Social security contributions and insurance premiums can be deducted up to specified limits, as follows.
#### Health insurance and long-term care contributions
Contributions to health insurance are completely tax deductible as far as these contributions are paid for primary basic healthcare. Contributions to long-term care insurance are also tax deductible under these circumstances.
#### Unemployment insurance contributions
Additionally, contributions paid to certain other insurance policies (e.g. unemployment insurance) can be deducted up to a maximum of EUR 2,800 per year (EUR 1,900 for employees and pensioners). This only applies if these amounts have not already been utilised for health and long-term care insurance contributions.
#### Pension scheme contributions
In 2024, contributions to old-age pension schemes are tax deductible up to an overall limit of EUR 27,566 (EUR 55,132 for married taxpayers filing jointly). For a transitional period (2005 to 2023), only a reduced amount could be deducted. In 2022, the tax deduction amounted to 94% of the actual contributions, at a maximum of 94% of EUR 25,639 (EUR 51,278), and increased to 100% in 2023. For employees contributing to the state pension scheme, the deductible amount was reduced by contributions paid by the employer to the state pension scheme, as those contributions were already tax exempt under the income tax act.
### Mortgage deduction
Mortgage interest is only deductible against income from the property (i.e. not deductible for privately used property).
## Standard deductions
A lump sum special expense deduction totalling EUR 36 for a single person or EUR 72 for married couples is provided without need for proof. Furthermore, there are also a number of other specific allowances and reliefs, for example, for children, the elderly and the disabled.
## Personal allowances
Deductions are allowed for extraordinary burdens such as:
  * Subsistence for parents and children with low income (documentary evidence of low income is required) if entitled by law. The maximum deduction is EUR 11,604 (EUR 12,096 for 2025) and may be reduced by the standard of living of the country and the personal income situation of the beneficiaries.
  * Deductions for children who are being educated in Germany or abroad (within limitations), who are older than 18, and living outside the parents' household amounting to EUR 1,200 per year. If the child lives abroad, the amount may be reduced by the standard of living of the appropriate country.
  * Further deductions may be granted, for example, for handicapped family members and expenses for household help.


The allowances shown below are deductible in computing taxable income.
Per year / per taxpayer | EUR  
---|---  
Employee's allowance | 1,230  
Investor's allowance (for interest, dividends, and capital gains) | 1,000  
Social security allowance | variable  
Lump sum special expense deduction | 36  
Child allowance - per child registered in Germany and per parent | 4,800  
## Business deductions
Fixed assets and intangibles are subject to depreciation or amortisation.
For businesses common tax deductions are:
  * interest expenses
  * personnel expenses
  * operating materials, and
  * work equipment.


## Losses
Losses not offset in the year in which they occur can either be carried back to the previous year up to EUR 1 million (for 2020 until 2023 this amount was increased to EUR 10 million) or carried forward to future years indefinitely, whereby in the latter case an amount of EUR 1 million can be offset fully per year and a loss carryforward exceeding EUR 1 million can only be used within detailed thresholds per year. For married taxpayers filing jointly, the mentioned amounts are doubled.

## Individual - Other issues
Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
## Immigration and work permit
If foreign nationals shall become employed with or assigned to a German branch or subsidiary, German immigration law requirements have to be observed. The requirements have to be checked in each individual case from an immigration expert.
Generally, EU nationals do not need a German work permit. Foreign nationals of non-EU member states intending to work in Germany need a work and residence permit, which is regularly granted as an electronic permit (so-called '_elektronischer Aufenthaltstitel_ ').
Some nationals are privileged (US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Japan, Israel), and they do not need to apply for a visa when entering Germany for working purposes. They can directly apply for their German work and residence permit in Germany within a certain time after entrance. However, they are not allowed to start working before they have registered their German address and at least a preliminary permit is issued by the immigration office. 
All other nationalities (Visa-nationals) have to apply for an entry visa for working purposes (D-Visa) at the Germany embassy/consulate in the country where one officially resides abroad.
German immigration law provides various different work permit types, depending on the type of employment (assignment vs. local hire), salary level, qualification of the employee, nationality etc. Germany also implemented the EU Blue Card for high qualified individuals and the ICT (Intra-Corporate-Transfer) Card for third country nationals.

# Germany
## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
## Employment income
Salaries paid under the German payroll are subject to wage tax, which is withheld by the employer and credited against the final annual income tax charge. Account is taken of the personal situation by the application of certain tax classes and certain deductions are applied.
Salaries that are paid by a foreign employer (who does not have a permanent establishment in Germany) but are recharged to the German company are also subject to wage tax withholding. The same applies for salary that is not actually recharged but should have been recharged under an arm's-length perspective. The German company is deemed to be the 'economic employer' and thus required to calculate and transfer the appropriate wage tax to the tax office on a monthly basis.
Salaries that are paid by a foreign employer and are neither charged to a German company nor should have been recharged under an arm's-length perspective to a German company are generally not subject to wage tax withholding. As with other income, tax for these employees is levied by assessment generally following the first annual return. Pension income is also taxable, subject to further allowances.
## Equity compensation
Stock options are basically taxable when exercised. Taxable income is computed at the time of exercising the option, normally as the difference between the market price of the shares and the exercise price. Tax exemption may be granted if during the period between grant and vesting employment was not performed in Germany and thus the employment income was not taxable in Germany. The stock option benefit is sourced based on workdays between grant and vesting.
Shares provided free of charge or at a low-price may be tax-free up to an amount of EUR 2,000 _per annum_ if certain conditions are fulfilled. This relief is granted for shares of the employing company and of the parent company controlling and consolidating its subsidiary.
A favourable tax rate may apply if the period between grant and exercise exceeds 12 months and if the employee is employed with the granting company at least for the first 12 months of this period. In the case of a limited taxpayer status, the application of the favourable tax rate in payroll leads to an individual income tax filing obligation for the non-resident taxpayer, including progression impact of otherwise tax-exempt income.
## Business income
Tax on net income from professional activities or from carrying on a trade or business is collected by assessment. Quarterly instalments might be assessed on an estimated basis by the tax authorities and credited against the final income tax burden.
## Capital gains
Capital gains from financial investments (e.g. sale of shares) are subject to a flat tax rate of 25% plus 5.5% solidarity surcharge (in total 26.375%, plus church tax if applicable), which is generally withheld at source automatically upon distribution of the gains. Related expenses cannot be deducted. Capital gains qualify for the 'investor's allowance' of EUR 1,000 per taxpayer and year for the total of all financial investment income. This amount is doubled in the case of married taxpayers filing jointly. Special rules apply on the taxation of capital gains from the sale of a significant interest in a corporation (1% or more).
Special partial tax exemptions apply on capital gains from the sale of mutual funds units, depending on the nature of the fund.
Other capital gains are taxable in Germany at individual progressive rates only if the sale is within one year (for movable assets) or ten years (for real property) after the purchase date. Since 2024, these capital gains are only taxable if the profit exceeds EUR 1,000 (previously EUR 600) per year in total. Further tax relief may be applicable under specific conditions if the property was used for private purposes.
## Exit tax
The German Foreign Tax Act contains regulations concerning an exit taxation for individuals if certain requirements are met. If the individual has been subject to unlimited tax liability in Germany for a certain time and holds at least 1% in a corporation as private asset, they could qualify for exit tax. The exit tax will be triggered in case the unlimited tax liability in Germany is terminated (e.g. in most cases due to relocation of the shareholder). As a result, the capital gain of a deemed sale of the shares will be taxed under German income tax regulations. The exit taxation could, in some cases, be avoided by appropriate structuring.
## Dividend income
Dividend income is subject to a flat tax rate of 25% plus 5.5% solidarity surcharge (in total 26.375%, plus church tax if applicable), which is basically withheld at source. Related expenses cannot be deducted. Dividend income qualifies for the annual investor's allowance of EUR 1,000 (previously EUR 801) per taxpayer for the total of all financial investment income. This amount is doubled in the case of married taxpayers filing jointly.
Special partial tax exemptions apply on distributions of mutual funds, depending on the nature of the fund.
Mutual funds retaining their profits can trigger deemed income to be taxed at the investor level even if no actual distributions are made. 
## Interest income
Interest income is subject to a flat tax rate of 25% plus 5.5% solidarity surcharge (in total 26.375%, plus church tax if applicable), which is basically withheld at source. Related expenses cannot be deducted. Interest income qualifies for the annual investor's allowance of EUR 1,000 (previously EUR 801) per taxpayer for the total of all financial investment income. This amount is doubled in the case of married taxpayers filing jointly.
Note that the investor's allowance is only provided one time for the total of interest and dividend income and capital gains.
## Rental income
Rents received less allowable expenses form part of taxable income. Under treaty provisions rental income from sources abroad is mostly exempt. Tax exemption with progression will be applicable if sources are not located within the EU/EEA.
## Exempt income
Employment income connected to special construction, engineering, or consulting work outside Germany, lasting at least three months, might be exempt if:
  * The employee works abroad for a German employer or an employer located in the European Union.
  * There is no tax treaty with the foreign country.

## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
## Child benefits
Depending on criteria like residency status, age of the children, and possibly social security status, qualifying families will receive a monthly child benefit for dependent children. In 2025, this amounts to EUR 255 (EUR 250 in 2024) per month for each child.
An additional child benefit supplement of up to EUR 292 can be applied for if the income is not sufficient to cover the child’s living expenses.
The mentioned benefits and bonus payments are offset against a potential tax relief from the lump sum deduction of the child allowance of EUR 4,800 in 2025 (EUR 4,770 in 2024) per parent when calculating the taxable income, so that only either the mentioned benefits and bonus payments are granted or the lump sum deduction of the child allowance. 
## Other tax credits and incentives
There are no other significant tax credits or incentives for individuals in Germany.


# Germany
## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
Generally, individuals are deemed to be resident:
  * if they have a dwelling in Germany that they use, or that is at least available to them (irrelevant if rented or owned – even a room at a friend’s house could be enough if always accessible), or
  * if they have an habitual abode in Germany. This can be assumed if the individual is physically present in Germany for more than six months in any one calendar year, or for a consecutive period of six months over a year-end.


Objective circumstances are decisive. Nationality is not, in itself, a criterion for determining residence or tax liability. Also, registration with the German (tax) authorities is only an indicator.
Where an international assignee has a residence in two or more countries, the employee is deemed, for application of a double tax treaty (DTT), to be a resident of the contracting state in which the employee has a centre of vital (personal and economical) interests.


# Germany
## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
## Social security contributions
The following social security contributions (as of January 2022) are levied on employment income. Employer contributions are generally tax-free.
  * Pension insurance: 18.6%, up to an income ceiling of EUR 84,600 annually (EUR 81,000 in the new federal states). A contribution of 9.3% each is borne by both the employer and the employee.
  * Unemployment insurance: 2.4%, up to an income ceiling of EUR 84,600 annually (EUR 81,000 in the new federal states). A contribution of 1.2% each is borne by both the employer and the employee.
  * Health insurance: 14.6%, up to an income ceiling of EUR 58,050 annually. A contribution of 7.3% each is borne by both the employer and the employee.
  * Long-term care insurance: 3.05% (3.4% for childless individuals, beginning with age 23), up to an income ceiling of EUR 58,050 annually. The contribution is borne 1.525% by the employer and 1.525% (1.875% for childless individuals, beginning with age 23) by the employee.
  * Work accident scheme depends on the industrial sector and the accident risk; these contributions are borne by the employer.
  * Insolvency contribution only payable by the employer amounts to 0.09%, up to the income ceiling of EUR 84,600 annually (EUR 81,000 in the new federal states).


An individual can apply for private health and long-term care insurance if certain conditions are met.
Self-employed individuals generally do not have to pay mandatory social security contributions.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
Proceeds of sales and services provided in Germany are subject to VAT under the common system of the European Union (EU) at the standard rate of 19% (7% on certain items, such as food and books). For an interim period between 1 July 2020 and 31 December 2020, the rates were reduced to 16% and 5%. An entrepreneurial taxpayer generally is entitled to deduct the VAT charged on input from that payable on output.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
At this point of time, no wealth taxes are levied in Germany.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Inheritance and gift tax is a tax levied on lifetime gifts and on transfers of value passing on death. This tax is imposed on transfers if testator/donor and/or heir/donee is a German tax resident. If no individual is involved who is resident in Germany under national tax rules, only the transfer of assets situated in Germany is liable. Tax benefits for business assets are possible.
Progressive tax rates of 7% up to 50% and tax-free amounts between EUR 20,000 and EUR 500,000 apply, depending on the value and the degree of the relationship between testator/donor and beneficiary. For the calculation of the tax, acquisitions within the last ten years are taken into account. The allowances are granted once every ten years. For a surviving spouse, an additional tax-free allowance of EUR 256,000 is granted. This allowance is reduced by the discounted value of any pension entitlements, which are not subject to inheritance tax. For surviving children, an additional tax-free allowance of up to EUR 52,000, depending on age at the time of inheritance, may apply. 
## Property tax
There is a local tax on real estate property. The respective municipality is responsible for the final tax assessment. As the current system of the property tax has been declared unconstitutional by the German Federal Constitutional Court, it can only be levied in its current form on a transitional basis until 31 December 2024. From 1 January 2025, property tax will then be levied on the basis of the new law. The property tax reform of 2025 replaces the previous unconstitutional system from 1935/1964 with a new valuation model that takes into account the current value of the property.
The property values are reassessed as part of this reform. Much of the data required for the revaluation of real property is not available to the tax authorities in electronically usable form, so that they had to be collected from the property owners. Even if the reform as a whole is designed to be revenue-neutral (i.e. all taxpayers do not pay more or less property tax), individual tax payments will change.
## Luxury taxes
There are no additional taxes on luxury goods in Germany.
## Real estate transfer tax
Real estate transfer tax is levied at 3.5% to 6.5% of the consideration on all conveyances of German property.
It is also levied on indirect transfers on acquisition of at least 90% of the shares (directly or indirectly) in property owning companies.
The tax is not levied on direct or indirect transfers without consideration in the course of a corporate reorganisation, under the laws of a member state of the European Economic Area (EEA), provided that at least 90% of the ultimate interest in the property remains unchanged for ten years before and after the transaction.
Tax exemptions are available, among others, for transfers between relatives in a direct line and transfers that are already subject to the German Inheritance and Gift Tax Act.
## Customs duties
Customs duties are levied under a common system on imports into the European Union, and the rates depend on various criteria. The basis is the import value of the goods. The European Commission also sets 'countervailing' duties from time to time on specific imports from specific countries in order to counter dumping attempts.
