## Tax Rules for Regional Headquarters (RHQs)
The Tax Rules for RHQs have been published by the Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority (ZATCA) with an immediate effect from the date of publishing (i.e. 16 February 2024).
The rules clarify several key matters to the tax and investment society, which includes the following, among others:
  * Key definitions regarding the RHQs.
  * Tax incentives.
  * Exemption duration and criteria.
  * Economic substance rules for the RHQs.
  * Tax compliance requirements.
  * Fines and penalties in case of violating the rules.
  * Rights of both ZATCA and the RHQ in case of tax audits and disputes.


### Tax incentives
RHQs meeting the qualification criteria shall be eligible to enjoy the following tax incentives:
  * 0% income tax on the qualifying income.
  * 0% withholding tax (WHT) on the payment made by the RHQ to non-residents, meeting any of the following criteria:


    * Payments of dividends.
    * Payments to related parties.
    * Payments to third parties for services necessary for the RHQ’s activities.


The WHT exemption shall not apply in any of the following cases:
  * If the payment made by the RHQ is related to non-qualifying activities.
  * In any of the tax evasion cases prescribed as per the RHQs Tax Rules.


Income derived by the RHQ from non-qualifying activities shall be treated according to the provisions of the relevant tax regulations in the Kingdom.
The provisions of the in-force treaties in Saudi and international obligations shall apply to the RHQs.
For purposes of all international treaties, conventions, or other agreements to which the Kingdom is party, RHQs are considered tax residents to the extent they meet the tax residency criteria according to Saudi Income Tax Law.
### **Duration of the tax incentives**
  * The tax incentives are applicable to the qualifying activities for renewable 30 years, starting from the date of obtaining the RHQ licence to carry out the qualifying activities.
  * The tax incentives shall expire on the earlier of:
    * The elapsing of the 30-years period.
    * The entity ceasing to be qualified as an RHQ for whatsoever reason.


## Amendments to Zakat and Income Tax By-Laws
His Excellency the Minister of Finance has approved the amendments to Zakat and Income Tax By-Laws, which have been published in the Official Gazette (Umm AlQura) on 12 September 2023 and entered into effect from that date.
The amendments cover the deductibility of expenses for taxpayers, the procedures of the tax and Zakat litigation process, and the WHT rates on inter-company transactions, among other amendments.
The importance of these amendments arises from their extended impact on non-resident taxpayers in Saudi with respect to their income derived from a source in Saudi, particularly through related parties and branches of foreign companies. 
## E-invoicing
On 28 May 2021, the ZATCA has published the e-invoicing resolution setting out the controls, requirements, technical specifications, and procedural rules covering the generation and integration phases, which includes value-added tax (VAT) invoices, debit notes, and credit notes. A detailed set of requirements and guidelines were also published.
The generation phase will be mandated from 4 December 2021, and the integration will be implemented in phases starting from 1 January 2023.
## Special tax rules for the Special Integrated Logistics Zone (ILBZ or 'the Zone')
The ILBZ is a special economic zone (SEZ) located adjacent to the King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) following the issuance of Royal Order (A/17) dated 10 October 2018.
The General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) has issued the Special Tax Rules (the 'Tax Bylaws') setting out the tax and customs incentives (and the associated conditions) that apply to entities established in the ILBZ to carry out specific activities.
The Tax Bylaws specify that, provided certain conditions can be met, ILBZ entities would be subject to corporate income tax (CIT) at 0% on the income earned from carrying on their specific activities for up to 50 years. Further, provided certain conditions can be met, ILBZ entities would also be exempt from deducting WHT on certain payments relating to the specific activities to non-residents.
From a customs perspective, goods imported into the ILBZ would be under a customs duty suspension arrangement. While these goods are under the customs duty suspension arrangement, transactions relating to these goods would be outside the scope of VAT in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Further guidance will be issued by the ZATCA to specify the conditions and the procedures that ILBZ entities will need to follow to access these tax and customs incentives.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 21 July 2024
## Taxable period
Tax filings are based on the company’s fiscal year.
## Tax returns
Returns are due to be filed with ZATCA within 120 days after the taxpayer’s year-end. The system is one of self-assessment.
According to the tax authority, companies that are owned by Saudis only, or by Saudis and non-Saudis, must file audited financial statements along with the tax return.
## Payment of tax
Final tax due must be paid within 120 days after the taxpayer's year-end.
Three equal advance tax payments are required to be made on the last day of the sixth, ninth, and 12th months for a current tax year, provided that the taxpayer has earned income during the year. Each advance payment is equal to 25% of the amount resulting from the taxpayer’s tax liability based on the previous year return minus the withheld tax on reported income, if any. The taxpayer is not required to make advance tax payments if the result of the said formula is less than SAR 500,000. Late payment of an advance payment is subject to a delay penalty of 1% of the amount due for every 30 days of delay.
## Tax audit process
There is no specific audit process followed by ZATCA; however, the most common ways for ZATCA to select companies for tax audits are the size of the company, the companies’ shareholders nationality (totally owned by foreigners and branches of foreign companies), and certain risk assessment measures.
ZATCA recently introduced what they call the 'risk engine', which is used to determine the companies that need to be audited. However, such engine has not been tested yet.
## Statute of limitations
ZATCA may, with a reasoned notification, make or amend a tax assessment within five years from the end of the deadline specified for filing the tax declaration for the taxable year, or, at any time, upon a written consent of the taxpayer.
ZATCA may make or amend an assessment within ten years of the deadline specified for filing the tax declaration for the taxable year if a taxpayer does not file its tax declaration or it is found that the declaration is incomplete or incorrect with the intent of tax evasion.
A taxpayer may request a refund of overpaid amounts at any time within five years from the end of the overpaid taxable year.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
ZATCA emphasises the reconciliation between the payroll as per the records of the General Organisation for Social Insurance (GOSI) (i.e. salaries and wages subject to GOSI) and salaries and wages charged to the taxpayer’s accounts duly certified by a Saudi licensed CPA.
ZATCA focuses on the payments made to non-resident parties to verify compliance with the WHT regulations by requesting a reconciliation statement for such payments with the annual WHT form.
ZATCA has also been requesting import value lists from the Customs Authority in order to confirm the value of goods imported and declared by taxpayers in their annual declarations during the financial period.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 21 July 2024
A company is considered a resident company if it is formed under the Saudi Arabian Regulations for Companies or if its central management is located in Saudi Arabia.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
According to the Saudi tax regulations, the following are the requirements for considering a non-resident party to have a PE:
  * A PE of a non-resident in Saudi Arabia, unless otherwise provided below, consists of the permanent place of activity of the non-resident through which one carries out business, in full or in part, including business carried out through an agent.
  * The following are considered a PE: 
    * Construction sites, assembly facilities, and the exercise of related supervisory activities.
    * Installations or sites used for surveying for natural resources, drilling equipment, or ships used for surveying for natural resources, and the exercise of related supervisory activities.
    * A fixed location where a non-resident natural person carries out business.
    * A branch of a non-resident company that is licensed to carry out business in Saudi Arabia.
  * A place is not considered a PE of a non-resident in Saudi Arabia if it is used in Saudi Arabia only to do the following: 
    * Store, display, or deliver goods or products belonging to the non-resident.
    * Keep an inventory of goods or products belonging to the non-resident only for the purposes of processing by another person.
    * Purchase goods or products only for the collection of information for the non-resident.
    * Perform any other activities that are preparatory or auxiliary in nature for the interests of the non-resident.
    * Prepare contracts relating to loans, supply of products, or perform technical services for signature.
    * Execute any group of the activities mentioned above.
  * A non-resident partner in a resident personal company is considered an owner to a PE in Saudi Arabia in the form of a share in a personal company.


Furthermore, the agent mentioned in the above article is identified as a dependent agent who has any of the following authorities:
  * Negotiate on behalf of a non-resident.
  * Conclude contracts on behalf of a non-resident.
  * Has a stock of goods, owned by a non-resident, on hand in Saudi Arabia to supply the clients’ demands regularly on behalf of the non-resident.

# Saudi Arabia
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 21 July 2024
All expenses that are necessary and normal to the business, paid or accrued, are allowable deductions, provided the expense meets the following conditions:
  * It is an actual expense, supported by a verifiable document or other qualifying evidence.
  * It is related to the generation of taxable income.
  * It is related to the subject tax year.
  * It is of a non-capital nature.


## Depreciation
A depreciation deduction is allowed under the following limitations as stipulated by the law:
  * The asset is not intended for resale and is to be used, in full or in part, for the entity’s purposes.
  * The asset is of a depreciable nature that loses value because of use or because of wear and tear and obsolescence and has a value extending beyond the end of the taxable year.
  * The asset is owned by the business, as per the ownership document for buildings and contracts and invoices for other assets.
  * The asset depreciation is allowed even if the asset becomes inactive during the tax year.


Depreciation for tax purposes is calculated as follows, based on the following five categories of depreciable tangible or intangible assets, other than land:
Asset category | Depreciation rate (%)  
---|---  
Fixed buildings | 5  
Industrial and agricultural movable buildings | 10  
Factories, machines and equipment, computer application programs, passenger cars, and cargo vehicles | 25  
Expenditures for geological surveying, drilling, exploration, and other preliminary work to exploit and develop natural resources and their fields | 20  
All other tangible or intangible assets not included in previous categories, such as furniture, planes, ships and trains, and goodwill | 10  
The declining-balance method of depreciation, according to the above rates, should be followed for tax purposes. However, straight-line depreciation is allowed for Zakat payers as per Zakat regulations.
There are also rules for depreciation relating to assets either acquired or disposed of. Essentially, 50% of the allowable acquisition price or disposal proceeds is added to or subtracted from the asset pool in the first year, and the remaining 50% in the following year.
From 1 January 2018, the cost base of assets transferred or distributed between companies that are part of the same group should be set at the net book value.
Assets under build, own, and transfer (BOT) and build, own, operate, and transfer (BOOT) are allowed to be depreciated over the contract period. This presumes, although it is not clear, that assets under the BOT and BOOT schemes actually will have a separate grouping in addition to the above prescribed groups.
## Start-up expenses
Tax treatment of start-up expenses depend on how they were treated under Saudi generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Generally, they can be fully expensed in the first financial year or can be capitalised and amortised.
## Loan charges (interest expenses)
An interest deduction is limited to the lower of the loan charge incurred during the tax year, if related to income that is subject to tax, or the result of the following formula, whichever is less.
The taxpayer’s total income from loan charges, plus 50% of (A minus B) as below:
A = income subject to tax other than income from loan charges.
B = expenses allowed under the law other than loan charge expenses.
Note that this formula does not apply to banks and interest charges used to finance capital assets that are capitalised / added to the value of the asset during the construction phase of that asset.
## Bad debt
Bad debts are deductible, provided they meet all of the following conditions:
  * The bad debt was previously declared in the appropriate year’s income.
  * The debt resulted from sale of goods or services.
  * The company holds a certificate from the taxpayer’s certified public accountant (CPA) certifying that the debt has been written off in the taxpayer’s books and records, based on a decision by the taxpayer at the appropriate management level.
  * Serious efforts have been exerted by the taxpayer to collect the debt with no success and the inability of the debtor to pay has been proved based on a judicial ruling or bankruptcy.
  * The debt is not from a related party.
  * There is a commitment by the taxpayer to reinstate, as income, any written-off debt whenever collected.


## Charitable contributions
In determining the tax base of each taxpayer, a deduction is allowed for donations paid during the taxable year to public agencies or philanthropic societies licensed in Saudi Arabia, which are non-profit organisations and are allowed to receive donations.
## Allocations and reserves
Allocations and reserves formed during the year are deductible as follows:
  * Bank allocations to a reserve fund for doubtful debts are allowable deductions. However, a bank must submit a certificate from the SAMA stating the amount of doubtful debts and the amount of doubtful debts collected during the year that should be reinstated in the tax base of the year of collection.
  * Insurance/reinsurance companies may deduct, based on industry standards, a reserve for unearned premiums and for unexpired risks, provided that it is reported in the tax base of the following year.A reserve for unearned premiums means a part of premium amounts collected or stated in books that covers risks related to the future tax year(s). A reserve for unexpired risks mean the amount of compensation claimed or reported, but for which the payment process falls short of completion during the tax year.
  * A taxpayer may reduce its book profit by the amount of reserves used during the year that had been readjusted when made to increase income or decrease expenses in the year of formation. Examples of such reserves are end-of-service awards, doubtful debt, and drops in prices. Such amounts are deductible, provided the following conditions are met: 
    * The used amount was paid or accrued during the year, and it is supported by documentation.
    * The reserve had been adjusted in the year of formation to increase the tax base.


## School fees
School fees paid by taxpayers for their employees’ children are deductible expenses, provided they meet the following conditions:
  * They are paid to a local licensed school.
  * This benefit is stated in the employment contract.


## Pension fund
Employers’ contributions to employees’ pension funds or savings funds established under Saudi Arabia’s rules and regulations are deductible, provided that such contribution, one payment or in aggregate, is not in excess of 25% of the employee’s income before the employer’s contributions and that the fund meets the following criteria:
  * The fund is established according to special provisions that clearly stipulate conditions of subscription and rights of subscribers.
  * Such obligation is stated in the employment contract or in the Articles of Association of the establishment.
  * The fund has a character independent of the establishment and has separate accounts audited by an independent CPA.


A capital company is allowed to deduct its contribution to a retirement fund, a social insurance fund, or any other fund established for the purpose of settling employee end-of-service benefits or to meet staff medical expenses, provided they meet certain conditions. It should be noted that there is a notification requirement to ZATCA in order to claim any deduction of the contribution.
## Research and development (R&D)
A deduction is allowed for R&D expenditure incurred during the tax year in connection with the generation of income that is subject to tax. Such expenditure relates to technical, scientific, and engineering experiments; computer systems; or similar research. This provision does not apply to the acquisition of land and facilities, or to equipment used for research. Such facilities and equipment are subject to depreciation under the law.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties related to income tax, paid or payable in Saudi Arabia or to other countries, are not deductible.
Financial fines or penalties paid or payable to any party in Saudi Arabia, such as traffic fines or fines for causing damage to public utilities, are also not deductible.
Fines or penalties paid for breach of contractual obligations, such as fines on delayed or defaulted completion of contracts, are deductible, provided they are documented by the contracting party and the income from such penalties is reported in the year of recovery.

The following expenses are non-deductible:
  * Wages, salaries, and whatever is so deemed, in cash or in kind, paid to an owner, partner, or shareholder, or to a member of their families, being a parent, spouse, sons/daughters, and siblings (this provision does not apply to stockholders in a stock company).
  * Compensation in cash or in kind paid to a partner, shareholder, or to a family member, including a parent, spouse, sons/daughters, and siblings, for a property or service to the extent that the compensation is higher than the fair market value of such property or service at time of transaction.
  * Entertainment expenses incurred for events such as parties, sports competitions, entertainment trips and activities, etc.
  * Expenses of a natural person for personal consumption, such as personal withdrawals, dependants’ cost of living, or education.
  * Any bribe or similar payment, which is considered an illegal practice in Saudi Arabia, even if paid abroad.
  * Insurance commission in excess of 3% of total premiums collected in Saudi Arabia through an agent or others and regardless of whether or not the agent is a partner.


## Net operating losses
A taxpayer may carry forward operational losses, as adjusted, to the years following the loss year until the cumulative loss is fully offset. The maximum profit percentage of any year that could be used to offset cumulative losses should not exceed 25% of the year’s taxable profit as reported in the taxpayer’s return. Carryback of losses is not allowed.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments made to head offices located abroad by local branches are not deductible. Such payments include:
  * royalties or commissions
  * loan charges (interest expense) or any other financial fees (except loan charges paid by branches of foreign banks in Saudi Arabia to their non-resident head offices, which are considered as tax deductible expenses), and

## United States (US) Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
Saudi Arabia signed a Model 1 Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) in light of the FATCA dated 24 June 2014. The draft regulations were issued in February 2012 and the final regulations were released on 17 January 2013 with an amendment to some of the deadlines issued through a notice on 12 July 2013.
On 6 February 2017, the Saudi Arabian Cabinet formally approved the IGA between Saudi Arabia and the United States to improve international tax compliance and implement the FATCA. The IGA and related implementing regulations will reduce the burden for financial institutions and remove some of the implementation issues faced by Saudi Arabia financial institutions, including the legal impediments related to data protection and reporting restrictions.
Under the IGA, Saudi-based financial institutions will be treated as compliant with the FATCA and should not be subject to a 30% WHT on US-source income and gross proceeds unless a financial institution fails to meet the requirements set out in the IGA and Saudi implementing regulations.
The IGA, signed on 15 November 2016, requires financial institutions to report US reportable accounts to the local competent authority, which is ZATCA. In case of non-compliance with IGA requirements, ZATCA may subject the relevant financial institutions to penalties.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
On 2 November 2016, the OECD announced that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia joined the CRS Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA), committed to the first exchange of financial account information by September 2018 (2018 adopter).
Applicable for individuals and legal entities, it aims to give participating countries transparency on the financial assets that residents hold offshore.
The CRS requires financial institutions to identify customer tax residencies and report to local tax authorities financial accounts held directly or indirectly by foreign tax residents. It also requires those tax authorities (in participating countries) to exchange this information.
If you are tax resident of a country other than the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia or where you maintain your bank account, then under the CRS, KSA-based financial institutions may be required to provide details, including information relating to accounts, to the tax authority in the country of your tax residency through ZATCA in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In case of non-compliance, ZATCA may subject the relevant financial institutions to penalties.

## Inventory valuation
The weighted average-cost method is used for valuing inventory under Saudi tax law.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are subject to income tax or Zakat, as appropriate, at the normal income tax or Zakat rate. However, capital gains realised from the disposal of shares in Saudi stock companies listed in the Saudi market are tax exempt, subject to certain conditions.
## Dividend income
Dividend income that is received by a resident party is subject to income tax at the normal income tax rate unless exempt. Dividends can be exempt from income tax in Saudi Arabia if the following conditions are met, generally: 
  * The percentage of ownership in the company invested in is not less than 10%.
  * The period of ownership of shares is not less than one year.


Dividends paid by resident entities to a non-resident party are subject to WHT at 5%.
## Interest income
Interest income is subject to income tax at the normal income tax rate. Interest paid to a non-resident party is subject to WHT at 5%.
## Royalty income
Royalty income is subject to tax at the normal income tax rate. Royalties paid to a non-resident party are subject to WHT at 15%.
Royalty is defined as per article one of the Saudi income tax law as follows:
“Payments received for use of or the right to use intellectual rights, including, but not limited to, copyright, patents, designs, industrial secrets, trademarks and trade names, know-how, trade secrets, business, goodwill, and payments received against the use of information related to industrial, commercial, or scientific expertise, or against granting the right to exploit natural and mineral resources.”
## Imports and supply contracts
Saudi tax law provides that no profit will be considered to arise from a contract for the supply of goods to Saudi Arabia, provided delivery of the goods is either free on board (FOB) or cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) to a Saudi port. However, should the contract provide for the delivery and/or installation of materials at a point inside Saudi Arabia, the supplier may be considered to be carrying on business within Saudi Arabia, and, as a consequence, the contract may be subject to Saudi income taxation as follows:
  * If the material cost was identified in the supply contract separately from the cost of work performed in Saudi Arabia, then, in the absence of a PE, a WHT on the work that will be performed in Saudi Arabia may be assessed, based on the type of services. However, if the contract qualifies the supplier to have a PE in Saudi Arabia, then income tax will be applied according to the Saudi tax regulations as for a normal taxpayer.
  * If the supply contract indicates a total cost without segregation in the value of supply and the value of the other activities in Saudi Arabia, then the work performed in Saudi Arabia will be assigned a value equal to 10% of the contract value for each type of activity.


## Foreign income
The gross income derived by a capital company resident in Saudi Arabia from its operations and of its branches inside and outside Saudi Arabia is subject to tax in Saudi Arabia. However, in order to avoid double taxation on the same income, the following exceptions and clarifications are to be considered:
  * With respect to the income realised from investments in other resident capital companies and foreign capital companies (foreign dividends applicable from 1 January 2018) and in order to avoid double taxation, such income is to be excluded from being subject to tax under the following conditions: 
    * The percentage of ownership in the company invested in is not less than 10%.
    * The period of ownership of shares is not less than one year.


Previously (up to 31 December 2017), foreign dividends were taxable unless a double tax treaty (DTT) provided relief.
There are no restrictions on repatriation of profits, fees, capital, salaries, or other monies.


# Saudi Arabia
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 21 July 2024
Generally, non-Saudi investors are liable for income tax in Saudi Arabia. In most cases, Saudi citizen investors (and citizens of the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] countries, who are considered to be Saudi citizens for Saudi tax purposes) are liable for Zakat, an Islamic assessment. Where a company is owned by both Saudi and non-Saudi interests, the portion of taxable income attributable to the non-Saudi interest is subject to income tax, and the Saudi share goes into the basis on which Zakat is assessed.
According to the income tax law, the following persons are subject to income tax:
  * A resident capital company with respect to shares owned either directly or indirectly by non-Saudi / non-GCC persons and persons operating in oil and hydrocarbon production, except for the following (in which case the underlying resident company would be subject to Zakat: 
    * Shares owned in a resident capital company listed in the Saudi stock market acquired for the purpose of speculation through trading in the Saudi capital market. 
    * Shares owned either directly or indirectly by persons working in the field of oil and hydrocarbons production in a resident capital company listed in the Saudi stock market, and the shares owned either directly or indirectly by these companies in capital companies.
  * A resident non-Saudi natural person who carries on activities in Saudi Arabia.
  * A non-resident person who carries out activities in Saudi Arabia through a permanent establishment (PE).
  * A non-resident person who has other income subject to tax from sources within Saudi Arabia without having a PE.
  * A person engaged in natural gas investment fields.
  * A person engaged in oil and other hydrocarbon production.


The rate of income tax is 20% of the net adjusted profits. WHT rates are between 5% and 20%. Zakat is charged on the company’s Zakat base at 2.5%. Zakat base represents the net worth of the entity as calculated for Zakat purposes.
It should be noted that, although the income tax rate is 20%, income from the following two activities is subject to different rates:
  * Income from oil and hydrocarbon production is subject to tax at a rate ranging from 50% to 85%.
  * The tax base of a person who works in natural gas investment should be independent of the tax base relating to other activities of this person.


Effective 1 January 2018, the income tax legislation was amended to repeal the Natural Gas Investment Tax (NGIT) provisions; natural gas investment should be taxed under the general provisions of the income tax legislation (including being subject to the general income tax rate of 20%). 
## Local income taxes
There are no local, state, or provincial government taxes on income other than the regular income tax or Zakat as mentioned above.

## Value-added tax (VAT) and excise tax
VAT Law and implementing regulations have been published and are applicable from 1 January 2018.
VAT is imposed at a rate of 5% for most goods and services, with certain exceptions applicable. Effective 1 July 2020, the standard VAT rate was increased by the government to 15%.
The Excise Tax Law became effective on 11 June 2017 in Saudi Arabia, with only tobacco products (at 100%), soft drinks (at 50%), and energy drinks (at 100%) selected as goods subject to the excise tax in Saudi Arabia.
In order to comply with the Saudi Arabian Excise Tax Law, manufacturers and importers of excisable goods are required to register with ZATCA. Businesses that qualify to be under the scope of the Excise Tax Law that fail to register and comply with the guidance issued by ZATCA will be considered as tax evaders and will be imposed penalties.
## Customs duties
Customs duties are imposed on imports according to tariff rates that are effective on the payment date in accordance with the Saudi Customs regulations. Customs duties are imposed on the price of the imported goods. This price is assessed based on the actual cost paid or on the agreed upon cost denominated in the currency of the exporting country. The price consists of the price of the imported goods as packed for shipping from the port of export plus freight and insurance cost to the Saudi port, which is converted to Saudi riyals at the exchange rates published by the Saudi Central Bank (SAMA) on the date of the declaration. In case this procedure is not achievable, the imported goods will be priced based on the most proximate comparable value that could be ascertained. Imported goods that are subject to customs duties based on weight are assessed based on the gross weight or the net weight as shown in the tariff schedules. The gross weight of the goods includes the goods weight, including all internal and external packing materials. Net weight of the goods excludes all internal and external packing materials, including the items used for separating and arranging the goods.
To encourage joint ventures in manufacturing, the government grants tariff protection from competing imports to locally produced, quality goods. Rates can be as high as 25%.
Penalties on smuggling goods vary from confiscation to collections of customs duties and penalties to imprisonment.
## Payroll taxes
Since there is no individual income tax regime in Saudi Arabia, earnings from employment are not subject to income tax. Only the social insurance tax (_see below_) is applied on the payroll.
## Social insurance tax
Social insurance tax is paid monthly based on (i) basic wage, (ii) cash or in-kind housing allowance, and (iii) commissions, with an upper limit of 45,000 Saudi riyals (SAR), is computed at 2% for non-Saudi employees, and is paid by the employer. For Saudi employees, the rate is 21.5% and is paid by both the employee (9.75%) and the employer (11.75%).
## Real Estate Transaction Tax (RETT) 
RETT is imposed at a rate of 5% of the total real estate disposal value regardless of its condition, shape, or use at the time of the disposal.
This includes the land and what is being constructed or built on it, whether the disposal occurred on this land at its current state or after an establishment was built on it, irrespective of whether the entire property was disposed of or only a part of it such as a detachment, a communal, a residential unit, or any other types of real estate, and whether the disposal was authenticated or not.
RETT also applies on transfer of real estate rich entities (as defined for RETT purposes). 
The rules provide for certain exemptions that could be available in certain cases.
## Other taxes
There is no form of stamp duty, transfer, sales, turnover, or production taxation, except in so far as they may fall within the scope of Zakat, which is applicable only to Saudi nationals.
