## Overview
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (Venezuela) has a privileged location on the Northern Coast of South America, which facilitates access to the East Coast of the United States, to the Panama Canal, to Central America, and to the Caribbean. The country has a surface of 916,445 square kilometres and is the seventh largest country in Latin America. The official language of Venezuela is Spanish, and the currency is the bolívar (VES).
Venezuela is defined as a federal and democratic state, with Caracas as the capital. There are three levels of government: the national, the state, and the municipal governments. The legal system is based on the Roman law and the Napoleonic Code. The main tenets of the legal system are embodied in the Constitution of 1999, congressional laws, executive decrees, and the legal standards of the Republic.
Venezuela is highly dependent on oil revenues. Due to the country’s current economic environment, a decrease of 26.8% in the gross domestic product (GDP) was experienced for the first quarter of 2019.
