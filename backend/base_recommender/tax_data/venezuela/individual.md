## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
Resident individuals are subject to tax on their worldwide income.
Foreign resident individuals with a fixed base in Venezuela must pay taxes on their income of national or foreign source attributable to said base.
Non-resident individuals pay taxes on their income whenever the cause or origin of such income lies within Venezuela.
## Personal income tax rates
Resident individuals are subject to tax using graduated rates. The annual income tax, before credits, is calculated using the following tax rate table (i.e. Tariff No. 1).
Range of taxable income in tax units (TU) | Tax rate (%) | Deduction (TU)  
---|---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 1,000 | 6 | 0  
1,000 | 1,500 | 9 | 30  
1,500 | 2,000 | 12 | 75  
2,000 | 2,500 | 16 | 155  
2,500 | 3,000 | 20 | 255  
3,000 | 4,000 | 24 | 375  
4,000 | 6,000 | 29 | 575  
6,000 | 34 | 875  
Income for non-resident individuals arising from non-business professional activities is subject to tax at 34% on 90% of the gross payments. Salary and other income received by non-residents for services performed in Venezuela are subject to a flat 34% tax, withheld at source.
### Tax units (TU)
The 1994 Income Tax Law reform established the concept of a taxable unit as an element that reduces the negative effects created by inflation on the determination of the tax rates. The tax code established the initial TU at 1 bolívar fuerte (VEF), formerly with annual basis adjustments according to the variation on the consumer price index (CPI) from the previous year. This parameter for adjustment was abrogated in the 2020 Master Tax Code. For 2022, the TU value, under the new currency expression enacted in October 2021, is 0.40 bolívar soberano (VES). For 2023, the TU published value is VES 9.
## Local income taxes
There are no local taxes on personal income in Venezuela.


# Venezuela
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
## Taxable period
Individual taxpayers earning wages and salaries must file their tax returns on a calendar-year basis, whereas taxpayers engaged in commercial activities, industry activities, or services are allowed to choose a period with duration other than that of the calendar year (12-month period). Exceptions are permitted (e.g. when an individual ceases all business).
## Tax returns
The Venezuelan income tax return should be filed by 31 March, or at the date established in the corresponding calendar in case of individuals notified by the tax authorities as major or special taxpayers. This period cannot be extended. Late filing of the return will attract fines and interests.
Spouses must, in principle, file joint returns even if they have personal income arising from their own activities. They will be considered as a single taxpayer. Husbands and wives can file separate tax returns only when the following conditions apply:
  * There was a mutual agreement for separation of property.
  * They both are reporting salaries, wages, and professional fees and choose to declare separately.


## Payment of tax
Income tax is withheld from salaries, professional fees, royalties paid to non-residents, and certain other payments received by non-residents.
Individuals other than employees must file estimated returns only if, during the year immediately preceding fiscal year, they received income exceeding TU 1,500 from: (i) commercial or credit activities, (ii) independent professional activities, (iii) leasing or subleasing activities involving movable or real property, and (iv) participation in net profits of partnerships or communities not subject to tax payment as provided for in domestic regulations.
The estimated tax is based on 75% of the tax that would result from applying full rates to the estimated income declared (80%). The prepaid tax resulting from the estimated returns must be paid in either a single instalment or in six equal instalments.
BI-weekly income tax advanced payments apply to individuals qualified as special taxpayers not earning wages and salaries instead of the estimated tax return.
## Tax audit process
According to the Master Tax Code, the tax administration is entitled to review the existence of a taxpayer’s liability, whether it has been reported or not. In exercising this power, the tax administration is entitled to obtain and verify information in connection with a determined tax liability. Verifications may be carried out on the basis of available information or on a presumptive basis if concrete information is not available
## Statute of limitations
The actions to verify, inspect, determine the tax obligation, and impose the legal fines are limited to a six-year period since the action was committed. However, the statute of limitation can be extended to ten years if there was no filing or payment of the tax obligation, the taxpayer did not register before the tax authority, the goods subject to the tax obligation were taken or are out of the country, the taxpayer has duplicated or no accounting, or the fine to be imposed is a freedom-limited restriction.
The right to acquire the return of taxes has a statute of limitation of six years.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
In general terms, tax audits are mainly focused on corporate taxpayers. However, those individuals qualified by the tax authorities as special taxpayers have been subject to tax audits.

Taxable income does not include properly documented travel expense reimbursements and individually supported representation expenses. Business deductions from salary income are not allowed.
## Losses
Tax losses may, in principle, be carried forward up to three years. During the three-year term, the amount of losses available to carry forward cannot exceed 25% of the tax period’s taxable income. Foreign losses may only be offset against foreign-source income.

## Individual - Other issues
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
## Exchange control
In January 2003, the Venezuelan government and the Venezuelan Central Bank (VCB) restricted the free trade of foreign currency and established an Exchange Control Regime.
The Venezuelan Constitutional Assembly enacted new Exchange Agreement N° 1 on 7 September 2018. The Exchange Agreement provides for new mechanisms for the settlement of transactions of acquisition and sale of foreign currency for the public and private sectors and abrogates the Exchange Agreements issued under the previous regime.
The VCB and the Popular Power Finance Ministry are authorised to determine the actions for development of the foreign exchange policy in accordance with Exchanage Agreement N° 1:
The following three mechanisms of operations are provided for the private sector:
  * Acquisitions and sales of positions in foreign currency by persons of the private sectors and through the authorised exchange operators, presumably provided for high-value transactions.
  * Retail exchange transactions up to 8,500 euros (EUR) of the equivalent value in other foreign currency per transaction.
  * Negotiations in Venezuela currency of foreign currency-denominated securities issued by the private sector. In addition, special considerations are provided for export activities and tourism. 


To date, regulations for implementation of the above-mentioned mechanisms, which are to be issued mainly by the VCB, have not been published. A new means of currency exchange was created by Resolution N°19-05-01 published in the official Gazette N°41.624 on 2 May 2019 whereby national banks sell to natural and legal persons through exchange tables.
## Visas and permits
Visas must be obtained prior to entering Venezuela. In order to gain access to Venezuela, international assignees must have a valid visa issued by the Venezuelan Consulate. Obtaining a visa can take several months, so applications should be submitted well in advance. Please also note that visa applicants must have a valid passport that should not expire for at least six months from the application date.
The Venezuelan government issues various types of visas (in total 13 various types of visas); the most important are Transient Business Visa (TR-N), Transient Work Permit Visas (TR-L), Transient Family Visas (TR-F), and Resident Visas.
Do note that all of the documents to be submitted in Venezuela shall be filed in Spanish or translated by a certified translator, notarised and apostilled/legalised whenever it may apply.
### Transient Business Visa (TR-N)
Business leaders, executives, representatives of companies or industries, and micro-entrepreneurs who are not willing to migrate but need to enter the country to carry out legal and lucrative matters related to their businesses, such as commercial, mercantile, and/or financial activities, must apply for a business visa (TR-N). This kind of visa is valid for one year, with multiple arrivals and departures, and will allow permanence of 180 days continuous or not, non-extendable. This visa does not allow the holder to work in Venezuela as a dependant. 
The applicant (natural person or company) must formally file the request before a Venezuelan Consulate stating the purpose of the trip. As an independent body of the Venezuelan State, the Consul and/or the Consulate Officials are expressly authorised to request any supporting and personal document to the applicant like police certificate clearance, vaccines certificates, medical tests, professional resume, the company articles of incorporation, chamber or association recommendation or supporting letter, or any other they may deem necessary to check.
### Transient Work Permit Visas (TR-L)
Companies wishing to hire a non-resident foreigner for work in a dependent relationship within the country must apply for a work visa (TR-L). This kind of visa may be granted for one year if a work permit is granted and can be locally extended for the same period. It may be also granted for three months without the need of a work permit, non-extendable. Both allows the applicant for multiple arrivals and departures and permanence for the same period. Further details are to be considered as drafted below.
To obtain the one-year TR-L visa, the hiring company shall start the visa request process, which comprehends:
  1. Filing for a work permit, locally, before the Ministry of Labour, where several documents will be requested to prove the local company qualification, tax solvencies, foreigners quota (maximum 10% of total foreigners in local payroll), and foreigners payments total amount (no more than 20% paid to Venezuelans), applicant high qualification for the job being applied for, and any other situation they may deem necessary to check. These scenarios are usually proved by submitting:


  *     * Work Permit Request Form.
    * Letter of Intention with a brief reasoning of why the applicant is needed, the role he/she will be responsible with, physical job to be address in country, salary amount and details (net salary, bonuses, house/medical allocation if any, etc.), and the job description, along with a vow to train local employees to perform said role.
    * Copy of the company local complete payroll.
    * In the case of transfer of qualified personnel, a Letter of Transfer issued by the headquarters must be submitted. It must state the motive for the transfer.
    * In the case of direct contract of foreign personnel outside Venezuela, a document explaining the motives for contracting foreign personnel must be submitted.
    * Notarised employment offer.
    * Police clearance certificate.
    * Resume of the foreigner, including hours worked, broad experience, and academic/studies supporting documents.
    * Full face photograph of the foreigner.
    * Full copy of the passport of the applicant. If no more than two pages are empty, the request may be rejected.
    * Medical tests. Express qualification for the job to be performed may be requested.
    * Vaccines card certification for yellow fever and any other they may deem necessary to request.
    * Labour-related solvencies, such as Ministry of Labour, Social Security (IVSS), Training and Education (INCES), etc.
    * Power of Attorney issued by the employer to the person in charge of requesting the work permit.


  1. Filing for the work visa issuance authorisation, locally, before the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Justice. The request should be filled with: 
     * The request form indicating the Venezuelan consulate where the applicant will request the visa.
     * Original of the granted work permit.
     * Notarised employment offer.
     * Biometric/ID page of the applicant passport.
     * Power of Attorney issued by the employer to the person in charge of requesting the work visa issuance authorisation.


To obtain the three-months TR-L visa, the hiring company shall start the visa request directly before the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Justice with the very same requirements as stated in (2) above, except for the work permit, which is not necessary, and a specific employment offer, which shall state the three months threshold work timeframe.
Once the visa issuance authorisation is granted, the company should hand it over along with the work permit to the applicant for him/her to be able to formally request the visa before the Venezuelan consulate. Do notice that the consulate officials are authorised by law to request any other document they may deem necessary to grant the visa. If approved, the visa will be stamped in the applicant passport. If denied, a reasoned letter shall be sent by the consulate officials to the Venezuelan authorities. 
Upon arrival, the one-year TR-L holder must request one's foreigner ID (not available for the three months visa holder). The law also requests foreigners to register before the 'Foreigners Registry' system of the Ministry of Interior and Justice, but, as of January 2023, said registry has not been enforced.
If the company aims the applicant to remain within the country for more than one year, the work permit should be renewed by formal request before the Ministry of Labour, as well as the visa before SAIME.
### Transient Family Visas (TR-F)
The foreign employee with a TR-L visa can apply for a transient family visa (TR-F) for one’s spouse, non-emancipated children under 18 years of age, parents, and in-laws upon certified proof of the family tie and economic dependency. One then must present the following documents:
  * Entry Application Form of the foreign family member.
  * Marriage licence of the spouse.
  * Birth certificates of the children.
  * Full face and profile photo of the applicant.
  * Passport copy of the family member.
  * Power of Attorney or authorisation issued to the person in charge of requesting the TR-F visa.
  * Tax stamps.


The TR-F visa is valid for one year, with multiple entries, and will allow permanence in the country for the same period. It can be extended in the country by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Justice, for the same period, upon ratification of the work permit by the Ministry of Labour.
### Resident visas
The foreigner who has remained in Venezuela for at least one uninterrupted year with a TR-L or TR-F visa may apply for residency with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Justice. Resident visas are valid for five years and can be renewed every five years.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
## Employment income
Resident and non-resident individuals are taxed on salaries and wages and on any other remuneration for personal services, such as meal allowances, pensions, profit sharing, and other similar remunerations, regardless of the place of payment or currency used.
Employees are not taxed on pensions and termination benefits as set forth in the labour law or collective contracts (employer/union) and interest thereon, or income from trusts established to administer employer contributions to the related funds.
Foreign-source income will be taxable for tax-resident individuals unless an exemption or tax treaty applies.
## Equity compensation
There are no specifications regarding the tax treatment of equity-based compensation. In this regard, general rules on taxation of employment income apply.
## Business income
All income earned by individuals from business activities carried out as a sole proprietor is to be reported in the annual tax return and is subject to the same tax rate applicable to individuals obtaining other income.
Taxable income and the resulting income tax from the business activities of individuals are usually determined in a manner similar to that of corporations (_see the section in the Corporate tax summary_).
## Capital gains
Residents are taxed on their capital gains as ordinary income.
Capital gains obtained on the sale of Venezuelan stock, registered with the Venezuelan National Securities and Exchange Commission, through a Venezuelan stock exchange are not taxable as ordinary income; however, a 1% flat withholding tax (WHT) on the sale price is payable. In this case, the losses on the sale of Venezuelan stock are not tax deductible.
Capital losses resulting from the sale of stock by other means, capital reduction, or liquidation of a company are only deductible if they meet one of the following conditions:
  * The cost of the capital stock was not in excess of the price quoted on a stock exchange or an amount with a reasonable relationship to the book value of the capital stock.
  * The holding period of the investment was for at least two years immediately preceding the date of the sale.
  * The stockholder proves that the company selling the shares carried on economic activities for at least two years preceding the date of sale.


A capital gain from the sale of a main residence is tax exempt if reinvested in another residence within one year prior to, or two years after, the sale.
## Dividend income
Dividend tax is levied at a flat rate of 34% on the positive difference between book income and fiscal income generated after 2001. To determine this difference, the last in first out (LIFO) method applies. The 34% (domestic) rate can be mitigated under tax treaties to 10%, 5%, or even 0%. The withholdings are to be made at the moment a dividend is declared or credited (to an account of the recipient).
Dividends obtained from companies incorporated or domiciled abroad or incorporated abroad and domiciled in Venezuela are excluded from the dividend tax system. However, these dividends will be taxed at a 34% flat income tax rate. Foreign tax credits on dividends can be offset with the proportional tax.
## Interest income
Income received in the form of interest is taxable when paid. Interest earned from Venezuelan saving deposits or saving funds is tax exempt.
## Rental income
Residents must report the amount of their worldwide rental income received from real estate. They may deduct administrative expenses incurred in connection with the rented property of up to 10% of the rental income for the fiscal year. Additionally, the following expenses are deductible: maintenance, interest on loans for the purchase or construction of rented property, and property taxes.
## Exempt income
Items exempt from taxable income include the following:
  * Compensation for an injury received by employees or their beneficiaries as result of their work, paid under the law or the labour contract. It may include the profits from the retirement fund as well as the profit received from interests.
  * Compensations received by the insured or their beneficiaries as result of the insurance contract.
  * Pensions received from retirement, seniority, or invalidation.
  * Inheritances or gifts received.
  * Contributions made by employers to the safe deposit box of their employees, and the profits received from interests or any other concept on occasion of the safe deposit box.
  * Profits received from interests on occasion of fixed deposits, mortgage certificates, savings certificates, investments, or any other kind of savings instrument established under the banking law.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
Individuals are considered to be residents in Venezuela for tax purposes when they spend more than 183 days in Venezuela in aggregate during a fiscal year or if they have spent more than 183 days in Venezuela in the preceding year. Thus, an individual who spends 184 days in Venezuela will be deemed to be a resident for tax purposes.
According to the Organic Tax Code, individuals will be considered resident in Venezuela for tax purposes if they establish a residence or home in Venezuela, unless they have stayed in another country for more than 183 days and demonstrate, by evidence issued by the corresponding tax authorities, that they are tax resident in that other country.
Venezuelan citizens are presumed domiciled in Venezuela unless they can prove otherwise.

## Social security contributions
Below is a chart containing the main contributions established to finance social security.
Contributions | Employee Contribution Basis | Contribution basis (cap) | Employer´s contributions (%) | Employee´s contributions (%) | Notes  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Mandatory Social Security Regime Contribution | Wages (normal or regular wages) | Up to five minimum salaries for urban workers | 9, 10, or 11 | 4 | (1, 2, 5)  
Employment Benefit Regime Contribution | Wages (normal or regular wages) | Up to ten minimum salaries for urban workers | 2 | 0.5 | (1)  
Housing Regime Contribution | Total monthly (or integral) salary | No cap | 2 | 1 | (4, 5)  
Employee Training Contribution (INCES) | Annual profit sharing bonus | No cap | 2 | 0.5 | (3)  
Workplace Prevention, Conditions and Environment Contribution (LOPCYMAT) | Total salaries paid to employees | No cap is established. | 0.75 to 10 | N/A | (6, 7)  
Notes
  1. Minimum monthly salary increased to VES 130 as of 15 March 2022. 
  2. According to the current system, the employer's contribution to social security will depend on the company's risk qualification (minimum risk, middle risk, or maximum risk).
  3. Regarding _Instituto Nacional de Capacitación y Educación Socialista_ (INCES) contribution, the employer must contribute 2% of the total wages and salaries paid to employees.
  4. According to the _Ley Orgánica del Sistema de Seguridad Social_ (LOSSS), the general rule for contribution basis for the new systems cannot exceed ten minimum salaries. The transition rules establish a contribution basis of five metropolitan minimum salaries for urban workers for social security purposes. No cap is expressly established in the transition rules for the housing system and work, security, and health regime.
  5. The basis of calculation of the housing contributions is the ‘integral salary’. The integral salary is a concept established in the Organic Labour Law, and it comprises the following payments: commissions, gratifications, profit sharing, bonuses, vacation bonus as well as surcharges for holidays, overtime, night shifts, among others, all of which are made to the employee and correspond to the services rendered by the individual.
  6. Contributions to be made to this regime are exclusively for the employer and vary depending on the risk associated to the company. A company's risk is to be determined by the _Instituto Nacional de Prevención,_ _Salud y Seguridad Laborales_ (INPSASEL).
  7. _Ley Orgánica de Prevención, Condiciones y Medio Ambiente de Trabajo_ (LOPCYMAT) regulations do not establish a cap for the contribution. However, as mentioned, the LOSSS establishes a maximum of ten minimum urban salaries. For this reason, there are several contrary interpretations on whether a cap should be applied in this case.


## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
Federal VAT (_Impuesto al Valor Agregado_ or IVA), is a one-time tax payable by the ultimate consumer of all types of products and services. 
In general, VAT is payable on all sales, rental, and importation of goods, and rendering of services executed or used in the country, although a number of significant exceptions are provided by law.
The rate may change every year, within the range of 8% to 16.5%. The current general rate is 16%.
A 15% VAT applies to the sale and imports of luxury products (e.g. vehicles valued at 40,000 United States dollars [USD] or more, motorcycles valued at USD 20,000 or more, nickel or token game machines, aircraft used for recreational or sport purposes, jewellery valued at USD 300 or more).
An additional tax rate, subject to modification by the National Executive and ranging from 5% to 25%, is applicable to goods and supply of services paid in foreign currency, cryptocurrency, or crypto assets different from those issued or guaranteed by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. To date, the applicable rate has not been published.
The aforesaid additional rate is to be established by the National Executive by Decree and will be applicable if (i) the sale of movable property or supply of services taking place in the national territory, including tax exempt transactions, is paid in foreign currency, cryptocurrency, or crypto assets different from those issued or guaranteed by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and (ii) sales of immovable property are paid in foreign currency, cryptocurrency, or crypto assets different from those issued or guaranteed by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
The newly introduced additional tax rate will be effective as of 30 continuous days following the publication of the Official Gazette by which the National Executive is to establish the applicable rate.
An 8% VAT applies to the following transactions:
  * Goats, sheep, and minor species for slaughter or breeding.
  * Meats in their natural state, or refrigerated, frozen, or salted meats, or meats in brine of goats, sheep, and poultry.
  * Shortening.
  * Rendering of professional services to any government entity, in any level or branch of government, provided such services do not involve any commercial transactions but rather predominantly intellectual work or efforts.
  * Domestic air passenger transportation. 


## Net wealth/worth taxes
The high net wealth tax was enacted by Constitutional Law published in July 2019 and reprinted in August 2019. The tax applies to the net worth of taxpayers qualified as special taxpayers and shall be determined on an annual basis on the value of the net worth at the end of the tax year. 
Individual and corporate special taxpayers are subject to tax when their worth is equal to or higher than TU 150 million. Resident individuals and entities in the terms of the Constitutional Law are subject to tax on their total net worth, regardless of the place where the assets are located or the rights can be enforced, whereas non-resident taxpayers or nationals non-resident in the country are subject to tax on assets located and rights enforceable in the country. Foreign persons with a permanent establishment (PE) in the country are subject to tax on the total net worth attributable to the PE regardless of the place where the assets are located or the rights can be enforced.
Under the Constitutional Law that enacted the high net wealth tax for special taxpayers, the circumstances determining individual tax residence have been enhanced with respect to those provided in the Venezuelan Income Tax Law and the Master Tax Code
The annual tax period end has been provided to end on 30 September of each year. The first taxable period was that ending 30 September 2019. The applicable rate is 0.25%. The taxable basis is comprised by the sum of the total assets’ value less liabilities and excluding the value of burdens and encumbrances, as well as tax-exempt assets and rights.
The return filing and payment of the tax shall be executed from 1 October and 30 November of each year. The tax shall be reported pursuant to the standards provided for such purposes in the tax authorities’ website.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
The estate and gift tax (_Impuesto sobre Sucesiones y Donaciones_ [EGT]) is imposed on all persons that are beneficiaries of an estate, inheritance, or gift of immovable property, rights, or shares located within Venezuela. The EGT is territorial in the sense that it is levied on Venezuelan estates and gifts, irrespective of the residence, domicile, or nationality of the beneficiary. EGT is imposed on the value of all property inherited or received from the descendant or donor (less certain liabilities and expenses), which must be appraised based on current market values at the time of the death of the descendant or at the time of the gift. The tax rate varies depending on the degree of kinship between the descendant of the donor and the beneficiary.
## Property taxes
The Urban Property Tax is a local or municipal tax payable by any person who owns property rights or any other real rights on urban real estates. The taxable basis is the value of the urban real estate. For these purposes, the fair market value of the real estate is provided as a point of reference. The applicable rate varies according to each municipality.
