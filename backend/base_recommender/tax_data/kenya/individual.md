Resident employees are taxed on worldwide earned income, in respect of any employment or services rendered in Kenya or outside Kenya. Residents are also taxed on any other income that has accrued in or is derived from Kenya.
Non-resident employees are taxable only on their income earned from within Kenya or derived from Kenya.
## Personal income tax rates
Effective 1 July 2023, the tax rates applicable to taxable income are tabulated as follows: 
Annual taxable income (KES*) | Tax rate (%)  
---|---  
On the first 288,000 | 10  
On the next 100,000 | 25  
On the next 5,612,000 | 30  
On the next 3,600,000 | 32.5  
On all income over 9,600,000 | 35

As shown above, the maximum rate of 35% will be charged on income in excess of KES 9,600,000.
Resident individuals are entitled to a personal relief of KES 2,400 per month. (_see_ _Personal relief in the section_).
## Residential rental income tax
Residential income tax is payable by any resident person who accrues or derives income from the use or occupation of residential property in Kenya.
Effective 1 January 2016, a simplified tax on residential rental income for landlords was introduced. The Finance Act, 2020 increased the threshold for the annual gross rental income from KES 10 million or less to KES 15 million or less. The landlords falling under this category are required to pay residential rental income tax at a flat rate of 10% on the gross rental income such that no tax-deductible expenses are allowed. The Finance Act, 2023 reduced the rental income tax rate to 7.5% effective 1 January 2024. 
Eligible persons are required to file monthly tax returns via the i-Tax system and pay the tax due on or before the 20th day of the month following the rent receipt. In the context of this tax, a month means a calendar month.
Landlords who wish to continue being taxed under the old tax regime can elect in writing to the Commissioner to be taxed under the normal tax rates. Once approved by the Commissioner, such landlords shall be required to pay instalment taxes and file returns in the normal way.
The Finance Act, 2023 introduces section 42C of the Tax Procedures Act (TPA), which grants the Commissioner the authority to appoint rental income tax agents. These agents will be responsible for collecting and remitting rental income tax on behalf of taxpayers to the Commissioner.

## Taxable period
The year of income is a calendar year.

Individual self-assessment tax returns must be filed by 30 June in the year following the year of income. Spouses can file separate self-assessment returns.

Last reviewed - 18 February 2025
## Employment expenses
reimbursement of business expenses relating to entertainment, travel, and car expenses are not part of taxable income.
Actual airfare and moving expenses paid to expatriate employees recruited outside Kenya and there solely to perform their duties are not taxable. Leave passages for such employees are also not taxable.
Reimbursed medical insurance or medical expenses are not normally taxable. Any expense incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of employment income is not taxable.
The Finance Act, 2023 amended Section 5(2) of the Income Tax Act (ITA) to exempt from tax amounts reimbursed to an employee as mileage claim for travelling to perform official duties, provided that such reimbursement is based on the standard mileage rate approved by the Automobile Association of Kenya ('AA Kenya').

This exemption applies on condition that the non-resident is in Kenya solely for the implementation of the project financed by the 100% grant.
The Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 2024 exempts from tax, the reimbursement of expenditure incurred by public officers for purposes of performing official duties notwithstanding the ownership or control of any assets purchased.
## Personal deductions

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 18 February 2025
## Employment income
Taxable employment income in Kenya includes all payments made by an employer to an employee. This will include salaries, wages, bonuses, and fringe benefits received or enjoyed by virtue of employment. Fringe benefits will typically have a specific tax treatment (). Where no specific tax treatment is prescribed, the taxable value will be the higher of the cost to the employer or the fair market value of providing the benefit.
For the taxation of housing benefit, there are special rules for directors and few other categories of staff to determine whether it will be taxed at the higher of 15% of gross remuneration (excluding housing) and the rent paid by the employer. Where the property is owned by the employer or the rental agreement is not at arm's length, reference is made to the fair market value rent of the property. 
Motor vehicles supplied by the employer are taxed on a monthly basis at the higher of 2% of the initial cost of the vehicle (where the employer owns the car) or prescribed standard rates.
For interest-free or low-interest loans granted to employees, the tax burden has been shifted to the employer under the fringe benefit tax (FBT).  _See the section in the Corporate tax summary for more information_.
Education fees of employees’ dependants or relatives borne by the employer are taxed on the employee unless the employer disallows the related costs for corporate tax purposes.
Where a contract of employment states that remuneration should be paid free or net of all taxes, the amount received by the employee is deemed to be net income, and the figure is grossed up to determine the tax liability. All benefits should be taxed under the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system.

## Insurance relief
A resident individual shall be entitled to insurance relief at a rate of 15% of the insurance premiums paid, subject to a maximum relief of KES 5,000 per month (or KES 60,000 per annum), provided the individual can prove that:

  * their employer has paid premiums for the benefit of that individual that has been charged to tax on that employee, or
  * both the employee and the employer have paid insurance premiums.


## Post-retirement medical fund (PRMF) deduction
The Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 2024 amended Section 15(2) of the Income Tax Act (ITA) to include contributions made to a PRMF as allowable deductions for employees.
