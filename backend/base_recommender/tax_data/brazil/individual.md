## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 26 December 2022
## Foreign tax relief
Tax credits are available with respect to income tax paid to countries with which Brazil has a ratified tax treaty or to countries that would render reciprocal treatment in relation to income tax paid to the Brazilian government, provided that some requirements are met.
## Tax treaties
Brazil signed tax treaties to avoid double taxation with the following countries: Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia (*), Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Finland, France, Hungary, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Paraguay (*), Peru, Philippines, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Trinidad & Tobago, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, Uruguay (*), and Venezuela.
(*) Treaties pending ratification (not yet in force).
In the case of the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany, the Brazilian authorities have already officially recognised the reciprocity of tax treatment, which permits the offsetting of the tax paid in those countries against the tax due in Brazil, on the same earnings.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 26 December 2022
The social security contribution table applicable for 2022 was updated by an Ordinance, dated 17 January 2022, issued by the Brazilian social security authorities (_see the section for more information_). The progressive tax table applicable as of April 2015 was updated by the Provisional Measure (PM) 670/2015, dated 11 March 2015, and converted to the Law 13,149, dated 21 July 2015 (_see the section for more information_).
Brazil is negotiating new totalisation agreements (_see the section for more information_), including Bulgaria, China, India, Switzerland, and the Portuguese speaking countries Multilateral Agreement (Brazil, Angola, Cabo Verde, Guinea Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal, Sao Tome and Principe, and East Timor).
Regarding the report of overseas assets in Brazil (Annual Income Tax Return and Brazilian Central Bank reporting), there is an Agreement between the Brazil and the United States (US) whose main objective is the exchange of financial information between the countries. This occurs through the tax authorities, which can exchange data with regards to balances in checking and saving accounts, earnings from financial investments, brokers, and insurance accounts. Further information (e.g. information related to real estate purchased abroad by Brazilians) may also be requested, but is not automatically provided.
On 14 January 2016, the Special Regime of Taxation and Foreign Currency Regularisation was established, which creates a legal mechanism for voluntary declaration by individuals and companies of their assets located outside the country that were not declared or were declared incorrectly. For regularisation, the taxpayer must bear a tax burden of approximately 30% of the assets amount. The deadline to avail of the regime finished on 31 October 2016.
Law 13,429, in force as of 30 March 2017, brought a second version of the Special Regime of Taxation and Foreign Currency Regularisation for those who have not benefited in the first stage. In this second phase, for regularisation, the taxpayer must bear a tax burden of approximately 35% of the assets amount. The deadline to avail of the regime finished on 31 July 2017.
A new obligation, called eSocial, is implemented to substitute several payroll related ancillary obligations of Brazilian companies. PwC Brazil is tracking all the news regarding eSocial in order to assist companies that are looking forward to be in compliance with the Brazilian legislation.
The eSocial implementation started on 1 January 2018 for companies with revenue in 2016 that has surpassed 78 million Brazilian reais (BRL). For other companies, the implementation started in July 2018.
New Law 13,467/2017 amends the Consolidation of Labor Laws (CLT) and adjusts various legal rules applicable to labour relationships. The newly introduced rules entered into force on 11 November 2017. Given their importance, companies should give these rules special attention due to their potential impacts on international assignment processes and costs.
The ‘New Migration Law’ (Law 13,445 issued in May 2017) has formally revoked the ‘Foreigner Statute Law’ (Law 6,815/1980), defining the rights and duties of Brazilian migrants and the legal situation of foreign individuals in Brazil. The main purpose of the new legislation is to ensure equal rights and opportunities to foreigners as if they are Brazilians citizens, as well as simplify the procedures for entrance and residence in Brazil. With respect to the latter, the Law has created new types and characteristics for allowable visas, extended the coverage conditions for the temporary visa, and introduced a new authorisation for residence.
Normative Instruction (NI) 1,831/2018, published by the Brazilian tax authorities on 21 September 2018, deals with procedures of customs control and tax treatment applicable to the traveller's goods and aims to improve and simplify the procedures adopted in the entrance of the goods of the return traveller to the country.
On 23 November 2018, the Brazilian IRS published the 16th version of the Income Tax Regulation thru the Decree 9,580/2018.
On 12 November 2019, the Brazilian government promulgated the Social Security Reform though the Constitutional Amendment (EC) n. 103. The new legislation has changed the social security system in Brazil, introducing, among other aspects, new rates for the individual social security contributions and new rules for granting pension benefits.
Based on the Law 13,932/2019, the government has extinguished the social contribution due by companies in cases of employee's dismissal without just cause. This charge, previously calculated at 10% on the total deposits made by the employer to the employee's Severance Indemnity Fund (_Fundo de Garantia por tempo de Serviço_ or FGTS) account during the employment relationship, ceases to exist as of 1 January 2020. 
In June 2021, the Brazilian government proposed a tax reform that will change some rules regarding individual taxation, affecting both company and personal income. This is still being discussed in the Brazilian Congress.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 26 December 2022
Residents of Brazil are taxed on their worldwide income, and non-residents are taxed exclusively at source on their Brazilian-sourced income. The source of income is determined by the place where the income payer is located, irrespective of where the work is performed.
For reference, non-resident taxpayers are taxed only on Brazilian-earned income at a flat rate of 25% (no deductions are allowed). Rental income received from a Brazilian-located property is taxed at 15%. Income receive abroad by non-residents is tax exempt.
## Personal income tax rates
Resident taxpayers who receive income from Brazilian sources are subject to withholdings. Resident taxpayers who receive income from non-Brazilian sources (e.g. through split payroll arrangement) or from individuals (e.g. rental income) are subject to mandatory monthly tax payments on amounts not subject to withholdings.
The monthly income tax will be calculated based on the following progressive tax rates (in Brazilian real or BRL) as of April 2015:
Income at or over (BRL) | Up to (BRL) | Tax rate (%) | Deductible tax amount (BRL)  
---|---|---|---  
0 | 1,903.98 | Exempt | 0  
1,903.99 | 2,826.65 | 7.5 | 142.80  
2,826.66 | 3,751.05 | 15.0 | 354.80  
3,751.06 | 4,664.68 | 22.5 | 636.13  
4,664.68 | and above | 27.5 | 869.36  
## **Alternative income taxes**
In December 2012, the Brazilian authorities issued PM 597/2012, converted into Law 12,832 (20 June 2013), altering Law 10,101/2000, which regulates profit sharing distributed to employees. The referred law established new rules, as follows:
  * A new specific progressive table applicable only for profit sharing paid by companies to its employees, which is valid as of April 2015:  Annual profit sharing (BRL) | Tax rate (%) | Deductible tax amount (BRL)  
---|---|---  
0 to 6,677.55 | 0 | 0  
6,677.56 to 9,922.28 | 7.5 | 500.82  
9,922.29 to 13,167.00 | 15.0 | 1,244.99  
13,167.01 to 16,380.38 | 22.5 | 2,232.51  
Above 16,380.38 | 27.5 | 3,051.53  
  * The possibility for the employee to use the alimony paid as a deduction from the profit sharing or from the regular salary.
  * The periodicity of payment must be twice a year, considering a minimum period of three months between the payments.


## Local income taxes
There are no provisions for local, state, or provincial income taxes in Brazil.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 26 December 2022
## Taxable period
The Brazilian tax year covers the period from 1 January to 31 December.
## Tax returns
Residents must file a tax return annually by the last business day of April of the following year, and no extension of time is allowed. In case of a late filing, penalties will be assessed by the tax authorities.
Since individual income tax is due and payable monthly, this return will account for only minor tax adjustments and will serve to list assets and liabilities. While there is no tax on assets owned, the government uses the list to check if the increase in the taxpayer's net worth is compatible with the reported income.
Spouses may elect to file tax returns jointly or separately. If filed separately, income received jointly must be allocated to each spouse's return. Also, in the section pertaining to assets and liabilities, each spouse must show the corresponding items held individually. The value of jointly held assets/liabilities should be allocated according to ownership percentage or shown only on one spouse's return. The spouse not listing the jointly held assets/liabilities must declare that the items will be listed on the other spouse's tax return.
The head of a household may treat as a dependant a spouse or any dependant (up to 24 years old who fulfils the dependant's rules) who receives taxable income, since the pertinent amounts are included in the income tax calculation basis.
## Payment of tax
Income tax is normally withheld at source, at rates varying from 0% to 27.5%, depending on the income bracket. The final liability is determined upon filing the tax return. Any difference between the amounts as determined by the tax return and that withheld at source or paid during the year by the individual must be paid or is refunded to the taxpayer. In case of any tax due, it must be paid to the Brazilian tax authorities at once or through up to eight monthly instalments, due on the last business day of April and in the succeeding months. In case the tax due is paid in instalments, interest must be considered monthly.
Taxes due on taxable capital gains arising from the sale of property must be collected through a tax voucher on or before the last working day of the month subsequent to sale in the case of resident taxpayer, or on the same day of sale in the case of a non-resident taxpayer.
If paid in Brazil, dividends are exempt from taxes whereas interest and royalties are taxed at source. If paid abroad, dividends and royalties are subject to taxation through the mandatory monthly income tax calculation whereas interest is taxable as capital gain. In both cases, the taxes due must be collected through a tax voucher on or before the last working day of the month subsequent to when the income was earned.
## Tax audit process
Upon the electronic filing of an individual income tax return, the Brazilian tax authorities process it and release the payment of refunds. In case of any questioning, the taxpayer will be requested to provide the tax authorities with further clarification and/or support documentation.
## Statute of limitations
The Brazilian tax authorities have up to five years, from 1 January of the year in which it is filed, to examine and question an individual income tax return.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The Brazilian tax authorities tend to question taxpayers whenever a tax credit and/or substantial amount of deductions are claimed in an individual income tax return.


# Brazil
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 26 December 2022
## Personal deductions
For Brazilian tax legislation purposes, the following items can be deducted from an employee's annual taxable income:
  * Dependants (a specific amount per dependant is established each year by the tax authorities). Note that according to the Normative Instruction published on 20 November 2017, as of the 2018 tax year, all dependants must hold a Central Provident Fund (CPF) number, regardless of their age, to be reported in the annual tax return and benefit from the corresponding deduction.
  * Alimony payments, in Brazil or abroad, provided some requirements are met.
  * Tuition expenses, in Brazil or abroad, limited to a certain specific amount established each year by the tax authorities (applicable to the taxpayer and dependants per year).

## Individual - Other issues
Last reviewed - 26 December 2022
## Visas
The Brazilian Migration Law (Law 13,445), in force as of 21 November 2017, formally revoked the ‘Foreigner Statute Law' (Law 6,815/1980), defining the rights and obligations of foreign individuals in Brazil, either as residents or visitors.
Brazilian authorities may grant visit or temporary visas to foreigners who intend to visit or live in Brazil. 
A Visit Visa (VIVIS) will be applied for those who come to Brazil for tourism, business, transit, and for the performance of audit and consulting activities for up to 90 days. The law prohibits any remunerated activity under this type of visa; however, the foreigner visitor may receive daily allowances for travel expenses.
ATemporary Visa is necessary for any type of work with or without an employment contract, such as technical services or maritime work. It also applies for those coming to Brazil for research, health treatments, study, vacation or summer jobs, family reunion, and investments, among other situations.
Official, diplomatic, and courtesy visasare generally applicable for foreign government representatives or private employees who travel to Brazil for an official visit, under a temporary or permanent nature.
### Residence authorisation
The residence authorisation may be granted to foreigners while in Brazil depending on the circumstance. Citizens from countries located on the border of Brazil, as well as those who are from countries that are part of the Mercosul agreement, have a more expedited application process. 
The aforementioned legislation also affects the current individual tax residence rules with respect to foreign individuals in Brazil, which will need to be duly updated by the Brazilian IRS to take into account the new types of visas and new rules for residence authorisation.
## Brazilian Central Bank (BACEN) Reporting Requirement
In July 2020, the BACEN, under Normative Resolution nº. 4,841, raised the total value of assets abroad that requires mandatory annual filing of the Brazilian Central Bank Central Bank Reporting (CBE) from 100,000 to 1 million United States dollars (USD).
According to the new rule, the CBE must be filed by any individual, tax resident in Brazil, who, on 31 December, had total assets equal to or greater than USD 1 million or equivalent in other currencies.
In case of not complying with such obligation, the taxpayer will be assessed to pay penalties.
The deadline for the delivery of such reporting requirements is 5 April, according to the rules annually issued by the BACEN.
In addition, the fiscal residents who hold foreign-held assets and rights where the value is equal to or more than USD 100 million as of 31 March, 30 June, and 30 September of each year must file the Brazilian Central Bank Report on a quarterly basis. 
The non-compliance with the Brazilian Central Bank obligations may subject the individual to penalties that may reach up to BRL 250,000.
## Departure from Brazil
A resident taxpayer of Brazil who leaves the country permanently or becomes a non-tax resident after 12 months outside of the country (due to a temporary departure) must file a Communication of Definitive Departure to the Brazilian tax authorities.
The deadline for filing a Communication of Definitive Departure from Brazil is up to the last business day of February of the calendar year subsequent to the year of departure from Brazil on a permanent or temporary basis, as follows:
  * Permanent departure: as of the date of departure and up to the last business day of February of the subsequent calendar year.
  * Temporary departure: as of the date when the status as a non-resident is typified until the last business day of February of the subsequent calendar year.


Additionally, a resident taxpayer must file a Definitive Departure Income Tax Return, which will comprise the period of fiscal residency in Brazil. The filing deadline of a Definitive Departure Tax Return is the last business day of April of the following calendar year. At that time, the individual must also file any annual Brazilian income tax returns due and not yet filed as well as request for an issuance of a Tax Clearance Certificate before the tax authorities.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 26 December 2022
First of all, it is important to emphasise that the ‘New Migration Law’ (Law 13,445 issued in May 2017) has formally revoked the ‘Foreigner Statute Law’ (Law 6.815/1980) and created new types and characteristics for allowable visas, extended the coverage conditions for the temporary visa, and introduced a new authorisation for residence.
The implementation of the new changes introduced by the 'New Migration Law' will depend on the issuance of regulations by the local authorities, specifically with respect to the procedures for visa issuances, as well as impact the current individual tax residence rules with respect to foreign individuals in Brazil.
Notwithstanding the above, until the new regulation is issued by the Brazilian authorities, the following individuals are considered residents for Brazilian income tax purposes:
  * Brazilian citizens living in Brazil. 
  * Brazilian residents living abroad for the first 12 months subsequent to their departure (in cases where no exit process is filed). 
  * Naturalised foreign nationals living in Brazil. 
  * Foreign national holders of permanent visas and holders of temporary work visas under an employment contract with a Brazilian entity, as of the date of entry to Brazil with such visas. 
  * Individuals who enter into Brazil under a temporary visa to work as a doctor under the program _'Mais Médicos_ ' on the date of arrival. 
  * Foreign nationals holding temporary visas without an employment contract with a Brazilian entity, after completing 183 days of actual physical presence in Brazil (consecutive or not) within a 12-months period. 
  * Nationals from Mercosul States (Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay), as well as from Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, and Peru, who claim temporary residence on the date the work relationship is established or on the date permanent residence is achieved. 


The following individuals are considered non-residents for Brazilian income tax purposes:
  * Brazilians living abroad, as of the date of departure (if the exit process has been filed). 
  * Brazilians living abroad, after 12 months of departure (if the exit process has not been filed). 
  * Foreign nationals holding temporary visas without an employment contract with a Brazilian entity, during their first 183 days of actual physical presence in Brazil (consecutive or not) within a 12-months period.

## Social security contributions
All employees, self-employed individuals, and employers in Brazil are required to make contributions to the social security system.
Social security contributions due by employees are payable monthly, on Brazilian-source salary income, limited to a ceiling cap each month, according to the rates table, as outlined below.
Based on the Social Security Reform approved in November 2019, as of January 2021, employees will be subject to the payment of monthly social security contributions based on progressive rates from 7.5% up to 14% (resulting in a new cap amount of BRL 828.38), replacing the previous rates, as follows:
Contribution salary from (BRL) | Up to (BRL) | Social security rate (%) | Ceiling contribution (BRL)  
---|---|---|---  
0 | 1,212.00 | 7.5 | -  
1,212.01 |  2,427.35 | 9 | -  
2,427.36 | 3,641.03 | 12 | -  
3,641.04 | 7,087.22 | 14 | 828.38  
Social security contributions due by the employer are calculated considering a flat rate of 20% or 22.5%, depending on the industry's sector. In addition to the referred social security contribution, additional social charges are due by the employer, whose rate will depend on its economic activities.
Social security payable by self-employed individuals may be 5%, 11%, or 20% of the ceiling contribution salary, depending on specific conditions of the individual and of the services rendered.
## Corporate social contributions - Specific sectors
Companies that provide certain services (information technology; communication companies; hotel services; integrated circuits design or development; transport companies; aircraft, engines, components, and related equipment maintenance and repair; navigation support maritime, port support, and others) and specific industrial sectors (clothing, leather, fur, textiles, metal products, buttons, and others) should pay social security contributions based on the gross revenue instead of payroll. The tax rates will depend on the respective sector and may reach up to 4.5% levied on the company's net revenue (the precise rate depends on the type of product manufactured and type of services provided by the company).
## Capital gains tax
The capital gain tax is applicable on the sale of real estate, vehicles and objects of art and collectibles sold in Brazil or abroad; on stocks sold in foreign markets, as well as on interest income received from investments located offshore. Non-residents are only subject to capital gains tax resulted from the sale of assets located in Brazil. The gain is calculated on the excess of the sale price over the cost of the asset sold at a tax rate of 15%. However, for tax residents in Brazil, there are certain exemptions applicable that must be observed.
It is also important to emphasise that, as of 1 January 2017, the portion of capital gain that exceeds BRL 5 million will be taxed at higher rates, ranging from 17.5% to the maximum rate of 22.5%, the latter applicable to the portion of capital gain that exceeds BRL 30 million.
## Capital gains tax on Brazilian Variable Incomes
Stocks sold in Brazilian markets or in the over the counter (OTC) market are subject to equity income taxation. Gains on the sale of stocks in the Brazilian stock exchange will be treated as equity income and will be taxed at a flat 15% rate, except for day-trade transactions which are taxed at 20%. There are also certain exemptions applicable that must be observed.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Brazil.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Donations, gifts, and inheritances are liable to taxation in Brazil via the Tax on Inheritances and Gifts (_Imposto sobre Transmissão Causa Mortis e Doações_ or ITCMD). This is a state tax, which means its regime may vary from state to state in Brazil.
As a general rule, the ITCMD tax rate can reach up to 8%, calculated on the value of the assets or rights, or on the amount being transferred to someone.
## Property taxes
_Imposto Predial e Territorial Urbano_ (IPTU) is a property tax levied annually based on the fair market value of property in urban areas at rates that generally vary according to the municipality and location of the property. In the municipality of São Paulo, the basic IPTU rate is 1% for residential properties or 1.5% for commercial properties (both rates may be increased or decreased according to the market value of the property).
_Imposto de Transmissão de Bens Imóveis Inter Vivos_ (ITBI) is a property tax levied at the transfer of immovable property, with rates also varying based on the municipality where the property is located. The ITBI of up to 3% is payable by the acquirer on sales or transfers of real estate.
## Luxury and excise taxes
There are no luxury and excise taxes in Brazil.
