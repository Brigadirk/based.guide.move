## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
As of 2025, a number of legislative changes have come into effect regarding the taxation of income generated by closely held companies (see the section entitled Corporate - Taxes on corporate income below).
As of 2025, the standard VAT rate in Israel increased from 17% to 18%.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year is generally the calendar year. Certain entities may apply to have their tax year-end on different dates, specifically mutual funds, government companies, quoted companies, and subsidiaries of foreign publicly listed companies.
## Tax returns
The Israeli system is based on a combined form of assessment and self-assessment.
The statutory filing date is five months following the end of the tax year, which for a calendar year taxpayer would be 31 May. It is possible, however, to secure extensions of the filing date.
## Payment of tax
Generally, 12 monthly advance payments are levied at a fixed ratio of the company’s turnover. Alternatively, a company may be required to make ten monthly payments beginning in the second month of its tax year, each payment being a fixed percentage of the previous year’s tax assessment.
### Penalties
Penalties are imposed on overdue advance payments and on delays in the submission of tax returns. For any tax due for a certain year that has not been paid by the end of that tax year, the taxpayer shall be charged interest at a rate of 4% and linkage differentials for the period from the end of the tax year until the date of payment. If the balance due is paid by the end of the first month following the end of the tax year, the taxpayer should receive a full exemption from any interest and linkage differentials.
When the ITA determines that a taxpayer has a tax deficiency exceeding 50% of the total tax due and the taxpayer has not proven to the satisfaction of the ITA that it was not negligent in its tax reports filed (or where there was a failure to file reports), a penalty equal to 15% of the tax deficiency shall be imposed.
A penalty equal to 30% of the tax deficiency may be imposed when an additional tax liability exceeding ILS 500,000 is issued by the ITA further to a tax assessment and the tax deficiency is more than 50% of the total tax due (additional conditions apply).
## Tax audit process
A tax return, once filed, constitutes a self-assessment that remains open to review by the ITA generally for four years from the end of the tax year in which the tax return is filed. If no return is filed and a tax officer believes a taxpayer owes tax, the tax officer may issue a ‘best judgement’ assessment without time limit.
An assessment issued by an Assessing Officer may be challenged by the taxpayer in writing within 30 days stating in the objection the reasons why the assessment is not correct. A different Assessing Officer will then review the facts of the case. If following the filing of the objection the taxpayer reaches an agreement with the Assessing Officer, the tax assessment shall be amended and a notice of tax served on the taxpayer. If no agreement is reached, the Assessing Officer may determine the tax by issuing a Written Order, which may confirm, increase, or reduce the original tax assessment. If following the conclusion of the statute of limitation period or within one year after the appeal was submitted, whichever is later, no agreement is reached and no Written Order was issued, then the taxpayer's objection shall be deemed to have been accepted.
An appeal of a Written Order may be made by the taxpayer directly to the Israeli district courts. There is no special tax court system in Israel. A decision of the district court may be appealed to the Supreme Court as a court of civil appeals.
Detailed rules apply to the procedural appeal process.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Some key tax issues that the ITA has focused on recently include:
  * Transfer pricing. 
  * Treaty shopping to reduce WHT and capital gains tax. 
  * WHT on payments to overseas service providers and for payments in regard to software.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
The following are considered to be resident in Israel:
  * A company incorporated in Israel. 
  * A company whose business is managed and controlled from Israel. 


In the absence of a definition of the term ‘management and control’ either in Israeli legislation or a direct discussion of this term by the Israeli courts, it may be difficult to determine whether a company that is incorporated outside of Israel shall be viewed as managed and controlled from Israel. This is a complex subject that needs to be addressed on a case-by-case basis. When an entity is both an Israeli tax resident and a resident of a foreign jurisdiction that is party to an income tax treaty with Israel, most treaties provide a tiebreaker test in the determination of an entity’s tax residency.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Foreign resident entities might be exempt from corporate tax to the extent that its activities do not constitute a PE under the tax treaty applicable between Israel and the foreign resident’s country of residency.
Whether a non-resident has a taxable presence under Israeli domestic tax law is far less clear than the definition of PE under a relevant tax treaty. There is no detailed legislation or Israeli court decisions that directly address this issue. In general, where there is no tax treaty protection, a non-resident is subject to tax on income accrued or derived in Israel, which is a taxation threshold lower than the PE criterion.


# Israel
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
Costs incurred by a branch or a company are deductible as a business expense for tax purposes where they are incurred ‘wholly and exclusively in the production of income’. The amount of the deduction may be limited or disallowed further to other ITO provisions and income tax regulations.
## Depreciation
The ITO and tax regulations prescribe standard annual rates of tax depreciation for assets serving in the production of taxable income. Depreciation is generally on a straight-line basis for industrial and other enterprises based on the specific asset types as set out in the tax regulations.
Accelerated rates of depreciation may be available in regard to certain activities (such as industrial) where there is unusual wear and tear due to additional shifts of equipment use. Detailed rules apply.
Depreciation is not permitted on land.
## Goodwill
In general, under Israeli tax regulations, goodwill purchased may be amortisable by the purchaser over a ten-year period (10% annually).
## Organisational and start-up expenses
Organisational and start-up expenses are generally not immediately deductible but, rather, are to be capitalised for tax purposes.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses incurred in the production of taxable income are generally deductible. Since there are no thin capitalisation rules in Israel, there are no specific debt-to-equity ratio requirements and there is no limit to the amount of debt that may be used in establishing a branch or local company operation in Israel. Interest and linkage payments arising from late tax payments are generally not deductible for tax purposes. Interest charges between related parties must be set based on transfer pricing principles. Detailed rules apply.
## Bad debt
Provisions for bad debts are deductible in the year in which it is evident that the debt has become irrecoverable. Detailed rules apply for making this determination.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions do not constitute a regular business expense. However, a tax credit may be available (_see Tax credit for donations in the section_).
## Research and development (R&D) costs
Special tax relief is provided under the ITO for R&D costs incurred (_see the section_).
## Pension expense
Pension fund contributions made to recognised funds are generally deductible for the employer, provided, _inter alia_ , the contributions do not exceed a prescribed level and are effected on a regular basis.
## Directors’ fees
Payments for commercially justifiable director fees should generally be deductible.
## Accrued expenses
Payments are generally deductible on an accrual basis for commercially justifiable expenses representing arm’s-length consideration. However, when payments made to foreign residents attract WHT, the deduction will generally be allowed, provided the payment is effected within the tax year. Alternatively, such payments may be deductible in a tax year if the applicable WHT is deducted within three months after the tax year-end and remitted to the tax authorities within seven days of the deduction, together with index linkage differences and interest accrued since the year-end.
However, accrued expenses for severance pay, vacation pay, recreation pay, holiday allowances, and sick pay are not deductible, even if there is an obligation to make these payments. They are only deductible in the year in which they are actually paid to the beneficiary or to a recognised fund.
## Contingent liabilities
Based on Israeli court decisions, contingent liabilities may be deductible for tax purposes upon satisfying the following criterion: (i) according to accepted accounting principles, the taxpayer must include in its balance sheet a suitable provision for the potential liability; otherwise, its income will be considered to have been incorrectly reported; (ii) the circumstances of the case and the technical means according to accepted accounting practice must be provided, enabling a determination of the amount of the liability; and (iii) there is a high probability that the potential debt with respect to which the provision was made will become an absolute debt.
## Excess (disallowed) expenses
Israeli tax law disallows the partial deduction of certain employee-related expenses incurred by a company doing business in Israel. These include so-called ‘excess expenses’. Examples of these are (i) payments for business, travel, and meals that exceed allowable deductions; (ii) expenses incurred in respect of a benefit granted by an employer to its employees but that cannot be attributed to a particular employee; and (iii) certain vehicle maintenance expenses (all expenses relating to a company-owned vehicle that was also designated for use of an employee are generally tax deductible as the employee is taxed in this regard upon an imputed amount).
A company is obligated to pay a monthly advance on excess expenses in the amount of 45% of the excess expense. The amount paid as an advance in respect of excess expenses is deemed a payment on account of the regular tax advances and payments that the company must pay for corporate tax and is offset against them, but it is not refundable (i.e. when a taxpayer’s tax liability in a given year is lower than the excess expense advances paid, the unutilised amount shall be carried forward to future tax years). Detailed rules apply.
## Fines and penalties
Payment of fines and penalties are generally not deductible.
## Taxes
Municipality taxes incurred in the production of taxable income are generally deductible.
## Net operating losses
Business losses can be offset against income from any source in the same year. Loss carrybacks are not allowed. Losses may be carried forward and set-off without time limit against income from any trade or business or capital gains arising in the business, but not against income from any other source.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments of interest, royalties, and management fees to foreign affiliates are deductible if based on normal commercial terms and practices and evidenced by an inter-company agreement and transfer pricing documentation. Where such payments attract WHT, the deduction will only be allowed where such tax has been withheld and paid in accordance with certain requirements. All cross-border payments to foreign affiliates for goods and services have to comply with arm’s-length pricing standards (_see Transfer pricing in the section_).


# Israel
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
As a general rule, a parent company and its subsidiaries may not submit consolidated tax returns. Only groups of industrial companies in the same line of business, as well as parent companies that control industrial companies in the same line of business and have at least 80% of their assets invested in industrial companies, are eligible to file consolidated tax returns.
## Transfer pricing
The ITO and its accompanying regulations contain elaborate transfer pricing provisions, including the arm’s-length principle, that apply to any international transaction in which there is a special relationship between the parties to the transaction and for which a price was settled on for property, a right, a service, or credit. In general, the regulations are based upon internationally recognised transfer pricing principles (i.e. US tax regulations or Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] rules). These regulations generally require the taxpayer to support the pricing of international transactions with a transfer pricing study, inter-company agreements, and other documentation. In accordance to Israeli High Court Rulings, the terms of transaction conducted between related parties should be set in written contracts.
A taxpayer is required to include in its annual corporate tax return a special form entitled ‘Declaration of International Transactions’ providing details for every cross-border transaction conducted with related parties. In December 2022, the ITA updated the transfer pricing form that is submitted annually within the tax return of an Israeli taxpayer reporting each inter-company transaction. This form includes requirements to disclose whether or not the company is following local safe harbour rules relevant to certain activities, and a new disclosure as to whether the company has local compliant transfer pricing documentation for the reported related-party transaction. As each form needs to be signed by the taxpayer, companies will need to carefully consider their local Israeli documentation compliance in respect to this increased disclosure within the corporate tax return.
In 2022, Israeli transfer pricing legislation has been amended to include two new sections adding the requirement for a Country-by-Country (CBC) Report and setting the legal foundation for a Master File requirement. With both of these amendments, Israel has now joined the many countries that have formally adopted requirements aligned with Action 13 of the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative and as detailed within Chapter V of the OECD Guidelines.
Since transfer pricing is a subject that receives considerable attention from the ITA in its examination of related inter-company transactions, transfer pricing principles and documentation requirements should be carefully adhered to.
## Thin capitalisation
Israel has no statutory or regulatory provisions or other rules concerning thin capitalisation for tax purposes as exist in certain other jurisdictions. Since there are no thin capitalisation rules and Israel has no specific debt-to-equity ratio requirements, a company may be financed with minimum capital, and there is no limit to the amount of debt that may be used. Transfer pricing principles shall generally apply with regards to interest charges.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Under the CFC regime in Israeli tax law, an Israeli company or individual may be taxed on a proportion of certain undistributed profits of certain Israeli-controlled, non-resident companies in which the Israeli shareholder has a controlling interest (10% or more of any of the CFC’s ‘means of control’). A CFC is a company to which a number of cumulative conditions apply, including that most of its income or profits in the tax year were derived from passive sources (e.g. capital gains, interest, rental, dividend, royalties) and such passive income has been subject to an effective tax rate that does not exceed 15%.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
A branch is liable for tax at the standard corporate rate on Israel-source income. No tax is withheld on transfers of after-tax profits to the foreign head office upon receiving a withholding tax (WHT) clearance from the Israel Tax Authority (ITA).

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
## Foreign tax credit
Double taxation is avoided by way of a foreign tax credit mechanism that also applies unilaterally in the absence of an applicable DTT. The foreign tax credit is limited to the Israeli corporate tax payable with respect to the same income. Foreign-sourced income is divided into 'baskets' (i.e. categories) on the basis of the income source (e.g. dividends, business income), and a particular credit limitation applies to each basket. Excess uncredited foreign income can be carried forward for the subsequent five tax years.
## Preferred Enterprise (PFE) regime
PFE status, which provides for tax benefits, may be granted under the Law of Encouragement of Capital Investments (‘the Law’) to enterprises that meet relevant criteria. In general, the Law provides that projects are considered ‘preferred’ if the enterprise will contribute to the development of the productive capacity of the economy, absorption of immigrants, creation of employment opportunities, or improvement in the balance of payments.
### Eligible income (qualifying PFE income)
In order to qualify as a PFE, a company must, _inter alia_ , generate ‘preferred income’, as defined in Section 51 of the Law, which is income that was produced or arose in the course of the enterprise's ordinary activity in Israel, excluding income from an intangible asset, which is not attributed to manufacturing (specific rules apply), and if it was produced by a Preferred Technology Enterprise (_as described below_) it was not considered as Qualifying Preferred Technology Enterprise income. To qualify it must be from one or more of the below types of income:
  1. Income from the sale of products manufactured in that factory.
  2. Income from the sales of products that are semiconductors produced in another factory, which is not owned by a relative of the owner of the factory, according to know-how developed by the factory.
  3. Income from granting permission to use know-how or computer software developed by the enterprise, as well as income from royalties received for the said use that the Director of the Israeli Tax Authority approved is connected to the productive activities of the enterprise in Israel.
  4. Income from services connected to sales as stated in (i) and (ii) above, and also from services connected to the right to use know-how or computer software or to the royalties stated in (iii).
  5. Income from industrial R&D for a foreign resident, provided there has been given an approval from the Israeli Innovation Authority. 


### Marketing and economic qualifying factors
In order to qualify for tax benefits under the Law, the Law requires that the enterprise will be considered as an industrial enterprise (i.e. an enterprise whose main activity in the tax year is a productive activity) and will meet one of the following conditions each year:
  * Its main activity is bio-technology or nano-technology (an approval in this regard should be received from the Director of the Department of Industrial Research and Development prior to approval of the PFE).
  * Its revenue during the tax year from sales in a specific country or separate customs duties territory does not exceed 75% from its total revenue for that tax year.
  * 25% or more of its revenue during the tax year is derived from sales in a specific country or in a separate customs duty territory that has a population of at least 14 million.


### Corporate tax rates
The PFE corporate tax rate is 7.5% for operations in ‘development area A’ and 16% for operations outside development area A.
R&D centres will not be entitled to any reduced corporate tax rate if the direct or indirect controlling shareholders or the direct or indirect beneficiaries (entitled to 25% or more of the income or profits of the R&D centre) are Israeli residents.
### Dividend WHT rate
The WHT rate applicable to dividends from PFE profits is 20%, which may be reduced under certain tax treaties.
## Special Preferred Enterprise (SPFE) regime
### Key eligibility conditions
The SPFE regime is intended for very large companies with material investments in productive assets, R&D, or in providing new employment opportunities. A company must demonstrate that it will greatly contribute to the Israeli economy to qualify for the SPFE regime.
To qualify, an Israeli company must meet certain conditions, such as having SPFE annual revenue greater than or equal to ILS 1 billion and being part of a group of companies that generates annual revenues greater than or equal to ILS 10 billion in the same industrial sector in which the Israeli company operates.
### Corporate tax rates
The SPFE corporate tax rate is 5% for operations in development area A and 8% for operations outside of development area A for ten years. After ten years, the PFE tax rates shall apply unless the company has a new investment program that requalifies the company again for SPFE status.
### Dividend WHT rate
The WHT rate applicable to dividends from SPFE profits continues to be 20%, which may be reduced under certain tax treaties. 
## Preferred Technology Enterprise (PTE) regime
### Key eligibility conditions
To be eligible for the PTE regime, a company must engage in the technology sector and be part of a group of companies with aggregate annual revenues less than ILS 10 billion and meet one of the following two tests:
  * The enterprise's average R&D expenses in the three years prior to the current tax year must be greater than or equal to 7% of the company's total revenues or exceed ILS 75 million per year. The company also must satisfy one of the following conditions: 
    * At least 20% of the company's employees are employees whose salaries are fully recorded as R&D expenses in the company's books, or the company has at least 200 such employees.
    * A venture capital fund has invested at least ILS 8 million in the company and the company has not changed its field of business since this investment was made.
    * During the three years prior to the current tax year, the company's revenue grew on average by 25% or more in relation to the preceding tax year and the revenue was at least ILS 10 million in each year.
    * During the three years prior to the current tax year, the company increased its number of employees each year by an average of 25% or more in relation to the preceding tax year and the company had at least 50 employees in each tax year.
  * The company obtained an approval from the Israeli Innovation Authority (formerly known as the Office of the Chief Scientist).


Qualifying PTE income is such income that is derived by the enterprise in the ordinary course of its business from preferred intangible assets that are wholly or partially owned by the enterprise or that the enterprise has a right to use and includes, _inter alia_ , income from the following sources:
  * Granting the right to use the preferred intangible asset.
  * Services based on a software.
  * Products produced by the enterprise using a preferred intangible asset.
  * Accompanying or supporting products to computer software or a product that is directly connected to the preferred intangible asset (specific rules apply).
  * Accompanying or supporting services to computer software or a product that is directly connected to the preferred intangible asset.
  * R&D services that do not exceed 15% of the enterprise's total income.
  * Other types of income that will be included by the Finance Ministry, including,_inter alia_ , generic pharmaceuticals. 


Income that is not treated as qualifying income includes, _inter alia_ , the following:
  * Income attributed to production that can be eligible for the PFE tax rates.
  * Income from an intangible asset, which does not qualify as a preferred intangible asset (detailed definitional rules apply), that is used for marketing purposes.
  * Additional types of income to be specified by the Ministry of Finance.


Detailed definitional rules apply.
### Corporate tax rates
Under the PTE regime, reduced corporate tax rates of 7.5% for operations in development area A or 12% for operations outside of development area A shall apply on qualifying income, subject to detailed rules. These corporate tax rates shall apply only with respect to the portion of intellectual property (IP) developed in Israel, based on a nexus approach. 
### Capital gain on sale of IP
Companies that sell IP to a related foreign company may qualify for a reduced 12% capital gains tax rate, provided that the company acquired the IP from a foreign company after 1 January 2017 for at least ILS 200 million, subject to the approval of the Israeli Innovation Authority.
### Dividend WHT rate
A reduced 4% WHT rate may apply to dividends paid to a foreign company, provided that at least 90% of the payer's shares are held by foreign resident companies.
For other dividend distributions, the WHT rate shall be 20%, which may be reduced under certain tax treaties.
## Special Preferred Technology Enterprise (SPTE) regime
### Key eligibility conditions
To be eligible for the SPTE regime, a company must meet the eligibility conditions of a PTE above and be part of a group of companies with aggregate annual revenues of at least ILS 10 billion.
### Corporate tax rates
Under the SPTE regime, a reduced corporate tax rate of 6% shall apply on qualifying income, subject to detailed qualifying rules. The reduced tax rate shall apply only with respect to the portion of IP developed in Israel based on a nexus approach. 
### Capital gain on sale of IP
Companies that sell IP to a related foreign company may qualify for a reduced 6% capital gains tax rate, provided that the company developed or acquired the IP from a foreign company after 1 January 2017, subject to the approval of the Israeli Innovation Authority.
### Dividend WHT rate
The dividend WHT rates are the same as under the PTE regime, _discussed above_.
## Approved Enterprise (AE) grants
Under the Law, an AE operating in ’development area A‘ may be eligible for grants on investments in fixed assets from the Israeli Investments centre, at a rate of 20% of the approved investment. An AE operating in some areas in the North of Israel, in Gaza strip, and in the Negev area may be eligible for an additional grant of up to 10% of the approved investment. Detailed rules apply.
## Approved Enterprise (AE) and Benefitted Enterprise (BE) regimes (for companies established prior to 2011)
Prior to the enactment of the incentive regimes addressed above, there were other incentive regimes that allowed for a variety of tax benefits.
The AE and BE regimes discussed below were tax incentive programs granted to operations qualifying under the Law prior to the Law's amendments in 2005 and 2011. The AE and BE regimes included, in some cases, a temporary tax benefit that income generated was tax exempt from corporate tax until such time that the income was distributed from the enterprise, which triggered, at that time, a claw-back of corporate tax.
As some companies may still have income subject to the rules of prior regimes, we set out below certain key tax highlights.
### Reduced tax rates
In addition to financial incentives for the establishment or expansion of an AE/BE, various tax incentives apply when a new AE/BE or expansion thereof is operational.
The reduced tax rates generally apply for a seven-year benefit period (or a ten-year period in certain cases of local companies established in development area A or in the case of a foreign investor company, _see below_), commencing with the year in which the AE/BE first generated taxable income.
Generally, this seven or ten-year period of benefits is limited to 12 years from the year of implementation. For AE plans governed prior to the 2005 amendment to the Law, the period of benefits cannot extend beyond 12 years from the year the enterprise commenced its operations or beyond 14 years from the year in which approval of status as an AE was granted, whichever is earlier.
### Locally owned companies
Income derived by a company from an AE/BE during the maximum seven-year period of benefits is generally subject to corporate tax at a rate of 25%.
A WHT rate of 15% (subject to a possible reduction under a tax treaty) applies to dividends paid from profits of an AE/BE earned during the benefits period if distributed either during the benefits period or during the subsequent 12 years.
### Foreign investors’ companies (FICs)
A company that qualifies as an FIC is entitled to enhanced tax benefits on AE/BE income. In general, an FIC is a company having more than 25% of its share capital (in terms of rights to shares, profits, voting, and the appointment of directors) and its combined share capital and investor loan capital owned by foreign residents. To qualify for FIC status, a foreign investor must make an investment in the company of at least ILS 5 million.
An FIC benefits from reduced corporate tax on the profits of an AE/BE for a period of ten years (instead of seven years) commencing with the first year in which taxable income is generated. The total period of benefits is restricted as discussed above. The reduced corporate tax rate depends on the level of foreign ownership as shown below:
Percentage of foreign ownership | Corporate tax rate (%)  
---|---  
Over 25% but less than 49% | 25  
49% or more but less than 74% | 20  
74% or more but less than 90% | 15  
90% or more | 10  
Dividends paid by an FIC out of the profits of its AE/BE are subject to tax in the hands of the recipient at the rate of 15% (subject to a reduced tax rate under an applicable tax treaty), without limitation as to their distribution date, provided the dividends are distributed out of AE/BE profits derived during the benefits period.
### Alternative system of tax benefits (tax holiday)
Companies with new or expanding AEs/BEs were entitled to elect to forego all government cash grants and receive, instead, a total exemption (i.e. tax holiday) from corporate tax on undistributed profits of the AE/BE for ten years in development area A, for six years in development area B, and for two years in development area C. The area of incentive is the area in which the company’s facilities are located.
The tax holiday provides an Israeli tax exemption so long as the AE/BE profits generated in the exemption period are retained within the company. Should a subsequent distribution of such profits occur, corporate tax and dividend WHT is imposed on the income distributed, at the rates which would have been applicable if the tax holiday had not been elected (i.e. 25% or at a lower rate if the company is an FIC with a foreign ownership percentage of 49% or more during those years).
Israeli companies who distribute tax-exempt profits generated in their Approved and Benefitted Enterprise regimes of the Encouragement Law ('trapped profits') are generally subject to a claw-back of the corporate tax deferred on those profits at rates of 10% to 25% upon distribution. In order to encourage companies to release their 'trapped profits' accumulated until 31 December 2020, the Budget Law passed in November 2021 included special legislation (the Trapped Profits Law) that allows 'trapped profits' upon distribution to be entitled to a reduction of up to 40% of the corporate tax rate but not less than a 6% corporate tax rate. This applies for distributions made during a one-year period starting from 15 November 2021. 
The Trapped Profits Law, however, eliminated the ability of companies upon distribution of profits to determine that the pool of profits being distributed should not be attributed to tax exempted profits, which had prevented the triggering of the claw-back of tax on the distribution. Under the new legislation, effective for profits distributed from 15 August 2021, all dividends distributed by a company that have 'trapped profits' shall be required to recognise a portion of the dividend as being sourced from the 'trapped profits', which shall trigger the claw-back of corporate tax. The determined amount shall be based on the proportion of 'trapped profits' to all company profits available for distribution.
The Trapped Profits Law has not been renewed but should be monitored for developments.
Under certain anti-avoidance provisions applicable to tax holidays, amounts directly or indirectly paid or credited by an AE to a relative, a major shareholder, or to a related entity controlled by either a relative or a major shareholder may be treated as a deemed taxable distribution of profits by the AE.
### Ireland track and strategic investment track
For companies having an AE/BE in development area A that seeks to distribute dividends while maintaining a low company and dividend tax burden, there was an ‘Ireland track’ under which the aggregate Israeli corporate and dividend WHT for a foreign resident shareholder is 15% and for an Israeli resident shareholder is 24.8%. This track is in contrast to the standard alternative benefit track discussed above, which provides a tax holiday, provided that profits remain undistributed.
Furthermore, a ‘strategic investment track’ allowed for an exemption during the benefit period from corporate tax and dividend WHT for a company having (depending on its location within area A of the country) very significant investment and revenue levels. This means that during the benefits period, a company eligible for benefits from income accrued under this track will have no tax liability whatsoever for its productive activity arising from such investment and for the distribution of profits. Detailed rules apply to these tracks. 
## Incentives for investments in technological companies 
The Law for the Encouragement of Knowledge-Intensive Industry (‘**the New Angel's Law** ‘) entered into force on 25 July 2023 and is a special law that encourages investment in the Israeli high-tech industry. The New Angel's Law provides different tracks for private investors and for technological companies investing in other technological companies, Israeli or foreign, under certain conditions. The main benefit tracks in the New Angels Law are the following:
### Benefits for private investors
Under the New Angel's Law, private investors (including partnerships established for the purpose of investing in a specific company and some minimal-shareholder companies [detailed rules apply]) can be eligible for a tax credit equal to the capital gains tax rate relevant to the investor multiplied by the investment amount in an Israeli ’R&D Company‘. The maximum investment amount in a specific ’R&D Company‘ is ILS 4 million. Additional detailed rules apply.
An ‘R&D company’ is an Israeli Company, which is not traded, that meets certain conditions, including, among others:
  * A ’Preferred Company‘ that meets the conditions of a PTE.
  * Its preferred technological income does not exceed ILS 4 million from the day it incorporated and its total income does not exceed ILS 12 million.
  * The total amount of investments and loans in it, from the day it incorporated, does not exceed ILS 12 million.
  * 70% of its expenses are, directly or indirectly, expenses that relate to the development of its owned IP.


Alternatively, such private investors can be eligible for a postponement in payment of capital gains tax in selling shares of a ’Qualifying Company‘ (a ’Preferred Company‘ with a PTE) in the event of performing an alternative investment in one or more ’R&D Company‘ in the period of 12 months from the sale or in the four months before it. The amount that the investor can deduct in the capital gain tax calculation is the least from the real capital gain from the sale / the investment amount in the ’R&D company‘ / ILS 5.5 million.
Both tracks are subject to receiving auditor's approvals for meeting the conditions of an ’R&D Company’.
### Benefits for technological companies investing in other technological companies
Under the New Angel's Law, technological companies (a ‘Preferred Company’ with a PTE) investing in other technological companies, Israeli or foreign, can be entitled to deduct their investment, over five years, starting the year after gaining ’control‘ (at least 80%) of the purchased technological company.
In the event that the purchased company is an Israeli technological company, it needs to be a ’Preferred Company‘ with a PTE that owns a ’preferred intangible asset‘ and that was not related to the purchasing company in the year before the year of the investment.
In the event that the purchased company is a foreign company, (i) it needs to own a ’preferred intangible asset‘, (ii) its R&D expenses must exceed 7% of its income (if the percentage is between 5% and 7%, an approval can be received from the Israeli Innovation Authority), (iii) its R&D expenses must be at least ILS 20 million; (iv) the foreign company must not be related to the purchasing company from the day it incorporated; and (v) the IP and activity of the purchased company must be transferred to Israel in a period of 12 months from the investment as part of a ’business combination‘ (as defined in the regulations to the Law).
In addition, when the purchased company is a foreign company, an approval from the Israeli Innovation Authority is needed and the investment amount needs to be at least 20 million United States dollars (USD). Additional detailed rules apply.
### Exemption on interest paid to a qualifying Israeli high-tech company to a foreign financial institution
An exemption for interest, as well as income from discount on a loan (and foreign exchange gains), is available in qualifying cases further to the New Angel's Law.
There are detailed qualifying rules, including, _inter alia_ , the following:
  * It applies for Israeli publicly traded companies and for Israeli companies that are not publicly traded in Israel that have a PTE that had high-tech income over ILS 30 million in the tax year preceding the receiving year of the loan. For non-publicly traded companies, there is also a requirement that the company has Israeli resident individuals who own (directly or indirectly) at least 5% of the company's shares. 
  * Companies publicly traded outside of Israel also can qualify upon meeting certain rules.
  * It applies to loans of at least USD 10 million from a foreign financial entity (as defined in the Law) that is a resident in a country that has a tax treaty with Israel.
  * The loan is intended to finance the company’s ongoing activities (including the purchase of companies).
  * The lender and borrower are unrelated parties.
  * The lender nor any of its affiliates have a PE in Israel that is engaged in the business of providing large loans.
  * The Israeli company's number of employees and costs of salaries did not decrease more than 30% in comparison to the year preceding the year the loan is received.
  * The Israeli company is required to notify the Israeli tax authorities of the loan in the manner and within the time period set out in the Law.


## Other research and development (R&D) incentives
### Deduction of R&D costs
Under special relief provided under the ITO, which was enacted for the purpose of encouraging taxpayers to invest in R&D activities, R&D costs can generally be deductible for tax purposes even when they represent capital costs.
The ITO provision generally distinguishes between two types of investors in R&D projects:
  * The R&D project is conducted or sponsored by the owner of an enterprise in the fields of industry, agriculture, transportation, and energy, and it is intended to develop this enterprise.
  * The R&D costs are borne by a taxpayer that is not the owner of an enterprise in the above-mentioned fields or the taxpayer participates in R&D costs of another developer in consideration for a reasonable return, when such R&D projects also enjoy government grants.


In regard to the first group of taxpayers, the R&D expenses shall be deducted in the tax year incurred when such expense has been approved as an R&D expense by the relevant government department (the approval in regard to industrial related projects is generally granted by the Israeli Innovation Authority [previously called the Office of the Chief Scientist]). When such approval is not obtained, the expense shall be deducted over three tax years.
The R&D expenses incurred by the second group of taxpayers shall generally be deducted over two tax years. The deductible expenses allowed to a participant in R&D costs of another developer generally may not exceed 40% of the taxable income of the investor in the year in which the expenses had been incurred.
## Tax credit for donations
A tax credit is granted in respect of donations to approved state and charitable institutions aggregating at least ILS 207 (for 2025) in a tax year. The donor is allowed a tax credit equal to the amount of the contribution times the corporate tax rate applicable during the year, provided the amount eligible for the credit does not exceed the lower of the following: (i) 30% of the corporation’s taxable income in that year or (ii) ILS 10,354,816 (in 2025). The above figures are adjusted each year according to the CPI. Excess unused tax credits may be carried forward for three years, subject to detailed rules.
## Incentive to promote foreign investment in Israeli corporate bonds
In order to promote foreign investment in the Israeli corporate bonds market, there is an exemption from tax with respect to interest income received by foreign investors on their commercial investments in Israeli corporate bonds traded on the Tel Aviv stock exchange (TASE). The exemption is not granted to a foreign investor that has a PE in Israel or is related to, or holds 10% more of the means of control in, the investee company. In addition, in order for the exemption to apply to a foreign investor that has ‘special relations’ with the investee company, regularly sells products to or provides services to the investee company, or is employed by the investee company, the investor must prove that the interest rate on the corporate bond was determined in good faith.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
Under Israeli domestic tax law, WHT on payments of Israeli-source income is generally deducted at the corporate tax rate from all income remittances abroad, unless a tax certificate is obtained from the ITA authorising withholding-exempt remittances or a reduced rate of tax pursuant to an applicable tax treaty.
Set out below is a listing of WHT rates for dividends, interest, and royalties under domestic tax law and pursuant to tax treaties in force. Detailed rules apply under certain tax treaties for eligibility to the treaty-reduced rates (e.g. beneficial ownership, having no PE in Israel). The applicable tax treaty should be consulted to determine the relevant WHT rate and to examine detailed conditions that may apply for the specific circumstance. 
Israel has adopted the Multilateral Instrument (MLI) amendments to tax treaties. The changes to the DTTs provided for in the MLI will generally apply for those Israeli treaties when the country treaty partner has also ratified the MLI in their respective country and for those provisions on which both countries have not submitted reservations to the OECD. Therefore, in examining treaty eligibility for reduced WHT rates, it is important to examine the relevant treaty together with its MLI amendments as applicable (e.g. amended provisions regarding residency).

  81. 5% for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic, or scientific work, including cinematograph films or films or tapes used for radio or television broadcasting.
  82. 5% if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a real estate investment fund that is a resident of Israel) that directly holds at least 10% of the voting power in the company paying the dividends throughout a 365-day period that includes the day of payment of the dividend (for the purposes of computing that period, no account shall be taken of changes of ownership that would directly result from a corporate reorganisation, such as a merger or divisive reorganisation, of the company that holds the shares or that pays the dividend).
  83. 5% applies in the case of certain pension funds or financial institutions.

## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
## Choice of business entities
Investments and business operations in Israel may be structured in a variety of ways. The following are the common types of business entities in Israel: (i) Israeli public or private company; (ii) foreign company in Israel (i.e. a branch); (iii) Israeli general or limited partnership; (iv) foreign general or limited partnership; (v) other entities such as cooperative societies; and (vi) other arrangements (e.g. contractual joint ventures).
## Mergers and acquisitions
Israeli tax law allows for non-taxable reorganisations in situations in which the ownership and business enterprise of the original parties is continued after the reorganisation takes place, allowing for the deferral of the tax liability until the shares or assets transferred in such reorganisations are actually sold. Different qualifying requirements and conditions apply (e.g. obtaining a ruling from the ITA in certain cases), depending upon the tax residency of the parties and the type of transfer.
## US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) in Israel
A Model Reciprocal Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) was signed by Israel and the United States on 30 June 2014 and was ratified on 12 July 2016. The IGA took effect on 4 August 2016, once the Ministry of Finance published the relevant tax code regulations.
The IGA provides clarity around the implementation of FATCA for the financial institutions and investment entities resident in Israel.
In addition, the ITA released FATCA Guidance in May 2017.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS) in Israel
Israel has been implementing the CRS since 2019. The FATCA law that was passed by the Knesset (Israeli Parliament) on 12 July 2016 also serves as the primary legislation for purposes of the CRS. The secondary legislation (Israeli Tax Code CRS Regulations) was approved by the Finance Committee of the Knesset on 1 January 2019. Israeli financial institutions submitted their first CRS returns in 2019, covering both 2017 and 2018 years.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
In general, the annual results (i.e. the excess of income over expenses or _vice versa_) of an Israeli company or branch, as detailed in the taxpayer’s financial statements, form the basis for computing the taxable income of the business.
The base amount is then adjusted pursuant to the provisions of the tax law to arrive at ‘taxable income’.
## Inventory valuation
Inventories are generally valued at the lower of cost or market value (i.e. net realisable value). Conformity is required between book and tax reporting of inventory. The first in first out (FIFO) or weighted-average basis of valuation is acceptable; the last in first out (LIFO) method is not accepted.
## Capital gains
Capital gains tax is generally payable on capital gains by residents of Israel on the sale of assets (irrespective of the location of the assets) and by non-residents on the sale of the following:
  * Assets located in Israel.
  * Assets located abroad that are essentially a direct or indirect right to an asset or to inventory, or that are an indirect right to a real estate right or to an asset in a real estate association, located in Israel. Taxation applies only in respect of that part of the consideration that stems from the above property located in Israel.
  * Assets that are a share or the right to a share in an Israeli entity.
  * Assets that are a right in a foreign resident entity that is essentially a direct or indirect right to property located in Israel. Taxation applies only with respect to that part of the consideration that stems from the property located in Israel.


The cashless transfer of rights and assets arising from certain mergers, spin-offs, and asset transfers may be exempt from tax upon meeting various requirements.
### Determination of the capital gain
Corporate tax on capital gains is imposed on the disposal of fixed and intangible assets where the disposal price is in excess of the depreciated cost.
### Computation of real gain and inflationary components
For tax purposes, the capital gain is generally calculated in local currency, and there are provisions for segregating the taxable gain into its real and inflationary components. The inflationary amount is the original cost of the asset, less depreciation (where applicable), multiplied by the percentage increase in the Israeli consumer price index (CPI) from the date of acquisition of the asset to the date of its sale. The inflationary amount component is exempt to the extent it accrued after 1 January 1994 and is generally subject to tax at the rate of 10% if it accrued before that date.
The real gain component, if any, is taxed at the rates set out further below.
A non-resident that invests in capital assets with foreign currency may elect to calculate the inflationary amount in that foreign currency. Under this option, in the event of a sale of shares in an Israeli company, the inflationary amount attributable to exchange differences on the investment is always exempt from Israeli tax.
### Sale of assets (including publicly and non-publicly traded shares)
The real gain is generally subject to tax at the corporate tax rate applicable in the year of the gain (23% in 2025). Special exemptions may apply for non-residents (_see further below_).
### Special rule for retained profits upon sale of shares
Special provisions apply to part of the real gain that is attributed to the seller’s share of retained profits in the case of a sale of (i) non-traded shares that were acquired prior to 1 January 2003 or (ii) publicly traded shares where the seller was a 10% or more shareholder.
In the case of a disposal by corporations of (i) non-traded shares and (ii) traded shares when the seller generally directly or indirectly holds at least 10% of the sold Israeli company during the 12-month period preceding the sale, special provisions apply to such part of the real gain that is attributed to the seller’s share of retained profits. The share of retained profits is the amount of gain equal to the proportional part of the retained profits of the company that the seller of the shares would have rights to by virtue of those shares. Detailed rules apply in determining this profit component.
Generally, the seller’s proportionate part of the company’s retained profits is taxed as if this amount had been received as dividends immediately before the sale (i.e. at a tax rate of 0% in the case of an Israeli-resident corporate shareholder or at a tax rate of 30% when the seller is a non-Israeli resident corporate shareholder that generally holds 10% or more in the rights of the Israeli company [it is unclear if this 30% rate may be reduced by an applicable tax treaty]). The part of the retained profits that is attributed to the period ending on 31 December 2002 is subject to tax at the rate of 10%.
### Special exemptions for non-residents
#### Publicly traded Israeli shares
Non-residents corporations not having a PE in Israel are exempt from tax on capital gains from the sale of shares of an Israeli company traded on the Israeli stock exchange or on a foreign stock exchange. Certain exceptions apply.
Where the shares were purchased by the non-resident prior to being publicly traded, _subject to the availability of exemptions detailed below_ , capital gains tax might apply for the portion of the gain that was generated up to the day of the share’s public listing but not to exceed the capital gain actually arising upon the sale of the share and provided that the value on the day of public listing was more than their value on the date of purchase and that the proceeds upon sale exceeded the value on the date of purchase.
#### Non-publicly traded shares
For purchases after 1 January 2009, an exemption exists under domestic law for non-residents, regardless of their percentage holding in an Israeli company, from gains derived from the sale of securities not traded on a stock exchange, provided the following conditions are met:
  * The investment is not in a company in which, on the date of its purchase and in the two preceding years, the main value of the assets held by the company, directly or indirectly, were sourced from an interest in (i) real estate or in a real estate association (as defined in the Income Tax Ordinance [ITO]); (ii) the use in real estate or any asset attached to land; (iii) exploitation of natural resources in Israel; or (iv) produce from land in Israel.
  * The capital gains were not derived by the seller’s PE in Israel.
  * The shares were not purchased from a relative (as defined in the ITO) or by means of a tax-free reorganisation.


A non-resident company shall not be eligible for this exemption if Israeli residents are controlling shareholders or benefit or are entitled to 25% or more of the income or profits of the non-resident company, either directly or indirectly.
For shares purchased between 1 July 2005 and 1 January 2009, more restrictive conditions apply in order to be eligible for the exemption. Detailed rules apply.
#### Treaty exemption
Non-residents may qualify for a tax treaty capital gain exemption, depending upon the particular circumstances and the provisions of the applicable tax treaty (e.g. in some tax treaties, no capital gains exemption is allowed where the holding in the sold Israeli company exceeds a certain percentage).
When assets are attributable to an Israeli PE or are real estate rights (including rights in a real estate association), a treaty exemption will generally not be available.
The ITA is very sensitive to treaty shopping, and it will be necessary to demonstrate to the ITA that the foreign holding entity has business substance in its country of residence and that the structuring of the holding through that entity was not implemented for tax treaty benefit purposes.
## Capital losses
Capital losses may offset all capital gains (including gains from Israeli or foreign securities) and gains from the sale of property (whether Israeli or foreign source).
Where the capital loss is from a non-Israeli asset (including when carried forward into future years), the loss must first be offset against foreign-source capital gains.
Capital losses derived from the sale of securities may also be offset against interest and dividend income generated from the sold security and also against interest and dividend income received from other securities (where the income was not subject to tax of more than 25%).
Capital losses from the sale of shares are generally reduced by any dividends received by the selling corporation during the 24 months preceding the sale, unless tax on the dividends of at least 15% was paid.
Capital losses can generally be carried forward indefinitely and set-off only against capital gains.
## Exit tax
When an Israeli tax resident, including a company, ceases to be an Israeli resident for tax purposes, its assets are deemed to have been sold one day before it ceased being an Israeli resident. Although exit tax is primarily applicable to individuals, this might also apply to corporations incorporated outside of Israel whose management and control is transferred from Israel to another jurisdiction at a particular time.
Any gain attributable to the deemed sale of assets may be paid on the day the residency ceased or it may be postponed until the date the assets are actually realised. When the tax event is deferred to the sale date of the assets, the amount of the Israeli capital gain portion is determined by taking the real capital gain at the time of realisation, multiplied by the period of ownership from the day on which it acquired the asset until the day it ceased being an Israeli resident, divided by the entire period from the day of the asset’s acquisition until the day of realisation. The exit tax provisions do not apply for those Israeli assets that in any event are subject to tax in Israel upon their sale. The Minister of Finance is authorised to prescribe provisions for the implementation of the exit tax, including provisions for the prevention of double taxation and the submission of tax reports, but no provisions have yet been issued.
## Dividend income
### Received by an Israeli-resident company
Dividends received by an Israeli-resident company from another Israeli-resident company that originate from income accrued or derived in Israel are exempt from corporate tax, except for dividends paid from income of an AE (_see the section_). This affords the opportunity to transfer after tax profits within an Israeli group of companies for further investment.
Dividends received by an Israeli-resident company from a non-resident company, as well as dividends received from an Israeli company that arise from foreign-source income of the distributing company, are generally taxable for the receiving company at the rate of 23%. Under certain circumstances, the receiving company may elect to be taxed on such dividends at the corporate tax rate, in which case it will also be entitled to a foreign tax credit with respect to corporate taxes paid by the company distributing the dividend (i.e. an ‘underlying’ tax credit).
### Received by a non-resident shareholder
Dividends received by a non-resident shareholder from an Israeli company are generally subject to tax at the rate of 25% (30% if paid to a 10% or more shareholder), subject to a reduced rate of tax under an applicable tax treaty.
Several of Israel’s tax treaties have very beneficial WHT rates for dividends being paid from Israel. The ITA is very sensitive to treaty shopping, and it will be necessary to demonstrate to the ITA that the foreign holding entity has business substance in its country of residence that will support its residency for treaty purposes and that the structuring of the holding through that entity was not implemented for tax treaty benefit purposes. Furthermore, many of the treaties contain a beneficial ownership clause as a condition to enjoying the treaty WHT rates.
## Interest income
### Received by an Israeli-resident company
Interest income received by an Israeli-resident company is subject to the regular corporate tax rate (23% in 2025).
### Received by a non-resident
Interest income received by a non-resident company is generally subject to tax at the rate of 23% or subject to a reduced rate of tax under an applicable tax treaty.
Interest received by a non-resident from deposits of foreign currency with an Israeli bank is exempt from tax, subject to certain conditions.
## Rent/royalties income
Rent and royalty income, less allowable deductions for tax purposes, is subject to tax at the regular corporate tax rate (23% in 2025).
## Partnership income
From an Israeli tax perspective, a partnership is, in principle, a fiscally transparent vehicle. Accordingly, Israeli tax law does not tax partnerships as such; however, generally, each partner is taxed in respect of its share of the partnership income, with the taxable income allocated to a corporate partner taxed at the regular corporate tax rate. Consequently, the actual distribution of partnership income to a partner is a non-taxable event.
## Foreign income
An Israeli-resident company is liable for tax on its worldwide income. Double taxation is avoided by way of a foreign tax credit mechanism that also applies unilaterally in the absence of an applicable double taxation treaty (DTT) (_see the section_).
Under the controlled foreign company (CFC) regime in Israeli tax law, an Israeli company or individual may be taxed on a proportion of the undistributed profits of certain Israeli-controlled, non-resident companies in which the Israeli shareholder has a controlling interest (10% or more of any of the CFC’s ‘means of control’). _See Controlled foreign companies (CFCs) in the section for more information_.


# Israel
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
Israel-incorporated companies and foreign companies that have a branch presence in Israel are both subject to Israeli corporate tax. An Israeli-resident entity is subject to Israeli corporate tax on worldwide income while a non-resident entity is subject to Israeli corporate tax only on income accrued or derived in Israel. Income sourcing rules determine when income is to be considered from an Israeli source.
The corporate tax rate is 23% in 2025 (same rate as in 2024).
Business operations qualifying under the Encouragement of Capital Investments Law are entitled to reduced rates of tax depending upon their location and other conditions (_see the section_).
## Closely held companies - tax on current income
A provision in Israeli tax law effectively lifts the corporate tax veil of a closely held company that provides services to another company (the ‘other company’) in certain circumstances. A closely held company is generally defined as a company that is directly or indirectly held or controlled by no more than five individuals (taking into account certain relatives). This provision is generally intended for situations when an individual controlling shareholder in the closely held company (‘individual’) is providing officer or management type services to the other company or services that are of the type that are generally performed by an employee for his employer. In such a case, the income shall not be taxed to the closely held company but, rather, shall be taxed to the individual as employment income, business income, or other income, depending upon the circumstances. The employment income classification shall apply if 70% or more of the total income or taxable income of the closely held company in the tax year is sourced from the services performed by the individual or the individual's relatives for a single entity during a period of at least 22 months during a three-year period. Certain exclusions apply.
## Closely held companies - excess profitability
As of 2025, when the profitability of a closely held company (defined as taxable income divided by gross income) from active business activity (i.e. income from any source other than interest, dividends, rent, consideration for the sale of assets, income from securities that constitute business inventory, consideration from the sale of real estate in Israel or abroad or the shares of real estate companies) exceeds 25%, an active shareholder's (defined as a shareholder holding 30% or more of at least one of the means of control of the closely held company or a shareholder holding less than 30% thereof who is involved in generating the active business income of the closely held company or involved in the management of the closely held company) pro-rata share of the income constituting the excess profitability (i.e. exceeding 25%) is included in the active shareholder's taxable income and subject to tax at the active shareholder's marginal tax rate.
Another new provision applicable as of 2025 applies with respect to a closely held company that holds a stake in a partnership. In this respect, to the extent that the closely held company holds at least 10% in the partnership, the company's pro-rata share of the partnership's income and expenses is taken into account for purposes of the company's calculation of whether its profitability exceeds 25%. If, however, the closely held company holds less than 10% in the partnership, 55% of the closely held company's pro-rata share of the profits of the partnership is included in each controlling shareholder's taxable income and subject to tax at the controlling shareholder's marginal tax rate.
## Closely held companies - tax on accumulated profits
As of 2025, closely held companies are generally required to pay an annual tax of 2% on certain accumulated profits. A closely held company is generally defined as a company that is directly or indirectly held or controlled by no more than five individuals (with certain relatives or partners in a partnership viewed as a single individual). The tax on undistributed profits may be avoided if the company distributes a dividend equal to: (i) at least 6% (5% in 2025 – so long as the tax is paid during 2025) of its accumulated profits as of the end of the prior tax year; or (ii) more than 50% of its accumulated profits less certain deductions. Detailed rules apply.
## Closely held companies - winding up the structures
In light of the reduced attractiveness, for Israeli tax purposes, of the utilization of closely held companies, and in order to incentivize the liquidation of such companies, a temporary provision has been enacted which provides certain tax relief with respect to the liquidation of closely held companies or the non-liquidation transfer of assets (be they real estate assets or non-real estate assets) therefrom. This temporary provision is in force through November 30, 2025, with the tax relief offered thereby contingent upon the tax liabilities arising from the transaction being paid by December 31, 2025.
## Local income taxes
Israel does not impose district or local taxes on corporate income.


# Israel
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The 2025 current rate of VAT is 18%.
Exports of goods and certain services and various other transactions are zero-rated, and certain transactions are exempt.
Banks and other financial institutions pay VAT-equivalent taxes at the rate of 18% based on their total payroll and on profits (scheduled to be increased to 18% effective 1 January 2025).
Not-for-profit organisations pay VAT-equivalent tax (wage tax) at the rate of 7.5% of their total payroll.
## Customs duties
Customs duty is imposed on certain products imported into Israel. The rates of duty depend upon their classification according to the Harmonised Customs Tariff and the country of origin. Israel has concluded free-trade agreements with the United States (US), Canada, Mexico, the European Union (EU), and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA).
## Excise taxes
Israel imposes excise taxes on a variety of goods (e.g. gasoline and diesel fuel used for transportation, tobacco, alcohol). The excise taxes are levied item-by-item, and the rates vary.
## Municipal tax
Municipal tax is levied annually on buildings by local municipalities based on the size, location, and purpose of the property.
## Property taxes
Property taxes are generally imposed on the occupier of commercial and residential real property. Unoccupied property is generally taxed on the property's owner. The tax is imposed at the municipality level.
## Real estate capital gains
Capital gains on real estate are subject to the Land Appreciation Tax Law. The law relates to any real estate in Israel, including houses, buildings, and anything permanently fixed to land; real estate rights; and leases for 25 years or more. Tax calculations closely follow the calculation of corporate tax on capital gains (_see Capital gains in the section_).
The tax rate on the real gain is the applicable corporate tax rate (23% in 2025).
A special tax rate may apply with respect to real estate acquired prior to 1960.
## Transfer tax
The purchaser of real estate is generally subject to acquisition tax at rates up to a maximum of 10% (the highest rate applies when the purchase price exceeds 20,183,565 Israeli shekels [ILS]).
## Stamp taxes
There are no stamp taxes imposed in Israel.
## Payroll taxes
There are no payroll taxes other than employer’s national insurance contributions (_see below_).
## Employer’s national insurance contributions
Employers are obligated to pay national insurance contributions based on a percentage of each employee’s income on a monthly basis. Employers are responsible for withholding employees’ contributions from wages and remitting these together with the employer’s own contributions. The employer’s contribution rates (current as of January 2025) for Israeli-resident employees are 4.51%, up to monthly income of ILS 7,522, and 7.6% on the difference between ILS 7,522 and the maximum monthly income of ILS 50,695.
For non-resident employees, the employer rates are significantly lower and are 0.75%, up to monthly income of ILS 7,522, and 2.65% on the difference between ILS 7,522 and the maximum monthly income of ILS 50,695. The minimal national insurance payments for non-resident employees do not provide any retirement benefit for the non-resident but generally provides a certain element of work accident coverage.
When an irregular salary payment in excess of one quarter of the usual salary is made, special provisions apply to the computation of social charges by which the application of this payment is equally attributed to the current month and to the past 11 months.
Israel has social security totalisation agreements with 19 countries that may allow for an exemption from Israeli national insurance throughout the employment period of the employee in Israel.
