# Israel
## Overview
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
Israel, a parliamentary republic, is located on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea. It is bordered by Lebanon and Syria to the north, Jordan to the east, and Egypt to the southwest. The capital of Israel is Jerusalem, and its currency is the shekel (ILS). Currently, there are two official languages in Israel: Hebrew and Arabic.
Israel has a technologically advanced market economy that depends on imports of crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military equipment. Recent natural gas discoveries off the coast of Israel have been a positive development for Israel, which otherwise has limited natural resources. Israel also has intensively developed its agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years. Cut diamonds, high-technology equipment, and agricultural products (fruits and vegetables) are the leading exports. The Bank of Israel expects gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the Israeli economy to increase in 2022 by 5.5%.
