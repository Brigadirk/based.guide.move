## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
## Foreign tax relief
Double taxation is avoided by way of a foreign tax credit mechanism that applies unilaterally in the absence of an applicable DTT. The foreign tax credit is limited to the Israeli tax payable with respect to the same income. Foreign-sourced income is divided into categories (baskets) on the basis of the income source (e.g. dividends, business income), and a particular credit limitation applies to each basket. Excess uncredited foreign income can be carried forward for the subsequent five tax years.
Foreign residents are not entitled to unilateral tax relief on foreign income. However, in circumstances where it can be shown that the amount of tax payable in Israel exceeds the amount of tax credit available in the home country on specific Israeli-source income, the Minister of Finance is permitted to order a total or partial tax reduction.
## Tax treaties
_See the section in the Corporate summary for a list of countries with which Israel has a DTT_.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
Israeli tax residents are taxable on their worldwide income.
Non-resident individuals are subject to income tax on Israeli-source income and to capital gains tax on capital gains from assets situated in Israel (subject to special exemptions for non-residents; _see Capital gains in the section for more information_). Sourcing rules determine when income is to be regarded as being from an Israeli source.
## Personal income tax rates
Taxation of individuals is imposed in graduated rates ranging up to 47%. Additionally, a 3% surtax applies on annual taxable income exceeding 721,560 Israeli shekels (ILS), resulting in a 50% maximum income tax rate. Non-residents are taxed at the same rates as Israeli residents. The annual tax brackets are an aggregation of the monthly brackets in force during the year, which are periodically updated for inflation. The annual bracket amounts for 2025, expressed in Israeli shekels, are as follows:
Annual taxable income (ILS) | Tax on column 1 (ILS) | Tax on excess (%)  
---|---|---  
Over (column 1) | Not over  
0 | 84,120 | 0 | 10  
84,120 | 120,720 | 8,412 | 14  
120,720 | 193,800 | 13,536 | 20  
193,800 | 269,280 | 28,152 | 31  
269,280 | 560,280 | 51,551 | 35  
560,280 | 721,560 | 153,401 | 47  
721,560 | 229,203 | 50  
A minimum tax rate of 31% generally applies to certain classes of passive income not derived from business or employment earned by a taxpayer under age 60.
Most types of interest, dividends, and capital gains have varying, fixed rates of tax set in the Income Tax Ordinance (ITO) (_see the section for more information_). In this respect, it should be noted that, in addition to such fixed rates, as of 2025, the portion of an individual's annual income from capital sources (e.g., capital gains, real estate appreciation, dividends, interest, CPI linkage differentials, rental income, passive royalties, etc.) exceeding a certain threshold (NIS 721,560 in 2025) is subject to an additional surtax of 2%.
## Local income taxes
There are no local taxes on income in Israel.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
## Taxable period
Tax returns are filed on a calendar-year basis.
## Tax returns
Subject to certain exceptions, _as detailed below_ , an individual who is a resident of Israel is required to file an annual tax return. Should a tax return be required, 30 April is the prescribed filing due date, subject to extensions.
A resident taxpayer may not be required to file a tax return for 2025 where tax is withheld at source from one’s wages and at the prescribed levels from other specified sources (e.g. rent, dividends, interest, and capital gains) unless one of the following exceptions apply, in which case the individual would be required to file a tax return (detailed rules apply; certain further exceptions may also be applicable):
  * Wages exceeded ILS 723,000.
  * The taxpayer or spouse are subject to the 3% surtax in 2025 (income exceeded ILS 721,560)
  * Any of the following categories of income exceeded ILS 375,000: 
    * Rental income.
    * Foreign income.
    * Non-exempt foreign pension income.
    * Certain other income (detailed definitional rules apply).
  * Income from the sale of traded securities (turnover) exceeded ILS 2,810,000.
  * Interest income exceeded ILS 717,000.
  * The taxpayer together with one’s spouse and children under age 18 at any time during the year owned: 
    * shares of a foreign non-publicly traded company
    * foreign assets having a value of at least ILS 2,086,000, or
    * deposits with a foreign banking institution of ILS 2,086,000 or more.
  * The taxpayer is the settlor or beneficiary of a trust during the tax year.
  * The taxpayer received a distribution (direct/indirect) from a trust or from the creation of a trust an amount of more than ILS 100,000 (cash/equivalent), even if not subject to tax in Israel.


These amounts are periodically updated.
Married couples are permitted to file separate or joint returns. In the latter case, a separate calculation may still be obtained for tax on income from personal exertion in any business or vocation or from employment, provided the income is from independent sources.
A non-Israeli tax resident employee will generally not be required to file an Israeli income tax return for 2025 if proper withholdings were remitted to the tax authorities, the employee's 2025 annual income did not exceed ILS 721,560, and the employee had no other Israeli-source income.
## Payment of tax
Payroll withholding of income and social tax is statutory, irrespective of the residence of the employer or employee. In general, withholding taxes in respect of salary payments effected from the 14th day of one month to the 13th day of the following month are payable on the 15th day of that following month.
Tax advances are required to be paid by an individual for interest, dividends, capital gains, and rental income in amounts and according to specific deadlines set out in detailed Israeli tax rules.
Self-employed individuals are generally required to make monthly or bimonthly advance tax payments, usually based on a percentage of turnover.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitation period for taxation of individuals is generally four years from the end of the tax year in which the relevant tax return is filed.

# Israel
## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
## Employment income
Under Israeli sourcing rules, employment income is regarded as being sourced at the place where the related work is performed. Accordingly, employment income derived by a foreign resident relating to the employee's performance of services in Israel would be subject to Israeli taxation, unless a tax treaty exemption is available in accordance with the relevant double tax treaty (DTT).
The definition of taxable employment income is broadly defined in the ITO and covers salary, bonuses, cost of living allowances, tax equalisation payments, and virtually all types of fringe benefits (including benefits from stock-based compensation plans). The value of the use of an employer provided car as set in Israeli tax regulations is also included as employment income.
Israeli taxation of security-based compensation for employees who relocate to or from Israel is a complex subject matter whose taxation depends upon the specific facts and circumstances of the benefit plan and the person's period of residency in Israel.
Employer contributions to approved pension and benefit schemes and to further education funds are exempt from income tax (subject to certain requirements and maximum levels of contribution).
## Capital gains
Capital gains tax is generally payable on capital gains by residents of Israel on the sale of assets (irrespective of the location of the assets) and by non-residents on the sale of the following:
  * Assets located in Israel.
  * Assets located abroad that are essentially a direct or indirect right to an asset or to inventory, or that are an indirect right to a real estate right or to an asset in a real estate association located in Israel. Taxation applies only in respect of that part of the consideration that stems from the above property located in Israel.
  * Assets that are a share or the right to a share in an Israeli entity.
  * Assets that are a right in a foreign resident entity that is essentially a direct or indirect right to property located in Israel. Taxation applies only with respect to that part of the consideration that stems from the property located in Israel.


The cashless transfer of rights and assets arising from certain mergers, spin-offs, and asset transfers may be exempt from tax upon meeting various requirements.
_See the section for a description of the LAT imposed on gains from the sale of Israeli real estate_.
### Determination of the capital gain
Tax on capital gains is imposed on the disposal of fixed and intangible assets where the disposal price is in excess of the depreciated cost.
### Computation of real gain and inflationary components
For tax purposes, the capital gain is generally calculated in local currency, and there are provisions for segregating the taxable gain into its real and inflationary components. The inflationary amount is the original cost of the asset, less depreciation (where applicable), multiplied by the percentage increase in the Israeli consumer price index (CPI) from the date of acquisition of the asset to the date of its sale. The inflationary amount component is exempt to the extent it accrued after 1 January 1994 and is generally subject to tax at the rate of 10% if it accrued before that date. The real gain component, if any, will be taxed at the rates set out further below, plus the 3% surtax, if applicable.
A non-resident who invests in capital assets with foreign currency may elect to calculate the inflationary amount in that foreign currency. Under this option, in the event of a sale of shares in an Israeli company, the inflationary amount attributable to exchange differences on the investment is always exempt from Israeli tax. In respect of a security held by an individual that is denominated in foreign currency or value-linked to a foreign currency, the currency exchange rate shall be deemed the index rate. 
### Traded and non-traded securities acquired from 1 January 2003 and thereafter
The real gain, if any, realised upon the sale of shares purchased on or after 1 January 2003 is generally taxed at a rate of 25% for individuals. This rate is increased to 30% where the seller was a 10% or more shareholder at the date of sale or during any of the 12 months preceding the sale; detailed definitional rules apply (hereinafter ‘10% or more shareholder’).
### Traded and non-traded securities acquired before 2003
A blended tax rate shall apply, as follows:
  * The ordinary individual tax rate (determined in accordance with the individual’s marginal tax rate in the range of 31% to 50%) will be applied to the gain amount that bears the same ratio to the total gain realised as the ratio the holding period commencing at the acquisition date and terminating on 1 January 2003 bears to the total holding period.
  * The remainder of the gain realised will be subject to capital gains tax at a 25% rate (or 30% rate where a 10% or more shareholder).


### Special rule for retained profits upon sale of shares
Special provisions apply to part of the real gain that is attributed to the seller’s share of retained profits in the case of a sale of (i) non-traded shares that were acquired prior to 1 January 2003 or (ii) publicly traded shares where the seller was a 10% or more shareholder.
The share of ‘retained profits’ is the amount of gain equal to the proportional part of the retained profits of the company that the seller of the shares would have rights to by virtue of those shares. Detailed rules apply in determining this profit component.
  * The part of the retained profits that is attributed to the period ending on 31 December 2002 will be subject to tax at a reduced rate of 10%.
  * Generally, the seller’s proportionate part of the company’s retained profits will be taxed as if this amount had been received as dividends immediately before the sale (e.g. at a tax rate of 25% or at a tax rate of 30% where the seller is a 10% or more shareholder).


### Special exemptions for non-residents
Non-resident are exempt from tax on capital gains from a sale of shares of an Israeli company traded on the Israeli stock exchange or on a foreign stock exchange.
For non-traded shares of an Israeli company acquired from 1 January 2009 and thereafter, a non-resident shall be exempt from tax on capital gains, provided that the following conditions are met:
  * The investment is not in a company in which, on the date of its purchase and in the two preceding years, the main value of the assets held by the company, directly or indirectly, were sourced from an interest in (i) real estate or in a real estate association (as defined in the ITO); (ii) the use in real estate or any asset attached to land; (iii) exploitation of natural resources in Israel; or (iv) produce from land in Israel.
  * The investment is not in a company the majority of whose assets are real estate assets in Israel.
  * The shares were not purchased from a relative.


For non-traded shares acquired in the period 2005 to 2008, the exemption is also conditioned on the seller having been a resident of a tax treaty country for at least ten years prior to the sale, the seller filing a tax report in their local country of residency reporting the sale, and that notice of the purchase of the shares was given by the person to the ITA within 30 days of the purchase of the security, and subject to additional conditions. Detailed rules apply.
A foreign resident may also be exempt from Israeli capital gains tax under the provisions of an applicable tax treaty.
### Surtaxes
As of 2025, the portion of an individual's taxable annual income from capital sources (e.g., capital gains, real estate appreciation, dividends, interest, CPI linkage differentials, rental income, passive royalties, etc.) exceeding a certain threshold (NIS 721,560 in 2025) is subject to an additional surtax of 2%. This is in addition to 3% surtax on an individual's annual taxable income from all sources exceeding a certain threshold (NIS 721,560 in 2025).
## Capital losses
Capital losses may offset all capital gains (including gains from Israeli or foreign securities) and gains from the sale of property (whether Israeli or foreign source).
Where the capital loss is from a non-Israeli asset, the loss must first be offset against foreign-source capital gains.
Capital losses derived from the sale of securities may also be offset against interest and dividend income generated from the sold security and also against interest and dividend income received from other securities (where the income was not subject to tax of more than 25%).
Capital losses can generally be carried forward indefinitely and set off only against capital gains. Capital losses carried forward from the sale of a foreign asset should first be offset against foreign-source capital gains arising in the carryforward year.
## Exit tax
When an Israeli tax resident ceases to be an Israeli resident for tax purposes, the individual's assets shall be deemed to have been sold one day before the individual ceased being an Israeli resident.
Any gain attributable to the deemed sale of assets may be paid on the day the residency ceased or it may be postponed until the date the assets are actually realised. The amount of the Israeli capital gain portion shall be determined by taking the real capital gain at the time of realisation, multiplied by the period of ownership from the day on which it acquired the asset until the day it ceased being an Israeli resident, divided by the entire period from the day of the asset's acquisition until the day or realisation. The Minister of Finance has been authorised to prescribe provisions for the implementation of the exit tax, including provisions for the prevention of double taxation and the submission of tax reports, but no provisions have yet been issued.
## Dividend income
Dividends shall generally be subject to tax at the rate of 25% (or 30% in the case of a 10% or more shareholder).
For a non-resident, the tax rate may be reduced by an applicable tax treaty.
A 15% to 20% rate generally applies for dividends distributed from certain enterprises qualifying under The Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments. A lower rate for non-residents may be available for distributions from certain types of qualifying enterprises and also under a relevant tax treaty.
Under the controlled foreign corporation (CFC) regime in Israeli tax law, an Israeli individual may be taxed on a proportion of the undistributed profits of certain Israeli-controlled non-resident companies in which the Israeli shareholder has a controlling interest (10% or more of any of the CFC’s ‘means of control’). A CFC is a company to which a number of cumulative conditions apply. These include the fact that most of its income or profits in the tax year derive from passive sources (e.g. capital gains, interest, rental, dividend, royalties) and such passive income has been subject to an effective tax rate that does not exceed 15%.
As of 2025, the portion of an individual's taxable annual income from capital sources (e.g., capital gains, real estate appreciation, dividends, interest, CPI linkage differentials, rental income, passive royalties, etc.) exceeding a certain threshold (NIS 721,560 in 2025) is subject to an additional surtax of 2%. This is in addition to 3% surtax on an individual's annual taxable income from all sources exceeding a certain threshold (NIS 721,560 in 2025).
## Cash withdrawals or personal use of company assets
Withdrawals from a company by a 10% or more shareholder of (i) cash whose accumulated balance during any year exceeds ILS 100,000 (including certain shareholder loans and guarantees) or (ii) the personal use by such shareholder of an apartment, art, jewellery, airplanes, or boats owned by the company (or of other company assets as will be published by the Finance Ministry) shall be taxed to the shareholder as a dividend, as salary in the case where the company has no retained earnings and there is an employer-relationship, or as other taxable income. These rules also apply when the recipient is a relative of the 10% or more shareholder as defined in the tax law.
For cash withdrawals, the tax event will arise if the withdrawn money has not been repaid to the company by the end of the tax year following the tax year in which the withdrawal was made. When there is a use of other company assets, the tax event shall be at the end of each tax year in which the asset was used for personal use until the asset is returned to the company.
Detailed rules apply.
## Interest income
Interest income shall generally be subject to tax at a rate of 25%.
Interest from investments in financial institutions or in traded securities that are not linked to the CPI may be eligible for a 15% rate.
For a non-resident, the tax rate may be reduced under an applicable tax treaty.
Interest paid to a non-resident from deposits of foreign currency with an Israel bank is exempt from tax, subject to certain conditions.
In order to promote foreign investment in the Israeli corporate bonds market, an exemption from tax is provided with respect to interest income received by foreign investors on or after 1 January 2009 on their commercial investments in Israeli corporate bonds traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE), subject to certain conditions.
As of 2025, the portion of an individual's taxable annual income from capital sources (e.g., capital gains, real estate appreciation, dividends, interest, CPI linkage differentials, rental income, passive royalties, etc.) exceeding a certain threshold (NIS 721,560 in 2025) is subject to an additional surtax of 2%. This is in addition to 3% surtax on an individual's annual taxable income from all sources exceeding a certain threshold (NIS 721,560 in 2025).
## Rental income
Individual landlords (including married couples together with their minor children) of residential homes are eligible, under certain conditions, to select one of the following taxation alternatives.
  * Individual landlords are eligible, under certain conditions, for a complete exemption from income tax for rental income (from Israeli homes) not exceeding a prescribed amount per month (ILS 5,654 in 2025). No special approval is needed to qualify for this exemption. If the rental income is higher than the prescribed amount, then a certain portion of the rental income will be taxed at the individual landlord’s marginal tax rate.
  * For rental income derived from Israeli residential property, individual landlords are eligible, under certain conditions, to elect to pay tax at the rate of 10% on their gross rental income from homes (no deductions are allowed). Under this alternative, if the landlord owns a single residential property and rents it to a third party, while the landlord separately rents a different property from a third party as a residence for himself, the landlord may deduct from his rental income up to the lesser between the rent paid for his residence and ILS 90,000, with the balance of his rental income (if any) subject to tax at a rate of 10%. 
  * For rental income derived from Israeli residential property, individual landlords are eligible, under certain conditions, to elect to deduct expenses and depreciation with the balance of the rental income subject to tax at the individual landlord's marginal tax rate.
  * For rental income derived from multiple Israeli residential properties, individual landlords may consider choosing a combination of the second and third alternatives detailed above. Detailed rules apply.


For rental income from residential property abroad, the rate is 15%.
Depreciation is generally allowable on a straight-line basis for expenditures on buildings, but not on land. Detailed rules apply.
Passive losses from leasing a building may only be used to offset rental income from the same building in future years, or land appreciation realised upon disposal of that building. Detailed rules apply.
Losses from an active property rental business operation may be used to offset other taxable income in the same year from any source, or against future active business income and certain capital gains.
As of 2025, the portion of an individual's taxable annual income from capital sources (e.g., capital gains, real estate appreciation, dividends, interest, CPI linkage differentials, rental income, passive royalties, etc.) exceeding a certain threshold (NIS 721,560 in 2025) is subject to an additional surtax of 2%. This is in addition to 3% surtax on an individual's annual taxable income from all sources exceeding a certain threshold (NIS 721,560 in 2025).

## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
## Personal tax credits
Residents are entitled to personal tax credits against their tax liabilities according to their status. Each point is worth ILS 242 per month, with resident individuals being entitled to a minimum of 2.25 points. Additional points are granted for, among other items, dependent children, new immigrants, and single-parent families.
Foreign residents are not entitled to personal tax credits.
## Charitable contributions
Donations to recognised public institutions entitle the taxpayer to a tax credit of 35% from donations that in aggregate are not less than ILS 207, provided the donations do not exceed 30% of annual taxable income or ILS 10,354,816, whichever is less. Excess donation amounts can be carried forward for three years under certain circumstances.
## Tax benefits for new immigrants and returning residents
New immigrants and returning residents (who were foreign residents for a continuous period of at least ten years and returned to Israel to become an Israeli tax resident after such period) may enjoy the following tax benefits upon becoming tax resident in Israel (returning residents from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2009 may enjoy these benefits where they were foreign resident for at least five years):
  * Exemption from Israeli taxation for a period of ten years from the date of becoming Israeli tax resident on passive income that is accrued or derived from outside of Israel or that is sourced from assets overseas. This exemption shall apply to income from dividends, interest, rent, royalties, pensions, annuities, and the like.
  * Exemption from Israeli taxation for a period of ten years from the date of becoming Israeli tax resident on income from a business, vocation, or salary that is accrued or derived from outside of Israel. This exemption may be limited in certain cases.
  * Exemption for a period of ten years from capital gains tax on the sale of assets located outside of Israel. The capital gain exemption shall apply even where the overseas assets sold are purchased during the ten-year exemption period. Where assets are disposed of after the expiry of the ten-year period, the taxable amount will be calculated on a linear basis by applying the ratio between the exempt and non-exempt periods to the total holding period of the asset.
  * Exemption from reporting income derived or produced abroad or which are sourced from assets outside of Israel.


Pursuant to certain transition provisions, an individual will qualify for the above benefits if one has returned to Israeli tax resident status in 2007, 2008, or 2009 after having been a foreign resident for a continuous period of at least five years (rather than requiring the above mentioned ten-year period).
A returning resident, who was a foreign resident for only six years before returning to Israeli residency status, shall enjoy the following:
  * Exemption from Israeli taxation on passive income (but not pension income), and only for a period of five years from the date of becoming Israeli tax resident. This exemption applies only to passive income generated by assets that were acquired while the person was a foreign resident.
  * Exemption for a period of ten years from capital gains tax on the sale of assets located outside of Israel but only with respect to assets that were purchased during the period the individual was a foreign resident.


Detailed rules apply to the above provisions. This subject matter is complex and requires review of each person's specific facts and circumstances.
## Special deductions for qualifying expatriates
'Foreign expert’ status is granted to a non-resident who, while abroad, has been invited by an Israeli individual or by an Israeli resident entity (not being a manpower company or temporary agency) to perform services in their area of expertise for the inviting party and meets the following conditions:
  * The person must reside/work in Israel legally.
  * The person must perform duties in their area of expertise for the entire period of their stay and not perform some other duties.
  * The person must earn more than ILS 14,800 monthly for performance of the services in Israel.


Additional qualifying conditions apply.
A non-resident who is granted ‘foreign expert’ status is entitled to deduct from Israeli taxable income the following items for a period not exceeding 12 months of employment in Israel:
  * Documented rent and certain utilities (gas, water, electricity) costs or accommodation expenses. Therefore, the employee should retain a copy of rental contracts, hotel bills, and utility charges.
  * Daily living expenses (per diem): In accordance with the ITA guidelines, these expenses are limited to ILS 360. This deduction is only for the actual days that the employee is physically present in Israel and is dependent upon the presentation of sufficient documentation of the expenses).


'Approved specialists’ (non-residents approved by the director of the Investment Centre at the Ministry of Industry and Trade), provided they are experts who possess skills not readily available locally, are taxed at a maximum rate of 25% on their earnings for a period of three years, with a possible extension of up to a further five years. They are also entitled to the benefits available to foreign experts in the first 12 months. Approval is generally given on income up to 75,000 United States dollars (USD) _per annum_.


# Israel
## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
The ITO defines an Israeli resident as a person whose ‘centre of life’ is in Israel. Various factors are analysed in determining where the individual’s centre of life is located.
In addition, the following are refutable (by either the tax officer or the taxpayer) presumptions regarding the determination of an individual’s ‘centre of life’:
  * Any individual who has been present in Israel during a certain tax year for 183 days or more shall be presumed to have their centre of life in Israel (and consequently be an Israeli tax resident) in such tax year. 
  * Any individual who has been present in Israel during a tax year for 30 days or more, and a total of 425 days or more during such tax year and the two previous tax years (on aggregate), shall be presumed to have their centre of life in Israel in such tax year. 


It should be emphasised that the main defining test under the ITO remains the ‘centre of life’ test. The presumptions mentioned above (regarding the length of stay in Israel) will merely assist in reaching a conclusion. Even if the ‘days tests’ provided by these presumptions are not met, it may still be concluded that the individual is an Israeli tax resident.
Should an individual be deemed to be an Israeli resident while at the same time resident of another country, the tie-breaker tests set out in the applicable treaty will determine in which country the individual will be viewed as resident. Generally, the treaties focus on factors relating to where the person’s permanent home is maintained, in which country the person’s personal and economic relations are closest (‘centre of vital interests’ test), and in which country the person is a national.
A ‘foreign tax resident’ is generally defined in the ITO as anyone who is not considered an Israeli tax resident and also includes an individual who has met the following tests:
  * The person has spent at least 183 days outside of Israel in both the tax year in question and in the following year. 
  * Such person's centre of life had not been in Israel in the following (third and fourth) years. 


Therefore, when an individual will meet the 183 days test for the first two years (without necessarily meeting the centre of life test during the first two years) and the centre of life test during the next two years, the person would be regarded as a foreign tax resident for this entire period.
In order to allow individuals moving to Israel to reach an informed decision about where they wish to live, a new immigrant and a returning resident (following ten years of foreign residency) are entitled to a one-year acclimation period from the date of their arrival. During this year, these individuals can request not to be considered a resident of Israel for income tax purposes. This election request requires the person to notify the Israel Tax Authority (ITA) within 90 days of arriving in Israel. Detailed rules apply.
When an Israeli tax resident ceases to be an Israeli resident for tax purposes, exit tax provisions apply (_see Exit tax in the section for further information_).

Special detailed rules and rates regarding health insurance tax apply to irregular salary payments, the self-employed, and to other sources of income generated by an Israeli resident (i.e. rent, interest, dividends, pension, etc.). Capital gains are not subject to health insurance tax.
## Land appreciation tax (LAT)
LAT is imposed on gains from the sale of Israeli real estate. LAT is also imposed on the sale of an interest in a non-traded real estate association (REA), defined as a company or partnership whose principal assets consist of Israeli real estate. However, the tax liability arising from the sale of such an association will be determined based on the capital gains tax provisions of the Israeli ITO. For LAT purposes, a sale includes most types of dispositions, as well as the grant of a lease capable of lasting for 25 years or more.
In measuring the lease period, an option to lease is considered as if exercised. Detailed expenditure deduction rules are prescribed for LAT purposes.
The resulting taxable capital gain is divided into real and inflationary elements.
The real capital gain is taxable as follows (these guidelines do not apply with respect to the sale of residential apartments in Israel - detailed rules apply):
### Assets purchased from 1 January 2012 and thereafter
The tax rate applicable to real capital gains derived from the sale of an interest in real estate for individuals is 25%. The tax rate applicable to real capital gains derived from the sale of an interest in an REA is 25%, or 30% in the case of a 10% or more shareholder.
### Assets purchased prior to 1 January 2012
  * Capital gains arising from the sale of an interest in real estate (and in REAs) shall be apportioned on a linear basis to the periods before and after 7 November 2001.
  * The portion of the gain attributed to the period before 7 November 2001 shall be subject to tax for individuals at the taxpayer's marginal tax rate, up to 50% (including surtax) depending on the date of acquisition.
  * The portion of the gain attributed to the period from 7 November 2001 until 31 December 2011 shall be taxed at the rate of 20% for individuals.
  * The portion of the gain attributed to the period from 1 January 2012 until the date of the sale shall be taxed at the rate of 25% for individuals (or at the rate of 30% with respect to the sale of an interest in an REA if the individual is a 10% or more shareholder).


### Surtaxes
As of 2025, the portion of an individual's taxable annual income from capital sources (e.g., capital gains, real estate appreciation, dividends, interest, CPI linkage differentials, rental income, passive royalties, etc.) exceeding a certain threshold (NIS 721,560 in 2025) is subject to an additional surtax of 2%. This is in addition to 3% surtax on an individual's annual taxable income from all sources exceeding a certain threshold (NIS 721,560 in 2025).
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The current rate of VAT is 18%. _See the section in the Corporate tax summary for more information_.

## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes

Israel does not impose a special gift tax on the gifting of assets.
## Property taxes
Property taxes are generally imposed on the occupier of commercial and residential property. Unoccupied property is generally taxed on the property's owner. The tax is imposed at the municipality level.
## Luxury and excise taxes
Israel imposes an additional 3% on personal income at the highest marginal rate (which increases the highest tax marginal rate from 47% to 50%).
A luxury tax is also imposed on the purchase of certain yachts and luxury cars.
Israel imposes excise taxes on a variety of goods (e.g. gasoline and diesel fuel used for transportation, tobacco, alcohol). The excise taxes are levied item-by-item, and the rates vary.
