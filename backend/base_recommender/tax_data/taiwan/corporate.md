## Anti-tax avoidance rules
The Income Tax Act was amended in July 2016 to include anti-tax avoidance rules in Article 43-3 (Controlled Foreign Company [CFC]) and Article 43-4 (Place of Effective Management [PEM]) of the Income Tax Act.
In general, profits retained at the CFC level, which is located in a low tax rate jurisdiction and without commercial substance, will be taxed in advance at the Taiwan parent company level. In the past, taxation of foreign investment income was deferred until the Taiwan parent company received dividend income. Going forward, qualified investment income will be deemed distributed and taxable in Taiwan in advance. The Regulations Governing Controlled Foreign Companies were announced by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) on 31 May 2017. On 14 January 2022, the Executive Yuan announced that the CFC Rules will come into force from 1 January 2023.
For PEM rules, under this new tax regime, if a foreign company meets all three criteria triggering the PEM definition, including (i) decision making location, (ii) record keeping and maintenance location, and (iii) actual operating location are all in Taiwan, the foreign enterprise will be deemed as having its head office in Taiwan and will be subject to tax assessment in accordance with the Taiwan Income Tax Act and other tax regulations. The Regulations Governing Places of Effective Management were announced by the Ministry of Finance in May 2017. However, the PEM taxation mechanisms have yet to take effect. 
## Joint Property Tax System 2.0 is effective from 1 July 2021 onwards
Building and land acquired post 1 January 2016 and sold after 1 July 2021 will be subject to the tax rate stipulated under Joint Property Tax System 2.0.
## Tax treaties
As of 30 June 2024, Taiwan has concluded 35 effective double taxation agreements (DTAs) with countries around the world, which generally follow the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Tax Convention and cover corporate and individual income tax. Taiwan has also concluded 13 international transportation income tax agreements. 
Taiwan has also signed a treaty with China; however, this tax treaty has not yet come into effect. 
On 17 November 2021, Taiwan and Korea signed a DTA (the 'Taiwan-Korea tax treaty'). The Taiwan-Korea tax treaty became effective starting 1 January 2024.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 19 August 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year in Taiwan runs from 1 January to 31 December. Businesses may request approval from the local collection authority to file CIT returns using a fiscal year-end other than 31 December.
## Tax returns
Tax returns are filed on a self-assessment basis. CIT returns are due no later than five months after the end of the tax year.
## Payment of tax
Tax is paid on a self-assessment basis in two instalments. The first payment is based on 50% of the tax liability of the prior year’s tax return and is made in the ninth month of the enterprise’s fiscal year. However, if the taxpayer meets certain requirements, it may self-assess the provisional tax based on the taxable income of the first half of the current fiscal year and deduct income taxes paid overseas against the provisional income tax payable if corresponding income is consolidated in the provisional tax return. The second payment is made at the time of filing the annual tax return. The returns are subsequently reviewed by the tax authorities, and a final assessment is issued.
Any overpaid tax as a result of the tax collection authority’s mistake shall be refunded to the taxpayer within two years of the tax authority’s acknowledgement of such mistake, and shall not be subject to the original five-year period for applying for refund where the taxpayer is responsible for the mistake.
## Tax audit process
Taiwan does not have a fixed audit cycle. Tax audit can be carried out any time prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations. Companies may be selected for audit if certain criteria are met.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations in Taiwan is five years from the tax return filing date if the return is filed on time. Where a taxpayer fails to file an annual tax return within the statutory deadline or evades tax by fraud or any other unrighteous means, the statute of limitations is extended to seven years.
## Tax ruling system
Corporate taxpayers may file an advance tax ruling application with the tax authorities, together with the relevant supporting documents, to clarify their tax position before initiating the specific transaction. The tax authorities are obligated to issue a response within six months after submitting the application.
## Recent focus of Taiwan tax authorities
The tax authorities have developed sophisticated and comprehensive tax audit techniques and approaches over the years. The following sets out some of the common items frequently challenged or audited by the tax authorities:
  * Management fees allocated from the foreign parent company or affiliates: The tax authorities frequently question the economic substance of the services rendered, the allocation method, and the availability of sufficient documents to support the tax deduction claim. 
  * Amortisation of goodwill: The tax authorities frequently challenge the valuation report supporting the calculation of goodwill and whether the transaction itself should give rise to goodwill. 
  * Amortisation of business rights: The tax authorities have taken a more conservative view, which limits 'business rights' to those explicitly authorised by laws (e.g. those regulated under certain public utilities act). 
  * Eligibility for R&D tax credits. 
  * WHT compliance. 
  * Transfer pricing compliance. 
  * Business tax audit. 




# Taiwan
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 19 August 2024
A company is a resident of Taiwan for CIT purposes if it is incorporated in Taiwan. A non-resident company that has an FPOB or business agent in Taiwan is obligated to file a CIT return in Taiwan on its Taiwan-sourced income.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The term 'permanent establishment' only exists in the underlying DTAs signed with Taiwan. Taiwan domestic tax regulations only refer to an FPOB and business agent as a taxpayer of a foreign entity’s Taiwan-source income. The foreign entity shall be liable for Taiwan income tax assessment on its Taiwan-source income.


# Taiwan
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 19 August 2024
## Depreciation
Depreciation on all fixed assets other than land, including premises, plants (buildings), and equipment, which are used to generate income, is allowed as a deduction. The straight-line, fixed percentage on diminishing book value, sum-of-years-digit, unit-of-production, and working-hour methods are acceptable depreciation methods to the tax office. The useful lives of typical assets are shown below:
Asset category | Useful life (years)  
---|---  
Computer equipment | 3  
Furniture and fixtures | 5  
Automobile | 5  
Building | 50  
With the approval of the tax authority, a company may revalue its fixed assets each time the government’s wholesale price index increases by 25% over the base period. A company’s base period is established at the time of purchase of fixed assets or at such time when a company revalues its fixed assets. Any increase in fixed assets may then be depreciated for tax purposes.
## Goodwill
Goodwill is commonly realised from merger and acquisition, which should follow the purchase method as defined under Taiwan Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Goodwill should be amortised for 15 years if a valuation report is issued by a creditable professional valuation firm and the net identifiable assets are valued separately. However, in practice, the amortisation of goodwill is frequently challenged by the Taiwan tax authority.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses during the start-up period can be deducted in the year incurred. The start-up period is from the preparatory stage to the date the business starts to generate significant revenue from its primary business operation.
## Interest expenses
Interests on loans that are used for business purposes are deductible in the year incurred. However, for a loan from a non-financial institution, the interest rate shall not exceed 15.6% _per annum_. As for interest on inter-company loans, the deductible amount is subject to the thin capitalisation rule and transfer pricing regulations (_see the section_).
## Bad debt
Actual losses on bad debts are allowed for deduction when certain legal proceedings or time requirements have been satisfied. The loss should first be charged against the bad debt provision, which should not exceed either 1% of accounts receivable and notes receivable outstanding, or the actual average bad debt ratio for the past three years.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions to support national defence, troop morale, contribution to government of any level, and donation made with special approval of the MoF are not subject to any tax limit. Donations to other parties are subject to prescribed limits under the relevant regulations.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties arising from violation of various tax laws are generally not deductible.
## Taxes
All taxes, other than income tax, are generally deductible, unless where such taxes are related to tax-exempt income. The tax associated with the acquisition of real estate should be included in the cost of the land or building.
## Net operating losses
A company’s net operating losses can be carried forward for ten years. Losses cannot be carried back.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Royalties, interest, and service fees paid to a foreign affiliate are subject to WHT. Royalties or service fees paid to a foreign entity may be tax-exempt if certain requirements are met and prior approval is obtained.


# Taiwan
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 19 August 2024
Group enterprises meeting certain criteria under the Financial Holding Company Act and Business Mergers & Acquisitions Act may file consolidated tax returns for the Taiwan parent and its first tier Taiwan subsidiaries. For other enterprises, group taxation is not permitted. The Taiwan parent is eligible to file consolidated tax returns if it continuously holds over 90% of the shares of the subsidiaries for 12 months in a tax year.
## Transfer pricing
Transfer pricing regulations were established to constrain multinational corporations from leaving their profits in countries with lower tax rates. For applicable companies, the disclosure of related-party transactions in the CIT return and the preparation of a transfer pricing report is required. Upon request, the transfer pricing report will have to be submitted to the Taiwan tax authority within one-month of notice. The transfer pricing report must demonstrate the company’s good faith effort to comply with the assessment rules. Without proper reason, failure to comply with such rules will result in additional tax payable and financial penalties. The types of transactions governed by these regulations include the following: transfer of tangible assets, use of tangible assets, transfer of intangible assets, use of intangible assets, rendering of services, use of funds, business restructuring, and other types of transactions prescribed by the MoF.
If related-party transaction amounts exceed certain thresholds laid out below, an advance pricing agreement (APA) with the tax authority may be obtained to eliminate risk of inter-company prices being challenged. The criteria for applying for an APA are as follows:
  * The total amount of the controlled transaction covered under the APA is at least TWD 500 million or the annual amount of such controlled transaction is at least TWD 200 million.
  * There has been no significant act of tax evasion in the past three years.
  * The required documentation for the APA application has been well prepared, including the transfer pricing report.
  * Other criteria specified by the MoF are satisfied.


### Three tier transfer pricing documentation
In addition to a transfer pricing report, corporations also need to provide a Master File and a Country-by-Country Reporting (CbCR) file.
The Master File is to contain information on the corporation’s group’s value chain analysis, description of intangible assets, and financing activities. The threshold for being exempted from needing to prepare a Master File is each individual Taiwan local entity's total net operating revenues and non-operating income being less than TWD 3 billion, or over TWD 3 billion but with total absolute value of cross-border controlled transaction(s) amounting to less than TWD 1.5 billion in the current year.
The CbCR file is to contain information relating to the allocation of the corporation’s group’s profit/loss, resources, taxes paid, and primary activities performed by each entity. The threshold for being exempted from preparing a CbCR file is the corporation’s group's consolidated group revenues and non-operating income being less than TWD 27 billion (approximately equal to the OECD's threshold of 750 million euros [EUR]) in the preceding year. Moreover, for Taiwan entities under a multinational enterprise (MNE) group headquartered outside of Taiwan, even if the parent company or the surrogate company (as the case may be) is required to submit a CbCR file according to its country's regulations, the Taiwan entities shall be exempted from submitting a CbCR file to Taiwan tax authorities as long as it is exempted from Master File submission.
## Thin capitalisation
Deductible interest expense on inter-company loans is capped at a prescribed debt-to-equity ratio of 3:1. The thin capitalisation rule generally applies to profit-seeking enterprises, except banks, credit cooperatives, financial holding companies, bills finance companies, insurance companies, and securities companies.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Currently, profits of overseas subsidiaries held by Taiwan companies are not subject to 20% CIT in Taiwan until such profits are repatriated to Taiwan as dividend income. However, under the new CFC mechanism expected to take effect in the future, qualified investment income will be deemed distributed and taxable in Taiwan in advance, even if profits have not actually been distributed.
On 14 January 2022, the Executive Yuan announced that the new CFC Rules will come into force from 1 January 2023.
## Place of effective management (PEM)
Under the new tax regime, if a foreign company meets all three criteria triggering PEM definition, including (i) decision making location, (ii) record keeping and maintenance location, and (iii) actual operating location are all in Taiwan, the foreign enterprise will be deemed as having its head office in Taiwan and will be subject to tax assessment in accordance with Taiwan Income Tax Act and other tax regulations. A foreign enterprise may voluntarily apply to be subject to the PEM taxation mechanism, or the tax authorities may determine whether the PEM taxation mechanism should apply after conducting appropriate audits.
The date of implementation still has to be determined by the Executive Yuan.


# Taiwan
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 19 August 2024
A non-resident company whose head office is located outside of Taiwan must keep separate books for its branch in Taiwan. A head office or regional headquarters’ general and administrative expenses may be allocated to the branch under certain conditions. CIT is assessed only on the branch’s profits. A Taiwan branch should complete an annual CIT return.
A Taiwan branch of a foreign company may remit after-tax profits to its foreign head office without further tax due.
## Motion picture leasing
A foreign motion picture’s branch in Taiwan can deem 45% of its revenue from leasing of motion pictures as cost. However, if a foreign enterprise with no branch office in Taiwan leases motion pictures through agents, 50% of the revenues can be deemed as taxable income.
## Deemed-profit method
A non-resident company that is engaged in international transportation, construction contracting, provision of technical services, or machinery and equipment leasing within Taiwan, and where the cost and expenses are proven to be difficult to calculate, may apply for advance approval from the National Tax Administration (NTA) to adopt the deemed-profit method to determine the taxable income as 10% or 15% of the gross revenues. This will effectively reduce the WHT rate to 2% or 3% on gross revenues once the approval is obtained from the NTA.
A non-resident company having income derived from business operation in Taiwan may also seek approval from the NTA to be taxed on net profit by claiming actual costs or applying a deemed-profit ratio based on its industry. 
For non-resident enterprises providing cross-border electronic services to Taiwanese buyers (including individuals and profit-seeking enterprises and organisations), the non-resident company may apply to the NTA to adopt a deemed-profit method based on its business model and industry.


# Taiwan
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 19 August 2024
Certain tax incentives are provided to investors if they are located in prescribed areas, such as science parks, export processing zones, free-trade-zones, etc. Other tax credits are granted to qualifying companies that invest in specific businesses or industries promoted by the government, such as biotech.
## Research and development (R&D) tax incentives
Under the Statute for Industrial Innovation (SII), R&D credits are available for up to 15% of qualified R&D expenses incurred, with the maximum amount of tax credit capped at 30% of the tax payable for the year in which the expenses were incurred, including the 5% profit retention tax.
Effective from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2029, amendments to the SII provide another alternative for companies to claim an R&D credit of 10% of qualifying R&D expenses against income tax payable within a period of three years, starting from the current year. In addition, effective from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2019, to facilitate the circulation and application of innovative R&D results, and to promote industrialisation of innovative technologies, where individuals/companies derive income from transfer or license of their self-developed intellectual property (IP), the amendments also allow the individuals/companies to either deduct qualifying R&D expenses of up to 200% (capped at corresponding income received) within the current year or claim R&D tax credits against income tax payable.
Moreover, according to the Statute for Development of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), enterprises qualifying as SMEs may elect one of the following methods to calculate R&D credits, subject to the 30% cap mentioned above:
  * 15% of qualified R&D expenses for the current year, with credits limited to the same year, or
  * 10% of qualified R&D expenses for the current year, which can be carried forward for two ensuing years.


According to Regulation Governing R&D Investment Tax Credit (ITC) Available to Profit-seeking Enterprises, a single annual application for R&D ITC should be made with the central competent authorities within four months prior to the CIT return filing due date. Information relating to R&D ITC should be provided with the CIT return.
## Other tax incentives
The Legislative Yuan passed the third reading on amendments to the Statute for Industrial Innovation. In addition to providing a ten-year extension for the existing five major tax incentive items, 'deduction of actual investment from tax base of profit retention tax' and 'tax credit for smart machinery and 5G system expenditures' were added as new incentive items. Salient points of the additional tax incentives are as follows:
Items | Explanation  
---|---  
Investment tax credit | 
  * Effective period: 1 January 2019 through 31 December 2024 for smart machinery and 5G expenditures. 1 January 2022 through 31 December 2024 for IT security expenditures.
  * Tax credit of up to 5% of expenditures, creditable against current year CIT payable; or tax credit of up to 3% of expenditures, creditable against CIT payable within three years.
  * Tax credit shall not exceed 30% of current year CIT plus profit retention tax payable.

  
Deduction of actual investment from tax base of profit retention tax | 
  * Deduction of actual investment from tax base of profit retention tax if actual investment within three years reaches a certain threshold.
  * Scope of 'actual investment' includes purchase of: 
    * Buildings (including capital expenditure on expansion of building, which increases the building's value and efficacy).
    * Machinery and equipment.
    * Software/hardware.
    * Technology.

  
In addition to the above, the Legislative Yuan passed the third reading of amendments to Article 10-2 of Statute for Industrial Innovation (i.e. Taiwanese Chips Act) on 7 January 2023. Effective from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2029, Taiwan registered companies that undergo technological innovation onshore and assume critical positions in global supply chain can, subject to certain limits, utilise the following:
  * ITC for forward-looking innovative R&D expenditure: Credit up to 25% of forward-looking innovative R&D expenditure against CIT payable of current year.
  * ITC for purchase of equipment used in advanced manufacturing process: Credit up to 5% of equipment expenditure against CIT payable of current year.


## Tax concessions on merger
A number of tax incentives are available under the Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) Act to encourage M&A activities in Taiwan. Certain taxes, including business tax, deed tax, LVIT, securities transaction tax, and stamp tax, may be exempted or deferred in case of acquisitions, mergers, or corporate divisions (including spin-offs) that meet certain conditions.
After the merger, spin-off, or acquisition, any tax concession previously enjoyed by the merged entities will continue to be applicable to the surviving or newly created company. However, it is required to manufacture the same products or provide the same services that were originally approved for tax concessions by the merged entities in order to continue the concessions obtained previously.
The unexpired and unutilised net operating losses of the participating entities prior to the merger or spin-off may be carried over to the surviving or newly created entity according to the percentage of shareholding in the surviving or newly-created company held by all shareholders of the participating entities.
Income tax exemption is available if the shares acquired by a company as a result of transfer of its entire or substantial portion of business or assets to another company, or due to spin-off, is greater than 80% of the consideration of the entire transaction, and all the shares so acquired have been transferred to the shareholders of the transferor.
## Free-trade-zones
According to the Statute for the Establishment and Management of Free-trade-zones, companies (both domestic and foreign) that solely perform preparatory or ancillary activities within Taiwan and engage in or appoint a free-trade-zone entity to engage in procurement, importation, storage, or delivery activities within a free-trade-zone can apply for income tax exemption on the income from sales of goods.
## Foreign tax credit
Taiwan uses the credit method to avoid double taxation of income. Foreign taxes paid on foreign-sourced income may be credited against a company’s total Taiwan income tax liability. However, the credit is limited to the incremental taxes derived from the foreign-sourced income.


# Taiwan
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 19 August 2024
Resident corporations paying service fees to foreign entities are often subject to 20% WHT. However, under the following scenarios, the WHT might be reduced:
  * WHT on service income may be reduced by deducting costs and expenses and applying a contribution ratio.
  * Technical services income can utilise a deemed profit rate of 15%, thereby reducing the net WHT rate to 3%.
  * Cross-border electronic services income may be taxed after deducting costs and expenses and applying a contribution ratio.
  * A foreign entity that is a tax resident of a country with a tax treaty with Taiwan can evaluate the nature of its income to determine whether the income qualifies for business profits tax exemption in accordance with the applicable tax treaty.


In addition to the above, resident corporations paying certain types of income are required to withhold tax as follows:

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 19 August 2024
A Taiwan resident company is taxed on its net income, which is defined as gross annual income after deduction of costs, expenses, losses, and taxes. Except for certain exempt items, income from all sources, including offshore and onshore, is subject to CIT.
A non-resident company is only taxed on its Taiwan-sourced income. Article 8 of the Income Tax Act and the related Guideline defines the types of income that should be regarded as sourced from Taiwan. For example, fees received by a non-resident company for service performed entirely outside of Taiwan are exempt from income tax assessment, subject to supporting evidentiary documents.
## Inventory valuation
Inventory must be valued at cost. If cost exceeds the net realisable value, the latter may be used as the valuation basis. Cost may be determined by the first in first out (FIFO), moving average, weighted average, specific identification, or any other method approved by the tax authorities. Conformity between financial and tax reporting is not required.
## Capital gains
Gains on the disposal of fixed assets are taxable as current-year income of the company, with the exception of gains on the sales of land under the old real estate taxation regime. Capital gains on disposal of Taiwanese marketable securities and futures by resident companies and non-resident companies with an FPOB or business agent in Taiwan are exempt from CIT assessment, but are liable for IBT of 12%, with an exemption amount of TWD 600,000. Capital losses may be deducted against capital gains and carried forward for five years. 50% of capital gains can be tax exempt should the securities be held for more than three years. In addition, securities transaction tax is levied on the sales proceeds (_see the section_).
## Dividend income
Dividends received from resident investee companies by a resident corporate shareholder are not included in taxable income. However, dividends received from foreign subsidiaries are taxable, but credits are given for the WHT paid offshore, limited to the incremental tax liability that would result if the dividends were added to the Taiwan corporate shareholder’s taxable income and taxed at the Taiwan CIT rate.
## Interest income
Interest received on commercial paper and certain other interest-bearing financial instruments is subject to WHT of 10% and 15%/20% for resident and non-resident taxpayers, respectively (_see the section_). This income should be reported as current-year income, and the WHT paid can be deducted against the income tax payable.
## Royalties and technical service fees
Non-resident companies who receive royalties for licensing patents both registered in Taiwan and overseas, trademarks registered in Taiwan, and computer software copyright licensed to Taiwan companies, or who receive technical service fees in relation to construction of factories/plant/power plants to Taiwan companies incorporated as companies limited by shares, can apply for income tax exemption by obtaining advance approval from both the Industrial Development Bureau and the tax authorities. For licensing of patents and technical service fees, the Taiwan licensee company needs to be engaged in designated industries. The amendments to the relevant regulation governing the applicable criteria are effective retroactively for contracts concluded after 1 January 2011.
## Foreign income
Taiwan adopts a worldwide tax system to tax its resident companies (including the Taiwan subsidiaries of foreign companies). In theory, taxation on foreign investment income of a Taiwanese company is deferred until cash is repatriated to Taiwan. However, given Taiwan also taxes undistributed profits based on net income shown on the income statement (_see Profit retention tax in the section_), foreign investment income may still be taxed in Taiwan before cash is repatriated back to Taiwan.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 19 August 2024
The corporate income tax (CIT) rate in Taiwan is 20%.
Resident companies in Taiwan are taxed on their worldwide income as follows:
Taxable income (TWD*) | Tax thereon  
---|---  
Up to 120,000 | Exempt  
120,001 and over | 20% of total taxable income  
* Taiwan dollars
A non-resident company is taxed on income derived from Taiwan sources. A non-resident company with a fixed place of business (FPOB) or business agent in Taiwan is taxed similarly to a resident company (i.e. subject to filing of an annual CIT return based on the same CIT rate provided above). A non-resident company having no FPOB or business agent in Taiwan is subject to withholding tax (WHT) at source on its Taiwan-sourced income. WHT rates on dividends, interest, and royalties may be reduced if the recipient is a tax resident of a tax treaty country and the relevant treaty provides for a reduced rate. _See the section for more information_.
## Tonnage tax system
A qualifying enterprise having its head office in Taiwan engaged in maritime transportation may elect to be taxed under the tonnage tax system, where a lump sum tax is calculated on the net tonnage of their fleet. Once the application is approved, the enterprise must remain under the tonnage tax system and cannot switch to the regular tax system at its discretion for ten consecutive years. Furthermore, loss carryforwards and tax incentives are not eligible under the tonnage tax system.
## Profit retention tax
An additional profit retention tax of 5% is imposed on any current earnings of a corporation that remain undistributed by the end of the following year. Taiwan branches of foreign companies are not subject to profit retention tax.
## Income basic tax (IBT)
All Taiwan resident companies, as well as non-resident companies with an FPOB or business agent in Taiwan, should calculate IBT if they earn certain income that is tax-exempt. For taxable year 2024, the basic income of a company is the amount calculated in accordance with a formulae stipulated by the government, with a deduction of TWD 600,000. The IBT rate is 12%. If the IBT amount is greater than the regular CIT amount, taxpayers must pay income tax based on the regular CIT amount plus the difference between the IBT amount and the regular CIT amount. On the other hand, if the regular CIT amount is greater than the IBT amount, no special action is required.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 19 August 2024
## Business tax
All sales of goods and services in Taiwan, as well as the importation of goods into Taiwan, are subject to business tax. There are two types of business tax systems: value-added tax (VAT) and gross business receipts tax (GBRT).
Sellers and service providers are generally obligated to pay business tax for the sales of goods or services within Taiwan unless the law provides otherwise. For importation of goods, the business tax will be paid by the goods receivers or buyers via customs. For importation of services sold by foreign companies to Taiwanese buyers, business tax shall be paid by the service buyers. However, the service buyer (corporate entity) will not be required to pay business tax if it is exclusively engaged in taxable transactions subject to either 5% or 0% VAT.
### Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is applicable to general industries, and the VAT rate is 5%. Under the VAT system, each seller collects output VAT from the buyer at the time of sale, deducts input VAT paid on purchases from output VAT, and remits the balance to the tax authority.
### Gross business receipts tax (GBRT)
GBRT is applicable to specified industries (e.g. financial institutions, small businesses). For investment trust companies, securities and futures firms, short-term commercial paper enterprises, and pawnshops, the rate is 2%. The GBRT rate on revenues derived from the core business operations of banks and insurance enterprises is 5%. For re-insurance enterprises, the rate is 1%.
### Foreign e-service providers
Taiwan has formally implemented a VAT mechanism for cross-border sales of business-to-consumer (B2C) electronic services. Under the mechanism, sales of cross-border electronic services by corporate sellers to individual buyers require the foreign companies to register for VAT purposes in Taiwan, file VAT returns, and pay VAT if their annual sales exceed the promulgated threshold of TWD 480,000.
## Customs duties
Taiwan uses the Customs Cooperation Council Nomenclature (CCCN) to classify goods and set duty rates. The customs duty is payable by the consignee or the holder of the bill of lading for imported goods and is based on the dutiable value or the volume of goods imported.
## Commodity tax
Commodity tax (excise duty) is levied on certain commodities, as specified in the Commodity Tax Act (including rubber tyres, beverages, cement, plate glass, oil and gas, electrical appliances, and vehicles), at the time when such goods are dispatched from a factory or when imported. Tax rates vary from 8% to 30% and are applicable to different types of commodities based on the value of the goods or its volume in specific circumstances.
Type of commodity | Tax rate  
---|---  
Rubber tyres | 10% or 15%  
Beverages | 8% or 15%  
Cement | TWD 280 to TWD 600 per ton  
Plate glass | 10%  
Oil and gas | TWD 110 to TWD 6,830 per kilolitre or TWD 690 per ton  
Electrical appliances | 10% to 20%  
Vehicles | 15% to 30%  
## Property tax
Land and buildings are annually assessed for tax based on their officially assessed values as determined by the government authorities at the applicable rate. The land value tax rate ranges from 1% to 5.5% of the assessed land value. The building tax rate for properties used for non-residential purposes is 1.5% to 5% of the assessed value, and the rate for properties used for residential purposes is 1% to 4.8% of the assessed value.
## Land value increment tax (LVIT)
The sale of land is currently subject to LVIT and payable by the seller. The tax is levied on the increase in the government-assessed value of the land during the ownership period, adjusted for inflation, at regular progressive rates ranging from 20% to 40%, or a special rate of 10%.
## Real property transfer tax
### Joint Property Tax System 2.0
All properties acquired post 1 January 2016 and sold after 1 July 2021 will be subject to tax stipulated under Joint Property Tax System 2.0.
  * Scope of taxation: Sale of post 1 January 2016 acquired land, building, pre-sold building and underlying land, or majority (over 50% shareholding) shares of directly or indirectly held foreign or domestic profit-seeking enterprises where more than 50% of value of shares or capital contribution is comprised of building and land within Taiwan, excluding sale of listed/OTC or emerging stock.
  * Tax rate: A tax rate range from 15% to 45% will apply depending on the holding period of the property.
  * Tax base: The taxable base is the market value of the properties reduced by related costs, expenses, and the increase in government-assessed land value for LVIT purposes. 


LVIT will remain unchanged by the implementation of the new real property transfer tax regime on property transactions. The total amount of land value increment is deducted from real estate transaction income to avoid double taxation.
### Old Property Tax Regime
The old property tax regime still applies to properties purchased prior to 2 January 2014, or those bought on or after 2 January 2014 if held for more than two years, where only gain from sale of buildings is subject to CIT assessment, while gain from sale of land is exempt from CIT assessment, and LVIT applies to increment in government-assessed value of land instead.
## Deed tax
Currently, transactions of immovable property involving sale, creation of _Dien_ , exchange, bestowal, partition, or acquisition of ownership by virtue of possession are subject to deed tax. The deed tax rates range from 2% to 6%, depending on the types of transactions involved.
## Stamp tax
Stamp taxes are imposed on each copy of the following documents executed within the territory of Taiwan (with the following respective tax rates):
  * Monetary receipts must have a revenue stamp of 0.4% of the amount received per piece. However, a receipt for the money deposited by the bidder requires a revenue stamp of 0.1% of the amount received per piece.
  * Contract or deed for the sale or purchase of movable property must have a revenue stamp of TWD 12 per piece.
  * Contractual agreement under which one party agrees to complete a specific piece of work for the other party for consideration must have a revenue stamp of 0.1% of the contract price.
  * Contract for the sale, transfer, and partition of real estate must have a revenue stamp of 0.1% of the contract price.


## Securities transaction tax
Tax is levied on securities transactions at the rate of 0.3% on gross proceeds from the sale of domestic shares. Trading in corporate bonds and financial bonds issued by Taiwan companies is temporarily exempt from securities transaction tax assessment.
## Luxury tax
A 10% luxury tax applies to the sale of passenger cars, private jets, and helicopters valued at TWD 3 million or more, as well as to the sale of yachts that are at least 30.48 metres (100 feet) long. Preserved wildlife products (including turtle shells, hawksbill, coral, ivory, furs, and their products), high-end furniture, and non-refundable memberships worth TWD 500,000 or more are also taxed at 10%.
As of 1 January 2016, luxury tax is no longer levied on sales of real estate properties.
## Payroll taxes
There are no payroll taxes other than those for social security contributions (_see below_).
## Social security contributions
There are compulsory social security programs that require contributions from employers and employees based on monthly insured salary, which is capped at various amounts for labour insurance, health insurance, and pensions. Taiwan social security programs include the following:
  * Labour Insurance Program: Where a company hires five or more employees, it is obligated to insure all employees (including domestic and foreign employees) under the labour insurance program run by the government. Companies with less than five employees may also apply for labour insurance coverage for their employees. As of 1 January 2024, the premium rate for ordinary insurance is 11% on the employee's monthly insured salary up to TWD 45,800, with an additional 1% levied for unemployment insurance. The employer is required to contribute 70% of this premium.
  * National Health Insurance Program: The premium rate for each insured person is set at 5.17% of a domestic/foreign employee's monthly insured salary, up to TWD 219,500. The employer is required to contribute 60% of this premium. Further, the employer bears the cost of both the employee itself and that of the average dependant, which amounts to 1.57 headcount per employee. Moreover, under the Second Generation National Health Insurance Program, the employer needs to bear a supplementary premium (at the rate of 2.11%) where the monthly pay (including both regular and non-regular pay) exceeds the monthly insured salary range, which is capped at TWD 219,500 for any individual.
  * Labour Pension Program: An employer needs to make monthly contributions to a domestic employee's individual pension account set up with the Labour Insurance Bureau. The monthly contribution rate borne by the employer should be at least 6% of the employee's monthly insured salary up to TWD 150,000.
