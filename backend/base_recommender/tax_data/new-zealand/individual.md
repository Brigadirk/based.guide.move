## Foreign tax relief
A tax credit is available on the tax paid on foreign-sourced income derived by a resident (up to the level of New Zealand tax payable). In some cases, foreign tax credits will be limited to the lesser of the actual overseas tax paid on the overseas income or the New Zealand tax applicable to the overseas income.
## Tax treaties
_Information about countries with which New Zealand currently has DTAs and Tax Information Exchange Agreements can be found at_.
## Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) 
The United States (US) Treasury and the New Zealand government have entered into an inter-governmental agreement (IGA) for the implementation of the FATCA rules, which came into force on 3 July 2014. The FATCA rules require all global financial institutions that are not exempted, including New Zealand financial institutions, to register with and report to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regarding certain financial accounts held with them.

Last reviewed - 20 December 2024
## Double taxation agreements (DTAs)
New Zealand is currently negotiating new and updating DTAs with several countries, including Australia, Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Portugal, Slovenia, South Korea, and the United Kingdom.
## Trustee tax rate
Trustee income is subject to a tax rate of 39% from the 2024/25 income year, subject to some limited exclusions. 
## ‘FamilyBoost’ tax credit
The FamilyBoost tax credit was introduced in 2024 in relation to childcare costs incurred by families. The credit is available from 1 July 2024.
The amount of the credit for a quarter is equal to 25% of the licensed early childhood education (ECE) fees paid for that quarter, up to a maximum of 975 New Zealand dollars (NZD). However, the amount of the credit abates at the rate of 9.75 cents in the dollar when quarterly household income is greater than NZD 35,000. The amount of the credit is zero when quarterly household income is NZD 45,000 or more.
The tax credit results in a refund for the applicant and is based on actual ECE fees incurred, subject to eligibility requirements. A New Zealand tax resident caregiver of one or more children enrolled with a licensed early childhood service for which ECE fees are incurred may be entitled.
## Bright-line test
Under the bright-line rules, residential land that is disposed of within two years of acquisition is subject to tax (regardless of whether the taxpayer had a purpose or intention of disposal at the time of acquisition). The previous government had extended the bright-line period to ten years from the date of acquisition. The new government has recently enacted changes to reduce the bright-line period to two years for residential land disposed on or after 1 July 2024. 
A property is excluded from the bright-line rules if it was mainly a taxpayer’s ‘main home’ for most of the bright-line period. 
Rollover relief is also available (subject to certain conditions) for transfers between associated persons, including blood relatives, associated companies, trustees of a trust, and transfers to certain non-profit organisations.
## Interest limitation rules
Interest deductibility for borrowing on residential investment property is being phased back in over the next two tax years. Since1 April 2024, 80% of the interest expenses incurred for amounts borrowed in relation to residential property have been deductible. This is regardless of when the property was acquired or when the loan was drawn down. From 1 April 2025, interest deductibility will be fully restored (i.e. 100% deductibility), subject to other provisions governing interest deductibility.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 20 December 2024
## Taxable period
The New Zealand tax year ends on 31 March.
## Tax returns
Returns (if required) must be filed by 7 July each year, depending on the income type and/or the country of source. An extension of time until the following 31 March is available for taxpayers with a tax agent. Individuals file separate returns. There is no provision for joint returns for spouses. Failure to file a return (if required) may result in prosecution and penalties. There is no requirement to file a return for most individuals who earn only employment income, or income where tax is deducted at source at the appropriate rate.
## Payment of tax
Residual income tax (RIT) is the amount of income tax payable by a taxpayer after deducting tax credits but before deducting any provisional tax paid. Every taxpayer who is liable to pay RIT exceeding NZD 5,000 for an income year from 1 April 2020 will be a provisional taxpayer for the next year.
## Tax pooling
Taxpayers may reduce their exposure to use of money interest (UOMI) on provisional tax by using an Inland Revenue approved tax pooling intermediary. Tax pooling intermediaries facilitate the trading of under-payments and over-payments of provisional tax and typically save taxpayers some UOMI and late payment penalties that would have been charged in the absence of using tax pooling.
### Calculating provisional tax
Provisional taxpayers have four options for calculating their provisional tax payments.
These options are:
  * The standard uplift method. 
  * The estimate method. 
  * The GST ratio method. 
  * The accounting income method (AIM). 


#### Standard uplift method
Under the standard uplift method, the general rule is that provisional tax payable is 105% of the RIT for the previous income year. However, if the prior year tax return has not been filed due to an extension of time for filing, the provisional tax payable can be based on 110% of the RIT for the income year before the previous income year (i.e. two years ago). The standard calculation method is the default calculation method, but it cannot be used if another method is adopted.
#### Estimate method
Provisional tax can be based on an estimate of the income year’s RIT. A taxpayer who chooses to estimate RIT is required to take reasonable care when doing so.
#### GST ratio method
The GST ratio method enables smaller taxpayers to align their provisional tax payments with their cash flow and reduce their exposure to UOMI. The option benefits those taxpayers with declining, seasonal, or fluctuating income. This option calculates provisional tax by reference to the taxpayer’s GST taxable supplies in the relevant provisional tax instalment period.
#### Accounting income method (AIM)
Available from the 2018/19 income year onwards, AIM is targeted at small to medium sized businesses with annual gross income of less than NZD 5 million. AIM uses accounting information from the business' accounting software for a period as a basis for calculating the tax liability of the business for that period. The resulting amount is payable by the taxpayer as a provisional tax instalment.
#### Voluntary payments
Taxpayers can also make voluntary payments. Such payments can minimise exposure to UOMI.
When the taxpayer files their tax return for the year, the provisional tax paid for that year is credited against the tax assessed. This results in either a refund or further tax to pay by way of terminal tax.
### Use of money interest (UOMI)
Taxpayers are required to pay interest when taxes are not paid by the due date for payment. There is a corresponding requirement for the Commissioner to pay interest to the taxpayer when the taxpayer has overpaid tax. UOMI applies to most tax obligations (e.g. income tax, PAYE, FBT, GST).
Certain taxpayers are subject to the UOMI regime. From the 2018 tax year, there have been changes to the way interest is calculated on over and underpayments. When RIT exceeds provisional tax paid, the taxpayer may be liable to pay interest on the underpayment. This is generally where they pay provisional tax on an estimated basis or when they have RIT exceeding NZD 60,000. Interest is payable regardless of culpability. When provisional tax paid exceeds RIT, the taxpayer in some scenarios may be entitled to receive interest on the overpayment.
Under the interest rules, from the 2018 tax year, as long as a taxpayer has made provisional tax payments in full and on time under the standard method, credit and debit interest starts from the day after the:
  * terminal tax date if one's RIT is less than NZD 60,000, or 
  * final instalment date if one's RIT is NZD 60,000 or more. 


Taxpayers can also make voluntary payments. However, if provisional tax is paid under the standard method at the first and second instalment, this will minimise exposure to UOMI.
#### UOMI rates
From 16 January 2025, the interest rate for overpaid tax is 4.30% and the rate for underpaid tax is 10.88%. Interest is generally calculated from the due date for the third instalment of provisional tax if the taxpayer has paid under the standard method at the first and second instalment. Interest paid is deductible for both companies and individuals, while interest received is taxable.
### Tax penalties
An initial late payment penalty of 1% applies if the taxpayer does not pay tax by the due date. A further 4% late payment penalty applies if the tax is still not paid within seven days of the due date. Each additional penalty is applied on a compounding basis, i.e. it is imposed on any unpaid provisional tax plus any late payment penalties that have been imposed in respect of that unpaid tax.
Inland Revenue is required to notify a taxpayer the first time their payment is late rather than imposing an immediate late payment penalty. If the taxpayer does not make payment by a certain date, Inland Revenue will impose a late payment penalty. Taxpayers are entitled to one notification every two years. After receiving a first warning, Inland Revenue will not send further notifications for two years and will impose an initial late payment penalty in the normal manner.
#### Shortfall penalties
Shortfall penalties, calculated as a percentage of the tax shortfall resulting from the action or position taken by the taxpayer in a tax return, may also apply. These are:
Action subject to penalty | Standard rate (%) | Rate after reduction by 100%/75% for disclosure before audit or timing error only (%) | Rate after reduction by 40% for disclosure during audit (%) | Rate after reduction by 75% for disclosure when filing (%) | Rate after increase by 25% for obstruction (%)  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Lack of reasonable care | 20 | 0/5 | 12 | NA | 25  
Unacceptable tax position | 20 | 0/5 | 12 | 5 | 25  
Gross carelessness | 40 | 10 | 24 | NA | 50  
Abusive tax position | 100 | 25 | 60 | 25 | 125  
Evasion | 150 | 37.5 | 90 | NA | 187.5  
There is a 50% discount on certain penalties when the taxpayer has a past record of good behaviour and, in certain circumstances, a cap of NZD 50,000 on shortfall penalties for not taking reasonable care or for taking an unacceptable tax position.
When a taxpayer discloses a tax shortfall voluntarily before notification of a tax audit or investigation, penalties imposed for lack of reasonable care and for taking an unacceptable tax position are reduced by 100%.
## Employee share scheme reporting
From 1 April 2017, employers must disclose the value of share benefits that employees receive under employee share schemes. This requirement applies to shares and share options. Under the current payday filing rules, employers are also required to report the amount of tax withheld for the benefit (if any) to Inland Revenue. Employers are not required to disclose the specific details of the share scheme benefits provided.
## Tax audit process
The name of the New Zealand tax authority is the Inland Revenue Department (IRD). The IRD initiates a tax audit by sending a letter to the taxpayer notifying them they are undertaking an audit. The letter generally outlines the tax type(s) and year(s) under audit and includes a list of questions and/or document requests. The IRD normally provides a deadline for response within the letter.
## Statute of limitations
Inland Revenue generally has four years from the end of the tax year in which a tax return was filed to reassess the return. The limitation period does not apply to a tax return that is fraudulent or wilfully misleading or omits income.


# New Zealand
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 20 December 2024
## Employment expenses
Generally, no deduction is allowed for expenditure incurred in deriving employment income. It is therefore necessary that employers assess the correct tax treatment of allowances and expense reimbursements at payroll (PAYE) submission time.
## Business deductions
Deductions are available for expenditure incurred in deriving assessable or excluded income (other than employment income) incurred in the course of carrying on a business. Subject to the entertainment expenditure provisions, certain entertainment expenditure is only 50% deductible.
The new government reinstated interest deductibility in relation to residential properties. Since 1 April 2024, interest deductibility has been available for 80% of interest expenses incurred in relation to residential property. From 1 April 2025, interest expenses are 100% deductible.
## Personal deductions
No deduction is permitted for medical, superannuation, or insurance contributions. Certain insurance premiums may be allowed as a deduction under the general permission (i.e. loss of earnings).
## Charitable contributions
Taxpayers are eligible for a tax credit for charitable donations/contributions made during the tax year. _See the_ _section for more information._


# New Zealand
## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 20 December 2024
## Employment income
A New Zealand tax resident is taxed on salary, wages, bonuses, allowances, and retirement gratuities received in cash, regardless of the source of that income. Non-residents are taxed only to the extent their employment income is earned in New Zealand (i.e. usually where services are performed in New Zealand), regardless of where payment is made and whether it is remitted to New Zealand. Allowances paid in cash that are no more than a reimbursement of business-related expenses (with incidental person benefit) incurred within employment are generally not taxable. Certain relocation costs, overtime meal allowances, and accommodation benefits paid by employers to employees are exempt from income tax and FBT. The benefit arising from the use of an employer-provided motor vehicle, a low-interest loan, or discounted goods or services is not taxable to the employee, but the value of a benefit from the provision of shares or options, lodging, or housing by an employer is taxable to the employee. Other benefits provided to an employee in a non-monetary form are generally not taxable in the employee’s hands (_see Fringe benefit tax in the_ _section_).
## Capital gains
New Zealand does not have a comprehensive capital gains tax. However, income tax legislation specifically includes various forms of gain that would otherwise be considered a capital gain within the definition of 'income’. Gross income includes gains on the sale of real estate in certain circumstances and on personal property where the taxpayer acquired the property for resale, where certain residential properties are bought and sold within two years, where the taxpayer deals in such property, or where a profit-making purpose or scheme can be inferred from the actions of the taxpayer.
Gains on financial instruments are taxable when realised or when the instruments are deemed to have been disposed of. Above certain thresholds, such gains are taxable on an accrual (yield-to-maturity) basis, which may include unrealised gains.
## Rental income
Rent derived from property is gross income. Deductions are allowed for most expenses incurred in deriving the rental income.
From 1 April 2019, deductions for expenditure incurred in relation to residential rental properties are limited to the extent of the residential income derived. Any excess expenditure is 'ring-fenced' and available to carry forward to offset against future residential rental income, but, generally, will not be available to offset against other income streams. Since 1 April 2024, interest expenses have been 80% deductible, and they will be fully deductible from 1 April 2025.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
The CFC regime imposes New Zealand tax on the notional share of income attributable to residents (companies, trusts, and individuals) with interests in certain CFCs.
Central to the regime is the definition of a CFC. When five or fewer New Zealand residents directly or indirectly control more than 50% of a foreign company, or when a single New Zealand resident directly or indirectly controls 40% or more of a foreign company (unless a non-associated non-resident has equal or greater control), that company is a CFC. For interests of less than 10%, the investment may be taxed under the Foreign Investment Funds (FIFs) regime (_see below_).
For income years starting on or after 1 July 2009, a person with an income interest of 10% or more in a CFC does not have attributed CFC income or losses if:
  * the Australian exemption applies, or 
  * the CFC passes an active business test.


If the exemptions do not apply, only the CFC’s passive (attributable) income is subject to tax on attribution (on an accrual basis).
### Active business test
A CFC passes the active business test if it has passive (attributable) income that is less than 5% of its total income. For the purposes of the test, taxpayers measure passive and total income using either financial accounting (audited International Financial Reporting Standards [IFRS] or New Zealand Generally Accepted Accounting Principles [GAAP] accounts) or tax measures of income.
CFCs in the same country may be consolidated for calculating the 5% ratio, subject to certain conditions.
The active exemption test may also be available to investors with less than 10% interest income in a CFC if certain criteria are satisfied.
### Australian exemption
A person with an income interest of 10% or more in a CFC does not have attributed CFC income or a loss if the CFC is a resident in, and subject to income tax in, Australia and meets certain other criteria.
### Passive (attributable) income
Attributable, or passive, income is income that is highly mobile and not location-specific (i.e. income where there is a risk that it could easily be shifted out of the New Zealand tax base).
The broad categories of attributable income are as follows:
  * Certain types of dividend that would be taxable if received by a New Zealand resident company.
  * Certain interest.
  * Certain royalties.
  * Certain rents.
  * Certain amounts for financial arrangements.
  * Income from services performed in New Zealand.
  * Income from offshore insurance business and life insurance policies.
  * Personal services income.
  * Income from the disposal of revenue account property.
  * Certain income related to telecommunications services. 


Taxpayers must disclose interests in CFCs in their annual tax returns. Failure to disclose CFC interests can result in the imposition of penalties.
## Foreign Investment Funds (FIFs)
The FIF regime is an extension of the CFC regime, which subjects persons with interests in certain foreign entities (which are not CFCs) to New Zealand tax. It also applies when the investor does not have a sufficient interest in a foreign entity to be taxed under the CFC regime.
Common examples of investments classified as FIFs include foreign companies, unit trusts, certain foreign superannuation schemes, and certain life insurance policies issued by foreign entities.
The FIF rules can be split into the following two regimes:
  * The portfolio FIF rules, which apply to interests of less than 10% in a FIF. 
  * The non-portfolio FIF rules, which apply to interests of 10% or more that are outside the CFC rules. 


### Portfolio FIF rules
The portfolio FIF rules apply to interests of less than 10% in foreign companies, foreign superannuation schemes, and foreign life insurance policies issued by non-resident life insurers (if the CFC rules do not apply). However, a New Zealand resident does not generally have FIF income when:
  * the total cost of FIF interests held by the individual does not exceed NZD 50,000 at any point in the income year
  * the income interest is less than 10% in certain Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) listed companies or certain Australian unit trusts, or 
  * the CFC rules apply. 


There are also exemptions for interests in certain Australian superannuation schemes.
When an interest is exempt from the FIF rules, distributions are subject to tax on a receipts basis in accordance with normal principles.
The taxable income of a New Zealand resident with an interest in a FIF that does not qualify for one of the exemptions is calculated using one of the following methods:
  * Fair dividend rate (FDR). 
  * Comparative value. 
  * Cost. 
  * Deemed rate of return. 
  * Attributable FIF income method.


The nature of the interest held and the availability of information restrict the choice of method.
Taxpayers must disclose interests in certain FIFs in their annual tax returns. Failure to disclose can result in the imposition of penalties.
### Non-portfolio FIF rules
The active income exemption (which applies for CFCs) also includes certain non-portfolio FIFs. If the FIF fails the active business test, passive income will be attributed to the New Zealand shareholders. There is also an exemption for shareholders with a 10% or greater interest in a FIF that is resident and subject to tax in Australia.
When investors do not have sufficient information to perform the calculations required under the active business test (or choose not to apply the active business test), they will be able to use one of the attribution methods for portfolio FIF investments (_see above_).
## Foreign superannuation
Interests in foreign superannuation schemes (excluding certain Australian schemes) that were acquired during a period of non-residence are not taxable on an accruals basis under the FIF rules. Instead, the regime for taxing foreign superannuation schemes applies to cash withdrawals, amounts transferred into New Zealand or Australian superannuation schemes, and disposals of a superannuation interest to another person in certain circumstances. These rules do not apply to regular foreign pension or annuity payments. These remain fully taxable with the exception of Australian superannuation schemes where the tax treatment is determined by the New Zealand-Australia double tax agreement. The rules also do not apply to superannuation schemes that were acquired while the person was a tax resident of New Zealand. These remain in the FIF rules (with the exception of Australian superannuation schemes that are excluded from the FIF rules).
Taxpayers who have already treated their foreign superannuation schemes, and withdrawals in the first 48 months of a person becoming a resident, will generally not be taxable. There are no changes to the tax treatment of Australian superannuation schemes.
Any lump sum withdrawals or transfers to New Zealand/Australian schemes to which the new rules apply are now taxed under one of two new calculation methods.
Under the schedule default method, the tax liability on withdrawal/transfer amount is calculated by applying a fraction to the withdrawal/transfer amount. The fraction is based on how long a person has been present in New Zealand since the end of the 48-month exemption period at the time the withdrawal/transfer is made.
The optional formula method provides an alternative to the default method and is only available for defined contribution plans (provided taxpayers have sufficient information available). This method gives taxpayers the ability to use a method that attempts to tax actual investment gains derived between the end of the 48-month exemption period and the time of withdrawal/transfer.
## Trans-Tasman retirement savings portability
Previously, Australians and New Zealanders working in Australia could not take their superannuation with them when they left Australia permanently.
The Australian government has completed legislative steps to allow individuals to transfer retirement savings between an Australian complying superannuation fund regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and a New Zealand KiwiSaver scheme, and vice versa. The new arrangements took effect from 1 July 2013. Participation in this is voluntary for both members and superannuation funds and schemes and allows the transfer with minimal costs. The savings will generally be subject to the rules of the host country. Lump sum retirement savings transferred between the two countries will be exempt from New Zealand income tax. New Zealand KiwiSaver members will be able to retain any member tax credits if the transfer is to an Australian scheme.
## Portfolio investment entities (PIEs)
A collective investment entity (i.e. a listed company, managed fund, super fund, or a KiwiSaver scheme) that qualifies as a PIE is able to elect into a set of tax rules (the PIE rules).
To be eligible to elect to become a PIE, the entity must be a New Zealand resident company (includes unit trusts), superannuation fund, or group investment fund that meets specific criteria in relation to investor size and investment type.
The key features of the PIE rules are:
  * Taxable income is allocated to investors and tax paid by the PIE on behalf of the investors at their marginal tax rates, capped at 28%. 
  * A distribution from a PIE is ‘excluded income’ and therefore not taxable to the investor. 
  * Any gains/losses that the PIE makes on the sale of shares in New Zealand companies and certain Australian resident companies listed on an approved index of the Australian stock exchange are non-taxable/non-deductible. 


The tax rates on PIEs have been aligned with the personal income tax (PIT) rate structure. The PIE tax rates are 10.5%, 17.5%, and 28%.
Taxable income (NZD) | Taxable + PIE income (NZD) | PIE tax rate (%)  
---|---|---  
0 to 14,000 | 0 to 48,000 | 10.5  
0 to 14,000 | 48,001 to 70,000 | 17.5  
14,001 to 48,000 | 0 to 70,000 | 17.5  
48,001 to 70,000 | 48,001 to 70,000 | 28.0  
Any | 70,001 and over | 28.0  
From 1 April 2025, the PIE tax rate thresholds will be amended to align with changes to PIT thresholds, which apply from 30 July 2024.
Taxable income (NZD) | Taxable + PIE income (NZD) | PIE tax rate (%)  
---|---|---  
0 to 15,600 | 0 to 53,500 | 10.5  
0 to 15,600 | 53,501 to 78,100 | 17.5  
15,601 to 53,500 | 0 to 78,100 | 17.5  
53,501 to 78,100 | 53,501 to 78,100 | 28.0  
Any | 78,101 and over | 28.0  
### Supplementary dividend tax credit regime
Previously, the supplementary dividend tax credit (previously known as foreign investor tax credit [FITC]) regime ensured that foreign investors were not taxed at more than the New Zealand corporate tax rate by effectively rebating the New Zealand WHT to the extent that the dividend was fully imputed. As non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) rates have been reduced to nil on most fully imputed dividends, a supplementary dividend tax credit is generally no longer required.
The supplementary dividend tax credit regime applies only to fully imputed dividends paid to shareholders holding less than 10% of the shares in the company on NRWT rates of at least 15%.
Broadly:
  * Only portfolio investors (i.e. those with less than 10% holdings) on NRWT rates of at least 15% qualify for relief under the supplementary dividend rules. 
  * A zero rate of NRWT applies to dividends paid to non-portfolio shareholders (i.e. shareholders with more than 10% holdings) and to any other dividends subject to lower tax rates, to the extent they are fully imputed. 


The changes affect provisional tax calculations for taxpayers who take into account their anticipated supplementary dividend tax credits in calculating their provisional tax. Taxpayers should also consider the need to impute dividends where a tax treaty applies to reduce the NRWT rate.


# New Zealand
## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 20 December 2024
## Credits for taxes withheld or paid
Tax credits are available for the following:
  * PAYE tax deducted by employers from employee wages. 
  * Instalments (provisional tax) paid by business taxpayers. 
  * Resident withholding tax (RWT) deductions on interest and dividends paid to New Zealand residents. RWT rates of 10.5%, 17.5%, 30%, 33%, and 39% apply to interest derived by residents. The default rate for people who do not notify their bank of the correct RWT rate is 33% (or 17.5% for bank accounts opened prior to 1 April 2010). The default rate for people who do not supply their tax file number to the interest payer is 45%. Interest payers are required to remind taxpayers of the RWT rate they are on at least once a year to ensure that it is consistent with their PIT rate. 
  * RWT on interest, dividends, and royalties where the NRWT is not a final tax. 
  * WHT deducted from payments made to contractors. 
  * Charitable donations. 


_See the_ _section for a description of foreign tax credits_.
## Imputation credits
The imputation system was designed to eliminate double taxation on company profits. Under the imputation system, a company effectively attaches imputation credits (representing tax paid at the company level) to cash and non-cash dividends and taxable bonus issues distributed to shareholders. The shareholders then use those imputation credits to reduce their own tax liability in respect of the company’s dividends. The shareholder includes both the dividends and the imputation credits as assessable income, with a credit being allowed against the shareholder’s income tax liability for an amount equal to the attached imputation credits. Imputation credits cannot be utilised by non-resident shareholders.
## Personal tax credits
Individuals with annual income between NZD 24,000 and NZD 70,000 and who meet certain requirements are entitled to an 'independent earner' tax credit of up to NZD 520 per week. For eligible individuals who earn over NZD 66,000, the annual entitlement decreases by 13 cents each additional dollar earned up to NZD 70,000, at which point the credit is fully abated.
## Credit for charitable donations
An individual can claim a 33.3% tax credit for eligible charitable donations, up to their taxable income.
## ‘Working for Families’ tax credit
Individuals may also be eligible for ‘Working for Families’ tax credits, which provide an in-work payment for families with dependent children. These credits are aimed at low and middle income families. They are generally paid in fortnightly instalments with any under or overpayment being calculated annually. Amounts received are not taxable. The definition of family scheme income means the amount, based on a person’s net income and adjusted as provided by section MB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, on which an entitlement and tax credit under the family scheme is based.
## ‘FamilyBoost’ tax credit
The FamilyBoost tax credit was introduced in 2024 to alleviate the financial pressures faced by low to middle income families in meeting the costs of childcare. 
The tax credit results in a refund for the applicant and is based on actual early childhood education (ECE) fees incurred, subject to eligibility requirements. A New Zealand tax resident caregiver of one or more children enrolled with a licensed early childhood service for which ECE fees are incurred may be entitled.
The amount of the credit for a quarter is equal to 25% of the licensed ECE fees payable for that quarter, up to a maximum of NZD 975, however, the amount of the credit will abate at the rate of 9.75 cents in the dollar when quarterly household income is greater than NZD 35,000. The abatement amount is NZD 975, which eliminates the credit when quarterly household income is NZD 45,000 or more.


# New Zealand
## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 20 December 2024
Residence is determined by either of the following tests:
  * Permanent place of abode: Persons are deemed residents of New Zealand if they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand regardless of how long they have been outside of New Zealand. 
  * 183 days’ presence: Persons are deemed residents of New Zealand from the date of their arrival in New Zealand if they are personally present in New Zealand for a period or periods exceeding, in total, 183 days in any 12-month period. 


## Non-residents’ exemption
A non-resident’s personal services income earned in New Zealand is exempt from New Zealand tax if all the following conditions apply:
  * the visit (or visits) of the non-resident do not exceed, in total, a period or periods of 92 days in the income year
  * the non-resident is liable for income tax on New Zealand-sourced income in their country of residence, and
  * the person paying the employee/contractor is not resident in New Zealand.


The exemptions listed above do not apply to public entertainers, such as performing artists and professional athletes. They are subject to a maximum 20% withholding tax (WHT).
Special rules apply to non-resident contractors. WHT is required to be deducted from payments to non-resident contractors who do not hold valid certificates of exemption. The tax withheld is an interim tax credited against the taxpayer’s ultimate income tax liability. Non-resident contractors who are present in New Zealand for less than 92 days in any 12-month period and eligible for total relief under a DTA do not have to apply for a certificate of exemption, although they may wish to in order to obtain certainty for the payer. Also, any payments received by a non-resident contractor where the total contract payments are less than NZD 15,000 in a 12-month period will be exempt from non-resident contractor’s tax (NRCT) withheld.
## Double taxation agreements (DTAs)
A non-resident employee may seek relief from New Zealand tax if a DTA exists between New Zealand and the country in which the employee is a tax resident. The following conditions will need to be met in order to obtain relief under the treaty:
  * the recipient is present in New Zealand for not more than 183 days in any 12-month period
  * the remuneration is paid by or on behalf of a non-resident employer, and
  * the remuneration is not borne by a permanent establishment (branch) or a fixed base that the employer has or is deemed to have in New Zealand.


## Exemptions for new migrants
A temporary (four year) exemption from income tax is available on certain foreign income derived by new migrants or New Zealanders who return to New Zealand after an absence of at least ten years. The exemption applies to people becoming resident in New Zealand on or after 1 April 2006. The exemption can only be granted once in a lifetime. Employment income from overseas employment performed while living in New Zealand and business income relating to services performed offshore is excluded.

## KiwiSaver scheme
KiwiSaver is a voluntary workplace-based superannuation savings scheme. It was introduced from 1 July 2007. The KiwiSaver scheme is voluntary for all employees over the age of 18, both full and part-time. All New Zealand residents over the eligible age are able to join KiwiSaver, but membership is not compulsory.
The minimum rate for both member and employer contributions is 3%.
Employers must contribute to KiwiSaver for those of their employees who are KiwiSaver members.
Employers must calculate employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) at a rate equivalent to an employee’s annual salary and wage plus the employer’s annual gross contribution.
## Employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT)
Employer contributions to approved superannuation funds (such as KiwiSaver) are subject to ESCT, formally known as ‘specified superannuation contribution withholding tax’. 
ESCT rates are based on the employee’s annual salary and wage, plus the employer’s gross contributions. Additionally, the method for determining the employee’s annual salary and wage is dependent on how long the employee has worked for the employer. 
Contributions to other funds may be subject to fringe benefit tax (FBT).
## Accident compensation levies
A statutory-based scheme of accident insurance is funded in part by premiums payable by employers and employees.
Premiums paid by employers (including the self-employed) fund insurance for work-related accidents. Employers are liable to pay a residual claims levy and an employer levy. Premiums are payable at a rate set for the industrial category on leviable earnings up to these amounts.
Non-work accident insurance is funded by premiums paid by employees and the self-employed. 
## Fringe benefits tax (FBT)
FBT is payable by employers when a fringe benefit (non-cash benefit) is provided to an employee or an associated person of the employee as a result of their employment relationship with the employer. The value of fringe benefits provided is not included in the gross income of employees.
The FBT quarters end with the last day of June, September, December, and March. Returns are due within 20 days of the end of the relevant quarter, except for the fourth quarter return (March), which is due 31 May. Any employer who has provided a fringe benefit is required to file a return setting out the fringe benefits received or enjoyed by employees in the quarter and a calculation of the amount of FBT payable on those benefits. 
Employers with pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) and employer superannuation contribution tax deductions not exceeding NZD 1 million  _per annum_ for the previous tax year can pay FBT on an annual basis, or if the employer was not an employer in the previous tax year. An income year basis is also available for a company that provides fringe benefits to shareholder-employees.
### FBT rates
Net remuneration (NZD) for the 2021–22 to 2024–25 income years | Net remuneration (NZD) for the 2025–26 and later income years | FBT rate (%)  
---|---|---  
12,530 or less | 13,962 or less | 11.73  
12,531 to 40,580 | 13,963 to 45,230 | 21.21  
40,581 to 55,980 | 45,231 to 62,450 | 42.86  
55,981 to 129,680 | 62,451 to 130,723 | 49.25  
Greater than 129,680 | Greater than 130,723 | 63.93  
Changes to income tax rate brackets, which apply from 30 July 2024, will have consequential impacts on the FBT thresholds set out above. However, these changes are proposed to take effect from 1 April 2025.
Employers can pay FBT at either a single rate of 63.93% or use an alternate rate method (whereby benefits are attributed to employees). If the 63.93% single rate is used in all of the first three quarters, the employer may use an alternate rate calculation in the fourth quarter or continue to pay FBT at 63.93%. 
There are currently three alternate rate methods: the full alternate rate, the short-form alternate rate, and the new pooled alternate rate.
Under the full alternate rate method, the applicable FBT rate depends on the net remuneration (including fringe benefits) paid to the employee. For employees who received attributed fringe benefits in any quarter during the year, the employer must calculate the employee’s fringe benefit inclusive of cash remuneration. The attribution calculation, which is performed in the fourth quarter, treats the fringe benefit as if it was paid in cash and calculates FBT as the notional increase in income tax that would otherwise have arisen.
The short-form alternate rate applies at a rate of 49.25% to all non-attributed benefits and a rate of 63.93% to all attributed benefits. In general, a benefit is attributable to an individual if it is principally assigned to, used, or available for use by that employee. However, there are other specific attribution rules to consider, such as the attribution rules for unclassified benefits.
The new pooled alternate rate calculation method has been introduced effective for the FBT year beginning 1 April 2021. The calculation of FBT to pay under this method is determined as follows.
  * Attribute benefits are returned at: 
    * 49.25% for employees who receive less than NZD 160,000 in gross cash pay and less than NZD 13,400 in attributed benefits.
    * 49.25% for employees who receive more than NZD 160,000 in gross cash pay or more that NZD 13,400 in attributed benefits but have 'all-inclusive pay' of under NZD 129,681.
    * 63.93% for all other employees.
  * Non-attributed benefits are returned at 49.25% (or 63.93% for shareholder employees).


A _de minimis_ exemption may apply to exempt unclassified benefits from FBT. The thresholds for exempting unclassified benefits under the _de minimis_ exemption is two-fold: 
  * NZD 300 per employee per quarter. 
  * NZD 22,500 per employer per annum.


Where the NZD 22,500 threshold is breached, FBT must be returned on all unclassified benefits. Where only the NZD 300 threshold is breached, FBT needs to be returned only on those amounts. 
Examples of benefits subject to FBT are as follows:
  * Motor vehicles available for private use.
  * Employment-related low interest / interest-free loans.
  * Employer contributions to medical insurance.
  * Employer contributions to employee superannuation funds.
  * Employer contributions to certain superannuation schemes (including foreign schemes).
  * Free, subsidised, or discounted goods and services.
  * Unclassified fringe benefits.


Self-powered and low-powered vehicles, vehicle-share services for self-powered and low-powered vehicles, and public transport are exempt from FBT.
FBT also applies to benefits received by an employee from a third party where there is a special arrangement between the employer and the third party. Generally, FBT does not apply to discounted goods or services received by an employee from a third party if the price paid by the employee is not less than the price that would be charged to other groups of people.
Benefits that are not subject to FBT include specified superannuation contributions (which are separately taxed), the provision of accommodation by an employer (which is subject to PAYE), and the use of a business tool such as a mobile telephone or laptop (provided the tool is used primarily for business purposes and the cost of the tool does not exceed NZD 5,000, GST inclusive). 
FBT is generally a tax-deductible expense. The effective FBT cost is intended to align with the receiving employee’s marginal tax rate.
## Consumption taxes
### Goods and services tax (GST)
A form of value-added tax (VAT), GST applies to most supplies of goods and services. The narrow category of exempt supplies includes financial services and residential accommodation. The rate applied to taxable supplies is 15% or 0%. The 0% rate applies to only a few supplies, including exports.
A ‘reverse charge’ mechanism requires the self-assessment of GST on the value of services imported by some GST registered persons. Financial services supplied to other registered businesses can be zero-rated under the GST business-to-business (B2B) regime.
Compulsory zero-rating (GST at 0%) applies to any supply involving land between two GST-registered parties if:
  * the purchaser acquires the land with the intention of using it to make taxable supplies, and
  * the land is not intended to be used as a principal place of residence for either the purchaser or an associate.


From 1 April 2024, existing GST rules for electronic marketplaces (that currently apply to remote services and low-value imported goods) were extended to taxable accommodation, ride-sharing, and food and beverage delivery services that are provided through electronic marketplaces. This means that electronic marketplace operators facilitating these services via their platform are required to collect and return GST at the standard rate of 15% when they are performed, provided, or received in New Zealand.
## Property taxes
Local authorities levy tax known as 'rates' on land within their territorial boundaries. Rates are levied on properties based on the properties' rateable value.
## Residential land withholding tax (RLWT)
RLWT applies to the sale of residential land in New Zealand by an 'offshore RLWT person'. RLWT applies in relation to land that was:
  * sold within five years for property acquired on or after 29 March 2018 and sold before 1 July 2024, or
  * sold within two years of acquisition for property sold on or after 1 July 2024.


An RLWT offshore person includes all non-New Zealand citizens and non-permanent residents. It also includes a New Zealand citizen who is living overseas if they have been overseas for the last three years. A holder of a New Zealand residence class visa may be an offshore person if they are outside New Zealand and have not been in New Zealand within the last 12 or more months continuously. New Zealand trusts and companies may also be 'offshore persons' if there are significant offshore interests in them.
The amount of RLWT to be deducted is the lesser of:
  * 10% of the current purchase price
  * the gain on sale x the RLWT rate (39% for taxpayers that are not companies, such as individuals, and companies acting as trustees of a trust), or
  * the current purchase price less outstanding local authority rates or less security discharged amounts, depending on which party is withholding the tax.


### Administrative property tax rules
Buyers and sellers of property must provide their Inland Revenue number at the time of property transfer. Those who are tax residents in another country will also have to provide their Tax Identification Number (TIN) from their home jurisdiction. There is an exemption for New Zealand residents' main home.
Offshore persons must have a New Zealand bank account in order to get a New Zealand Inland Revenue number. This also applies to New Zealanders who have been out of the country for three or more years.
### Purchase price allocation
Special purchase price allocation rules apply to sale and purchase agreements entered into from 1 July 2021. These rules govern the way parties to a transaction must allocate a transaction price across different classes of assets. The rules cover the situation where the transaction parties agree to an allocation, and also provide a default mechanism if no agreement is reached. In both instances, the allocation must ascribe relative market values to the assets, and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue may require the parties to adopt a different allocation if she considers that the allocation does not reflect market value.
Where the vendor and purchaser have agreed and documented a purchase price allocation before filing their respective income tax returns incorporating their tax position in relation to the transaction, the Income Tax Act 2007 now states that the parties must file in accordance with the agreed allocation. Agreement between the parties made within this timeframe will override any allocation made by the parties under the mechanisms outlined below.
Where the vendor and purchaser have not agreed to an allocation before filing their tax position in relevant returns, the Income Tax Act contains three mechanisms to give an allocation for the parties to use. These mechanisms are: (i) vendor allocation, (ii) purchaser allocation, or (iii) no allocation. If no allocation is made by the parties within six months of the change of ownership in the assets occurring, the Commissioner may allocate the purchase price across the assets at what she considers to be ’market value‘, and the vendor and the purchaser are treated as disposing and acquiring the property for this deemed market value.
Until an allocation is made by one of the parties (and notified to the Commissioner), or by the Commissioner, the purchaser will be treated as having no cost base in the assets acquired. Deductions disallowed as a result of this rule are intended to be deferred rather than denied.
## Luxury and excise taxes
Excise duty is levied, in addition to GST, on alcoholic beverages (e.g. wines, beers, spirits), tobacco products, and certain fuels (e.g. compressed natural gas, gasoline) under the Customs and Excise Act 2018. The excise duties are levied item-by-item at rates that vary considerably.
In addition, a duty is imposed on all gaming machine operators for the payment of gaming duty on the proceeds of a gaming machine under the Gaming Duties Act 1971.
