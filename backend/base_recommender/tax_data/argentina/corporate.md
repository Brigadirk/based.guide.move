## Asset Regularization Regime
An Asset Regularization Regime was established by Law 27.743 providing taxpayers with a legal framework to disclose undeclared assets located in Argentina or abroad. This voluntary regime allows individuals, undivided estates and entities to bring previously unreported assets into compliance, such as real estate, financial instruments, and other properties, under specific conditions. By adhering to this regime, taxpayers avoid fines and penalties associated with non-compliance. Additionally, the law offers reduced tax rates based on the type and timing of the disclosure, incentivizing early participation.
## Promotional Regime for Large Investment
The Argentine Congress has recently passed a comprehensive law package that introduces, among several legislative amendments, a Promotional Regime for Large Investment (RIGI for its Spanish acronym). This alert summarizes the key aspects of this innovative and attractive regime designed to attract large investments to the country.
RIGI is a comprehensive promotional regime designed to provide certainty, stability, legal security and protection to foster specific long-term investments in Argentina, by offering tax, customs, and currency exchange incentives.
The regime applies nationwide, encompassing sectors such as forestry, tourism, infrastructure, mining, technology, steel, energy and oil and gas.
The deadline to adhere to the regime is two years as from the law's enactment, with an option for a one-year extension.
### **Tax Incentives**
  1. **Corporate Income Tax**** _a) Tax Rate:_** The maximum rate will be 25%.**_b) Accelerated Amortization:_** i) For depreciable movable assets, amortization can be done in two equal and consecutive annual installments. ii) For investments in mines, quarries, forests, similar goods, or infrastructure, amortization can be done in the number of equal and consecutive annual installments based on 60% of their estimated useful life.**_c) Tax Losses:_** tax losses will be adjustable for inflation with no time limit for carryforward. If tax losses are not absorbed by taxable income within five years, these losses can be transferred to third parties.**_d) Dividends and profits distributions:_** taxable at a rate of 7%. After seven years from the registration date, the rate will be reduced to 3.5%.**_e) Interest expenses and FX losses:_** Restrictions on the deductibility of interest expenses and foreign exchange losses derived from foreign and local financing will not be applicable during the first five years from the registration date.**_f) Benefits for projects qualified as Long-term Strategic Exporters:_** i) No withholding tax on payments to non-residents relating to international transportation services and for services included in engineering, procurement, and construction management contracts. ii) a reduced withholding tax of 10.5% on payments to non-resident in all other cases (unless a lower rate is applicable by virtue of domestic law or an applicable tax treaty). No gross up provision should apply on those payments.
  2. **Value Added Tax (VAT):** No VAT immobilization for VPUs, as they will be allowed to pay VAT to their suppliers using Fiscal Credit Certificates, which will not generate fiscal credit for the VPU and will be treated as freely available tax credits for the supplier.
  3. **Tax on Banking Transactions:** Fully creditable against income tax payments.


### **Customs Incentives**
  1. **Import Duties:** Imports for consumption of goods, as well as temporary imports conducted by VPUs, including capital goods, spare parts, parts, and components, will be exempt from import duties, statistical rate, and from all national and/or local tax withholding, collection, advance payment, or retention regimes. This exemption may also be extended to imports destined to VPUs made by local suppliers (subject to special registration).
  2. **Export Duties:** Exports performed by VPUs will be exempt from export duties after three years from the adhesion date (reduced to two years for projects declared as Long-term Strategic Exports).
  3. **Import and Export Restrictions:** Registered VPUs can freely import and export without direct prohibitions, quantitative restrictions, quotas, or economic qualitative restrictions.


### **Foreign Exchange Incentives**
Proceeds from exports performed by the VPU will be exempt from the obligation to enter and/or negotiate and liquidate in the exchange market in the following percentages: a) 20% after two years from the registration date; b) 40% after three years from the registration date; c) 100% after four years from the registration date. These periods are reduced by one year for projects qualified as Long-term Strategic Exports.
Further, VPUs will also have free availability of foreign currency from local or external financing disbursed after the enactment of the regime. Additionally, exchange regulations imposing restrictions or prior authorizations for accessing the currency market for repaying loans, interest, accessories, other financial debts, or repatriating direct investments by non-residents, or for paying dividends, profits, or interests to non-residents, will not apply to VPUs provided some requirements are met.
### **Stability**
RIGI will grant eligible VPUs with regulatory stability in tax, customs, and exchange matters for their projects, ensuring that the incentives awarded will not be affected by their repeal or by the creation of more burdensome regulations. This stability will last for 30 years from the registration date.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## Taxable period
Tax is assessed on a fiscal-year, self-assessment basis, which may or may not match the calendar year.
## Tax returns
The due date for filing the CIT return is during the second week of the fifth month after the fiscal year-end. Tax returns are filed electronically.
## Payment of tax
Instalment payments on account of CIT must be made in the course of the tax year. The instalment payments must be made on a monthly basis, beginning in the first month after the due date of filing of the tax returns.
### Penalties
Penalties derived from tax infractions may be applied by tax authorities, as follows:
  * Failing to file the tax return: Fines range between ARS 200 and ARS 400.
  * Tax omission: Fine of 100% of unpaid taxes.
  * Tax avoidance: Fines range between two and six times the avoided tax.
  * Certain tax infractions may be penalised by closing the business premises for two to six days. In addition, fines ranging between ARS 3,000 and ARS 100,000 may be imposed.
  * Simple evasion: Entities or individuals evading payment of social security contributions or withholdings, or both, payable to the tax authorities under the social security regime, through deceitful declarations, malicious concealment, or any fraudulent or deceitful procedure, either through action or omission, in excess of ARS 200,000 per fiscal period, shall be punished with two to six years’ imprisonment. Such amount will be ARS 1,500,000 in the case of taxes, it being applied by tax and by fiscal year.
  * If the infringement qualifies as aggravated evasion: Imprisonment could be extended from three years and six months to nine years in certain situations.


### Interest on late payments
Late payment of taxes is subject to compensatory interest. The applicable rate is periodically updated by the tax authorities (currently 7.47%). Interest will start accruing on the day after the filing due date.
## Tax audit process
The tax authorities are entitled to audit taxpayers within the statute of limitations period. Audits consist of revising the calculation of any national or provincial tax based on formal requirements. Where any assessment is issued by the tax authorities, the taxpayer is entitled to either accept it or file a claim. Assessments can be done under a real or estimated basis, depending on the specific case and the information that the taxpayers have on their transactions. In the case that the taxpayers do not accept the assessment during the administrative period, they can claim against Tax Courts before any judicial process.
There are no specific provisions about e-auditing.
## Statute of limitations
The actions and powers of the tax authorities to determine and require payment of federal taxes, and to implement and enforce fines and closures planned, prescribe:
  * five years in the case of registered taxpayers, as well as in the case of unregistered taxpayers who are not legally required to register with the AFIP; or that, having that obligation, had not fulfilled them and, spontaneously, regularise their situation, and
  * ten years in the case of unregistered taxpayers.


The statute of limitations may be extended to ten years in certain provinces with respect to provincial taxes.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Topics of focus for tax authorities include the following:
  * Increasing cooperation: Tax information exchange.
  * Tax treaty network still under review.
  * Tax treaty benefits: Substance-over-form principle.
  * High penalties and tax criminal law.
  * Transfer pricing (inter-company charges and export of commodities to international intermediaries).
  * Wealth tax: Applicability on branches.
  * Corporate income tax: Application of inflationary adjustment.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
Corporate residence is determined on the basis of centres of activity, which may be the location of a company’s economic activity or management activity.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Centres of activity in Argentina of non-Argentine corporations are treated as PEs.
As from 2017, Argentine Income Tax Law includes a PE definition aligned to the one included in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD's) Model Tax Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation, although it is broader as it includes the performance of services by a non-resident provider, including services rendered by consultants, within the National Territory for a total length greater than six months within any 12-month period.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
Expenses necessary to generate, maintain, and preserve taxable income, and related to the company activity, are usually tax deductible, with a few exceptions, to the extent they are fair and reasonable.
## Depreciation and depletion
Depreciation is generally computed on a straight-line basis over the technically estimated useful life of the assets or, alternatively, over the standard useful life (e.g. machinery and equipment: ten years; furniture: ten years). Depreciation of buildings and other construction of real estate is 2% _per annum_ on cost (on a straight-line basis), unless it can be proved that useful life is less than 50 years.
Depreciation of automobiles whose original cost exceeds ARS 20,000 is not deductible. Related expenses (gasoline vouchers, insurance, rentals, repairs and maintenance, etc.) are deductible up to an amount of ARS 7,200 per automobile per year.
Conformity between book and tax depreciation is not required.
Profit or loss on the sale of depreciated property is determined with reference to cost less depreciation, and is included in ordinary taxable income.
Percentage depletion is available for natural resources (mines, quarries, woods).
## Goodwill
The amortisation of goodwill cannot be deducted for CIT purposes. At the moment of sale, the taxable gain will be calculated by deducting the cost expenses (purchase price).
With regards to self-developed goodwill, at the moment of sale the cost will be the amount of expenses incurred in obtaining it, provided it was not deducted for CIT purposes before.
## Research and development (R&D)
R&D expenditures (for the development of intangible assets) may be deducted when they are incurred or amortised over not more than five years, at the option of the taxpayer. Expenditures for R&D in connection with the creation of fixed assets form part of the assets' cost and are amortised over their useful lives.
The amortisation of brands and licences acquired can be deducted if they have a limited term of duration.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses may be deducted when incurred or amortised over not more than five years, at the option of the taxpayer.
## Interest expenses
The tax law establishes a restriction on the deductibility of interest and foreign exchange losses arising from debts of a financial nature contracted by taxpayers with controlling/related entities for CIT purposes (_see Thin capitalisation in the section_).
## Bad debt
The deduction of accounting bad debts is not allowed for tax purposes. However, if the debts fulfil certain characteristics (i.e. bankruptcy, prescription, among others), and with the corresponding supporting documentation, they can be deducted.
## Charitable contributions
When made to societies and associations expressly exempt from assessment of CIT, donations are admissible deductions at up to a maximum of 5% of the donor’s net taxable profits, provided certain requirements are fulfilled.
## Representation expenses
If adequately documented, representation expenses are permissible deductions at up to 1.5% of the amount of salaries accrued during the fiscal year. According to the Regulatory Decree, representation expenses are payments made in order to represent the company in the market, to improve and maintain its relationship with suppliers and clients, etc.
## Directors’ fees
Amounts up to the greater of 25% of after-tax profit or ARS 12,500 per individual are deductible in the financial year to which they apply, provided they are approved and available for the director before the due date of the tax return or in a later year of payment.
## Fines and penalties
In relation to deductibility of penalties to determine net taxable income, taxpayers are not allowed to deduct sums paid on their own account corresponding to penalties, litigation costs, penalty interest, and other costs derived from tax obligations.
## Taxes
Except for CIT and the tax on minimum notional income, all taxes are deductible.
## Net operating losses
Net operating losses may be carried forward for five years. Loss carrybacks are not permitted. Furthermore, foreign-source losses must be offset against income from similar sources.
Losses on derivatives transactions with speculative purposes can only be used to offset income from the same types of transactions.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Transactions between related parties should be at arm’s length (_see Transfer pricing in the section for more information_). This principle is extended to transactions with companies that are not located in jurisdictions considered to be ‘cooperative’ for tax transparency purposes or located in a tax haven. Payments to foreign affiliates or related parties and companies located in a tax haven or a non-cooperative jurisdiction that represent income of Argentine source are tax deductible, provided they are paid before the due date for filing the tax return and the corresponding withholding is paid to the tax authorities. Otherwise, they would be deducted in the fiscal year in which they are paid.


# Argentina
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
Group taxation is not permitted in Argentina.
## Transfer pricing
The transfer pricing regulations governing inter-company transactions adopt principles similar to those of the OECD, pursuant to which companies must comply with the arm’s-length principle in order to determine the value of goods and services in their transactions with foreign-related companies.
The following taxpayers, among others, must generally file, together with their annual CIT return, a supplementary return (transactions encompassed by regulations governing transfer prices) and transfer pricing study:
  * Taxpayers carrying out transactions with related individuals or legal entities set up, domiciled, or located abroad. Two or more persons are considered to be related parties when one of them takes part, either directly or indirectly, in the administration, control, or capital of the other, or when a person or group of persons takes part, either directly or indirectly, in the administration, control, or capital of those persons.
  * Taxpayers carrying out transactions with related individuals or legal entities not set up, domiciled, or located in countries considered to be cooperative for tax transparency purposes, whether related or not.
  * Argentine residents carrying out transactions with PEs located abroad and owned by them.
  * Argentine residents, owners of PEs located abroad, for transactions carried out by the latter with persons or other type of related entities domiciled, set up, or located abroad.


The Regulatory Decree provides specific rules to determine the fairness of the transfer pricing methodology. These rules are similar to those set by the OECD and contemplate six methods, including the following:
  * Comparable uncontrolled price (CUP).
  * Resale price method (RPM).
  * Cost plus.
  * Profit split method (PSM).
  * Transactional net margin method (TNMM).
  * Special method for export of goods with prices quoted in transparent markets.


There is no specific hierarchy, as each particular transaction must be analysed based on the assets, functions, and risks involved and on information available. Regulations establish that the most appropriate method is that which reflects the economic reality of the transactions.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
Through General Resolution (GR) 4130-E, the Federal Administration of Public Revenue (AFIP) established an annual information regime related to the submission of the CbC report and is aligned with Action 13 of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan regarding CbC reporting.
This obligation is applicable to those multinational enterprise (MNE) groups whose ultimate parent’s total consolidated revenue is equal to or higher than 750 million euros (EUR), or its equivalent in the local currency converted to the exchange rate as of 31 January 2015, for the fiscal year prior to the one being reported. The CbC report will be filed annually, no later than the last business day of the 12th month following the end of the ultimate parent’s reporting fiscal year.
Although mainly MNE groups whose ultimate parent is resident in Argentina have the obligation to submit the CbC report, other Argentine entities from MNE groups may also be required to file a CbC report if certain circumstances set forth in the aforementioned resolution take place (i.e. subrogated entities not designated, etc.).
In addition, and regardless of having the obligation or not to file the CbC report in Argentina, the provisions in Title II of said GR require all Argentine entities that are members of a MNE group to file with the AFIP information about the MNE group they belong to, including if the group is required to comply with the submission of the CbC report and, if so, which company will perform the filing on behalf of the group (i.e. the ultimate parent or a subrogate entity). The local entity must comply with this obligation no later than the last business day of the third month following the end of the ultimate parent’s reporting fiscal year.
Finally, the member entities resident in the country mentioned in the preceding paragraph must report, until the last business day of the second month immediately following the due date for the submission of the CbC report, the submission of such report in the corresponding tax jurisdiction.
## Thin capitalisation
Thin capitalisation rules apply as a restriction on the deductibility of interest and foreign exchange losses arising from debts of a financial nature that are contracted by taxpayers with related entities (whether local or foreign).
The deduction on interest expense and foreign exchange losses with local and foreign related parties is limited to 30% of the taxpayer’s taxable income before interest, foreign exchange losses, and depreciation. The taxpayer is entitled to carry forward excess non-deductible interest for five years and unutilised deduction capacity for three years.
Certain exceptions to the above limitation are also available.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Argentina does not have a CFC regime. However, an Argentine taxpayer would be required to immediately tax passive income generated by a CFC that is directly or indirectly held by the Argentine taxpayer to the extent that more than 50% of that CFC’s income is passive and is effectively subject to a tax that is lower than 75% of the applicable Argentine income tax rate.


# Argentina
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
The rate of CIT on net taxable income from Argentine sources and from activities performed abroad by the branch is currently as follows (for fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2021, indexed as of 2024):
  * Taxable income from ARS 0 to ARS 34,703,523.08: 25%.
  * Taxable income from more than ARS 34,703,523.08 to ARS 347,035,230.79: ARS 8,675,880.77 + 30% on the amount that exceeds ARS 34,703,523.08.
  * Taxable income from more than ARS 347,035,230.79: ARS 102,375,393.08+ 35% on the amount that exceeds ARS 347,035,230.79.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## Foreign tax credit
National taxpayers are entitled to recognise a tax credit for any taxes actually paid in the countries where they have obtained foreign-source income, in respect of similar national taxes, up to a cap, which is the increase in their Argentine tax liability due to the inclusion of the foreign income. Any excess not offset in a given fiscal year may be carried forward to the next five fiscal years.
## Province of Tierra del Fuego Regime
Companies set up in the province of Tierra del Fuego enjoy a general tax exemption and important benefits in customs matters. Tax exemption includes CIT, tax on personal wealth and excise tax. The VAT benefit consists of the release from payment of the technical balance of the tax (VAT debits less VAT credits). Also, a reduction of the prevailing rate for tax on financial transactions and an exemption from taxation on the transfer of fuels is contemplated.
## Mining activity
An investment regime for mining activity is applicable to natural and legal persons. Mining ventures included within this regime enjoy fiscal stability (i.e. tax rates will remain basically the same) for a term of 30 years, except for VAT, which will adjust to the general regime. Furthermore, the regime grants incentives for CIT, tax on assets, import duties, and any other tax for introduction of certain assets. Additionally, this mining investment law established an exploration recovery regime for the mining investors, which allows the reimbursement of the VAT credit balances originated in the mining exploration activity.
This regime allows the reimbursement of such VAT credits after a 12-month period since the expenditure was incurred, and only if it has been paid.
Through specifics regulations, the authorities established the requirements (e.g. filing a tax return, filing a report certified by a public accountant with respect to the VAT, a presentation to the Mining Secretary) to be followed by the taxpayers in order to apply for this benefit.
## Forestry
There is an investment regime for plantation, protection, and maintenance of forests. It contains rules similar to those for mining activity tax incentives:
  * Fiscal stability for a period of 30 years. The period may be extended to 50 years.
  * Refund of VAT resulting from the purchase or final importation of goods, leases, or services effectively for forestry investment projects in a period of less than 365 days.


## Export incentives
Exports of goods and services are exempt from VAT and excise taxes. The temporary importation of raw materials and intermediate and packaging goods for the manufacture of products for export is free from duties with the obligation of offering sufficient guarantees for the import. A reimbursement regime is in place for VAT credits paid to suppliers in relation to the export activity.
## Biotechnology industry
A promotional tax regime for development and production of modern biotechnology has been introduced. Pursuant to this law, the beneficiaries of the projects that qualify for this regime are entitled to the following benefits:
  * CIT: Accelerated depreciation of capital goods, special equipment, parts, or components of newly acquired goods destined for the promoted project.
  * VAT: Early refund of the tax applicable to the assets acquired for the project.
  * Social security contributions: The amount representing 50% of social security contributions actually paid on the payroll salaries involved in the project shall be converted into a tax credit bond that may be applied to payment of national taxes.


## Energy generation through renewable sources
Through the enactment of Law 26,190, as amended by Law 27,191, and Regulatory Decree 562/2009 and 531/2016, the Argentine government launched and updated promotional measures for the energy sector with the aim of encouraging the use of renewable energy sources for the production of electricity.
According to this regime, certain tax benefits shall be granted upon request by filing the projects with the relevant authorities. Benefits include accelerated depreciation of project assets for CIT purposes, a five-year extension on the loss carryforward, early recovery of VAT paid on the acquisition of new assets or infrastructure work, and a tax credit certificate to be applied against federal taxes.
Also, from a provincial tax perspective, Law 26,190 invites all Argentine provinces to adhere to the regime enacting local regulations with tax benefits aimed at promoting and encouraging the production of electric energy through renewable sources.
## Province incentives on local taxes
Most of the provinces have legislation establishing incentives for the development of industries within their boundaries, especially industries that utilise or develop their natural resources and provide work for their residents. The incentives, in general, consist of exemptions from provincial and municipal taxes.
Various provinces have investment promotion regimes. Even when there are certain differences among these regimes, generally they include the following incentives:
  * Exemption from provincial taxes, such as turnover tax, stamp duty, real estate tax.
  * Reduced public utility rates.
  * Support for infrastructure and equipment projects.
  * Facilities for purchase, rental, or lease without charge of public property.


These regimes are not automatically applied, and a special procedure should be followed to be entitled to the respective benefits.
## Free trade zones
The free trade zones offer exporters the possibility to import free from customs duties, statistics rate, and VAT all the necessary equipment for construction of a ‘turnkey plant’ within the zones. Furthermore, exporters manufacturing within the zones enjoy the benefit of buying supplies and raw materials from third countries, without having to pay duties or taxes that lead to increased prices.
Customs authority regulating these goods considers them as stored in a third country; consequently, incoming products are subject to inspection with the sole purpose of classifying quantity and type. In other words, goods enjoy a duty-free status until they enter the Argentine customs territory. Goods may remain in the free trade zone for a maximum period of five years.
## Promotional regime for knowledge-based activities
By virtue of Law 27,506 (amended by Law 27,570), Argentina’s government enacted new tax incentives intended to promote certain knowledge-based activities through the end of 2029. Taxpayers that comply with all requirements must apply and register in order to benefit from the new law.
The new regime aims to encourage the creation, design, production, and implementation or adaptation of products and services (and the associated technical documentation) related to, among others, the following ‘Promoted Activities’:
  * software
  * computing and digital services
  * audio-visual production and post-production activities
  * certain scientific and engineering activities
  * geological and prospecting services
  * activities related to the industrial sector using ‘4.0 technologies,’ and
  * the exportation of professional services.


Incentives under the new regime include:
  * Reduction by a certain percentage of the statutory CIT rate (currently 30%). The reduction depends on the taxpayer’ssize. Large taxpayers would benefit from a 20% reduction (24% effective tax rate). Reduction for micro and small businesses is60% and for medium sized enterprises is 40%. This reduction would apply to both Argentinian and foreign-sourceincome.
  * Reduction to 0% on export duty applicable to exports of promoted services.
  * Non-transferable fiscal credit certificate of up to 70% of social security contributions paid by the employer with respectto employees dedicated to the Promoted Activities, which can be applied to the payment of certain taxes, such as VAT(excluding CIT). This bonus certificate will increase to up to 80% of the social security contributions of new hiresconsidered included in special interest groups (including women, LGBT, people with disabilities, and residents inunfavourable areas). Exporters may request the use of the certificate to offset CIT liabilities.
  * Tax stability with respect to the new regime’s benefits (available until 31 December 2029).


The incentives will become effective for income tax purposes starting with the fiscal year that follows the year in which taxpayers receive approval. However, they become effective for all other tax purposes as of the date the relevant governmental institution approves the registration. Furthermore, the incentives apply retroactively to 1 January 2020 for taxpayers that benefited under the software incentive regime, which expired on 31 December 2019.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## WHT on dividend and profit distributions
WHT on dividend distributions and branch profit remittances has been set at a rate of 7% for profits generated in fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The 2017 tax reform has abolished the so-called ‘equalisation tax’ for profits generated in taxable years starting on or after 1 January 2018. The equalisation tax was a WHT levied at a 35% rate on dividend distributions in excess of tax earnings. However, the equalisation tax still applies to dividend and branch profit distributions made out of earnings accumulated prior to 1 January 2018 that exceeded tax earnings as of the year-end prior to the relevant distribution.
## Other payments
Other payments to residents and to non-residents are subject to WHT rates as follows:
Recipient | WHT (%)

Notes
  1. Withholding from payments of interest and royalties to non-residents is based on a flat rate of 35% applied to an assumed percentage gross profit margin. This margin is not contestable, but the resultant rate may be limited by bilateral treaty. Under the 1998 tax reform, the general margin for interest paid for credits obtained abroad is 100%. However, a margin of 43% is applicable (i) if the debtor is a local bank; (ii) if the creditor is a foreign financial institution located in a country not considered as a low or no tax jurisdiction, or in countries that have signed an agreement with Argentina for exchange of information and have no bank secrecy laws, which are under the supervision of the respective central bank; (iii) if the interest is paid on a loan dedicated to the purchase of tangible assets other than cars; (iv) if the interest is paid on debt certificates (private bonds) issued by local companies and registered in certain countries that have signed an agreement with Argentina for the protection of investments; and (v) on interest paid on time deposits with local banks. 
Royalties’ covers a variety of concepts. The rates given in this column relate specifically to services derived from agreements ruled by the Foreign Technology Law, as follows:
     * Technical assistance, technology, and engineering not obtainable in Argentina: 21% (35% on assumed profit of 60%).
     * Cessation of rights or licences for invention patents exploitation and technical assistance obtainable in Argentina: 28% (35% on assumed profit of 80%). On non-registered agreements, the rate is 31.5% (profit of 90% is assumed) or 35% (profit of 100% is assumed), depending on the case.
Several other concepts of 'royalties' are subject to rates that, in turn, may be limited by treaty. A broad sample of these concepts and the non-treaty effective rates are set forth in Note 2.
  2. Payments to non-residents (only) for 'royalties', rentals, fees, commissions, and so on, in respect of the following, are subject to withholding at the rates given below on the basis of assumed gross profit margins (Note 1) unless limited by treaty. The treaty concerned should be consulted to determine any limitation in each case.  Payment | WHT (%)  
---|---  
Freight and passenger bookings (other than those covered by special treaties), news and feature services, insurance underwriting | 3.50  
Containers | 7.00  
Copyright | 12.25  
Rental of movable assets | 14.00  
Motion picture, video, and sound tape rentals and royalties; radio, television, telex and telefax transmissions; any other means for projection, reproduction, transmission, or diffusion of image or sound; sale of assets located in Argentina | 17.50  
Rental of real estate | 21.00  
Any other Argentine-source income (unless the non-resident is or was temporarily resident) | 31.50  
  3. The higher tax rate is applicable on non-registered taxpayers. On interest paid to corporations by financial entities or stock exchange/open market brokers, income tax must be withheld at 3% (10% if not registered); individuals are tax exempt.

## Legal entities
Foreign companies in Argentina, carrying out their business or activity in Argentina, must have a local legal vehicle, of which the most common legal entity types are the following:
  * Branch.
  * Corporation (_Sociedad Anónima_ or SA).


  * Local Limited Liability Company (_Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada_ or SRL).


Argentine corporations and limited liability partnerships (LLPs), as Argentine residents, are subject to the Argentine tax system. Branches of foreign companies, whatever the nature of their activities, are taxed under the same rules as those applicable to corporations and LLPs.
Several documents are required to register an entity with the relevant authorities. Some of said documentation must be filed in the original language, duly translated and certified with the Apostille issued pursuant to The Hague Convention or legalised by the Argentine Consulate of the company's place of origin.
At present, the minimum capital requirement to incorporate an SA is ARS 30,000,000. There are no special requirements regarding the minimum amount of capital for SRLs.
A branch does not require capital contributions unless it is engaged in certain specific activities (e.g. banking and financing). The branch must carry its financial statements separately from those of the foreign company.
The three legal types are subject, in general terms, to the same legal, tax, and accounting regulations.
## Information regimes
In the last few years, the AFIP has introduced several information regimes aimed principally to monitor transactions with local and foreign related parties.
By means of General Resolution (AFIP) 3572, a database in which local taxpayers must disclose their relationships with domestic and foreign related parties has been created. For purposes of this rule, the definition of ‘related party’ is broad and goes beyond economic or legal ownership.
## Intergovernmental agreements (IGAs)
Argentina has been very prolific in relation to the signature of tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs) over the past few years.
The authorities have signed around 24 TIEAs, including those with Andorra, Aruba, Azerbaijan, The Bahamas, Bermuda, Brazil, Cayman Islands, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Curaçao, Ecuador, Guernsey, India, Isle of Man, Italy, Jersey, Macedonia, Monaco, Peru, San Marino, South Africa, Spain, and Uruguay.
Argentina has also taken an active part in the OECD’s BEPS initiatives and tax transparency discussions. During Berlin’s global forum on transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes, Argentina joined the list of 54 countries that agreed to implement an automatic financial information exchange in accordance to OECD’s Common Reporting Standard (CRS) as of 2016.
In this respect, several Argentine regulatory authorities (i.e. Central Bank, Securities Exchange Commission, and Superintendence of Insurance Companies) have already issued a set of regulations compelling local financial institutions to implement the necessary procedures to be in compliance with OECD’s CRS. The regulation establishing the CRS was issued in December 2015 and is effective as of 1 January 2016.
Argentine authorities signed a bilateral agreement with the US government to facilitate implementation of the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). In December 2022, Argentina signed an IGA under Model 1 with the United States whose effects would apply as from fiscal year 2023. The main objective of this agreement is to improve international tax compliance through domestic reporting and automatic exchange of information. This IGA will enable the reciprocal exchange of certain financial account information between the United States and Argentina with appropriate data protection.

## Inventory valuation
Inventory valuation is based on the latest purchase. Thus, the last in first out (LIFO) method may not be elected for tax purposes. Conformity between book and tax reporting is not required.
## Capital gains/losses
Capital gains and losses attract normal CIT treatment, except that losses from the sale of shares, equity interests, bonds, and similar securities may be offset only against the same type of income.
### Capital gains on equity
Gains derived from the transfer of shares, bonds, and other securities are subject to tax at regular CIT rates (25% to 35%). 
Non-residents are subject to capital gains tax on the disposal of Argentine equities at a 13.5% effective tax rate on gross proceeds or, alternatively, a 15% income tax on the actual capital gain if the seller’s tax cost basis can be duly documented for Argentine tax purposes. Disposal of equities listed in the local stock exchange and American Depository Receipts (ADRs)/Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) are tax exempt, provided certain conditions are met.
### Capital gains on debts
Capital gains derived by foreign beneficiaries from the sale of corporate bonds placed by public offer (_obligaciones negociables_), notes issued by financial trusts (_títulos de deuda_), or government bonds should be exempt from profits tax, provided certain conditions are met.
## Dividend income
Dividends, including stock dividends, are not included in the tax base by the recipient if distributed by an Argentine company (_see the section for additional information_). However, tax is levied if the dividends are distributed by a foreign company.
## Royalty income
Royalty income should be included as part of the taxpayer’s taxable income and will be subject to the standard CIT rates.
## Foreign exchange gains/losses
The general rule is that foreign exchange results (gain or losses) have to be recognised on an accrual basis. However, in some cases, the cash basis is applicable.
Foreign exchange losses arising from inter-company financing are subject to thin capitalisation rules.
## Foreign income
Foreign income received or held undistributed abroad (in case of investments in non-stock companies) by resident corporations is subject to tax. Note that an Argentine taxpayer is immediately taxed on the passive income generated by a controlled foreign company (CFC) that is directly or indirectly held by the Argentine taxpayer to the extent that more than 50% of that CFC’s income is passive and is effectively subject to a tax that is lower than 75% of the applicable Argentine income tax rate. Tax losses from a foreign source can only be offset against income from a foreign source.

CIT rate is set as follows (indexed as of 2024):
  * Taxable income from ARS 0 to ARS 34,703,523.08: 25%.
  * Taxable income from more than ARS 34,703,523.08 to ARS 347,035,230.79: ARS 8,675,880.77 + 30% on the amount that exceeds ARS 34,703,523.08.
  * Taxable income from more than ARS 347,035,230.79: ARS 102,375,393.08+ 35% on the amount that exceeds ARS 347,035,230.79.


Legal entities resident in Argentina are subject to tax on Argentine and foreign-source income. Resident legal entities are able to claim any similar taxes actually paid abroad on foreign-source income as a tax credit. The tax rate applies on net income determined on a worldwide basis.
A withholding tax (WHT) on dividend distributions and branch profit remittances is established at a rate of 7% (applicable for profits as of 2018).
The 2017 tax reform abolished the so-called ‘equalisation tax’ for profits generated in taxable years starting on or after 1 January 2018. The equalisation tax was a WHT levied at a 35% rate on dividend distributions in excess of tax earnings. The equalisation tax, however, remains applicable on dividend and branch profit distributions made out of earnings accumulated prior to 1 January 2018 and which were in excess of tax earnings as of the year-end prior to the relevant distribution.
Argentine-source income (e.g. royalties, interests) received by foreign entities is subject to WHT in full and final settlement at source (_see the section_).

## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is assessable on the sales value of products (e.g. raw materials, produce, finished or partly finished merchandise) with few exemptions, most services (e.g. construction, utilities, professional and personal services not derived from employment, rental), and on import of goods and services. The VAT rate is 21%, although certain specific items are subject to a 27% or 10.5% rate. VAT is payable by filing monthly tax returns.
The increased rate of 27% applies to ‘utilities services’ (e.g. telecommunications, household gas, running water, sewerage, and energy) not rendered to dwelling-purposes real estate.
A reduced rate of 10.5% applies to certain transactions, including (but not limited to) the following:
  * Construction of housing.
  * Interest and other costs on personal loans granted to final consumers by financial institutions.
  * Sales and imports of living bovine animals.
  * Supply of publicity and advertising in some specific cases.
  * Any passenger transportation operating inside the country when the distance does not exceed 100 km.
  * Medical assistance in some specific cases.
  * Certain capital goods, depending on the Customs Duty Code.


VAT paid on purchases, final imports, and rental of automobiles not considered as inventory cannot be computed by the purchaser as a VAT credit. The same tax treatment applies to other services, such as those provided by restaurants, hotels, and garages.
VAT legislation also includes ‘digital transactions' (e.g. digital services, hosting, on-line technical support, software services, Internet services) provided from abroad as a taxable event. These types of services are currently subject to VAT at a 21% rate if they are supplied by a non-resident entity to an Argentine customer, provided that they are effectively used in Argentina.
### VAT exemptions
Among others, the following transactions are exempt from VAT:
  * Sales of books, ordinary natural water, common bread, milk, medicine, postage stamps, aircraft used in commercial activities and for defence or internal safety, and ships or boats acquired by the national government.
  * Supply of certain services, such as services rendered by the government (national, provincial, or local) or by public institutions; school or university education provided by private institutions subject to public educational programmes; cultural services supplied by religious institutions; hospital and medical care and related activities; transportation services for sick or injured persons in vehicles specially designed for the purpose; tickets for theatre, cinema, musical shows, and sport events; the production and distribution of motion picture films; local transport of passengers (e.g. taxis, buses) up to 100 km; and international transportation.
  * Rental of real estate for housing purposes.


### VAT exemption on importation
The following import transactions are also exempted from VAT:
  * Final importation of goods qualifying for exemption from customs duties under special regimes for tourists, scientists and technicians, diplomatic agents, etc.
  * Final importation of samples and parcels exempted from customs duties.


### VAT export reimbursement regime
Exports of goods and services are treated as zero-rated transactions. Nevertheless, input VAT related to these transactions can either be used as a credit against output VAT or refunded pursuant to a special procedure.
Services rendered within the country shall be deemed to be exports if they are effectively applied or economically utilised outside the country.
Exporters must file an export return with the tax authorities, reporting the VAT receivables related to their exports to be reimbursed on VAT paid in relation to the export operations. A report certified by a public accountant with respect to the value, registrations, and other characteristics related to the refund must be attached to the export return.
The tax credit related to exports and other taxable activities can only be refunded in proportion to the exports, and can be fully refunded to a cap of 21% of the freight on board (FOB) value of the exported products.
There is no specific method stated in the legislation for allocating the tax credit related to exports, but taxpayers are able to use any methods of calculation that would be suitable to their business model. This calculation has to be approved by the tax authorities.
Finally, it is important to highlight that the tax authorities have to approve the tax credit to be refunded.
### VAT reimbursement on investments in infrastructure projects and acquisition of capital goods
An expedient VAT recovery mechanism for VAT credit balances on certain infrastructure and investments in capital goods is available, to the extent that companies have not been able to recover the VAT within six months.
### Electronic invoicing
All VAT-registered taxpayers are compelled to use electronic invoices. In order to apply for this regime, an authorisation must be obtained from the tax authorities. As a result, the tax authorities will assign an Electronic Authorization Code (_Código de Autorización Electrónico_ or CAE), which is included in every issued electronic invoice.
## Import and export duties
The levels of import duty currently range between 0% and 35%, except in cases where a specific minimum duty is applied or that involve merchandise with a specific treatment. These percentages were established considering the individual competitive conditions prevailing in different production sectors and the relative advantages of contributing to the introduction of equipment and technology for local industry. In general, merchandise originating from Latin America Integration Association (LAIA) countries is entitled to preferential duty.
## Excise taxes
Excise tax is assessable on a wide variety of items sold in Argentina (not on exports), principally on tobacco, wines, soft drinks, spirits, gasoline, lubricants, insurance premiums, automobile tyres, mobiles services, perfumes, jewellery, and precious stones. The bases of the assessment and tax rate of some items are as follows:
Products | Nominal rates (%)  
---|---  
Tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes | 20/25/70  
Alcoholic drinks | 20/26  
Beers | 8/14  
Soft drinks | 4/8/10  
Jewellery and precious stones | 20  
Automobiles, motor vehicles, motor vessels, motor homes, etc. | 20/30/35  
Certain electronic devices and appliances | 9.5/19  
## Stamp tax
Stamp tax is levied by each of the 24 jurisdictions into which Argentina is divided, and applies principally to contracts and agreements, deeds, mortgages, and other obligations, agreements, and discharges of a civil, financial, or commercial nature of which there is written evidence or, in certain instances, that are the subject of entries in books of account. The average tax rate ranges between 1% and 1.5% and it is applicable on the economic value of the contract.
In the city of Buenos Aires, the standard tax rate is 1% of the aggregate amount of the transactions, contracts, and deeds that are subject to the stamp tax. Special rates of 0.5%, 1.2%, 3%, and 3.6% are also established.
## Turnover tax (gross income tax)
Each of the 24 jurisdictions into which Argentina is divided imposes a tax on gross revenues from the sale of goods and services. Exports of goods are exempt, and certain industries are subject to a reduced tax rate. Rates, rules, and assessment procedures are determined locally. On average, rates for trade and services range from 4% to 6%. In case of industry, rates are generally lower (ranging from 0% to 2%).
## Real estate tax
Similar to the turnover tax, real estate tax is imposed by each Argentine jurisdiction. It is levied on the ownership of real estate located in the territory of the jurisdiction.
Real estate tax is usually assessed by the local tax authority, considering the property’s fiscal value and the tax rates established by the current year tax law.
## Tax on financial transactions (on credits and debits on bank accounts)
Bank account movements (deposits and withdrawals) are subject to a national tax on financial transactions at the following rates:
  * 0.6% of deposits and withdrawals in bank accounts opened in local financial entities.
  * 1.2% of any transactions made in a bank without using a bank account.


33% of the tax on financial transactions effectively paid on bank account transactions (0.6%) and movement of funds (1.2%) is creditable against CIT and minimum notional income tax and/or respective tax advances.
## Wealth tax
An annual wealth tax is levied on the shares or holding in the capital of local companies owned by individuals or undivided estates domiciled in Argentina or abroad, and/or companies and/or any other type of legal person domiciled abroad. It shall be assessed and paid directly by the local company as a full and final payment on behalf of the shareholders (the issuing company has the right to recover from the shareholder the tax paid).
The applicable tax rate is 0.5% and is applicable on the value of the participation, which is generally calculated on the difference between assets and liabilities arising from the financial statements closed at 31 December or during the respective fiscal year.
Note that a Supreme Court decision has ruled on the non-applicability of this tax to Argentine branches of foreign companies.
## Payroll taxes and social security contributions
Foreign and local nationals working for a local company must be included on the local payroll and will be considered as local employees for local labour, tax, and social security purposes. Both the local company and the employees will be subject to the corresponding regulations.
All the compensation paid in Argentina or abroad for work performed for the local company will be considered as local compensation and should be reported to the tax and social security authorities, as the case may be, and included in the salary slips and recorded in the local labour books.
The local employer must withhold income tax on an actual and monthly basis and make the corresponding payments to the tax authorities through monthly WHT returns. Individual tax rates range from 5% to 35%, and personal deductions are available (under certain circumstances).
The local entity must issue salary slips every month for each employee included on its payroll, considering the total compensation mentioned above.
Employer social security contributions add between 24% and 26.4% to payroll costs. There is a compulsory 13th-month salary. There is no restriction regarding the employment of foreigners, provided they hold working visas.
Workers’ (Employees’) Compensation: Argentine labour regulations determine different forms of compensation for employees. These include, but are not limited to, the following:
  * Vacation compensation.
  * Compensation in a case of termination of employment contract with employee (prior notice of dismissal and to a severance payment, both based on seniority).


Main social taxes and contributions assessable on salaries are as follows:
Social taxes and contributions | Percentage of gross monthly earnings (%)  
---|---  
(including 13th month salary)  
Employer (2, 3) | Employee (1)  
Pension fund | 18/20.4 | 11  
National unemployment fund | - | -  
Family allowances fund | - | -  
Social services institute for pensioner | - | 3  
Social health care plan | 6 | 3  
Total | 24/26.4 | 17  
Notes
  1. Social security charges borne by employees are applicable up to a monthly salary cap. 
  2. Argentine employers are exempt to pay social security contributions for the first ARS 7,003.68 per month per employee. 
  3. Employers' contributions to the national unemployment fund, family allowances fund, and social services institute for pensioners is paid at a unified rate of 18%. The rate is increased to 20.4% for companies whose main activity consists of rendering services or commerce, provided the amount of their total annual sales exceeds the amount to be considered a small and medium-sized enterprise (SME).
