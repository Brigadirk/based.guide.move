## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
The Personal Income Tax (PIT) Code foresees, with the respective specificities, the segmentation of income into Groups, namely:
  * Group A: Generally applicable to the income earned by employees.
  * Group B: Income earned by self-employed workers.
  * Group C: Income earned by individuals carrying out an industrial or commercial activity listed in the minimum profits table in force, attached to the PIT Code.


## Personal income tax rates
Group B and Group C taxpayers are subject to PIT in line with the regime provided for business and professional income.
The PIT Code provides the following two regimes of taxation of income derived by Group B taxpayers, and the withholding tax (WHT) rules depend on the payer's status:
  1. When the income is paid by companies, or individuals who have a simplified accounting or a general accounting model/organised accounting, the taxable amount corresponds to the value of the service and is subject to WHT at a rate of 6.5%.
  2. When the income is paid by entities that do not meet the requirements mentioned in 1 above, the taxable income is determined by the service provided based on one's accounting records, the available records of purchases, sales, and services rendered, or the data available by the tax authorities according to the specific rules applicable to taxpayers of Group B and is subject to a 25% tax rate. Taxpayers maintaining accounting books and records, simplified accounting model, or purchase and sale or services provided registration book are allowed to deduct up to 30% of incurred expenses in the computation of taxable income. Taxpayers of Group B with no organised nor simplified accounting models are not entitled to deduct costs, and the tax is levied over all income.


For Group C taxpayers with organised accounting, the taxable income (not subject to WHT) should be determined, with the necessary adjustments, in similar terms as the ones applicable to taxpayers subject to the general corporate income tax (CIT) regime. Group C taxpayers without organised accounting may determine the taxable income (not subject to WHT) according to deemed profits (table of minimum profits) or, when exceeding certain limits, the turnover (sales of goods and services rendered).
Taxable income | Rate (%)  
---|---  
The amount of profits not subject to WHT assessed through the accounting records of individuals with organised accounting (Groups B and C) is subject to the following rate.The amount of profits established in the minimum profits table (Group C) or amount of sales of goods and services not subject to WHT, when the taxpayer has turnover in excess of four times the maximum value established in the minimum profits table, is subject to the following rate. | 25  
Fees paid to self-employed individuals are subject to the following WHT when the payer has organised or simplified accounting models. | 6.5  
Business and professional income derived by non-resident professionals is generally subject to final WHT of 6.5% on the gross amount. | 6.5  
The taxable income of Group C taxpayers whose turnover, in the financial year 2023, is equal to or less than 10 million Angolan kwanza (AOA), corresponding to the volume of sales of goods and services not subject to WHT, on which the rate of 6.5% will apply. | 6.5  
For Group A, there are progressive income tax rates up to 25%, as follows:
Income (AOA) | Payable tax (AOA)  
---|---  
Up to 100,000 | Exempt  
Between 100,001 and 150,000 | 13% upon the excess of 100,001  
Between 150,001 and 200,000 | 12,500 + 16% upon the excess of 150,001

Between 1,500,001 and 2,000,000 | 292,249 + 22% upon the excess of 1,500,001  
Between 2,000,001 and 2,500,000 | 402,249 + 23% upon the excess of 2,000,001
