# Mauritius
## Overview
Last reviewed - 16 December 2024
Mauritius, an island nation east of Madagascar off the southeast coast of Africa, gained independence in 1968. A stable democracy with regular free elections and a positive human rights record, the country has attracted considerable foreign investment and has earned one of Africa's highest _per capita_ incomes. Mauritius is divided into ten districts and three dependencies, and its capital is Port Louis. Its official language is English, and its currency is the Mauritian rupee (MUR).
Since independence, Mauritius has developed from a low-income, agriculturally based economy to a middle-income, diversified economy with growing industrial, financial, and tourist sectors. For most of this period, annual growth has been in the order of 5% to 6%. This remarkable achievement has been reflected in more equitable income distribution, increased life expectancy, lowered infant mortality, and a much-improved infrastructure. The economy depends on tourism, textiles and apparel, and financial services, and is expanding into fish processing, information and communications technology, hospitality, and property development.
Mauritius is ranked first in Africa and 20th worldwide on the Ease of Doing Business, according to the World Bank Doing Business Report 2019.
According to Statistics of Mauritius, the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) at basic prices was 3.8% in 2018. The headline inflation rate increased from 1.0% in 2016 to 3.7% in 2017.
Investment as a ratio of GDP has increased to 18.7% in 2018 compared to 17.3% in 2017, and total foreign direct investment for the period of July 2017 to June 2018 was 484 million United States dollars (USD). GDP _per capita_ for financial year 2019 was USD 11,182.
