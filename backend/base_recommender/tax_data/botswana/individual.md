## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 19 April 2024
## Foreign tax relief
A tax credit is granted unilaterally where amounts received by a Botswana resident have been subject to taxation in a foreign country and in cases where a double taxation agreement (DTA) has been concluded. A tax credit is also granted where income from a source within Botswana has been subject to a WHT. The amount of the relief is limited to the lesser of the tax paid by deduction and that normally paid in Botswana on such income.
## Tax treaties
Botswana has DTAs with Barbados, Belgium, China, Czech Republic, eSwatini, France, India, Ireland, Kenya, Lesotho, Luxembourg, Malawi, Malta, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Russia, Seychelles, South Africa, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 19 April 2024
The following developments are effective from 1 July 2021:
  * The resident individual income threshold increased from 36,000 to 48,000 Botswana pula (BWP), with concomitant changes to tax paying brackets.
  * The income threshold for non-residents has been updated.


## Revised filing obligations for individuals for tax year 2021 and 2022
The Commissioner General of the Botswana Unified Revenue Service (BURS) has confirmed that tax returns are not required to be submitted by individuals:
  * who earned gross income of less than BWP 480,000 for the year ended 30 June 2021
  * where such gross income arose solely from employment from a single employer, and
  * which gross income was subjected to correct pay-as-you-earn (PAYE).


The above shall remain in place until the Commissioner General advises otherwise.
The BURS has expanded e-services to personal income tax (PIT) for individuals.
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The VAT rate was initially changed from 12% to 14% on 1 April 2021; however, in an effort to reduce the impact of increasing inflation on the Botswana economy, the Botswana government introduced a temporary measure to alleviate the pressure by reducing the rate from 14% to 12% from 3 August 2022 up to 31 March 2023. The VAT rate reverted to 14% with effect from 1 April 2023.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 19 April 2024
The Botswana tax system operates on a territorial basis, and income is taxable in Botswana if the source is within Botswana. Income for services performed outside Botswana is deemed to be from a Botswana source if the services are incidental to employment in Botswana.
A resident is taxable on all income from a Botswana source in accordance with the PIT rates.
A non-resident is taxable on earned income in accordance with the PIT rates, but pays withholding tax (WHT) only at the rate of 15% for interest, commercial royalties, and management and consultancy fees, 10% for dividends, and 10% for entertainment fees, where such income is of Botswana origin.

## Individual - Income determination

## Employment income
Expatriate employees are taxable on salary and on any overseas allowances, wherever payment is made. Living and housing allowances, tax reimbursements, and the value of benefits, such as free accommodation and the use of motor vehicles, are included in taxable income. All employment income is subject to PAYE. However, airfares and medical costs borne by the employer for the employee, spouse, and dependent children, and provided in the terms of the employee's contract, are not taxable.
For individuals' contracts of employment signed on or after 1 July 1999, any gratuities paid are taxable to the extent of two-thirds of such gratuity. The remaining one-third is tax free. The percentage parameters are still 25% of gross salary for the first contract, 27.5% for the second contract, and 30% for the third and subsequent contracts. Contracts normally run two to three years.
## Capital gains
Capital gains for individuals are considered to be from a separate source and are taxed on the basis of a separate table (_see Capital gains taxes in the section_).
