  * supply of electronic books; 
  * deliveries of building land and buildings; 
  * book sales.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 24 February 2025
As a general rule, a resident company is a company that is incorporated under New Caledonian/French commercial laws.
The notion of a business carried on in New Caledonia means the habitual exercise of an activity that can either be carried out within an autonomous establishment or be performed through representatives who are economically or legally dependent or result from the completion of transactions forming a full commercial cycle.
However, for insurance activities, the business is considered as carried on in New Caledonia for the insurance products that are distributed locally.
The profits arising from transactions carried out by Caledonian businesses in establishments that they own outside of New Caledonia are not taken into account for CIT. Therefore, related expenses and losses are not deductible from the profits subject to CIT.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 24 February 2025
## Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation is allowed as a deductible expense from taxable profits when it meets the following conditions:
  * It must be carried out on fixed assets belonging to the operator and actually subject to depreciation.
  * The annuity must correspond to the depreciation suffered. It can be calculated either according to the straight-line system or, for certain equipment assets, according to the declining-balance system.
  * The depreciation must have actually been carried out in accounting.
  * Depreciation must appear on a special statement (_relevé special_).


Depreciation ceases to be tax deductible when it has reached, in total, the amount of the cost price. The cost price to be used generally means the actual acquisition price that the item involved for the company, as it results in principle from the accounting.
In the straight-line system, the annual depreciation to be deducted from the results of each fiscal year is calculated by applying to the cost price the rate corresponding to the normal duration of use of the element.
Equipment goods whose normal useful life is at least three years and industrial or agricultural buildings whose normal useful life does not exceed 15 years can be depreciated using the declining-balance method.
The coefficient applicable to the linear depreciation rate is, for each fixed asset, set at:
  * 1.5 when useful life is 3 years or 4 years.
  * 2 when useful life is 5 or 6 years.
  * 2.5 when useful life is greater than 6 years.


## Start-up expenses
The New Caledonian law provides specific rules for certain new companies, particularly when they set up in a free zone or when they can be qualified as young innovative companies (_jeunes entreprises innovantes_).
## Interest expenses
Interest paid to shareholders for the sums they leave or make available to the company, in addition to their share of the capital, whatever the form of the company, is deductible within the higher of the following two rates:
  * Legal interest rate in force over the period for which the interest is due.
  * Legal interest rate in force over the period for which the interest is due, increased by three percentage points, the rate thus determined not being able to exceed 5%.


The legal interest rate is the rate determined by Article L. 313-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code.
This deduction is subject to the condition that the capital has been fully paid up.
## Charitable contributions
As a general principle, charitable donations are not tax deductible for CIT purposes. However, they may entitle one to an incentive (_see the section for more information regarding the charitable donations tax reduction_).
## Payments to directors 
The fixed allowances that a company grants to its directors or executives of its company for representation and travel expenses are not deductible from tax results when these expenses already include the usual expenses of this nature reimbursed to the interested parties. Moreover, expenses that are excessive and not incurred for business purposes, including direct or indirect remuneration, paid to directors or persons with the highest remuneration in the company are not deductible from the taxable result.
## Research and development (R&D) expenses
_See Tax credit for research and development (R &D) in the section_.
## Fines and penalties
As a general principle, fines and penalties are not tax deductible for CIT purposes.
## Taxes
The TSS and the CAIS are not tax deductible for CIT purposes.
## Other significant items
Overhead costs of any kind are generally tax deductible for CIT purposes. However, companies having their head office or effective management outside New Caledonia may deduct from the amount of their taxable profit the share of general expenses incurred at the place of the head office or management relating to activities carried out in New Caledonia, within the limit of 5% of the amount of external services required by said activities. This deduction is subject to the following cumulative conditions:
  * The costs allocated to activities carried out in New Caledonia were incurred in the direct interest of companies in New Caledonia.
  * Companies attach to their CIT return a statement of overheads (_relevé des frais généraux_) incurred and a statement of determination of the deductible amount of overheads in accordance with models established by the administration.


When these conditions are not met, the share of the costs deducted is reinstated in taxable income without a rectification proposal.
At the first request from the administration, a justification of the interest of the costs for the business operated in New Caledonia is produced within three months.
Royalties that mining companies pay to shareholders who have, directly or indirectly, a majority stake in the company's capital are not deductible for the purposes of CIT.
## Net operating losses
### Carryforward of tax losses
Tax losses can be offset against long-term capital gain of the fiscal year.
Tax losses carried forward are available to offset the entire taxable profits of the following fiscal years and can be carried forward indefinitely.
### Carryback of tax losses
As a general principle, carryback of tax losses is not allowed, except for metallurgical and mining companies.
## Payments to foreign entities
Interest, arrears, and other income from obligations, debts, deposits and guarantees, royalties from the transfer or grant of operating licences, patents of invention, trademarks, manufacturing processes or formulae and other similar rights or remuneration for services, paid or due by a natural or legal person domiciled or established in New Caledonia to natural or legal persons who are domiciled or established outside New Caledonia and are subject to a privileged tax regime are permitted as deductible expenses for the establishment of the tax only if the debtor provides evidence that the expenses correspond to real operations and that they are not abnormal or exaggerated. Persons are considered to be subject to a privileged tax regime in the state or territory considered if they are not taxable there or if they are subject to taxes or if the tax due is less than half of the tax that they would have been liable in New Caledonia.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 24 February 2025
There is no tax group regime in New Caledonia. _See Dividend income in the section for more information on the preferential regime of dividends distributions between related entities_.
## Transfer pricing
Profits indirectly transferred outside New Caledonia, either by increasing or decreasing purchase or sale prices or by any other means, are incorporated into the results recorded by the accounts.
When, during a tax audit, the tax services department has gathered elements leading to the presumption that a company has made an indirect transfer of profits, it may request this company information and documents specifying:
  * The method of determining the prices of operations carried out with companies or groups established outside New Caledonia and the elements that justify it, as well as, where applicable, the compensation granted.
  * Activities carried out by companies or groups established outside New Caledonia.
  * The tax treatment of operations carried out by the companies outside New Caledonia or by the companies or groups of which it holds, directly or indirectly, the majority of the capital or voting rights.


## Thin capitalisation
There are no specific thin capitalisation rules in New Caledonia. _Please see Interest expenses in the section_.


# New Caledonia
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 24 February 2025
CIT rates on branch profits are the same as on corporate profits. As a principle, branch profits are deemed to be distributed to the head office.
Deemed distributed income are also subject to IRVM at a 10% rate, CCS at a 5% rate, and to _centimes additionnels_ (communal tax), and the CAIS at a 3% rate would also apply, depending on the deemed distributed profits amount.
In a judgment of 29 December 2023, the Council of State stated that the DTT concluded between France and New Caledonia provides that the profits made by a permanent establishment (PE) in New Caledonia cannot, after having borne the CIT, be subject to a tax whose rate exceeds 10%. This judgment directly targets the case of taxpayers submitting income earned through a PE in New Caledonia to both the IRVM and the CAIS.


# New Caledonia
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 24 February 2025
## Specific tax credit applicable to mining or metallurgical activities
Mining companies may benefit from various tax incentives for mining or metallurgical investments projects in New Caledonia.
Companies carrying out these activities are subject to CIT at a rate of 35%. However, they are benefiting from specific incentives, such as:
  * Tax stabilisation regime (_régime de stabilisation fiscale_) by which companies benefit from a stability, during a 15-years period, when it comes notably to tax rates, tax base, and applicable taxes.
  * Restricted carryback of tax losses regime.
  * Dividends distribution regime to certain French shareholders.


## Tax credit for research and development (R&D)
The R&D tax credit is determined on the basis of the eligible R&D expenses incurred during the calendar year.
The R&D tax credit is determined on the basis of R&D projects qualified as eligible and is equal to 30% of the sum of qualifying R&D expenses (until December 2024). The R&D tax credit is capped at XPF 5 million.
## Tax reduction on charitable donations
For charitable donations, the tax reduction amounts to 60% of the amount of the payments. For the calculation of the reduction, the amount of the payments is taken into account within the limit of 5 per thousand of turnover.
Donations and charitable contributions are not deductible for CIT purposes. The tax reduction on charitable donation can be offset against the CIT liability payable by the taxpayer with respect to the financial year during which the donations were granted.
## Loans for acquisition of principal residence
Credit institutions (as defined by Art. 511-1 of monetary and financial French Code) liable to CIT in New Caledonia may benefit from a tax credit for repayable advances not bearing interest, issued between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2030 and granted to individuals subject to resource conditions, for the acquisition or construction of a main residence located in New Caledonia as a first property purchase and paid during the tax year or financial year.
The amount of the tax credit is equal to the discounted sum of the differences between the monthly payments due for the interest-free repayable advance and the monthly payments of a loan granted under normal rate conditions on the date of issue of the tax credit.
## Foreign tax credit
Under the DTT signed between New Caledonia and France, several methods have been established to avoid double taxation depending on the revenues: deduction of a tax credit from tax effectively paid, a tax exemption, or the exclusive right to tax.

## France and the United States (US) sign bilateral agreement on the implementation of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
New-Caledonia and the United States signed a bilateral intergovernmental agreement (IGA) intended to implement FATCA. FATCA was enacted by the United States in 2010 to combat offshore tax evasion by US persons.
The New Caledonian government has committed to drafting local laws and regulations to implement FATCA among all financial institutions resident in New Caledonia. Broadly speaking, the banking, life insurance, and asset management industries will be most affected, but certain estate (patrimonial) vehicles, holding companies, as well as hedging, finance, and treasury centres of non-financial groups could also be impacted, depending on the nature of their activities.

## Inventory valuation
Inventories must be valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost must be determined in accordance with the first in first out (FIFO) or the average-cost method. The last in first out (LIFO) method is prohibited.
## Capital gains
Capital gains from the sale of fixed assets are subject to separate regimes depending on whether they are realised in the short or long term.
The short-term capital gains regime is applicable:
  * to capital gains arising from the sale of assets acquired or created less than two years ago, and
  * to capital gains realised on the sale of assets held for at least two years to the extent that they correspond to depreciation deducted for the tax base.


The short-term capital losses regime applies:
  * to capital losses suffered on the transfer of non-depreciable assets held for less than two years, and
  * to capital losses suffered on the transfer of depreciable assets, regardless of the duration of their holding.


Capital gains that do not meet short-term capital gains conditions are deemed to be long-term capital gains.
Transfers of securities included in the portfolio are deemed to relate in priority to securities of the same nature acquired or subscribed on the earliest date.
The long-term capital gains regime is applicable to proceeds from the transfer of patents, processes, and techniques, as well as to concessions of exclusive operating licences.
The net amount of long-term capital gains is taxed at a 15% CIT rate, with the exception of capital gains from the sale of building land and similar assets (as well as securities of companies whose assets are mainly constituted by this type of assets), the amount of which is taxed at a 25% CIT rate. Capital gains subject to tax at the rate of 15% or 25%, reduced by the amount of this tax, are placed in a special reserve.
Any excess of long-term capital losses can only be set off against long-term capital gains realised during the following ten financial years.
The net amount of short-term capital gains can be distributed equally over the year of their realisation and over the following two years. Where applicable, the excess of short-term capital losses recorded during a financial year is deducted from the profits of the financial year.
## Dividend income
Dividends received by companies based outside New Caledonia are taxable as ordinary income and subject to CIT at the standard rate. However, if the beneficiary holds at least 10% of the distributing company for four years (two years before and two years after), these dividends are not included in the taxable base, except a lump sum of 10%.
Dividends received from companies based in New-Caledonia are, without any condition, tax exempted.
The withholding tax (WHT) paid in the country of the distributing company is considered as a tax credit. 
## Interest income
Interest income generally is taxable as ordinary income and subject to CIT at the standard rate.
## Royalty income
Royalties are, in principle, subject to CIT at the standard rate (plus additional social contribution if relevant).
## Foreign income
Resident corporations are not taxed on foreign-source income derived from activities carried out abroad through foreign branches and foreign PEs. Other foreign income is not taxable until actually repatriated to French-resident corporations. As a result, undistributed income of foreign subsidiaries is not taxable.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 24 February 2025
A resident company is subject to corporate income tax (so-called ‘corporate income tax on companies and metallurgical or mining activities’; CIT) in New Caledonia on its New Caledonian-source income (deriving from an activity performed in New Caledonia or entities having their head office in New Caledonia). Taxable income in New Caledonia could also results from the application of a double tax treaty (DTT) between New Caledonia and another country.
New Caledonia levies CIT at a 35% rate for metallurgical or mining activities. For other corporates, CIT is levied at a 30% rate (that could be reduced to 15% depending on turnover thresholds). Even though the government has announced its wish to progressively reduce the standard CIT rate, no law has been enacted in this regard.
## Additional contribution on corporate income tax (CAIS)
The CAIS (_contribution additonnelle à l’impôt sur les sociétés_) applies at a 3% rate to the income distributed (or deemed distributed) by corporations or entities subject to the CIT whenever the amount of the income distributed during a fiscal year exceeds XPF 30 million.
## Additional Social Contribution (CSA)
The Additional Social Contribution (_Contribution Sociale Additionnelle_) applies, at a progressive tax rate from 5% to 15% (depending on the profits), to legal entities subject to the CIT and whose taxable income at the standard rate (30%) reaches or exceeds XPF 200 million. This contribution is not deductible from the taxable income for CIT.
## Tax on financial incomes (IRVM)
The IRVM (_impôt sur le revenue des valeurs mobilières_) applies, at a theoretical rate of 11.5%, to the income distributed (or deemed distributed) by companies or entities subject to CIT in New Caledonia.
IRVM is due on all incomes distributed mentioned in Article Lp. 529 of the local tax code (e.g. dividends, interest). Some entities are expressly exempted from IRVM.
## Income tax on debts, deposits, and guarantees (IRCDC)
The IRCDC (_impôt sur le revenue des créances, dépôt et cautionnements_) applies at 8% on interest, arrears, mortgage, privileged and unsecured debts having the characteristic of a money loan, cash guarantees, associates' current accounts, and deposits of sums of money, on demand or with fixed maturity, whatever the depositary and whatever the use of the deposit (bonds, capitalisation contracts, etc.). There are exemptions provided by Art. Lp. 555 of the local tax code. 
## Caledonian solidarity contribution (CCS)
The CCS is levied, at a rate ranging from 2% to 4%, notably on the income from securities for natural or legal persons subject to the IRVM, and on the private real estate capital gains for those subject to the tax on private real estate capital gains (PVI).

## General consumption tax (TGC)
The TGC (_taxe Générale sur la consummation_) is a value-added tax (VAT)-like tax that is applied to the consumer prices of goods and services since 1 October 2018 in New Caledonia.
TGC is due on goods sold and services rendered in New Caledonia. There are four rates of TGC:
  * Reduced rate: 3%
  * Specific rate: 6%
  * Normal rate: 11% for all the operations that are not subject to another rate.
  * Higher rate: 22%


Supplies of goods outside New Caledonia and certain specific services invoiced to foreign clients are, in principle, exempt from TGC.
Business-to-business (B2B) suppliers of services are generally taxable at the location of the customer and not at the location of the supplier. For business-to-consumer (B2C) supplies of services, the place of taxation is generally where the supplier is established / where the services are realised.
Some transactions are TGC exempted, such as:
  * Exemptions of transactions for reasons of public interest.
  * Some transactions in relation with real property.
  * Some transactions subject to other taxation, such as insurance premiums tax, tax on financial operations, etc.


## Customs duties
Customs duties are levied on the import of goods.
In New Caledonia, these duties, called ‘ _ad valorem’_ , range from 0% (‘exempt’) to 20% maximum.
Goods originating from certain countries (‘preferential origin’) may also be exempt from customs duties. This is the case, in particular, for goods imported from metropolitan France, the European Union (EU), or the ‘ _Pays et territoires d’outre-mer’_ , provided that their origin is justified in accordance with the conditions laid down by the regulations.
## Excise taxes
The license fee (_droits de license_) applies to businesses and professions whose purpose is the production or sale, in any capacity, of distilled or fermented alcoholic beverages or of fermented hygienic drinks.
There is a tax on alcohol and tobacco applying to alcoholic beverages from local production and to products of the tobacco monopoly.
The domestic consumption tax on local products and manufacturing (_taxe sur la consummation intérieure_ or TCI) applies to alcoholic beverages and products based on alcohol of any origin and source harvested or manufactured in New Caledonia.
## Real estate tax
The real estate tax (_contribution foncière des propriétés bâties et non bâties_) is a tax established on the ownership of land and buildings that varies according to the municipalities, neighborhoods, and type of construction.
The property tax is due for the entire year, without the possibility of splitting, according to the situation existing on 1 January of the tax year, in the name of the owner, the usufructuary, the long-term leaseholder, or the construction leaseholder or similar. Therefore, in the case of a sale during the year, the tax established during the year of sale remains due by the seller.
The tax base depends on the type of land, building, properties and equipment. The applicable rates range between 8.40% for buildings and 0.7875% for unbuilt properties. The tax should be determine based on the reduction applicable and considering the taxation applied by municipalities and provinces.
Please note that:
  * A Municipal Development Tax (_Taxe communale d’aménagement_) is also applicable to the recipient of a building permit.
  * A tax of 0.3% could apply to deeds that are mortgage related (_taxe hypothécaire_).
  * A real estate security contribution (_contribution de sécurité immobilière_) of 0.075% generally applies for the transcription of deeds related to real estate.


## Registration duties
Registration fees (_droits d’enregistrement_), either fixed or proportional, are levied on certain legal transactions: sales of real estate, businesses, donations, inheritances, etc.
They allow to date precisely the formality of registration. The duties are calculated on the sum that represents the amount of the transaction. In case of sale, it is the sale price stipulated or the fair market value if it is higher than the price. For successions or donations, it is the fair market value.
### Transfer of goodwill
The transfer of goodwill is subject to a registration duty at a rate of 4% on the part of the transfer price that is higher than XPF 5 million. If the transfer price is under XPF 5 million, a fixed registration fee of XPF 7,000 is applicable.
### Transfers of shares
The transfer of shares is subject to registration duty at a rate of 1%, subject to a cap of XPF 500,000. 
### Transfer of interest or quotas in legal entities whose capital is not divided into shares
The transfer of interests or quotas in legal entities whose capital is not divided into shares (e.g. _Société à responsabilité limitée_ [SARLs] or _Société en nom collectif_ [SNCs], which are a form of private limited liability corporate entity) is subject to a registration duty of 1% with no cap. A tax rebate is applied for each transferred security, equal to (XPF 5 million x the number of acquired securities) / the total number of securities.
### Transfer of shares in non-quoted real estate companies
The transfer of shares in non-quoted companies whose assets consist principally of immovable property (or rights related to such immovable property) is subject to a registration duty of 4% with no cap.
### Transfer of real estate
The sale of land and buildings is subject to registration duty at a rate of 4% on the transfer price. Some reduced rates and specific regimes exist.
### Other formalities
Registration duties are not due on the incorporation of a company, except when capital contributions consist in real estate properties or movable properties. 
Capital increases are subject to registration duties (ranging from XPF 25,000 to XPF 50,000 depending on the capital of the company).
## Stamp taxes
The stamp duty tax is levied on all papers intended for civil, administrative, and legal acts, and on documents that may be mentioned in the context of a judgment and provide evidence. It is also levied on all acts that have already borne the stamp and registration duties in France or abroad; it is only collected to the extent that there is a difference in the rate to be collected for the benefit of New Caledonia. Perception occurs cumulatively with the fixed and proportional fees for registration. The stamp duties are up to XPF 15,000.
## Capital gains taxes
The government has implemented a tax on private real estate capital gains (PVI). It is a tax due when an individual or a partnership (e.g. an SCI) sells a real estate property, as long as the property has increased in value between the date of acquisition and the date of sale. This tax is 20% of the amount of the capital gain, to which must be added 4% the CCS, making it a total of 24%. There are a number of exemptions and specific rules for calculating the amount of the tax.
Capital gains and profits made by corporate entities, regardless of their form, established outside of New Caledonia or without a stable establishment or a head office in New Caledonia, are also subject to the PVI.
## Social security contributions
The New Caledonian social security system is composed of various schemes providing a wide range of benefits. This system includes social security basic coverage, unemployment benefits, complementary retirement plans, death/disability coverage, and complementary health coverage. The contributions are based on the remunerations, and monthly thresholds are applicable to determine the rate, which ranges from 0.2% to 11.67%.
Employers have to pay these social contributions notably to the CAFAT (_Caisse de compensation des prestations familiales, des accidents du travail et de prévoyance des travailleurs de Nouvelle-Calédonie_).
## Training contribution
A training contribution (_contribution des employeurs sur les salaires au titre de la formation professionnelle_) is due on wages at a 0.25% rate.
## Business licence duty
Taxation of the business license (_contribution des patentes_) is compulsory for any natural or legal person who undertakes in New Caledonia the exercise of a trade, an industry, or a profession, for their own account and for profit.
It is calculated annually depending on the type and characteristics of the professional activity and is made up of a fixed fee (composed of a fixed tariff and additional tariffs) and a proportional duty (based on customs). If a company carries out its activity through several establishments, it will have to pay as many licences as it has establishments.
## Insurance premiums tax (IPT)
Companies are required, before starting their operations, to provide the professional tax service or the business formalities center with a declaration of existence stating the nature of these operations.
Any agreement with an insurance company or with any other French or foreign insurer insuring a risk in New Caledonia is subject to IPT (_taxe sur les conventions d’assurance_). The tax rate is set at 7%. The tax is applicable on all the amounts paid to the insurer (premiums and its accessories). Some risks are exempted from IPT, such as life insurances or reinsurance contracts.
Please note that additional contributions should apply based on the French Tax Code.
## Financial transaction tax
The tax on financial transactions (_taxe sur les opérations financières_) is due on financial transactions, which applies to interest, arrears, and all other income received by financial institutions and banks carrying out an activity in New Caledonia, in terms of mortgage debts, cash guarantees, current account following credit openings by banks and financial institutions.
Exemptions are applicable under certain conditions in the context, notably, of agricultural credits and real estate loans.
The tax is applicable at a 6% rate.

The municipal councils of the communes of New Caledonia are authorised to collect additional centimes applicable to the business licence, real estate tax, registration duties, and on IRVM.
## _Tax on sweets products_
The tax on sweet products came into effect on September 1, 2024. 
The tax is payable by the importer or local supplier of sweet products at the time of importation, or by the producer at the time of the first delivery for products resulting from a local transformation process. The tax rate depends on the sugar content per 100 grams (g) or 100 millilitres (ml).
