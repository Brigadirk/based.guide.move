## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Foreign tax relief
An individual resident may derive income from another country, which is subject to tax in that country. The individual may credit the foreign income tax paid against the Mexican income tax liability. However, the credit is limited to the lesser of (i) the amount of foreign tax paid with respect to foreign-source income that is taxable in Mexico and (ii) the amount of Mexican tax corresponding to that income. In addition, no credit is allowed for foreign taxes imposed on income that is exempt from Mexican taxation.
## Tax treaties
Tax treaties may reduce or eliminate tax withholding from non-residents, and the treaty provisions should be analysed accordingly, depending on the country of residence of the individual receiving Mexican-source income.
Mexico has concluded double-taxation agreements (DTAs) with the following countries:

During September 2020, an appeal court decision in Mexico City opened the possibility for foreign individuals leaving Mexico to seek a refund of part of their social security contributions that relate to pension and workers housing. The appeal court decision is a binding precedent only within the Mexico City area, although appeal courts in other jurisdictions within Mexico and the relevant authorities may follow the same criteria.
On 9 December 2020, a reform that regulates and promotes teleworking as a form of labour organisation was approved, establishing rights and obligations for employers and employees. This reform entered into force on 12 January 2021.
On 16 December 2020, a decree was published that amends, adds, and eliminates some tax provisions of the Social Security Law and Retirement Savings System Law. These apply from 1 January 2023.
Starting 1 June 2020, the income tax law establishes specific rules for collecting tax in relation to individuals who provide services via the digital economy as apps for transportation services, short-term rentals, and selling goods and services via digital marketplaces.
As of 2017, the Measurement and Actualisation Unit (UMA in Spanish) replaces the minimum wage in tax calculations, limits, exemptions, etc. as a unit of indexation. The UMA that corresponds to 2025 is 113.14Mexican pesos (MXN) per day.
On 1 May 2024, a decree was published regarding the employment subsidy, which came into force on the same date. The subsidy amount is determined based on the employee's salary and a progressive tax rate established by the government; such subsidy decreases as the salary increases, and it is credited for the income tax withheld to employees with low-income by reducing their tax burden, as this subsidy is provided to employees who earn a salary below a threshold of MXN 10,171 on a monthly basis for 2025.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Resident individuals are subject to Mexican income tax on their worldwide income, regardless of their nationality. Non-residents, including Mexican citizens who can prove residence for tax purposes in a foreign country, are taxed only on their Mexican-source income.
## Personal income tax rates
The following tax rates are effective for resident individuals for calendar year 2025:
Taxable income (MXN) | Basic tax  
---|---  
From | To | Tax on column 1 (MXN) | Tax on excess (%)  
0.01 | 8,952.49 | 0 | 1.92  
8,952.50 | 75,984.55 | 171.88 | 6.40  
75,984.56 | 133,536.07 | 4,461.94 | 10.88  
133,536.08 | 155,229.80 | 10,723.55 | 16.00  
155,229.81 | 185,852.57 | 14,194.54 | 17.92  
185,852.58 | 374,837.88 | 19,682.13 | 21.36  
374,837.89 | 590,795.99 | 60,049.40 | 23.52  
590,796.00 | 1,127,926.84 | 110,842.74 | 30.00  
1,127,926.85 | 1,503,902.46 | 271,981.99 | 32.00  
1,503,902.47 | 4,511,707.37 | 392,294.17 | 34.00  
4,511,707.38 | and above | 1,414,947.85 | 35.00  
If the employee is considered a non-resident for Mexican tax purposes, the tax rate applicable to compensation will vary from 15% to 30%. The first MXN 125,900 of employment income received in a 12-month floating period will be tax exempt.
The following tax table is applicable to income tax with respect to income earned by non-residents for the calendar year 2025:
Taxable income (MXN) | Tax rate (%)  
---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 125,900 | Exempt  
125,900 | 1,000,000 | 15  
1,000,000 | and above | 30  
Non-residents are subject to withholding taxes (WHTs) on Mexican-source interest income at rates varying from 0% to 35%, depending on several factors. Non-residents are subject to Mexican tax on gains arising from sales of real property located in Mexico (including shares of foreign companies holding a significant amount of Mexican real property) as well as the sale of shares of Mexican companies. Generally, when a capital gain is subject to tax, the non-resident investor can elect to pay either a flat rate of 25% of the gross proceeds or 35% of the net gain. Sales of shares in the Mexican stock exchange are subject to a flat 10% tax withholding on the profit from said transaction.
Other types of Mexican-source income (including rents and royalties) are also subject to WHTs when paid to a non-resident. In the case of dividends and other corporate distributions from Mexican companies, since 2014, there is a 10% tax withholding on the dividends from corporate profits generated after 2013.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Taxable period
The Mexican tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December. For non-residents who pay income tax on Mexican-source compensation income, the tax year is the 12-month period that starts with the first month the non-resident is subject to tax.
## Tax returns
All residents receiving income during the calendar year are required to file an annual tax return no later than 30 April of the succeeding year, except in certain cases. When an individual earns Mexican bank interest only, and it is less than MXN 206,368 per year, no tax return filing is required. Residents receiving only compensation income will be required to file an annual income tax return only if total compensation for the year exceeds MXN 400,000, and certain other conditions are met.
Although joint returns are not allowed, miscellaneous rules allow a married couple to have the highest income earner report all investment income. Since income splitting is not allowed, personal service income should be declared by the spouse earning it.
Under the current rules, most taxpayers must file the annual tax return electronically and will need to have previously registered an advanced electronic signature, which will be used in the return filing process.
### Information disclosures
Under certain circumstances, individuals are required to report six non-taxable items on their annual tax returns, for informational purposes only. These items include loan proceeds, prizes, gifts, inheritances, proceeds from the sale of a personal residence, and travel expense reimbursements. Although disclosed on the return, these items remain non-taxable. If these items are not disclosed, there is a risk to lose their tax-exempt treatment.
In addition to the obligation to file an annual tax return, individuals are also required to file an annual tax haven investment information report by 28 February (_see Tax haven investments in the_ _section for more information_).
## Payment of tax
The balance due is payable upon filing the return. The full tax on salary income and certain interest and dividend income is withheld at source. However, in the case of salaries received by resident individuals from non-resident employers (and non-resident employees subject to the non-resident tax on salaries), Mexican law requires the filing of personal monthly provisional tax returns to pay an amount equal to the tax withholding applicable to these wages. The monthly returns are generally due by the 17th day of the following month and are filed electronically.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Personal deductions
As of 2016, personal deductions have been limited. The general limit for 2025 is the lesser of (i) 15% of the yearly overall income of the taxpayer or (ii) an amount equal to five annual UMA (a maximum of MXN 206,368). Retirement accounts and education expenses are not subject to this general limit and have separate limits (_see below_). Medical expenses will not be subject to this limit provided that the individual has a medical certificate issued by a government health institution.
### Charitable contributions
Contributions made to authorised charities are deductible, limited to 7% of the prior year's taxable income.
### Medical, dental, nutritionist, psychologist, and funeral expenses
Resident taxpayers are allowed to deduct un-reimbursed medical, dental, nutritionist, psychologist, and funeral expenses for themselves and their dependants, as well as health insurance premiums subject to the general limit. Such expenses are not deductible if they are paid in cash.
### Home mortgage interest
Home mortgage interest (adjusted for inflation) is deductible, subject to the general limit and a cap on the loan value.
### Retirement accounts
Contributions to certain special private retirement accounts and voluntary contributions to the retirement accounts of the Mexican social security system are deductible (limited to certain amounts). Withdrawals from these plans become taxable income.
### Education expenses
Taxpayers are allowed to deduct tuition expenses paid for their spouse, children, parents, and themselves. The maximum amount deductible per student varies from MXN 14,200 to MXN 24,500 per year, depending on the level of education. The limits are adjusted annually for inflation. The cost of university-level education is not deductible.
## Standard deductions
There are no standard deductions in Mexico.
## Business deductions
Business owners and independent professionals are allowed to deduct most of the same business expenses as corporations (_see in the Corporate tax summary for more information_).
## Losses
A net loss from professional and business activities is not currently deductible against other income, but the tax loss may be carried forward for ten years against professional and business income only.
Capital losses may be used to partially or completely offset capital gains and, in some cases, other investment income but not against compensation, business, or professional income.
Rental losses can be deducted against other investment income in the same year. However, any excess loss cannot be carried forward.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Employment income
Income from personal services (earned income) includes salaries, commissions, and allowances of all types, including those for housing, living expenses, education, foreign service, tax reimbursements, and employer profit-sharing distributions.
Employees are allowed to exclude an amount equal to 30 days' UMA if they receive a year-end bonus (Christmas bonus), 15 days' UMA each if they receive a vacation bonus or participation in the employer's profits, and overtime pay up to five times the daily UMA per week, with certain limitations. These exclusions are taken into account by the employer when calculating the income tax withholding.
Fringe benefits, such as social welfare benefits, may be considered as totally or partially exempt income if the employer satisfies certain eligibility requirements (e.g. non-discrimination). However, the exempt amount of general social welfare benefits is limited to the equivalent of one annual UMA (MXN 41,273.47 [i.e. 113.14 x 30.4 x 12] for 2025). Under no circumstances will the social welfare benefits be taxable if their amount, added to other regular compensation, does not exceed seven times the UMA.
The use of an employer-provided automobile is usually not considered to represent additional taxable income to the employee. However, the employer's deductibility of automobile costs and expenses is subject to certain limitations, concerning mainly the maximum value of the vehicle. A _per diem_ rate for business travel is treated as a taxable allowance unless supported by third-party receipts for actual travel expenses that are limited to lodging (hotel), meals, and transportation. Travel expenses are subject to certain maximum deductibility limits for domestic and foreign travel and are deductible (and not imputed as income to the employee) only when incurred outside a 50-kilometre radius from the employer’s base.
Living expense reimbursements, including housing and rental allowances, are generally taxable as compensation to the employee, even if paid directly to third parties.
Reimbursements of expenses of a spouse or dependants usually represent taxable income to the employee.
Fees paid to members of the Board of Directors are treated as salary income for income tax purposes. Under some circumstances, independent professionals can also elect to have their fees treated as salary income, in which case it will be the payer's responsibility to withhold the income tax from the professional's income and remit it to the tax authorities on a monthly basis.
Non-residents' wages, salaries, and other remuneration for personal dependent services rendered in Mexico are taxed on the basis of income received in a floating 12-month period, as long as the stay exceeds 183 calendar days, consecutive or not, in the mentioned period when paid by a non-Mexican resident.
## Equity compensation
Regarding employee stock options, income tax is payable when the options are exercised. The taxable amount is the difference between the value at exercise and the strike price. There are no tax-exempt amounts or caps. The tax rate depends on the amount of income received. The top marginal rate for 2025 is 35%. The tax is withheld at source and remitted to the Mexican tax authorities by the Mexican employer. If a stock option is exercised after the employee leaves Mexico and the former Mexican employer bears a portion or all of the benefit cost, the Mexican employer will be required to withhold by applying the income tax rates corresponding to salaries paid to a non-resident employee. Restricted stock units and other types of equity compensation are treated in a similar manner.
## Business income
All income received by individuals from business activities carried out by unincorporated enterprises and the fees of independent professionals are subject to ordinary income tax rates, and the individuals may deduct their normal business expenses.
Under a tax incentive that applies to the northern border region, a tax credit equivalent to one-third of the income tax payable may be applicable. Certain exceptions apply. The fees of independent professionals do not benefit from this tax incentive.
## Capital gains
Individuals that qualify as tax residents of Mexico are taxed on their worldwide capital gains. However, gains on sales of securities through the Mexican Stock Exchange are only subject to a 10% tax on the net gain for the year. Shares of Mexican companies traded abroad in authorised exchanges also receive the same treatment, when determined by the Mexican Ministry of Finance to be placed among the general public.
In addition, gains from the sale of the taxpayer’s principal residence are exempt if certain requirements are met. The exemption is limited to the gain corresponding to approximately 244,560 United States dollars (USD) of gross proceeds, approximately. The exemption is limited to only one sale every three years.
Gains on the disposition of real estate property or shares of capital stock receive favourable income tax treatment where historical costs (converted to pesos) may be adjusted (increased) for inflation (on the basis of the number of months the asset had been held). In the case of shares of capital stock of a privately held Mexican corporation, the adjustment also includes amounts intended to partially cover net retained earnings, whether capitalised or not. The resulting net gain for tax purposes is taxed under a formula favourable to the taxpayer, depending on the number of years the asset was held before the sale.
## Dividend income
Resident individuals must include in taxable income dividends received from Mexican corporations (grossed up for the corporate income tax [CIT] paid by the corporation) in their individual income tax returns and claim the underlying CIT paid as a credit against their personal tax liability. This ‘deemed paid’ credit system allows individual taxpayers to compute their tax on dividends at their own personal tax rate, which may be lower than the CIT rate of 30% in 2025. The CIT rate is lower than the top individual tax rate (35%).
Moreover, with respect to dividends paid from profits that were generated by the company after 2013, a 10% tax on the net dividend will be withheld by the Mexican company. This tax is in addition to the tax paid with the annual tax return, and it cannot be credited in the return.
Dividends paid by foreign corporations to resident individuals are fully taxable in the annual tax return. In addition, similar to domestic dividends, there is a 10% tax on the net dividend that the individual must pay by the 17th day of the following month. This tax is in addition to the tax paid with the annual tax return, and it cannot be credited in the return.
## Interest income
Interest from the Mexican banking system, except for certain exempt accounts with small balances, is subject to withholding and should be reported in the annual tax return. Except for certain transitional provisions, interest paid on most Mexican government obligations is taxable.
Interest on bank accounts, bonds, and other debt obligations issued by non-residents is fully taxable, and the taxable interest includes adjustments for inflationary losses and exchange gains and losses with respect to the principal.
## Rental income
Resident individuals are taxed on their worldwide rental income. They may deduct actual expenses incurred with respect to the property rented, including depreciation at 5% on the building’s cost, indexed for inflation; property taxes; insurance premiums; maintenance; interest on loans for the purchase or construction of the property (adjusted for inflation); and commissions paid. In order to claim these deductions, electronic accounting records must be provided to the Mexican tax authorities.
Alternatively, resident individuals may elect to deduct a standard deduction, equal to 35% of the gross rental income plus real estate taxes, in lieu of the deduction for actual expenses and depreciation mentioned above.
## Tax haven investments
Taxable investment income includes income earned (even if not distributed) by investments of any kind located in countries considered to be tax havens, in proportion to the ownership percentage of the resident taxpayers. If the taxpayer either does not have effective control of the administration of the tax haven investment or the total amount of the revenues obtained in the prior year does not exceed MXN 160,000, the income does not have to be recognised until it is received. Residents are also required to file a separate report with the tax authorities by 28 February of each year regarding their direct and indirect investments held during the previous calendar year in countries considered to be tax havens. Failure to file the information report is considered a felony. A procedure is established to determine the accrued income.

There are no other significant tax credits or incentives for individuals in Mexico.


# Mexico
## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
The Federal Tax Code provides that a person is a resident for Mexican tax purposes when that person establishes a home in Mexico. If the individual has a home in another country, then the individual is a resident of the country where the individual’s centre of vital interests is located. Under Mexican domestic tax law, a person’s centre of vital interests is considered located in Mexico if either (i) more than 50% of the person's income comes from Mexican sources in a calendar year or (ii) Mexico is the primary place of the person's professional activities.
Taxpayers are required to file a notice of suspension of activities for termination of tax residency in Mexico. The notice should be filed during the 15 days prior to the date on which the change of tax residency will take place. When individuals (or corporations) omit to submit such notice, they will not lose their status as Mexican residents.
A Mexican citizen who moves to a country that is considered a tax haven by Mexico will remain a tax resident of Mexico for the year in which the change of tax residency suspension notice is filed and the following five years, unless Mexico has in effect an information exchange agreement with the country or a tax treaty with an information exchange clause or an international treaty that enables mutual administrative assistance in the notification and collection of contributions.

## Social security contributions
Employee contributions to the Mexican Social Security Institute are withheld at source. The employer also makes contributions. Both contributions are calculated at varying rates and subject to various limits based on multiples of the UMA.
The maximum annual contribution for employees is MXN 28,057. The employer’s maximum annual contribution is MXN 207,892 (considering a low-risk company). The employer limit could be higher, considering that the employer's portion includes the occupational risk premium, which varies depending on the activity of the employer. These maximum contributions apply to employees earning more than MXN 1'031,689 per year (or MXN 85,974 per month).
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is payable at the general rate of 16% on sales of goods and services, as well as on lease payments and imports of goods and services. _See in the Corporate tax summary for more information_.
In the case of the northern border region, a tax credit of 50% on the VAT rate may apply, resulting in a rate of 8% instead of 16%.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Mexico.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There is no specific inheritance, estate, or gift tax in Mexico. Inheritances and gifts are treated as income under the income tax law but may be tax exempt as described below.
Income received by a Mexican resident through inheritance is exempt from income tax.
Income received as a result of a gift from a spouse, lineal ancestors, or lineal descendants is also exempt. However, gifts between siblings are not exempt, and gifts to parents are not exempt if the asset is later given or sold to a sibling of the original owner.
Other gifts are tax exempt, provided the gift does not exceed three times the annual UMA (MXN 123,821). Any portion of the gift exceeding this amount would be subject to income tax.
## Property taxes
Annual taxes on real property are levied by Mexico City and all the states at widely varying rates applied to values shown in the property tax records. 
## Payroll taxes
Most Mexican states levy a relatively low rate of tax on salaries (but not on income in general), which in most cases is payable by the employer. For example, Mexico City imposes a 4% payroll tax, but it is payable by the employer and constitutes a tax deductible expense for the employer.
