## Taxable period
The standard tax year is the calendar year, although different accounting year-ends can be granted upon application.
## Tax returns
CIT returns are to be filed annually by the last day of the third month following the year end.
Service tax, excise tax, sales tax, and WHT are to be filed monthly by the 15th day of the following month.
## Payment of tax
CIT due shall be settled to the Banking and Payments Authority or another entity nominated by the Timor-Leste Revenue Service by the date of filing (_see above_).
Service tax, excise tax, sales tax, and WHT should be settled to the Banking and Payments Authority or another entity nominated by the Timor-Leste Revenue Service by the 15th day after the end of the following month.
### Penalties
If a taxpayer fails to deliver the tax form on time, it shall be liable to an additional tax of USD 100. If a taxpayer fails to deliver all or part of any tax due by the due date, that taxpayer shall be liable to an additional tax of 5% of the amount due plus an additional 1% of the tax due on the 15th day of each month following the due date and:
  * if the failure was due to gross carelessness on the part of the person, further additional tax of 25% of the tax that remains unpaid, or
  * if the failure was due to a deliberate attempt to avoid payment of tax, further additional tax of 100% of the tax that remains unpaid.


If a taxpayer has understated the tax due in the tax form, that taxpayer shall be liable to an additional tax of 15% and:
  * if the understatement was due to gross carelessness on the part of the taxpayer, further additional tax of 25% of the tax understated, or
  * if the understatement was due to a deliberate attempt to avoid payment of tax, further additional tax of 100% of the tax understated.


## Tax audit process
Assessments may occur upon the following:
  * The delivery of a tax return form and payment.
  * After receipt of a return where the Commissioner believes a return is incorrect.
  * Where a taxpayer fails to file a return.


Assessments may be amended according to the following events:
  * By the taxpayer upon delivery to the Commissioner of an amended assessment.
  * Via a taxpayer request to the Commissioner.
  * Via specific amendment by the Commissioner.


## Statute of limitations
The Timor-Leste Revenue Service may issue an assessment notice or amend an assessment notice only within five years from the date of filing of the return. In the event of a deliberate tax evasion or fraud, there is no time limit for the issuance of an assessment notice.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Based on our experience, the Timor-Leste tax authorities are focussing on the timely remittance of the tax obligations. From an industry perspective, the oil and gas sector continues to be a focus. Finally, there have been numerous challenges of tax concessions granted on a contractual basis, including by government agencies.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 23 July 2024
The definition of a corporate resident (resident legal person) covers a wide range of entities, such as companies, partnerships, trusts, governmental institutions, and unincorporated associations incorporated, formed, organised, or established in Timor-Leste.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
A PE is defined as a fixed place of business through which the business of a person is wholly or partly carried on, including:
  * A place of management. 
  * A branch. 
  * A representative office. 
  * An office. 
  * A factory. 
  * A workshop. 
  * A mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry, or any other place of extraction of natural resources, including any place of drilling for mineral exploration. 
  * A fishery, place where animal husbandry is conducted, farm, plantation, or forest. 
  * A construction, installation, or assembly project. 
  * The furnishing of a service through employees or other personnel if conducted for more than 60 days in any 12-month period. 
  * A natural or legal person acting as a dependent agent. 
  * An agent or employee of a non-resident insurance company if the agent or employee collects premiums or insures risks in Timor-Leste. 




# Timor-Leste
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 23 July 2024
The taxable income of residents and non-residents who have a PE in Timor-Leste shall be determined on the basis of gross income reduced by:
  * expenditure and losses incurred from the alienation of assets or the discharge of debt in the conduct of a taxable business activity 
  * expenditure incurred in deriving any other amounts included in gross income 
  * any loss on disposal of an asset other than assets held on personal account 
  * contributions to an approved pension fund, and 
  * bad and doubtful debts (subject to various tests - _see Bad debts below_). 


## Depreciation and amortisation
'Depreciable assets' include any tangible movable property with a useful life exceeding one year that is wholly or partly used for taxable business activities. 'Intangible assets' include property, other than tangible movable property or immovable property, with a useful life exceeding one year that is used for taxable business activities.
There are provisions for election of either straight-line or double-declining methods, the pooling of assets, and _de minimis_ exceptions. However, the rate of tax depreciation/amortisation (for non-petroleum operations) is set at 100%, meaning that taxpayers are, in effect, entitled to a full and up-front deduction. In circumstances where the asset is only partly used for the conduct of taxable business activities, the deduction is reduced by the proportion of its non-taxable business use.
## Goodwill
There are no specific provisions dealing with the treatment of goodwill. We expect that the treatment should follow that under IFRS.
## Start-up expenses
There are no specific provisions dealing with the treatment of start-up expenses. However, assuming that the start-up expense is incurred to derive income, we expect that start-up expense should be deductible.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenditure is not deductible unless incurred by a financial institution.
## Bad debts
Bad debts are not deductible without passing all of the following tests:
  * The debt was previously included in taxable income. 
  * The debt was written off in the accounts during the relevant tax year. 
  * There are reasonable grounds for believing that the debt will not be recovered. 


The above tests do not apply to banks, which are entitled to deduct provisions for doubtful debt where determined in accordance with the prudential requirements prescribed by instruction of the Banking and Payments Authority.
## Charitable contributions
Donations are not deductible if the donations are exempt from income tax in the hands of the recipient.
## Fines and penalties
Penalties for violation of law and regulation are not deductible.
## Taxes
Timor-Leste or foreign income tax is not deductible.
## Deductions not allowed or conditional deductions
The following expenses are also not deductible to a resident or non-resident with a PE in Timor-Leste:
  * The distribution of profits in whatever name or form. 
  * Expenses incurred for the personal benefit of a taxpayer, a taxpayer’s dependents, shareholders, partners, or members. 
  * Reserves, other than as provided for under the TDA. 
  * Excessive compensation paid by a legal person to a member of the legal person, or paid between associates. 
  * Salaries paid to a partner in a partnership. 
  * A bribe, or any similar payment. 
  * Expenditure or losses incurred to the extent recoverable under an insurance policy or a contract of indemnities. 


## Net operating losses
Losses from previous years may be carried forward indefinitely. However, the carried forward loss from the disposal of assets may only be utilised against gains arising from the disposal of assets. Foreign-sourced losses may only be offset against foreign-sourced income of that particular country.
The carryback of losses is not allowed.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Excessive payments or compensation to ‘members of a legal person’ or payments between associates for work performed should not be deductible. The TDA, however, does not elaborate on the meaning of ‘excessive’.


# Timor-Leste
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 23 July 2024
Companies, etc. are taxable on a stand-alone basis (i.e. there is no grouping or ability to transfer tax losses).
## Transfer pricing
Excessive payments or compensation to ‘members of a legal person’ or payments between associates for work performed should not be deductible. The TDA, however, does not provide specific guidance on how to determine arm’s-length pricing on related-party transactions or any other general transfer pricing principles.
## Thin capitalisation
Currently, there are no ‘thin capitalisation’ or similar rules in Timor-Leste (noting that interest is not deductible, except for financial institutions).
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Timor-Leste does not have any CFC regulations.


# Timor-Leste
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 23 July 2024
The taxable income of a non-resident carrying out business activities through a PE is calculated by reference to:
  * the income attributable to the PE 
  * any sales of goods or merchandise of the same or similar kind as those sold through the PE, and 
  * any other business activities carried on in Timor-Leste of the same or similar kind as those effected through the PE. 


Other principles for determining the taxable income of a PE in Timor-Leste include the following:
  * Profit is calculated as if the PE was a Timor-Leste entity engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealt with wholly independently from the non-resident person of which it is a PE. 
  * Subject to this, deductions may be claimed for expenses incurred for the purposes of the business activities of the PE, including head office expenditures, whether incurred in Timor-Leste or elsewhere. 
  * No deductions may be claimed for amounts paid or payable by the PE to its head office or to another PE of the non-resident person, other than towards the reimbursement of actual expenses incurred by the non-resident person to third parties, by way of: 
    * royalties, fees, or other similar payments 
    * compensation for any services (including management services) provided to the PE, and 
    * interest on money lent to the PE (except for banking businesses).

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 23 July 2024
## Foreign tax credits
A resident taxpayer is entitled to a credit for any foreign income tax paid in respect of foreign-source income. The foreign tax credit is calculated separately for each foreign country from which income is derived by a taxpayer. The value of such tax credits is limited to the value of the Timor-Leste income tax payable on that income. There is no deduction or carryforward of any excess foreign tax credit.


# Timor-Leste
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 23 July 2024
WHT is imposed on the following payments by residents to a resident:
Type of payment | WHT rate (%) | Final/non-final tax  
---|---|---  
Dividends | 0 | Final  
Interest | 0 | Not final  
Royalties | 10 | Not final, except where paid to an individual  
Rent (land and building) | 10 | Not final, except where paid to an individual  
Prize and winnings | 10 | Final  
Construction/building activities | 2 | Final *  
Construction consulting services | 4 | Final *  
Air and sea transportation | 2.64 | Final *  
Mining and mining support services | 4.5 | Final *  
* The default position is that such amounts will be a final tax. The income recipient can elect to have these payments for services not subjected to final tax by submitting a notification letter to the Timor-Leste Revenue Service.
Payments of Timor-Leste-source income made by a resident to a non-resident are subject to WHT at 10%. Timor-Leste has entered into a double taxation treaty (DTT) with Portugal (although elements of DTT relief are also embedded in the Timor Sea Treaty [TST], _see Taxation of petroleum operations in the section_).
Where WHT is applied as a final tax, the taxed income is not included in the recipients’ taxable income for income tax purposes. Accordingly, expenses incurred in deriving income that is subject to final tax are not deductible for income tax purposes.

## Taxation of petroleum operations
The taxation of petroleum operations in Timor-Leste is partly covered by the TDA. However, the TDA operates only to modify the taxation of petroleum activities pursuant to a number of legacy tax regimes. These modifications apply to contractors, sub-contractors, and any other parties receiving income from the supply of goods or services to a contractor or sub-contractor.
A contractor is defined as a person with whom the responsible Ministry or Designated Authority, as the case may be, has made a petroleum agreement. A sub-contractor includes any person supplying goods or services directly or indirectly to a contractor in respect of petroleum operations.
Specific provisions for the taxation of petroleum operations include:
  * A CIT rate for contractors of 30% on taxable income, while sub-contractors will generally be taxed on a final WHT basis at a rate of 6% (_although see JPDA below_).
  * No tax on branch profit remittances (_although see JPDA below_).
  * Where 'net receipts' exceed specified levels, an SPT can apply.
  * The 'ring fencing' of income and expenditure within the contract area.
  * Modified deductibility rules, including around the deductibility of interest for contractors and a modified depreciation regime.
  * A specific WHT regime.
  * A specific transfer pricing and associated anti-avoidance provision.


## Special tax regime within certain maritime boundaries in the Timor Sea
On 6 March 2018, Timor-Leste and Australia signed a treaty permanently agreeing certain maritime boundaries in the Timor Sea (the MBT). The MBT was ratified by both countries in August 2019. The MBT succeeds the Timor Sea Treaty (TST) and the International Unitisation Agreement (IUA). The MBT results in the former JPDA, as well as territory covering a number of non-JPDA fields (e.g. Buffalo, parts of Greater Sunrise), falling under exclusive Timor-Leste control. As a result, Timor-Leste’s taxing rights in relation to the effected upstream activities have increased.
The MBT provides the following:
  * Permanently deals with the maritime boundary between Timor-Leste and Australia (although not necessarily third countries, such as Indonesia).
  * Establishes a Special Regime for the Greater Sunrise gas field. This includes revenue-sharing arrangements on the upstream revenue allocation, which will vary according to the development concept (essentially the location of the liquefaction facilities) ultimately chosen for the Greater Sunrise gas resource.


On 27 August 2019, Timor-Leste issued Law No.5/2019 (Law No. 5). Based upon an unofficial translation (of the Portuguese version), Law No. 5 operates to amend the following tax-related laws:
  * With regard to the Taxation of Bayu-Undan Contractors Act (ToBUCA), Law No. 5 provides that:
    * the VAT rate is formally reduced from 10% to 9% (per Article 3(4)(a))
    * the (Indonesian) 'estimated net income' upon which Article 23(1)(c)(2) WHT is based (including payments for 'drilling support services') is formally reduced by 90% (per Article 7(2))
    * the (Indonesian) Article 23(1)(a)(3) WHT that applies to payments for interest, dividends, royalties, etc. is formally reduced from 6% to 5.4% (per Article 8(1))
    * the (Indonesian) Article 4(2) WHT that applies to payments for construction and certain consulting services is formally reduced from 0.8% and 1.6% to 0.72% and 1.44%, respectively (per Article 8(2))
    * the (Indonesian) Article 26(1)(c) WHT that applies to payments of royalties, rent, etc. to non-residents is formally reduced from 8% to 7.2% (per Article 8(3))
    * the (Indonesian) Article 26(1)(d) WHT that applies to payments for services provided by non-residents is formally reduced from 8% to 7.2% (per Article 8(3)), and
    * the (Indonesian) Article 26(1)(d) WHT that applies to payments for dependent services by non-resident employees is formally reduced from 20% to 18% (per Article 8(4)).
  * With regard to the TDA, which represents the legislative framework for Timor-Leste’s general tax rules other than for the Bayu-Undan and Greater Sunrise Projects, a number of amendments are made so as to continue the 'ring fencing' of the Bayu-Undan and Greater Sunrise projects out of the TDA.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 23 July 2024
Taxable business profits are determined on the basis of net profit for financial accounting purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), subject to certain modifications in the Tax and Duties Act (TDA). In general, income is assessable when 'receivable', while expenses are deductible when 'payable'. A taxpayer with turnover of less than USD 100,000 may, however, elect to pay tax on a cash basis.
Gross income is defined widely to mean “any realised increase in economic capacity in whatever name or form which can be used for consumption or to increase the wealth of the taxpayer other than wages that are subject to Wages Income Tax (WIT)".
The gross income for a tax year is the total amount earned by the taxpayer, including, but not limited to, business income, property income, lottery prizes or awards, and refunds of tax payments previously deducted as an expense.
## Inventory valuation
There are no specific provisions dealing with inventory valuation in Timor-Leste. This is because a deduction is allowed for the cost of inventory incurred during the tax year even if the inventory is on hand at the end of the year.
## Capital gains
Gains and losses arising from the alienation of assets are generally assessable and deductible as ordinary income and subject to tax at the standard CIT rate.
## Dividend income
Dividends are tax exempt in the hands of Timor-Leste residents.
## Interest income
Interest income is generally assessable as ordinary income and subject to tax at the standard CIT rate.
## Royalty income
Royalty income is subject to a 10% WHT.
If the royalty payment is to a resident non-individual, the WHT is creditable for income tax purposes.
If the royalty payment is to an individual, the 10% WHT constitutes a final income tax.
## Exempted income
The following income is tax exempt:
  * Any aid or donations, provided that the donor and recipient do not have any business or control relationship. 
  * Gifts received by a religious, educational, or charitable organisation, provided that the donor and recipient do not have any business or control relationship. 
  * Assets (including cash) received by a resident in exchange for shares or a capital contribution. 
  * Any amount paid by an insurance company to a resident in connection with accident or life. 


## Foreign income
Under the worldwide income principle, a resident taxpayer is required to calculate income that is not only Timor-Leste sourced but also foreign sourced. In the case that the foreign-sourced income is taxed at source, Timor-Leste allows a foreign tax credit for the particular tax year (_see Foreign tax credit in the section_).
With regard to profits retained in controlled foreign companies (CFCs), Timor-Leste does not currently have any arrangements to otherwise deem the repatriation of the profit.


# Timor-Leste
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 23 July 2024
Timor-Leste residents are subject to income tax on worldwide taxable income, where taxable income is essentially the difference between gross income and allowable deductions. Non-residents are generally subject to income tax on Timor-Leste-source income attributed to a permanent establishment (PE) (_see the section for more information_). Non-residents without a PE may be subject to a 10% withholding tax (WHT) (_see the section for more information_).
The income of companies is generally subject to corporate income tax (CIT) at a flat rate of 10%.
## Industry-specific CIT rates
The rate of CIT for oil and gas contractors is 30%, while sub-contractors are subject to CIT at the flat rate of (generally) 6%.
Supplemental Petroleum Tax (SPT) also applies for oil and gas contractors and is imposed on 'accumulated net receipts' using a specific formula. SPT is deductible for CIT calculation purposes.
Separate tax arrangements apply for petroleum activities in the Joint Petroleum Development Area (JPDA) (_see the section_).
## Local income taxes
There are no municipal or local taxes on income in Timor-Leste.

Last reviewed - 23 July 2024
## Sales tax
Sales tax is imposed on the sales tax value of:
  * taxable goods imported into Timor-Leste and
  * taxable goods sold or taxable services provided in Timor-Leste on or after the date specified by Parliament.


Taxpayers liable for sales tax include the following:
  * A taxpayer who imports taxable goods into Timor-Leste.
  * A taxpayer who sells taxable goods in Timor-Leste.
  * A taxpayer who provides taxable services in Timor-Leste.


The rates of sales tax are 2.5% for taxable goods imported into Timor-Leste and 0% for the sale of taxable goods and provision of taxable services in Timor-Leste.
## Services tax
Services tax is imposed at 5% on any gross consideration of more than 500 United States dollars (USD) received by a taxpayer for the provision of hotel, restaurant and bar, or telecommunication services.
## Import duties
Import duty applies to imported goods (except for specifically exempted goods) at 5% of the 'customs value' of the goods. Customs value is the fair market value, including cost, insurance, and freight (CIF), as stated in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) rules.
The following goods are exempted from import duty:
  * Goods accompany a person arriving in Timor-Leste from another territory (limitations apply).
  * Imports of the type exempted under specific international conventions.
  * Goods re-imported in the same condition as when they were exported.
  * Goods, other than alcohol or tobacco, imported by registered charitable organisations, registered under any law of Timor-Leste, provided the goods are to be used for charitable purposes of humanitarian assistance and relief, education, or health care.
  * Other goods for temporary admission if the importer has provided security for the import duty in the prescribed manner.
  * Goods for consumption by international staff of the United Nations Integrated Mission in East Timor or members of peace keeping forces from contingent countries, provided the goods are sold in conformity with prescribed rules of sale.
  * Certain infant and female hygiene products.
  * Other goods imported into Timor-Leste as personal goods accompanying a traveller and where the import duty that would be imposed on the import would be USD 10 or less.


## Excise tax
Excise tax is imposed on excisable goods where removed from a warehouse by a registered manufacturer for consumption in Timor-Leste or imported into Timor-Leste.
Below is the list of excisable goods (not exhaustive) and the respective rates of excise tax:
Goods | Excise tax rate  
---|---  
Sugar and confectionery |  USD 1.00/kg  
Beer (with alcohol content less than 4.5%) |  USD 2.70/litre  
Beer (with alcohol content of 4.5% or more) |  USD 4.50/litre  
Wine, vermouth, fermented beverages (such as cider, perry) | USD 4.50/litre  
Ethyl alcohol (other than denatured) and other alcoholic beverages | USD 8.90/litre  
Gasoline, diesel fuel products, and other petroleum products | USD 0.06/litre  
Tobacco and tobacco products | USD 100.00/kg  
Cigarette lighters | 12% of the excise value  
Smoking pipes | 12% of the excise value  
Arms and ammunition | 200% of the excise value  
Motor cars and small passenger vehicles (with an excise value exceeding USD 50,000) | 30% of the excise value  
Private boats and aircraft | 20% of the excise value  
Note that the excise value of excisable goods imported into Timor-Leste is the total of the customs value and any import duty imposed. The excise value of excisable goods manufactured in Timor-Leste is their fair market value at the time of removal from the manufacturer's warehouse.
Goods on the above list are excisable goods, other than:
  * goods imported into Timor-Leste that are exempt from import duty, or
  * goods exported from Timor-Leste within 28 days after their production or import, as long as the taxpayer liable to excise tax submits to the Banking and Payments Authority documentary proof of the export of goods.


## Property taxes
There are no taxes on property in Timor-Leste.
## Transfer taxes
There are no transfer taxes in Timor-Leste.
## Stamp duties
There is no stamp duty in Timor-Leste.
## Payroll taxes
An employer paying taxable wages shall withhold Wage Income Tax (WIT) at a rate of 10% from those wages and remit the WIT on a monthly basis.
An annual WIT return is due by the last day of the March following the end of the relevant tax year. Information on WIT withheld must also be provided to each employee on an annual basis or on termination of employment.
## Social security contributions
A Social Security scheme was introduced in November 2016, with both employers and employees required to make contributions. The scheme provides cover for loss of income/benefits due to work-related accidents, maternity, old age, and death. It would appear that Social Security contributions should be deductible to employers. Implementing regulations for this scheme should be closely monitored.
