## Foreign tax relief
A resident taxpayer is entitled to a credit for any foreign income tax paid in respect of foreign-source income. The foreign tax credit is calculated separately for each foreign country from which income is derived by a taxpayer. The value of such tax credits is limited to the value of the Timor-Leste income tax payable on that income. There is no deduction or carryforward of any excess foreign tax credit.
## Tax treaties
Timor-Leste is understood to have only entered into a tax treaty with Portugal.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 23 July 2024
Timor-Leste residents are taxable on a worldwide income basis, while non-residents are taxable only on the income sourced from Timor-Leste. Residents earning foreign-sourced income may receive a foreign tax credit (_see the section_).
Timor-Leste individual taxpayers are subject to income tax on their taxable income, which is essentially the difference between gross income (other than from employment, _see Wage Income Tax [WIT] below_) and allowable deductions.
## Personal income tax rates
The income tax rates applicable for a resident individual taxpayer are as follows:
Annual taxable income (USD*) | Income tax rate (%)  
---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 6,000 | 0  
6,000 | 10  
* United States dollars
The income tax rate for taxable income earned by a non-resident individual is 10% (flat rate) for all Timor-Leste sourced taxable income.
## Wage Income Tax (WIT)
WIT is imposed on taxable wages received by an employee in Timor-Leste who is in employment in Timor-Leste. Employment in Timor-Leste is described as services performed in Timor-Leste or performed by an employee of the government of Timor-Leste, irrespective of where the services take place.
The WIT rates are as follows:
Annual taxable income (USD) | WIT rate (%)  
---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 500 | 0  
500 | 10  
Wages paid to employees who are non-residents of Timor-Leste are taxed at a flat rate of 10% (i.e. with no tax-free threshold). Wages are taxable whether provided in a cash or non-cash form.
Wages exempt from WIT are as follows:
  * Wages received for official duties that are exempt from taxation under the Law.
  * Wages of an employee who is a citizen of a foreign country received in the employee’s capacity as a government employee of a foreign country, provided the wages are subject to income tax in that country.
  * Wages of an employee who is an employee of the United Nations or its specialised agencies.
  * Wages received by an individual that are financed from the Trust Fund for East Timor.


An employer paying taxable wages shall withhold WIT from those wages, using the tax rates as provided, and remit the WIT on a monthly basis.
If an employee receives wages that have been correctly subject to WIT, then no further WIT or income tax liability exists with respect to those wages.
An annual WIT return is due by the last day of March of the following the end of the relevant tax year. Information on WIT withheld must also be provided to each employee on an annual basis or on termination of employment.

## Tax returns
An individual who derives income from business activities is required to lodge an Annual Income Tax Return by the last day of the third month of the following year.
An individual who receives income only from wages that have been correctly subject to WIT is not required to submit an Annual Income Tax Return.
## Payment of tax
An individual who is required to settle income tax is required to do so by the due date of the tax returns (i.e. the last day of the third month of the following year).
## Statute of limitations
The Timor-Leste tax authority may issue an assessment notice or amend an assessment notice only within five years from the date of filing of the return. In the event of a deliberate tax evasion or fraud, there is no time limit for the issuance of an assessment notice.
Assessments may occur upon the following:
  * The delivery of a tax return form and payment.
  * After receipt of a return where the Commissioner believes a return is incorrect.
  * Where a taxpayer fails to file a return.


Assessments may be amended according to the following events:
  * By the taxpayer upon delivery to the Commissioner of an amended assessment.
  * Via a taxpayer request to the Commissioner.
  * Via specific amendment by the Commissioner.

## Taxation of petroleum operations
The taxation of petroleum operations in Timor-Leste is partly covered by the TDA. However, the TDA operates only to modify the taxation of petroleum activities pursuant to a number of legacy tax regimes. These modifications apply to contractors, sub-contractors, and any other parties receiving income from the supply of goods or services to a contractor or sub-contractor.
Specific provisions for the taxation of petroleum operations include a personal income tax (PIT) rate of 30% for residents or 20% for non-residents.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 23 July 2024
## Employment income
_See Wage Income Tax (WIT) in the section._
### Equity compensation
There are no special rules at present for equity compensation.
## Business income
Taxable business profits are determined on the basis of net profits for financial accounting purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), subject to certain modifications in the TDA. In general, income is assessable when 'receivable', while expenses are deductible when 'payable'. A taxpayer with turnover of less than USD 100,000 may, however, elect to pay tax on a cash basis.
Gross income is defined widely to mean ’any realised increase in economic capacity in whatever name or form which can be used for consumption or to increase the wealth of the taxpayer other than wages that are subject to WIT’.
The gross income for a tax year is the total amount earned by the taxpayer, including, but not limited to, business income, property income, lottery prizes or awards, and refunds of tax payments previously deducted as an expense.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are treated as business income.
## Dividend income
Dividend income is tax exempt (_see Exempt income below_).
## Interest income
Interest income is treated as business income.
## Rental income
An individual paying rent is not required to withhold tax. Instead, the rental payment recipient is required to 'withhold' tax at 10% from the gross amount received.
## Exempt income
The following income is tax exempt:
  * Any aid or donations, provided the donor and recipient do not have any business or control relationship. 
  * Gifts received by relatives within one degree of direct lineage, or by a religious, educational, or charitable organisation, provided that the donor and recipient do not have any business relation or control relationship. 
  * Inheritance. 
  * Assets (including cash) received by a resident in exchange for shares or a capital contribution. 
  * Any amount paid by an insurance company to a resident in connection with health, accident, life, or education. 
  * Dividends. 
  * Any contribution paid by an employer or employee to an approved pension fund. 
  * Income derived by an approved pension fund. 
  * Remuneration received for services provided by a natural person (individual) if the remuneration is financed out of the Trust Fund for East Timor.
