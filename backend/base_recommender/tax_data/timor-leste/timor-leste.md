# Timor-Leste
## Overview
Last reviewed - 23 July 2024
Timor-Leste is located in Southeast Asia, on the eastern half of Timor Island (400 miles northwest of Darwin, Australia). The western half of Timor Island is part of Indonesia.
Timor-Leste (previously known as East Timor) was declared an Indonesian province in 1975 (previously colonised by Portugal). In 1999, Indonesia relinquished control of the territory, and Timor-Leste started the process to become an independent country. Timor-Leste officially became a sovereign state on 20 May 2002.
Timor-Leste is a democratic republic with a unitary parliamentary democracy with Dili as its capital city. Timor-Leste’s official languages are Tetum and Portuguese, although English and Indonesian are commonly used in business practice.
The currency of Timor-Leste is the United States dollar (USD) based on a declaration of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) in 2000.
Timor-Leste’s main exports are liquefied natural gas, coffee, sandalwood, and marble, while its main imported goods are food, gasoline, kerosene, and machinery.
PwC does not have a permanent office offering tax services in Timor-Leste. However, PwC Indonesia has a dedicated team responsible for providing consulting services relating to Timor-Leste tax issues.
