## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 10 December 2024
## Foreign tax relief
Relief for foreign taxes in the Canadian system is accomplished through a tax credit and deduction mechanism. A foreign tax credit of up to 15% for any foreign tax withheld at source on property income (other than income from real property) is allowed, although the credit cannot exceed Canadian tax payable on the foreign income. When the foreign tax exceeds 15% of the income, the excess foreign taxes may be allowed as a deduction from the property income. This provision can have adverse implications for foreign citizens who have foreign property income and live in Canada.
Foreign social security taxes, other than United States (US) social security taxes paid under the United States Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), generally do not qualify as non-business income taxes for foreign tax credit purposes.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 10 December 2024
Canada's individual tax summary reflects all 2024 federal, provincial, and territorial budgets. The summary is based on enacted and proposed legislation and assumes that the proposed legislation will become law. Generally, budget proposals and draft legislation are enacted into law, even with a minority federal government, which is currently the case. _For more details of the proposed new individual tax measures noted in the summary, see our Tax Insights on the 2024 federal budget at ._
## Capital gains inclusion rate
Draft legislative proposals increase the capital gains inclusion rate from one half to two thirds for the portion of capital gains realised by individuals after 24 June 2024 that exceeds an annual 250,000 Canadian dollars (CAD) threshold. _See Capital gains in the_ _section and our Tax Insights 'Finance releases draft legislation to increase the capital gains inclusion rate' (28 August 2024 update) at for more information._
## Canadian Entrepreneurs' Incentive
Draft legislative proposals introduce the Canadian Entrepreneurs' Incentive, which will reduce the taxes on capital gains from the disposition of certain shares of a small business corporation owned directly by an eligible individual. _See Canadian Entrepreneurs' Incentive in the_ _section for more information._
## Alternative minimum tax for high-income individuals
For taxation years that begin after 2023, recently enacted legislation increases the alternative minimum tax rate and exemption and broaden its calculation base. _See Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) in the_ _section and our Tax Insights ‘Changes to the alternative minimum tax are enacted: How will it affect individuals and trusts starting 2024?' at for more information._
## Reporting requirements for trusts
New tax return filing and information reporting requirements for trusts have come into effect for taxation years that end after 30 December 2023. The new rules require trustees to gather and report significantly more information; the filing deadline for a trust with a 31 December 2023 taxation year-end was 2 April 2024. However, for the 2023 and 2024 taxation years, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) does not require 'bare trust' arrangements to file this return, unless the CRA makes a direct request for it. Draft legislative proposals (i) reduce the number of trusts, including bare trust arrangements, that would need to file a trust return (and report certain additional information), and (ii) defer the start of the revised bare trust filing requirement until the 2025 taxation year. _See Reporting requirements for trusts in the section and our Tax Insights 'Finance proposes to reduce the scope of the enhanced trust reporting rules' (1 November 2024 update) at for more information_ _._

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 10 December 2024
Individuals resident in Canada are subject to Canadian income tax on worldwide income. Relief from double taxation is provided through Canada's international tax treaties, as well as via foreign tax credits and deductions for foreign taxes paid on income derived from non-Canadian sources.
Non-resident individuals are subject to Canadian income tax on income from employment in Canada, income from carrying on a business in Canada and capital gains from the disposition of taxable Canadian property.
Individuals resident in Canada for only part of a year are taxable in Canada on worldwide income only for the period during which they were resident.
Personal tax credits, miscellaneous tax credits, and the dividend tax credit are subtracted from tax to determine the federal tax liability.
## Personal income tax rates
2024 federal tax rates are as follows:
Federal taxable income (CAD) | Tax on first column (CAD) | Tax on excess (%)  
---|---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 55,867 | 0 | 15.0  
55,867 | 111,733 | 8,380 | 20.5  
111,733 | 173,205 | 19,833 | 26.0  
173,205 | 246,752 | 35,815 | 29.0  
246,752 | 57,144 | 33.0  
## Provincial/territorial income taxes
In addition to federal income tax, an individual who resides in, or has earned income in, any province or territory is subject to provincial or territorial income tax. Except in Quebec, provincial and territorial taxes are calculated on the federal return and collected by the federal government. Rates vary among the jurisdictions. Two provinces also impose surtaxes that may increase the provincial income taxes payable. Provincial and territorial taxes are not deductible when computing federal, provincial, or territorial taxable income.
All provinces and territories compute income tax using 'tax-on-income' systems (i.e. they set their own rates, brackets, and credits). All except Quebec use the federal definition of taxable income.
The following table shows the top 2024 provincial/territorial tax rates and surtaxes. The provincial/territorial tax rates are applicable starting at the taxable income levels shown below. Surtax rates apply to provincial tax above the surtax thresholds shown.
Recipient | Provincial/territorial tax | Provincial/territorial surtax  
---|---|---  
Top rate (%) | Taxable income (CAD) | Rate (%) | Threshold (CAD)  
Alberta | 15.0 | 355,845 | N/A | N/A  
British Columbia | 20.5 | 252,752 | N/A | N/A  
Manitoba | 17.4 | 100,000 | N/A | N/A  
New Brunswick | 19.5 | 185,064 | N/A | N/A  
Newfoundland and Labrador | 21.8 |  1,103,478 | N/A | N/A  
Northwest Territories | 14.05 | 164,525 | N/A | N/A  
Nova Scotia | 21.0 | 150,000 | N/A | N/A  
Nunavut | 11.5 | 173,205 | N/A | N/A  
Ontario | 13.16 | 220,000 | 20 and 36 | 5,554 and 7,108  
Prince Edward Island | 18.75 | 140,000 | N/A | N/A  
Quebec (1) | 25.75 | 126,000 | N/A | N/A  
Saskatchewan | 14.5 | 148,734 | N/A | N/A  
Yukon | 15.0 | 500,000 | N/A | N/A  
Non-resident | 15.84 (2) | 246,752 | N/A | N/A  
Notes
  1. Quebec has its own personal tax system, which requires a separate calculation of taxable income. Recognising that Quebec collects its own tax, federal income tax is reduced by 16.5% of basic federal tax for Quebec residents.
  2. Instead of provincial or territorial tax, non-residents pay an additional 48% of basic federal tax on income taxable in Canada that is not earned in a province or territory. Non-residents are subject to provincial or territorial rates on employment income earned, and business income connected with a permanent establishment (PE), in the respective province or territory. Different rates may apply to non-residents in other circumstances. 


Combined federal/provincial (or federal/territorial) effective top marginal tax rates for 2024 are shown below. The rates reflect all 2024 federal, provincial, and territorial budgets (which are usually introduced in the spring of each year). The rates include all provincial/territorial surtaxes, and apply to taxable incomes above CAD 246,752 in all jurisdictions except:
  * CAD 355,845 in Alberta.
  * CAD 252,752 in British Columbia.
  * CAD 1,103,478 in Newfoundland and Labrador.
  * CAD 500,000 in Yukon.

Recipient | Highest federal/provincial (or territorial) tax rate (%)  
---|---  
Interest and ordinary income | Capital gains (1) | Canadian dividends  
Eligible (2) | Non-eligible (2)  
Alberta | 48.0 | 24.0 | 34.3 | 42.3  
British Columbia | 53.5 | 26.8 | 36.5 | 48.9  
Manitoba | 50.4 | 25.2 | 37.8 | 46.7  
New Brunswick | 52.5 | 26.3 | 32.4 | 46.8  
Newfoundland and Labrador | 54.8 | 27.4 | 46.2 | 49.0  
Northwest Territories | 47.1 | 23.5 | 28.3 | 36.8  
Nova Scotia | 54.0 | 27.0 | 41.6 | 48.3  
Nunavut | 44.5 | 22.3 | 33.1 | 37.8  
Ontario | 53.5 | 26.8 | 39.3 | 47.7  
Prince Edward Island | 51.8 | 25.9 | 36.2 | 47.6  
Quebec | 53.3 | 26.7 | 40.1 | 48.7  
Saskatchewan | 47.5 | 23.8 | 29.6 | 41.3  
Yukon | 48.0 | 24.0 | 28.9 | 44.0  
Non-resident (3) | 48.8 | 24.4 | 36.7 | 40.8  
Notes
  1. As a result of draft legislative proposals, which increase the capital gains inclusion rate from one half to two thirds, effective 25 June 2024, for a portion of realised capital gains exceeding a threshold (_see Capital gains in the section for more information_), the top marginal capital gains rates in the table will be 33 1/3% higher for the portion of any capital gains realised after 24 June 2024 that exceeds an annual CAD 250,000 threshold (e.g. Alberta's top capital gains rate will be 32% [24% x 1 1/3]). 
  2. _See Dividend income in the section for more information on eligible and non-eligible dividends_.
  3. Non-resident rates for interest and dividends apply only in limited circumstances. Generally, interest (other than most interest paid to arm's-length non-residents) and dividends paid to non-residents are subject to Canadian withholding tax (WHT).


## Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)
In addition to the normal tax computation, individuals are required to compute an adjusted taxable income and include certain 'tax preference' items that are otherwise deductible or exempt in the calculation of regular taxable income. If the adjusted taxable income exceeds the minimum tax exemption, a combined federal and provincial/territorial tax rate is applied to the excess, yielding the AMT. The taxpayer then pays the greater of regular tax or the AMT. Taxpayers required to pay the AMT are entitled to a credit for the AMT paid, which can be applied in any of the following seven years to reduce their regular tax liability in excess of their AMT level for that year.
Recently enacted legislation changes the federal AMT calculation, effective for taxation years beginning after 2023, by:
  * increasing the federal AMT rate from 15% to 20.5% and the AMT exemption from CAD 40,000 to the start of the second from top federal tax bracket (i.e. CAD 173,205 in 2024; indexed thereafter)
  * broadening the AMT base through changes to the ‘tax preference’ inclusions in the AMT adjusted taxable income calculation, and
  * allowing only 50% of most non-refundable tax credits to reduce AMT (however, individuals can claim 80% of the charitable donations tax credit).


## Kiddie tax
A minor child that receives certain passive income under an income splitting arrangement is subject to tax at the highest combined federal/provincial (or territorial) marginal rate (i.e. up to 55%), referred to as 'kiddie tax'. Personal tax credits, other than the dividend, disability, and foreign tax credits, or other deductions cannot be claimed to reduce the kiddie tax.
## ‘Income sprinkling’
‘Income sprinkling’ (i.e. shifting income that would otherwise be realised by a high-tax individual [e.g. through dividends or capital gains] to low or nil tax rate family members) using private corporations is restricted by making certain aspects of the ‘kiddie tax’ rules (_see above_) also apply to adults in certain situations. The ‘split income’ of the adult family member will be subject to tax at the highest combined federal/provincial (or territorial) marginal rate (i.e. up to 55%). Personal tax credits, other than the dividend, disability, and foreign tax credits, or other deductions cannot be claimed to reduce this tax.


# Canada
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 10 December 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year for an individual in Canada is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
In most cases, taxpayers must file tax returns by 30 April of the following year. Married taxpayers file separately; joint returns are not allowed. The filing deadline is extended to 15 June if the individual, or the individual's spouse, carried on an unincorporated business. There is no provision for any extension of these filing deadlines, unless they fall on a weekend, in which case the filing deadline is usually extended to the next business day.
Residents in Canada who own foreign investment properties whose total cost exceeds CAD 100,000 must file an information return (Form T1135) each year they own such properties. Exceptions apply to certain types of assets, such as those held in a foreign pension plan. The filing deadline is the same as for the individual tax return. If the total cost of the taxpayer’s foreign property is less than CAD 250,000 throughout the taxation year, the taxpayer can report the property using the streamlined information reporting requirements on Form T1135.
Individuals are also required to file an information report for certain assets held at the time they cease to be a Canadian resident if the total market value of the assets exceeds CAD 25,000. This report must be filed with the Canadian tax return for the year that they cease residency. This reporting is separate from the reporting of assets subject to deemed disposition upon the cessation of Canadian residence.
## Payment of tax
Income tax is withheld from salaries. Any balance of tax owed is due 30 April of the following year. Individuals are required to pay quarterly instalments if their tax payable exceeds amounts withheld at source by more than CAD 3,000 (CAD 1,800 for Quebec residents) in both the current and either of the two previous years. Effective 1 January 2024, individuals must make all tax payments or remittances of more than CAD 10,000 to the Receiver General for Canada electronically, except in special circumstances that preclude it.
## Tax audit process
The tax authorities are required to issue an assessment notice within a reasonable time following the filing of a tax return. These original assessments usually are based on a limited review of the individual's income tax return with the notice of assessment explaining any changes made to the return. The CRA may later request additional information or supporting documents for personal deductions claimed. Returns become statute-barred three years after the date of the notice of assessment unless misrepresentation or gross negligence is involved.
The CRA typically does not select salaried employees for audit unless the individual is also involved in a tax shelter or business venture. Self-employed individuals are selected randomly, after considering various factors, such as the individual's business and the type and amount of expenses claimed. Individual shareholders of CCPCs are selected based on the activities of and income reported from the corporation and the individual's transactions with related entities, including trusts and partnerships. To address specific compliance concerns, the CRA is targeting certain individuals and their families who hold interests in privately held domestic and offshore entities that have a value exceeding CAD 50 million.
CRA officials have the authority to require persons to answer questions in any form specified by them, and to provide reasonable assistance for any purpose related to the administration or enforcement of the relevant statute. 
### Appeals
A taxpayer who disagrees with a tax assessment or reassessment may appeal. The first step is to file a formal notice of objection within 90 days from the date of mailing of the notice of assessment or reassessment, setting out the reasons for the objection and other relevant information. The deadline is one year from the due date of the return for the taxation year in issue, if this is later, for ordinary income tax and in other specific instances. The CRA will review the notice of objection and vacate (cancel), amend, or confirm the assessment. A taxpayer that still disagrees has 90 days to appeal the CRA's decision to the Tax Court of Canada. Further appeals can be made to the Federal Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada. However, the Supreme Court seldom hears income tax appeals.
## Statute of limitations
A reassessment can be issued at any time within three years of the date of mailing of the original notice of assessment, or at any later time if the taxpayer signs a waiver of the three-year limit or if the tax authorities can prove fraud or misrepresentation in the return. 'Misrepresentation' can include neglect or carelessness as well as wilful default. The limit is extended a further three years in some cases (e.g. for transactions with non-arm's-length non-residents).
The CRA can reassess tax, after the end of the normal reassessment period, on a gain from the disposition of real or immovable property if the taxpayer does not initially report the disposition.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Although CRA audits generally focus on non-salaried employees, individuals may be subjected to audit with regard to the following issues:
  * Income versus capital gain issues relating to transactions involving the acquisition or disposition of investments and real estate.
  * Deductions claimed against employment income.
  * Charitable donations.
  * Creation of trusts in provinces with lower tax rates.
  * The conversion of: 
    * dividends into capital gains using corporate surplus stripping arrangements, or
    * ordinary income into capital gains using derivative contracts.
  * Intergenerational business transfers.
  * Strategies that comply with Canada's tax laws but contravene its intention.
  * Taxable benefits related to employment (e.g. personal use of corporate-owned aircraft, automobiles, and dwellings).


### Failure to withhold tax for non-resident employees
Canadian tax authorities continue to focus their audit activity on employers who fail to withhold tax or apply for a treaty waiver from Regulation 102 withholding for commuters and business travellers. Under this regulation, employers (whether residents of Canada or not) that pay salaries or wages or other remuneration to a non-resident of Canada in respect of employment services rendered in Canada are required to withhold personal income tax unless a waiver has been received before commencing work physically in Canada. There are no '_de minimis_ ' exceptions, and this requirement applies regardless of whether the non-resident employee in question will actually be liable for Canadian income tax on that salary pursuant to an income tax treaty that Canada has signed with another country. Complying is time-consuming and administratively burdensome.
An amount paid by a ‘qualifying non-resident employer’ to a ‘qualifying non-resident employee’ is exempt from the Regulation 102 withholding requirement.
Generally, a ‘qualifying non-resident employer’ must meet the following two conditions:
  * Is resident in a country with which Canada has a tax treaty (‘treaty country’).
  * Is at that time certified by the Minister.


A ‘qualifying non-resident employee’ must meet the following three conditions:
  * Is resident in a treaty country.
  * Is exempt from Canadian income tax under a tax treaty.
  * Either: 
    * is present in Canada for less than 90 days in any 12-month period that includes the time of payment, or
    * works in Canada for less than 45 days in the calendar year that includes the time of payment.


To become certified, a non-resident employer must file Form RC473 (Application for Non-Resident Employer Certification) with the CRA. Certification is valid for two calendar years (after which time the employer must submit a new Form RC473), subject to revocation if the employer fails to meet certain conditions or to comply with its Canadian tax obligations.
The conditions to maintain non-resident employer certification include:
  * Track and record on a proactive basis the number of days each qualifying non-resident employee is either working in Canada or present in Canada, and the income attributable to these days.
  * Evaluate and determine whether its employees meet the conditions of a ‘qualifying non-resident employee’.
  * Obtain a Canadian Business Number.
  * Complete and file the annual T4 Summary and slips, if required.
  * File the applicable Canadian corporate income tax returns if the corporation is ‘carrying on business in Canada’.
  * Upon request, make its books and records available to the CRA for inspection.


### Tax planning using private corporations
Canada has enacted legislation to combat tax advantages for high income individuals, gained through the use of private corporations. Income sprinkling (i.e. shifting income that would otherwise be realised by a high-tax rate individual [e.g. through dividends or capital gains] to low or nil tax rate family members) using private corporations has been restricted. The legislation provides some clarity on whether a family member is to be considered significantly involved in a business, and thus potentially exempted from being taxed automatically at the highest marginal tax rate on non-salary income or gains derived from that business. However, the legislation is also extremely complex when applied to typical business structures. This creates uncertainty for many business owners, without any grandfathering for current income splitting arrangements. The CRA has issued some guidance on the potential application of the rules through a number of example scenarios.
Retaining business income in a CCPC to earn income on passive investments is discouraged by:
  * reducing the annual CAD 500,000 small business deduction limit, for a CCPC that (together with associated CCPCs) earned more than CAD 50,000 of passive investment income in the preceding year, by CAD 5 for every CAD 1 of investment income over CAD 50,000 (it is eliminated at CAD 150,000 of investment income), and
  * entitling a CCPC to a refund of taxes paid on certain investment income only by paying ‘non-eligible’ taxable dividends, which are subject to a higher effective tax rate when received by a shareholder that is an individual.


## Tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance
In recent years, the federal government has made significant investments to strengthen the CRA's ability to unravel complex tax schemes and increase collaboration with international partners. Initiatives that have been introduced include:
  * Increasing the number of CRA annual examinations of high-risk wealthy taxpayers.
  * Increasing 12-fold the number of transactions examined by the CRA.
  * Creating a special CRA program to stop 'the organisations that create and promote tax schemes for the wealthy'.
  * Hiring additional auditors and specialists with a focus on the underground economy.
  * Developing robust business intelligence infrastructure and risk assessment systems to target high-risk international tax and abusive tax avoidance cases.


Previously implemented tax measures to help the CRA combat international tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance follow:
  * Certain financial intermediaries are required to report to the CRA international electronic funds transfers (EFTs) of CAD 10,000 or more. 
  * The ‘Offshore Tax Informant Program’ compensates certain persons who provide information that leads to the assessment or reassessment of over CAD 100,000 in federal tax.
  * Failure to timely file Form T1135 (Foreign Income Verification Statement), or to report all specified foreign property therein, will extend the normal reassessment period for this form by three years.


The CRA has maintained a steady inventory of over 1,000 offshore audits for the past few years. The government is also aggressively pursuing those who promote tax avoidance schemes, imposing penalties on these third parties. In addition, the CRA continues to receive calls from potential informants and written submissions under the Offshore Tax Informant Program, which has resulted in additional taxpayers being audited by the CRA. Quebec also has a similar program, the 'Reward Program for Informants of Transactions Covered by the General Anti-Avoidance Rule and Sham Transactions.'
The federal government has made recent investments to:
  * Assist with the implementation of a publicly accessible corporate beneficial ownership registry to be used by law enforcement, tax, and other authorities to access accurate and up-to-date information on the individuals who own and control corporations and to catch those who attempt to launder money, evade taxes, or commit other financial crimes.
  * Further combat tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance, allowing the CRA to fund new initiatives and extend existing programs, including: 
    * Increasing GST/HST audits of large businesses with the greatest risk of non-compliance.
    * Modernising the CRA's risk assessment process to prevent unwarranted and fraudulent GST/HST refund and rebate claims and improve the ability to issue refunds to compliant businesses as quickly as possible.
    * Enhancing capacity to identify tax evasion involving trusts and provide better service to executors and trustees.
  * Improve the CRA's ability to collect outstanding tax debts in a timely way.
  * Implement new technologies, tools, and IT infrastructure that match the growing sophistication of cyber threats and to improve the way benefits and services are delivered to Canadians.


The CRA has also focused audit efforts on addressing non-compliance in real estate transactions, particularly in the Vancouver and Toronto markets, by improving its tools and methods of obtaining more specific and useful information to enhance its ability to combat tax avoidance. Over the past several years, CRA audits have identified significant additional taxes related to the real estate sector and have assessed related penalties. Areas of specific focus include property flipping, pre-construction assignment sales, rental income from the real estate sharing economy, unreported GST/HST on the sale of a new or substantially renovated property, unreported capital gains, and unreported worldwide income. The CRA has created dedicated residential and commercial real estate audit teams in high-risk regions to ensure that tax rules relating to real estate are being followed. _See Property flipping in the section for details of new rules to ensure that profits from flipping properties are taxed fully and fairly_.
The 2022 federal budget made a five-year commitment to:
  * Launch and lead a financial sector legislative review focused on the digitalisation of money and maintaining financial sector stability and security, with the first phase directed at digital currencies (including targeted consultations on crypto-assets; in November 2023, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions launched a consultation on the public disclosure of crypto-asset exposures by federally regulated financial institutions in Canada).
  * Expand CRA audits of larger entities and non-residents engaged in aggressive tax planning.


The 2024 federal budget proposes changes that would ensure that CRA officials who carry out criminal investigations are authorised to seek general warrants through court applications to help fight tax evasion and other financial crimes.
## Mandatory disclosure rules
To facilitate the timely receipt by the CRA of information on arrangements that involve aggressive tax planning, Canada's mandatory disclosure rules have been enhanced by:
  * changing the Income Tax Act’s existing reportable transaction rules
  * introducing requirements to report ‘notifiable transactions’ and for specified corporations to report uncertain tax treatments
  * extending the reassessment period in certain circumstances, and
  * introducing penalties for non-compliance that will apply to both taxpayers and promoters or advisers.


### Reportable transactions
Previous rules in the Income Tax Act required the reporting of a transaction to the CRA if it was considered an ‘avoidance transaction,’ as that term is defined for the purposes of the general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR), and it met at least two of three defined hallmarks. This resulted in only limited reporting by taxpayers.
To improve the effectiveness of the reportable transactions rules and to bring them in line with international best practices, the updated rules require that only one of the hallmarks be present for a transaction to be reportable. They also amend the definition of ‘avoidance transaction’ for these purposes so that the rules apply if it can reasonably be concluded that one of the main purposes of entering into the transaction is to obtain a tax benefit. Additional amendments deal with promoters or advisers who promote these transactions and require them to also disclose these transactions.
### Notifiable transactions
A new category of specific transactions, known as ‘notifiable transactions’, give the Minister of National Revenue, with the concurrence of the Minister of Finance, the authority to designate a transaction as a notifiable transaction. Similar to the approach taken by the United States, notifiable transactions include both transactions that the CRA has found to be abusive and transactions identified as transactions of interest. The description of a notifiable transaction sets out the fact patterns or outcomes that constitute that transaction in sufficient detail to enable taxpayers to comply with the disclosure rule. Effective 1 November 2023, five types of transactions have been officially designated as 'notifiable transactions'.
### Effective date
The changes to the existing 'reportable transaction' rules in the Income Tax Act and new requirement for taxpayers to report 'notifiable transactions' are effective for transactions entered into after 21 June 2023. The requirement for 'specified corporations' to report 'uncertain tax treatments' is effective for taxation years beginning after 2022.
## Tax debt avoidance
Although the income tax rules contain an anti-avoidance provision that is intended to prevent taxpayers from avoiding their tax liabilities by transferring assets to non-arm’s-length persons for insufficient consideration, an additional anti-avoidance rule, for the purposes of the existing tax debt avoidance rules, deems a tax debt to have arisen before the end of the taxation year in which the transfer of property occurs if certain conditions are met, and may, in certain cases, deem a transferor and transferee to be dealing on a non-arm’s length basis at the time of the transfer. Finally, where the transfer of property was part of a series of transactions or events, the overall result of the series would be considered in determining the values of the property transferred and the consideration given for the property**,** instead of simply using the values at the time of the transfer.
## Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement (J5)
Senior officials from the CRA and tax enforcement authorities in Australia, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States are members of a joint operational group, called the J5. The J5 was formed to increase collaboration in the fight against international and transnational tax crime and money laundering. The group focuses on building international enforcement capacity by sharing information and intelligence, enhancing operational capability by piloting new approaches, and conducting joint operations.
## Voluntary Disclosures Program (VDP)
In certain circumstances, penalties for non-compliance with tax reporting and payment requirements may be waived through an application to the CRA's VDP. The taxpayer must meet five conditions to qualify for the programme. The application must:
  * be voluntary
  * be complete
  * involve the application or potential application of a penalty
  * include information that is at least one year past due, and
  * include payment of the estimated tax owing.


Key aspects of the VDP include:
  * two 'tracks' of disclosures: 
    * a Limited Program when there is intentional conduct to be non-compliant or for corporations with gross revenue exceeding CAD 250 million in at least two of their last five taxation years and any related entities; requires participants to waive their right to object and appeal in respect of the issue disclosed, and
    * a General Program when the Limited Program does not apply.
  * pre-disclosure discussion service
  * referral of transfer pricing applications to the Transfer Pricing Review Committee (therefore no relief will be granted under the VDP)
  * specialist review of complex issues or large dollar amounts
  * disclosure of the identity of an adviser who assisted the taxpayer in respect of the non-compliance, and
  * cancellation of previous relief if a VDP application was incomplete due to misrepresentation.


VDP relief is not considered for applications that depend on an agreement being made at the discretion of the Canadian competent authority under a tax treaty provision. If a VDP application does not qualify for VDP relief, a taxpayer may still qualify for penalty and interest relief under the taxpayer relief provisions.
## Sharing information for criminal matters
The CRA can use the legal tools available under the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act to facilitate the sharing of information related to tax offences under Canada’s tax treaties, TIEAs and the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters; these tools include the ability for the Attorney General to obtain court orders to gather and send information.
Tax information can be shared with Canadian mutual legal assistance partners for acts that, if committed in Canada, would constitute terrorism, organised crime, money laundering, criminal proceeds offences, or designated substance offences.
## Quebec ‘Tax Fairness Action Plan’
Quebec's ‘Tax Fairness Action Plan’, contains actions that address tax havens, aggressive tax planning, transfer pricing, and e-commerce with suppliers having no significant presence in Quebec, among other things. Many of the actions rely on cooperation with federal authorities. It is an evolving plan that is modified as challenges arise. Key actions relating to individuals include:
  * Improving income tax auditing of individuals: 
    * The CRA will ask foreign tax authorities for their approval to share, with Quebec and other provinces, information about Canadian residents on financial assets held abroad _(__see Common Reporting Standard [CRS] in the_ _section for more information_).
    * The CRA will give the Quebec government access to information obtained from the CRA’s international EFT program _(discussed above)_.
  * Increasing penalties in respect of general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR)-based assessments to 50% (from 25%) of the amount of the tax benefit denied.
  * Implementing a tax informant reward program that is similar to the federal ‘Stop International Tax Evasion Program’.
  * Strengthening the mandatory disclosure mechanism, which requires reporting to Revenu Québec of certain transactions resulting in a tax benefit, and broadening the types of transactions that must be disclosed under this mechanism.
  * Requiring mandatory disclosure to Revenu Québec of nominee agreements made as part of a transaction or series of transactions.
  * Establishing a special regime to counter tax schemes based on sham transactions by adding new penalties for taxpayers, advisers, and promoters, and extending the standard reassessment period for an additional three years.
  * Fostering tax fairness in the sharing economy by requiring individuals operating a digital accommodation platform to register, collect, and remit the tax on lodging.
  * Increasing tax compliance in respect of certain transactions, by introducing a new tax slip to facilitate reporting of financial market transactions and requesting information about cryptoassets on tax return forms.
  * Simplifying tax compliance, tightening regulations, educating taxpayers of their rights and responsibilities, and increasing inspections in certain sectors with a higher risk of tax evasion (e.g. renovation, construction, personal placement, transportation, money-services, and cryptocurrency). 
  * Deploying new tax audit initiatives at Revenu Québec, including hiring of additional staff to combat aggressive tax planning, monitor high-risk sectors, increase tax debt collection efforts, and increase inspection activities in all sectors of activity, particularly those considered at risk of tax evasion.
  * Upgrading Revenu Québec service delivery to simplify taxpayer experience and fight tax evasion and fraud by modernising computer systems and strengthening information security.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 10 December 2024
## Employment expenses
In computing income from employment, an individual can claim only limited, specified deductions. Taxes and interest (except interest related to the earning of business and property income), most life insurance premiums, and casualty losses are not deductible. Allowable deductions in computing employment income include travelling and certain other expenses of officers or employees required as a condition of employment.
### Registered plans
A deduction is available with respect to an employee's contributions to a Registered Pension Plan (RPP), a Pooled Registered Pension Plan (PRPP), or to a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP), within certain limits. Income earned in these plans is taxed only on withdrawal. In certain cases, individuals can deduct their contributions to an employer-sponsored foreign pension plan if they participated in the plan before moving to Canada.
Self-employed individuals can also make deductible contributions to RRSPs.
For both employed and self-employed individuals, the deductible contribution to an RRSP is generally 18% of the total employment, self-employment, and rental income that was subject to Canadian tax in the preceding year, to a maximum annual contribution amount (CAD 31,560 in 2024). The allowable contribution is further limited when an individual is a member of an RPP, PRPP, or a foreign pension plan while working in Canada.
### Pooled Registered Pension Plans (PRPPs)
The federal PRPP is a voluntary savings plan aimed at individuals who do not have access to employer-sponsored pension plans. The tax rules for PRPPs complement the existing RPP and RRSP framework, and operate in a manner similar to multi-employer defined contribution RPPs. The provinces and territories must introduce their own enabling legislation to implement provincial and territorial PRPPs.
### First Home Savings Account 
Starting 1 April 2023, a new registered account, the First Home Savings Account (FHSA), is available to Canadian residents aged 18 and over who have not lived in a home that they owned during the year the FHSA is opened (or the preceding four calendar years). They can contribute up to CAD 8,000 each year (lifetime limit of CAD 40,000) to an FHSA. Contributions are deductible, and income earned in an FHSA is not subject to tax. Contributions made in the year can be deducted in a future year. Unused annual contribution room, up to a maximum of CAD 8,000, can be carried forward to the following year. Individuals can also transfer funds from an RRSP to an FHSA on a tax-free basis, subject to the contribution limits. Withdrawals from an FHSA to make a qualifying first home purchase are non-taxable. The FHSA must be closed within one year of the first non-taxable withdrawal to purchase a home or if the FHSA funds have not been used to purchase a home within 15 years of opening the FHSA.
## Personal deductions
Deductible non-business expenses include alimony and maintenance payments (if taxable to the recipient), certain child-care expenses, and eligible moving expenses for relocation within Canada (usually in connection with a change of employment).
### Alimony and child support payments
Periodic alimony payments made by a taxpayer under a divorce decree (or under the terms of a written divorce or separation agreement) to a former or separated spouse (or for the spouse's benefit) are generally deductible, subject to restrictions as to the precise nature of these payments. Also, certain supporting documentation usually must be filed with the first Canadian tax return in which the taxpayer claims a deduction for alimony payments. The payments constitute taxable income to the recipient spouse or former spouse if the individual is a resident of Canada.
Generally, child support payments made under the terms of an agreement cannot be deducted by the payer and need not be included in the income of the recipient spouse.
Neither alimony nor child support is subject to WHT if paid to a non-resident.
### Child-care expenses
Canada allows working parents to deduct child-care expenses if certain conditions are met. To qualify, the expenses must be incurred by the taxpayer (or a person supporting the child) to earn employment or business income, or to pursue training or research activities. The deduction can be claimed for a variety of child-care services, such as babysitting, day nursery, and attendance at a boarding school or camp. To qualify, the services must be provided in Canada and satisfy rules that govern who provides them. If more than one person is supporting a child, the deduction generally must be taken by the supporting person with the lowest 'earned income' (generally employment and/or self-employment income). The maximum annual deduction is generally CAD 8,000 per child under seven years old and CAD 5,000 per child from seven to 16 years old.
## Interest expense
Interest on money borrowed to acquire investment property or to invest in a business is usually deductible. Interest on loans used for personal purposes, including mortgage interest on a loan to purchase a home for personal use, is not deductible.
## Personal allowances
Unlike countries that permit personal exemptions and allowances in determining taxable income, Canada has adopted a system of tax credits. _See the section for more information_.
## Business deductions
Business deductions for self-employed individuals generally include all reasonable expenses that have been incurred to earn business income. Business expenses include costs of goods sold, advertising, bad debts, insurance, office expenses, and capital cost allowance. A self-employed individual can also deduct expenses for the business use of a work-space in the individual's home, if the home is the individual's principal place of business, or the individual uses the work-space only to earn business income and it is used on a regular and ongoing basis to meet business clients, customers, or patients. Home expenses that may be deducted include utilities, home insurance, property taxes, mortgage interest, and capital cost allowance.
### Immediate expensing of capital property for individuals and partnerships
Unincorporated businesses carried on directly by certain individuals and partnerships can, in the year that the eligible property becomes available for use, immediately expense up to CAD 1.5 million per taxation year of eligible property acquired after 31 December 2021 that becomes available for use generally before 2025. Eligible property consists of capital property subject to the capital cost allowance (CCA) rules, other than property included in CCA classes 1 to 6, 14.1, 17, 47, 29, and 51 (_see Depreciation and amortisation in the section of the Corporate tax summary for more information on CCA_).
## Capital losses
Capital losses are deductible, but generally only against capital gains. Any excess of allowable capital losses over taxable capital gains in the current year can be carried back three years and forward indefinitely, to be applied against net taxable capital gains from those years. No particular holding period is required. Intent is a major factor in determining whether the gain or loss is income or capital in nature. Draft legislative proposals clarify that the inclusion rate for net capital losses carried forward and applied against capital gains is adjusted to reflect the inclusion rate of the capital gains being offset.

## Individual - Other issues
Last reviewed - 10 December 2024
## Treatment of flow-through business entities
### Specified investment flow-throughs (SIFTs)
Certain earnings of SIFTs (i.e. publicly traded income trusts and partnerships) are subject to a SIFT tax and are deemed to be dividends when distributed.
### Partnerships
For Canadian tax purposes, a partnership is treated as a conduit, and the partners are taxed on their share of the partnership income, whether or not distributed. Income is determined at the partnership level and is then allocated among the partners according to the terms of the partnership agreement. However, certain deductions, such as depletion allowances, exploration and development expenses, and donations, will flow through to be deducted by the various partners directly, as will any foreign tax credits, dividend tax credits, or investment tax credits. Partners generally may deduct expenses incurred directly, such as interest on borrowings to acquire partnership interests, in computing income from the partnership.
## Cross-border tax compliance
### Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters
Under the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, Canada exchanges tax information with other signatories of the convention (member states of the Council of Europe and the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)), based on OECD standards, but is not required to collect taxes on behalf of another country or provide assistance in the service of related documents. Canada will continue to negotiate a provision on helping to collect tax on a bilateral basis, and has agreed to include such a provision in some of its bilateral tax treaties.
### Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
The CRS for the automatic exchange of financial account information between foreign tax authorities requires Canadian financial institutions to have procedures to identify accounts held by residents of any country other than Canada or the United States, and to report the required information to the CRA. Having satisfied itself that each jurisdiction has the appropriate capacity and safeguards in place, the CRA will formalise exchange arrangements with other jurisdictions, leading to the exchange of information on a multilateral basis. On 10 October 2022, the OECD released amendments to the CRS, which will:
  * require financial institutions to include additional information in their annual CRS reporting
  * align the CRS with the new Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) (_see ‘Crypto-asset reporting’ below_) and include crypto-assets in relevant CRS definitions, and
  * integrate certain frequently asked questions into the body of the CRS text and guidance.


Participating jurisdictions, including Canada, will need to agree to these amendments and update their domestic legislation to implement the more significant changes. The 2024 federal budget proposes, starting the 2026 calendar year, to implement amendments to the Canadian rules relating to the CRS that have been endorsed by the OECD in connection with the CARF, including changes relating to electronic money products and central bank digital currencies.
### US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
Canada reports enhanced tax information to the United States under an Intergovernmental Agreement between Canada and the United States to improve international tax compliance and to implement the US FATCA.
### Crypto-asset reporting
The OECD has developed a framework for the automatic exchange of tax information relating to transactions in crypto-assets, the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF). The 2024 federal budget proposes to implement the CARF in Canada, starting the 2026 calendar year. The new reporting rules would apply to crypto-asset service providers that are resident in Canada, or carry on business in Canada, and that provide services effectuating exchange transactions in crypto-assets. These service providers will need to report certain information regarding their customers and crypto-asset transactions.
## Personal services business income
The personal services business rules prevent employees from establishing corporations to take advantage of the small business income tax rate, rather than paying the higher personal rate imposed on employment income. They also limit the expenses a personal services business can deduct. The federal corporate tax rate that applies to ‘personal services business’ income is 33%.
## Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA)
Canadian residents aged 18 years and older who have a social insurance number can contribute each year to a TFSA, up to CAD 7,000 for 2024 (CAD 6,500 for 2023, CAD 6,000 for 2019 to 2022, and CAD 5,500 for 2016 to 2018). Contributions to a TFSA are not tax-deductible, but income (including capital gains) earned in a TFSA is exempt from income tax. Withdrawals (whether from capital or income) are tax-free and will increase the taxpayer’s contribution room in future years. Any unused contribution room can be carried forward indefinitely.
## Trusts and estates
Grandfathered _inter vivos_ trusts and certain testamentary trusts and estates are taxed at the highest federal marginal tax rate. In contrast, two specifically defined trusts, 'graduated rate estates' (GRE) and 'qualifying disability trusts' (QDT), have access to graduated tax rates.
There are numerous conditions required to meet the definition of either a GRE or a QDT. Among other conditions, a GRE must:
  * arise on, and as a consequence of, an individual's death
  * qualify as a 'testamentary trust,' and 
  * be designated as a GRE in its trust tax return for its first taxation year.


An estate can only qualify as a GRE within the first 36 months of the individual's death.
A QDT must, among other conditions:
  * arise on, and as a consequence of, an individual's death
  * qualify as a 'testamentary trust,' and
  * in its trust tax return, jointly elect to be a QDT with one or more trust beneficiaries who qualify for the disability tax credit.


### Reporting requirements for trusts
Certain trusts were previously exempted from an annual T3 'Trust Income Tax and Information Return' filing obligation. However, for trust taxation years ending after 30 December 2023, this exemption is no longer available for certain Canadian-resident and non-resident trusts.
For taxation years ending after 30 December 2023, updated rules require:
  * an 'express trust' (generally a trust created by a settlor during his or her lifetime, or at death in a will) that are resident in Canada
  * a non-resident trust that is required to file a T3 return, and
  * a 'bare trust' arrangement (where a trust can reasonably be considered to act as an agent for its beneficiaries with respect to all dealings in all of the trust’s property)


to report with its T3 return the name, address, date of birth (in the case of an individual), jurisdiction of residence, and taxpayer identification number for each settlor, trustee, beneficiary, and person who has the ability to exert influence over trustee decisions regarding appointment of income or capital of the trust (e.g. a protector) in the year. There will be significant penalties for non-compliance with these new reporting rules. However, for the 2023 and 2024 tax years, because of the unintended impact that these requirements have had on Canadians, the CRA does not require 'bare trust' arrangements to file a T3 return, unless the CRA makes a direct request for it. 
To deal with this unintended impact on certain Canadians, draft legislative proposals:
  * reduce the number of trusts, including bare trust arrangements, that would need to file a trust return (and report the additional information), and
  * defer the start of the revised bare trust filing requirement until the 2025 taxation year.


Effective 1 January 2024, trusts must make all tax payments or remittances of more than CAD 10,000 to the Receiver General for Canada electronically, except in special circumstances that preclude it.
### Employee Ownership Trusts (EOTs)
Recently enacted legislation, effective 1 January 2024, introduces rules to define and facilitate the use of EOTs. An EOT is a Canadian resident trust that holds shares for the benefit of employees of a corporation controlled by the trust and makes distributions to employees based on their length of service, remuneration, and hours worked. An EOT facilitates the purchase of a business by its employees, without requiring them to pay directly for the shares, and provides an additional succession planning alternative for business owners. To encourage the use of an EOT, the first CAD 10 million in capital gains realised on the sale of a business to an EOT occurring after 2023 and before 2027 will be exempt from tax (subject to certain conditions).

## Individual - Sample personal income tax calculation
Last reviewed - 10 December 2024
This sample calculation applies to a calendar year ending 31 December 2024.
## Assumptions
  * Resident husband and wife living in Alberta; two children (under 18); one spouse earns all the income.
  * Total remuneration of CAD 110,000.
  * Capital gains of CAD 16,000.
  * Foreign interest income of CAD 5,000, from which CAD 750 withholding has been deducted.
  * Other interest income of CAD 6,000.
  * All amounts are in Canadian dollars (CAD).

Notes
  1. Assuming the capital gains are not in respect of qualified farm property, qualified fishing property, or shares of a small business corporation, no capital gains deduction is available.
  2. In Alberta, the following rates are applied to taxable income in 2024.  Taxable income (CAD) | Tax on first column (CAD) | Tax on excess (%)  
---|---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 148,269 | 0 | 10  
148,269 | 177,922 | 14,827 | 12  
177,922 | 237,230 | 18,385 | 13  
237,230 | 355,845 | 26,095 | 14  
355,845 | 42,701 | 15  
  3. Personal tax credits and miscellaneous tax credits are subtracted from the result to determine Alberta tax. The 2024 Alberta personal tax credit for the government pension plan and employment insurance plan contributions is equal to 10% (maximum credit is CAD 427) of the lesser of the base (non-enhanced) amounts payable and the required base premiums for the year.
  4. The taxpayer does not have sufficient tax preference items to be liable for AMT.




# Canada
## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 10 December 2024
## Employment income
Salaries, wages, commissions, directors' fees, and all other remuneration received by an officer or employee are included in income from employment. Canadian residents are taxable on worldwide income, whether remitted in Canada or not. Most fringe benefits (e.g. interest-free or low-interest loans) received or enjoyed in connection with employment are also taxed as employment income. Foreigners working temporarily or permanently in Canada are eligible for special concessions for employment at a special work site or remote location. The rules exempt from tax most amounts received as allowances for board and lodging, as well as transportation between the special work site and the employee's principal place of residence.
Employer contributions to a registered pension plan or deferred profit-sharing plan will be taxed when the employee receives a distribution from the plan.
A non-resident of Canada is subject to a 25% WHT on plan withdrawals. The plan administrator is responsible for withholding and remitting this tax. However, a non-resident individual can elect to have the withdrawal taxed at graduated rates. In certain circumstances, this election enables the taxpayer to withdraw the funds tax-free up to an annual threshold, which is usually the personal tax credit for the year. The 25% rate may also be reduced under the provisions of an income tax treaty.
### Employee Profit Sharing Plans (EPSPs)
A 'specified employee' (generally an employee who has a significant interest in, or does not deal at arm’s length with, the employer) is subject to a special tax on the portion of an employer’s EPSP contribution, allocated by the trustee to the employee, that exceeds 20% of the employee’s salary received in the year from the employer. The tax rate will equal the top combined marginal rate of the province or territory in which the employee resides (except for Quebec residents, for whom the tax rate will equal the top federal marginal tax rate, which is 33%).
## Equity compensation
Employees who exercise options to acquire shares of their employer corporation (or a related corporation) will be considered in receipt of a benefit in the year of exercise, based on the difference between the market value of the shares on the date of purchase and the total price paid to acquire the options and the shares themselves. In most cases, 50% of this benefit (25% for Quebec tax purposes, except for options of small- or medium-sized businesses conducting innovative activities, and for options granted after 21 February 2017, in shares of public corporations with at least CAD 10 million payroll in Quebec) is deductible from taxable income. As a result, only half of this benefit (75% for Quebec tax purposes if none of the above exceptions apply) is included in income. Draft legislative proposals decrease the stock option deduction from one-half to one-third for the portion of the benefit realised after 24 June 2024 that exceeds an annual CAD 250,000 limit (for both employee stock options and capital gains).
Employees who cash out their stock option rights will be eligible for the stock option deduction only if their employer makes an election to forgo deducting the cash payment from its income. The cost of the shares to the employee for capital gains purposes is the market value of the shares on the day the option is exercised. Any capital gain or loss accruing after the date of exercise will arise only on the ultimate disposition of the shares. An exception is provided for stock options of Canadian-controlled private corporations (CCPCs) granted to employees of CCPCs, which are not subject to tax until the employee disposes of the underlying shares.
The employee stock option tax regime was changed on 1 July 2021 to be more aligned with the tax treatment of stock options in the United States for employees of large, long-established, mature firms. For stock options granted after 30 June 2021:
  * a CAD 200,000 annual vesting limit (based on the value of an option's underlying shares at the date of grant) is imposed on options that can qualify for the 50% employee stock option deduction, and
  * an employer deduction for the amount of stock option benefits that exceeds the new annual vesting limit is introduced, subject to certain conditions.


These rules do not apply to options granted by CCPCs, or non-CCPC employers with consolidated group revenue of CAD 500 million or less.
## Business income
Business income for self-employed individuals includes most income earned from any activity that is intended to be carried on for profit. Evidence must exist to support this intention. It does not include employment income.
Loss relief is available for self-employed individuals. Business losses from self-employment can be offset against income from the self-employment. Business losses can be carried back for a period of three years and carried forward for a period of 20 years.
Profits arising from the disposition of residential properties (including assignment sales) owned for less than 12 months are taxed as business income (some exceptions apply) and the principal residence exemption is disallowed (_see_ _Capital gain on sale of residence_ _below_).
## Capital gains
Half of a capital gain constitutes a taxable capital gain, which is included in the individual's income and taxed at ordinary rates. For the portion of capital gains realised by individuals, graduated rate estates (GREs), and qualified disability trusts (QDTs) after 24 June 2024 that exceed an annual CAD 250,000 threshold, draft legislative proposals increase the capital gains inclusion rate from one-half to two-thirds. For corporations and trusts (except for GREs and QDTs), the draft legislative proposals increase the capital gains inclusion rate from one-half to two-thirds for dispositions after 24 June 2024.
No special concessions are available to short-term residents with respect to the taxation of capital gains. However, a step-up in the cost base is available to new residents of Canada, which may reduce the amount of capital gains otherwise subject to tax.
The purchaser of taxable Canadian property is generally required to withhold tax from the proceeds paid to a non-resident vendor, unless the non-resident vendor has obtained a clearance certificate.
Taxable Canadian property of a taxpayer includes, among other things:
  * Real estate situated in Canada.
  * Both capital and non-capital property used in carrying on a business in Canada.
  * In general, shares in a corporation that are listed on a stock exchange if, at any time in the preceding 60 months: 
    * 25% or more of the shares of the corporation are owned by the taxpayer or persons related to the taxpayer, and
    * more than 50% of the fair market value of the shares is derived from real property situated in Canada, Canadian resource properties, and timber resource properties.
  * In general, shares in a corporation that are not listed on a stock exchange if, at any time in the preceding 60 months, more than 50% of the fair market value of the shares is derived directly or indirectly from property similar to that described above for shares of a public corporation.


However, in specific situations the disposition by a non-resident of a share or other interest that is not described above may be subject to Canadian tax (e.g. when a share is deemed to be taxable Canadian property).
### Capital gains reserve
When capital property is sold at a profit in the year or in a previous year, a reserve can be claimed on any proceeds that are not due until after the year end. The reserve equals the portion of the gain related to the sale proceeds that are not due until after the end of the year. The reserve mechanism can be used to spread gains over a maximum of five years on most types of capital property. Amounts brought into income each year under the reserve mechanism are treated as capital gains. A reserve cannot be claimed if the taxpayer was not resident in Canada at the end of the year or at any time in the immediately preceding year.
### Capital gain on sale of residence
A gain realised on the sale of an individual's home (principal residence) is exempt from tax in most instances. A loss is not deductible. Generally, a capital gain realised on the sale of a principal residence will be fully exempt from tax only if the taxpayer has been resident in Canada and has occupied the home during all the years of ownership (or all years except one, known as the 'one-plus' rule, which is intended to ensure that an individual who, in the same year, disposes of a home and acquires a replacement residence is not precluded from designating both properties as a principal residence). Only one principal residence per family unit in a tax year is eligible for this treatment.
Special rules permit resident taxpayers who temporarily rent their home to others to elect to continue to treat it as a principal residence for a further period. Generally, the period is up to four years, but it can be extended if the taxpayer is temporarily transferred by the employer and eventually returns to the same residence.
Individuals who sell their principal residence must report the sale (i.e. date of acquisition, proceeds of disposition, and a description of the property) and the principal residence designation on their income tax returns to claim the full principal residence exemption.
The 'one-plus' rule (_see above_) is eliminated if the purchaser of Canadian residential real estate was not resident in Canada during the year the property was purchased. As a result, non-residents who acquire residential properties in Canada can no longer claim a portion of the principal residence exemption to shelter gains on a later sale.
### Property flipping
Profits arising from the disposition of residential properties owned for less than 12 months are taxed as business income (some exceptions apply) and the principal residence exemption is disallowed. Profits from the disposition of the rights to purchase a residential property by way of an assignment sale if the rights were assigned after having been owned for less than 12 months are also taxed as business income. 
### Assessments and reassessments
The CRA can reassess tax, after the end of the normal reassessment period (three years after the date of the initial notice of assessment, for most taxpayers), on a gain from the disposition of real or immovable property if the taxpayer does not initially report the disposition.
### Capital gains exemption
A lifetime capital gains exemption (LCGE) allows a Canadian-resident individual to realise tax free up to CAD 1,016,836 for 2024 (indexed thereafter) in capital gains on the disposition of qualifying small business corporation shares and qualified farm and fishing properties; draft legislative proposals increase the LCGE to CAD 1.25 million for dispositions that occur after 24 June 2024 (to be indexed after 2025).
An individual resident in Canada for only part of the year may be eligible to claim the exemption if that individual was a resident of Canada throughout the immediately preceding or following year.
### Canadian Entrepreneurs' Incentive
Draft legislative proposals introduce the Canadian Entrepreneurs' Incentive, which will reduce the taxes on capital gains from the disposition of certain shares of a small business corporation that was a CCPC and owned directly by an eligible individual, among meeting other conditions. The incentive will also be available for dispositions of 'qualified farm or fishing properties'.
The incentive will reduce the prevailing capital gains inclusion rate (i.e. either one-half or two-thirds) to a one-third inclusion rate on up to CAD 2 million in capital gains per individual during their lifetime. The CAD 2 million limit will be phased in over five years by increments of CAD 400,000 per year, reaching CAD 2 million by 1 January 2029. The incentive will apply to dispositions that occur after 31 December 2024 and is in addition to the LCGE.
### Mutual fund trusts: Allocation to redeemers methodology
When a mutual fund trust unitholder redeems its units, the trust often must dispose of investments to fund the redemption, recognising accrued gains in the trust. Although a 'capital gains refund' mechanism is available under the Canadian Income Tax Act to prevent potential 'double taxation' that could result, the mechanism does not always work well. Accordingly, mutual fund trusts often use an 'allocation to redeemers (ATR) methodology' to allocate capital gains realised by it to a redeeming unitholder and claim a corresponding deduction. The allocated capital gains are included in computing the redeeming unitholder's income, but its redemption proceeds are reduced by that amount.
Certain mutual fund trusts have been using the ATR methodology:
  * to allocate capital gains to redeeming unitholders that exceed the capital gains that would otherwise have been realised by these unitholders on the redemption of their units, resulting in a perceived deferral benefit to the remaining unitholders (the deferral benefit), and
  * to allow the mutual fund trust to convert the returns on an investment that would have the character of ordinary income to capital gains for their remaining unitholders, which is possible when the redeeming unitholders hold their units on income account, but others on capital account (the character conversion benefit).


To address concerns with the deferral benefit and character conversion benefit, a mutual fund trust will be:
  * denied a deduction in computing its income when the ATR is paid out of its taxable capital gains and the amount allocated to a unitholder on a redemption of a unit of the mutual fund trust exceeds the capital gain that the unitholder would otherwise have realised on the redemption under certain conditions,* and
  * required to use 'reasonable efforts' to determine the unitholder's cost amount and its income earned.


* For exchange traded funds (ETFs):
  * the deduction by ETFs of certain amounts allocated to its investors who have redeemed units will be limited, and
  * a formulaic codification of the ATR methodology can be used by mutual funds that are ETFs.


## Dividend income
For 2024, non-eligible and eligible dividends from Canadian corporations are grossed up by 15% and 38%, respectively, for inclusion in income. A federal tax credit can then be claimed for 9.03% (non-eligible) or 15.02% (eligible) of the grossed-up dividend, in addition to a provincial or territorial tax credit.
Eligible dividends must be designated as such by the payer. Dividends generally will be eligible dividends if the corporation that pays them is resident in Canada and either is a public corporation or is not a CCPC. However, these corporations will pay non-eligible dividends in certain cases (e.g. if they received non-eligible dividends). Dividends from CCPCs will be eligible or non-eligible depending on the source of the dividends paid.
A non-resident's Canadian-source dividends are subject to WHT of 25%. That income is not subject to graduated rates. The 25% WHT, which is deducted at source, may be reduced under an income tax treaty to rates ranging from 5% to 20%.
## Interest income
Interest income is taxed as ordinary income, regardless of whether or not the interest is derived from a source in Canada. Accrued interest income on most debt obligations must be reported annually.
A non-resident's Canadian-source interest (except for most interest paid to arm's-length non-residents) is subject to WHT of 25%. That income is not subject to graduated rates. The 25% WHT, which is deducted at source, may be reduced under an income tax treaty to rates ranging from 0% to 18%.
## Rental income
Rental income is generally taxed as ordinary income.
A non-resident's Canadian-source rental income is subject to WHT of 25%. For real estate rentals that do not constitute income from carrying on a business, a non-resident can elect to be taxed on the net income from these sources at the graduated tax rates that apply to residents. However, the availability of personal and other tax credits to individuals electing to file on this basis is restricted. Any excess tax withheld is refundable to the non-resident. If an election is made, the non-resident can also file an undertaking that results in WHT being levied on only the net income from these sources.
Individuals working temporarily in Canada often have rental income from renting out their foreign home while in Canada. Deductions for expenses incurred to maintain the foreign house are allowed in determining the portion of rental income subject to the graduated tax. Canadian tax law, however, limits the amount of capital cost allowance (i.e. tax depreciation) that can be deducted to the amount required to reduce the rental income to zero. This ensures that a rental loss cannot be created by claiming capital cost allowance. If rental expenses, except for capital cost allowance, exceed rental income, the loss generally may be offset against the individual's other income, provided certain conditions are satisfied. The deductibility of rental losses against other income may be restricted if there is no reasonable expectation of a profit from the rental property.
Residents in Canada must file Form T1135 annually to disclose ownership of non-Canadian investment properties with a cost exceeding CAD 100,000 and any related investment income._See Tax returns in the section for more information._
## Foreign accrual property income (FAPI)
Individuals resident in Canada are taxed on certain investment income (FAPI) of controlled foreign affiliates as it is earned, whether or not distributed. A grossed-up deduction is available for foreign income or profits taxes and WHTs paid in respect of the income. A foreign corporation is considered to be a foreign affiliate of a Canadian individual if the Canadian individual owns, directly or indirectly, at least 1% of any class of the outstanding shares of the foreign corporation and the Canadian individual, alone or together with related persons, owns, directly or indirectly, at least 10% of any class of the outstanding shares of that foreign corporation. The foreign affiliate will be a controlled foreign affiliate if certain conditions are met (e.g. more than 50% of the voting shares are owned, directly or indirectly, by a combination of the Canadian individual, persons dealing at non-arm’s length with the Canadian individual, a limited number of Canadian resident shareholders, and persons dealing at non-arm’s length with such Canadian resident shareholders).
## Non-resident trusts (NRTs)
An NRT will generally be deemed to be resident for Canadian tax purposes if (i) it has Canadian resident contributors or (ii) certain former Canadian residents have contributed to an NRT that has Canadian resident beneficiaries. However, an election can be filed to deem the creation of a separate notional trust for tax purposes, referred to as a ‘non-resident portion trust’. Canadian tax will apply only to the income or gains from the properties held by the trust that are not included in the non-resident portion trust. Properties included in the non-resident portion trust are those that have not been contributed directly or indirectly by a Canadian resident or certain former Canadian residents (or property substituted for those properties or income derived from those properties). Many direct or indirect transfers or loans of property or services can be deemed to be contributions to an NRT.
An NRT will also be deemed to be resident in Canada if a Canadian-resident taxpayer transfers or lends property to the trust (regardless of the consideration received) and the property held by the trust may revert to the taxpayer, pass to persons to be determined by the taxpayer, or be disposed of only with the taxpayer’s consent.
## Offshore investment funds
The offshore investment fund rules affect Canadian residents that have an interest as a beneficiary in these funds. If the rules apply, the taxpayer will be required to include in its income an amount generally determined as the taxpayer’s cost of the investment multiplied by a prescribed income percentage (i.e. the prescribed rate of interest plus 2%) less any income received from the investment. Also, for certain non-discretionary trust funds in which a Canadian-resident person, and persons that do not deal at arm's length with the person, have interests in aggregate of 10% or more of the total fair market value of the total interests in the trusts, the trust is deemed to be a controlled foreign affiliate of the Canadian beneficiary and is thereby subject to the Canadian FAPI rules (discussed above).
## Exempt income
Few income items are specifically exempt from personal income tax in Canada.

Notes
  1. Personal credits are indexed for inflation.
  2. Any unused portion of the tax credits is not refundable.
  3. The basic/spouse/equivalent to spouse amounts are increased from CAD 2,123 to CAD 2,356 for taxpayers with taxable income below the second top tax bracket (i.e. CAD 173,205 in 2024), with the benefit of the increased personal amounts eliminated when taxable income reaches the top tax bracket (i.e. CAD 246,752 in 2024).
  4. The credit is reduced if the income of the individual or dependant exceeds a threshold.
  5. In some circumstances, the unused portion of the credit can be transferred to a spouse, parent, grandparent, child, grandchild, sibling, aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew.
  6. One spouse can claim the other's medical expenses, charitable donations, and adoption expenses.
  7. For total charitable donations in a year exceeding CAD 200, the tax credit rate is: 
     * 33%, to the extent the individual has income that is subject to the federal 33% income tax rate, and
     * 29% for other donations.
  8. Starting 2019, Canadian government pension plan contributions were increased by an enhancement that will be phased-in over seven years. The enhanced portion is deductible, while the non-enhanced base portion remains eligible for a tax credit.
  9. In Quebec, federal values are reduced by 16.5%. The amount shown reflects this reduction.


## Provincial and territorial personal tax credits
The provinces and territories have many personal tax credits that are similar to the federal personal tax credits. However, the provinces and territories set the amounts of their personal tax credits.


# Canada
## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 10 December 2024
Generally, an individual is resident in Canada for tax purposes if there is a continuing relationship between the individual and Canada. In determining an individual's residence, all relevant facts must be considered. Residential ties of particular significance include the maintenance of a dwelling place available for the individual's occupation and the residence of the individual's spouse and dependants. Ordinarily, individuals are considered to be resident where they maintain a fixed abode for themselves and their families. Secondary factors include social and business ties and personal property, such as memberships in clubs and religious organisations, driver's licences, vehicle registration, and medical insurance coverage.
Citizenship and domicile under the tax laws of another country are generally not relevant.
If an individual, who, as a matter of fact, is considered not a resident of Canada, sojourns (i.e. is temporarily resident) in Canada for 183 days or more in a calendar year, the individual is deemed to be resident in Canada for that entire year.
Sometimes an individual is considered to be a resident of both Canada and of another country under that country's domestic tax laws. In these cases, to eliminate any conflicts and the double taxation that might otherwise result, Canada's tax treaties often provide special residency 'tie-breaker' rules for determining residency. Normally, under Canadian law and the residency provisions of most tax treaties, an individual is considered resident in the jurisdiction to which the individual has closer personal and economic ties, although other factors may influence this conclusion. The tie-breaker rules override the general residency tests applied under Canadian domestic law.


# Canada
## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 10 December 2024
## Social security contributions
For 2024, Canadian-resident employees are required to pay government pension plan contributions of up to CAD 4,055.50 and employment insurance premiums of up to CAD 1,049.12. However, Quebec employees instead contribute a maximum of CAD 4,348.00 in Quebec government pension plan contributions, CAD 834.24 in employment insurance premiums, and CAD 464.36 to a Quebec parental insurance plan.
Starting 1 January 2019, Canadian and Quebec government pension plan contributions were increased by an enhancement that will be phased in over seven years. The enhanced portion of the contributions is deductible, while a credit equal to 15% of the lesser of the base (non-enhanced) amount payable and the required base premiums for the year is allowed in computing an individual's federal taxes payable.
Self-employed persons contribute double the employee's government pension plan contribution (i.e. for 2024, up to CAD 8,111, or if in Quebec, CAD 8,696) and are permitted to deduct half of the base (non-enhanced) contribution and 100% of the enhanced contribution. The non-deductible portion qualifies for a tax credit. Self-employed persons are not liable for employment insurance premiums but may opt to pay them. Self-employed persons in Quebec must contribute up to CAD 825.32 to the Quebec parental insurance plan.
## Consumption taxes
### Federal Goods and Services Tax (GST)
The GST is a federal tax levied at a rate of 5% on the supply of most property and services made in Canada. It is a value-added tax (VAT) applied at each level in the manufacturing and marketing chain. However, the tax does not apply to supplies that are zero-rated (i.e. taxed at 0%) or exempt. Examples of zero-rated supplies include basic groceries, medical and assistive devices, prescription drugs, feminine hygiene products, agriculture and fishing, and most international freight and passenger transportation services. Examples of exempt supplies include used residential real property and most healthcare, educational, and financial services.
Generally, registrants charge GST on their sales and pay GST on their purchases, and either remit or claim a refund for the amount of net tax reported (i.e. the difference between the GST charged and the GST paid). Suppliers are entitled to claim input tax credits (ITCs) for the GST paid or payable on their expenses, to the extent they are related to their taxable activities, i.e. in the course of making taxable and zero-rated supplies. Suppliers are not entitled to claim ITCs with respect to GST paid on expenses incurred relating to the making of exempt supplies.
### Harmonised Sales Tax (HST)
Five provinces have fully harmonised their sales tax systems with the GST and impose a single HST, which includes the 5% GST and a provincial component. HST applies to the same tax base and under the same rules as the GST. There is no need to register separately for GST and HST because both taxes are accounted for under one tax return and are jointly administered by the CRA. The HST rates are as follows:
Provinces | HST rate (%)  
---|---  
New Brunswick | 15  
Newfoundland and Labrador | 15  
Nova Scotia (1) | 15  
Ontario | 13  
Prince Edward Island | 15  
Notes
  1. The Nova Scotia government proposes to decrease the province's HST rate to 14% on 1 April 2025 (i.e. the provincial portion of the HST would decrease from 10% to 9%).


### GST/HST and the digital economy
Non-resident vendors that are considered to be ‘carrying on business in Canada’ and making taxable supplies in Canada are generally required to register for GST/HST under the regime, regardless of whether they have a physical presence in Canada. In addition, non-resident vendors that neither have a physical presence in Canada nor carry on business in Canada may also have the obligation to register for and collect GST/HST under a simplified regime, including:
  * foreign-based digital businesses that supply intangible personal property and services to consumers (non-GST/HST registrants) in Canada
  * non-resident digital accommodation platforms that facilitate the supply of short‑term accommodation by private residential property owners, and
  * non-resident suppliers or non-resident operators of distribution platforms participating in transactions involving goods for sale that are located at fulfilment warehouses in Canada and sold to purchasers in Canada, if the non-resident vendor is: 
    * selling goods directly to consumers in Canada on their own account, or
    * using an online marketplace platform to facilitate the sale of goods to consumers in Canada.


### Provincial retail sales tax (PST)
The provinces of British Columbia, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan each levy a PST (in addition to the 5% GST) at 7%, 7%, and 6%, respectively, on most sales of tangible personal property, software, and certain taxable services.
PST generally does not apply to sales of taxable goods, software, and services acquired by the purchaser for resale; registered purchasers can claim this resale exemption by providing to their suppliers either their PST number or a purchase exemption certificate. Certain exemptions also exist for purchases used in manufacturing, farming, and fisheries.
PST is administered by each province’s tax authority, separate from the CRA. Unlike GST/HST, PST is not a VAT and is not recoverable. Therefore, any PST paid on purchases by a business cannot generally be claimed as a credit or otherwise offset against PST charged on sales.
Alberta and the three territories (the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and the Yukon) do not impose a retail sales tax. However, the GST applies in those jurisdictions.
#### British Columbia PST
British Columbia requires certain out-of-province vendors to register for PST. Non-residents of British Columbia located:
  * in Canada that sell taxable goods or services, or
  * in or outside Canada that sell software and telecommunication services,


to customers for consumption or use in British Columbia are generally required to register for BC PST if their annual revenue from sales in the province exceeds CAD 10,000. 
Businesses that facilitate sales or leases of certain goods, services, or software for third parties through their online platform, including accepting payment from a consumer (known as marketplace facilitators) are required to collect and remit BC PST on those sales and leases made in British Columbia. Marketplace facilitators are also required to charge BC PST on marketplace services they provide to resellers. 
#### Manitoba PST
Manitoba requires certain businesses that do not have a physical presence in the province to register for PST. Businesses providing:
  * audio and video streaming services
  * sales of taxable goods by third parties through online marketplaces, and
  * bookings of taxable accommodation through online platforms,


to Manitoba consumers are required to register for Manitoba PST, regardless of whether they have a physical presence in Manitoba. Starting 1 January 2024, the threshold at which businesses must register for and collect Manitoba PST is increased from CAD 10,000 to CAD 30,000 of taxable sales. Manitoba PST commissions have been eliminated for any filing period ending after 30 April 2024.
#### Saskatchewan PST
Saskatchewan has broad registration requirements for out-of-province sellers. Businesses that operate online selling platforms are required to register for and collect Saskatchewan PST if they:
  * create or facilitate the marketplace in which retail sales of tangible personal property, taxable services, or contracts of insurance for consumption or use in or relating to Saskatchewan take place, and
  * collect payment from a consumer or user of the tangible personal property, taxable services, or contract of insurance and remit the payment to a marketplace seller.


Out-of-province sellers do not have to register for Saskatchewan PST if they only make sales to customers in Saskatchewan through online accommodation platforms or marketplace facilitators that are registered for Saskatchewan PST.
### Quebec sales tax (QST)
Quebec's sales tax is a VAT structured in the same manner as the GST/HST. The QST is charged in addition to the 5% GST and is levied at a rate of 9.975% on the supply of most property and services made in the province of Quebec, resulting in an effective combined rate of 14.975%. Registrants charge QST on taxable supplies (that are not zero-rated) and can claim input tax refunds for QST paid or payable on their expenses/purchases, to the extent they are incurred/made in the course of their commercial activity. The resulting net tax is reported to Revenu Québec (Quebec’s tax authority) and is either remitted or claimed as a refund. Revenu Québec also administers the GST/HST on behalf of the CRA for most registrants that are resident in the province.
The mandatory QST registration rules, under the regular QST regime, also apply to non-residents of Quebec where they are carrying on business in Quebec. Suppliers that are not residents of, and have no physical or significant presence in, Quebec, and that make digital and certain other supplies to ‘specified Quebec consumers’ may be required to register for QST under a specified registration system. The requirement to register may also apply to operators of digital distribution platforms in regards to taxable supplies of incorporeal moveable property or services received by specified Quebec consumers if these operators of digital platforms control the key elements of the transaction.
Quebec has harmonised its QST system with the federal GST/HST measures on the digital economy (_see above_). Operators of distribution platforms that sell foreign goods located in fulfilment warehouses in Canada and operators of short-term accommodation platforms are required to register and collect QST on certain sales made to Quebec consumers.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Canada.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There are no federal or provincial/territorial inheritance, estate, or gift taxes. However, an individual who dies is deemed to have disposed of any capital property immediately before death. This can result in any accrued capital gains being subject to income tax in the manner discussed under _Capital gains in the_ _section_. In addition, most provinces and territories impose probate fees or administrative charges for probating a will.
## Property taxes
Property taxes are levied by municipalities in Canada on the estimated market value of real property within their boundaries, and by provinces and territories on land not in a municipality. In most provinces and territories, a general property tax is levied on the owner of the property. Some municipalities levy a separate business tax, which is payable by the occupant if the premises are used for business purposes. These taxes are based on the rental value of the property at tax rates that are set each year by the various municipalities. School taxes, also generally based on the value of real property, are levied by local and regional school boards or the province or territory.
### British Columbia speculation and vacancy tax (SVT)
In British Columbia, an annual SVT is imposed on residential property in certain urban centres in British Columbia (i.e. Metro Vancouver Regional District, Capital Regional District and 26 other municipalities, of which 13 are newly subject to the SVT in 2024, with declarations for the new areas commencing in January 2025); most islands in British Columbia are excluded, except Vancouver Island. The SVT targets foreign and domestic homeowners who do not pay income tax in British Columbia above a certain threshold, including those who leave their homes vacant. The tax rate, as a percentage of the property’s assessed value on 1 July of the previous year, is:
  * 2% for foreign investors and satellite families.
  * 0.5% for British Columbians and all other Canadian citizens or permanent residents who are not members of a satellite family.


Up-front exemptions are available for most principal residences and for qualifying long-term rental properties and certain special cases, including home renovation, illness, and divorce. A non-refundable tax credit may be available in varying amounts (depending on the type of owner) for owners subject to the SVT to reduce the amount of SVT owing.
All residential property owners in the areas subject to the SVT must:
  * make a declaration (i.e. register and claim an exemption) online by 31 March of the following year, and
  * if no exemption is available, pay any tax owing by the first business day in July of the following year (2 July in 2025).


If a property has multiple owners, each owner must complete a separate declaration, even if they are married to another owner of the property. An owner with multiple properties must complete a separate declaration for each property. Failure to file a declaration for a calendar year will result in an assessment at the 2% tax rate for the taxpayer, regardless of residency status or exemption eligibility.
### Federal tax on Canadian housing owned by non-residents
Starting 1 January 2022, an annual 1% federal underused housing tax (UHT) applies on the value of non-resident, non-Canadian-owned residential property considered to be vacant or underused. In some situations, prior to 2023, the UHT also applied to some Canadian owners (i.e. certain corporations, partners, and trustees). Certain residential property owners in Canada are required to file an annual declaration for each Canadian residential property they own for the prior calendar year, by 30 April of the following calendar year, even if they claim an exemption from the tax. Failure to file the mandatory declaration could result in significant penalties. The tax generally applies to owners (other than Canadian citizens or permanent residents, in most cases), but exemptions are available to those who lease their properties to qualified tenants for a minimum period in a calendar year. The application of penalties and interest for the 2022 calendar year was waived for any late-filed returns and for any late-paid tax, provided the return was filed and the tax paid by 30 April 2024 (effectively extending the deadline for the 2022 return and payment by one year, to the same date as for the 2023 calendar year). Recently enacted legislation amends the UHT by:
  * eliminating the filing requirement for certain owners (i.e. ’specified Canadian corporations’, partners of ’specified Canadian partnerships‘, and trustees of ’specified Canadian trusts‘), effective the 2023 calendar year
  * reducing the minimum penalty for failing to file by the deadline, effective the 2022 calendar year, and
  * exempting certain employee accommodations, effective the 2023 calendar year.


## Land transfer tax
All provinces and territories levy a land transfer tax or registration fee on the purchaser of real property within their boundaries. These levies are expressed as a percentage, in most cases on a sliding scale, of the sale price or the assessed value of the property sold and are generally payable at the time title to the property is registered. Rates generally range from 0.04% to 5%, depending on the province or territory, but may be higher if the purchaser is a non-resident. Some exemptions (or refunds) are available. Additional land transfer taxes may apply for properties purchased in the municipalities of Montreal or Toronto. Other municipalities may also impose these taxes and fees.
In British Columbia, a 20% land transfer tax (in addition to the general land transfer tax) is imposed on foreign entities (i.e. foreign nationals and corporations, and certain Canadian corporations controlled by such foreign persons), and certain trusts and/or their trustees that have a foreign connection (a taxable trustee), that purchase residential property in the Metro Vancouver Regional District (but excluding residential property located on the Tsawwassen First Nations treaty lands), the Capital Regional District, the Regional District of Central Okanagan, the Fraser Valley Regional District, and the Regional District of Nanaimo. Failure to pay the tax or file the required forms can result in interest, plus significant penalties, and/or imprisonment. Anti-avoidance rules will capture transactions that are structured to avoid this tax.
Relief from the additional land transfer tax is available to property acquired on behalf of a Canadian controlled limited partnership. Refund from the additional land transfer tax is available, subject to certain qualifying conditions, to:
  * foreigners who become Canadian citizens or permanent residents within one year of purchasing a principal residence, or
  * foreign workers coming to British Columbia under the British Columbia Provincial Nominee Program who purchase a principal residence on or after their confirmation under that program.


In an effort to stop tax evasion when property ownership is hidden behind numbered companies and trusts, the British Columbia government requires trustees, partners of a partnership, and corporations that acquire property to identify all individuals with a beneficial interest in the trust, partnership interest, or significant interest in the corporation on the property transfer tax return. For beneficiaries or trusts that are corporations, information about each director of the corporation must be disclosed. This applies to all property types, including residential and commercial, with exemptions for certain trusts (e.g. charitable trusts) and corporations (e.g. hospitals, schools, and libraries).
In Ontario, a 25% land transfer tax (in addition to general land transfer tax and Toronto’s land transfer tax) is imposed on foreign entities (i.e. foreign nationals and corporations, and certain Canadian corporations controlled by such foreign persons) and taxable trustees (i.e. trustees of a trust that has at least one trustee or beneficiary that is a foreign entity) that purchase residential property in the province. For this tax to apply, the land transferred must contain at least one, but not more than six, single family residence(s) (effective 27 March 2024, the tax also applies to a standalone purchase of a parking space or storage unit). The tax also applies to unregistered dispositions of a beneficial interest in such residential property, when the purchaser of the interest is a foreign entity or taxable trustee. Failure to pay the new tax can result in a penalty, fine, and/or imprisonment. Exemptions from this additional land transfer tax are available in certain circumstances (including for foreign workers coming to Ontario under the Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program or for refugees under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, who purchase a principal residence), and rebates of the tax can be obtained in certain situations.
In Nova Scotia, a 5% land transfer tax (in addition to municipal land transfer tax, if any) is imposed on non-residents of Nova Scotia that purchase residential real property. Exemptions are available for non-resident purchasers who move to (and become resident of) the province within six months of the transaction’s closing date.
## Luxury and excise taxes
### Luxury tax
A tax applies on sales, for personal use, of:
  * luxury cars and personal aircraft with a retail sales price over CAD 100,000, and
  * boats with a retail sales price over CAD 250,000,


calculated at the lesser of:
  * 20% of the value above the sales price threshold, or
  * 10% of the full value of the luxury car, boat, or personal aircraft.


### Excise tax
Excise duties are levied at various rates on spirits, wine, beer, malt liquor, tobacco, and vaping products. When these goods are manufactured or produced in Canada, duty is payable on the goods at the point of packaging and not at the point of sale. When these goods are imported into Canada, duty is generally payable by the importer at the time of importation. Excise tax is also imposed on automobile air conditioners and fuel-inefficient automobiles, in addition to aviation fuel, gasoline, diesel fuel, and certain insurance premiums.
