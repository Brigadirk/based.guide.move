## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 10 December 2024
Canada's corporate tax summary reflects all 2024 federal, provincial, and territorial budgets. This summary is based on enacted and proposed legislation and assumes that the proposed legislation will become law. Generally, budget proposals and draft legislation are enacted into law, even with a minority federal government, which is currently the case. _For more details of the proposed new business tax measures noted in the summary, see our Tax Insights on the 2024 federal budget at ._
## 'Clean economy' investment tax credits
The 2022, 2023, and 2024 federal budgets introduced multiple 'clean economy' refundable investment tax credits (ITCs) for: carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS); clean technology; clean hydrogen; clean technology manufacturing (which includes electric vehicle supply chain investment); and clean electricity generation. Recently enacted legislation implements the ITCs for CCUS, clean technology, clean hydrogen, and clean technology manufacturing and applications are now being accepted. Draft legislative proposals introduce the ITC for clean electricity generation. _See Federal environmental incentives in the_ _section and our Tax Insights 'Clean economy investment tax credits (August 2024 update)' and 'Finance releases draft legislation for the clean hydrogen and clean technology manufacturing investment tax credits' (5 June 2024 update) at for more information_.
## Capital gains inclusion rate
Draft legislative proposals increase the capital gains inclusion rate, from one half to two thirds, for dispositions after 24 June 2024. _See Capital gains in the_ _section and our Tax Insights 'Finance releases draft legislation to increase the capital gains inclusion rate' (28 August 2024 update) at for more information_.
## Tax on equity repurchases
Recently enacted legislation implements a 2% corporate-level tax, which would apply on the net value of equity repurchased in a taxation year by a Canadian resident public corporation. _See Tax on equity repurchases in the_ _section for more information_.
## Transfer pricing
The government released a consultation paper to gather stakeholder input on various questions and proposals related to modernisation of Canada’s transfer pricing legislation. _See Transfer pricing in the section and our Tax Insights ‘Finance launches consultation on reforming and modernizing Canada’s transfer pricing rules’ at for more information._
## Interest deductibility limits
Recently enacted legislation limits the amount of net interest and financing expenses that a corporation may deduct in computing its taxable income to a fixed ratio of its ‘tax EBITDA’ (taxable income before interest expense, interest income, income tax, and deductions for depreciation and amortisation), with an election to instead use a ratio based on the 'book EBITDA' of its group, effective starting with taxation years beginning after 30 September 2023. _See Interest deductibility limits in the section and our Tax Insights ‘Bill C-59: Excessive interest and financing expenses limitation (EIFEL) regime' (28 August 2024 update) at for more information_.
## Hybrid mismatch arrangements
Recently enacted legislation (the first of two legislative packages) eliminates the tax benefits from hybrid mismatch arrangements, which are generally cross-border transactions that are characterised differently under the tax laws of different countries. The first package of rules applies for payments generally arising after 30 June 2022. _See Hybrid mismatch arrangements in the_ _section and our Tax Insights ‘Canada introduces first package of hybrid mismatch rules' at for more information_.
## Global minimum tax and the new international tax framework
138 countries, including Canada, have committed to fundamental changes to the international corporate tax system that support the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Inclusive Framework's 'Tax Challenges Arising from Digitalisation' project. The changes would provide new taxing rights that:
  * reallocate some portion of the profits of large multinational enterprises (MNEs) to countries where the MNE's customers are located (Pillar One), and
  * adopt a global minimum effective tax rate of 15% (Pillar Two).


Recently enacted legislation implements Pillar Two in Canada, which is generally effective for fiscal years of MNEs that begin after 30 December 2023; draft legislative proposals implement a backstop charging rule that will come into effect for fiscal years of MNEs that begin after 30 December 2024. The multilateral convention to implement Pillar One has been delayed, and the federal government has recently enacted legislation to implement a Digital Services Tax (DST) in Canada that retroactively applies to Canadian digital services revenue earned since 1 January 2022. _See Global minimum tax and the new international tax framework in the section and our Tax Insights 'Canada releases Global Minimum Tax Act' (21 June 2024 update), 'Finance releases draft legislation to implement the undertaxed profits rule' and 'Canada's Digital Services Tax Act is now law: What is next and how can you prepare?' (5 July 2024 update) at for more information._
## Digital services tax (DST)
Recently enacted legislation implements a tax on certain corporations that provide digital services in Canada. The tax would only have been imposed if a multilateral convention implementing Pillar One (_see Global minimum tax and the new international tax framework above_) had not come into force by the end of 2023, and since a multinational convention has not been signed, the DST applies effective the 2024 calendar year, retroactively in respect of in-scope revenues earned since 1 January 2022. _See Digital services tax (DST) in the section and our Tax Insights 'Canada's Digital Services Tax Act is now law: What is next and how can you prepare?' (5 July 2024 update) at for more information_.
## Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) Assessment and Revenue Management (CARM)
Canadian-resident and non-resident businesses that import goods into Canada and their trade chain partners that interact with the CBSA are required to participate in the CARM, which is now operational (the 180-day transition period for the Release Prior to Payment program will run from 21 October 2024 to 19 April 2025). _See_ Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) Assessment and Revenue Management (CARM)_in the section and our Tax Insights_ _‘_ _Businesses importing goods into Canada must register for CARM_ _–_ _Action required! (October 2024 update)' at_ _for more information_.
## General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR)
Recently enacted legislation amends the GAAR by:
  * introducing a preamble to guide the interpretation of the GAAR
  * lowering the avoidance transaction standard and introducing an economic substance rule, and 
  * applying a three-year extension of the normal reassessment period and implementing a 25% penalty.


_See General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR) in the section_ _and our Tax Insights ‘Bill C-59: Changes to the general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR)’ at_ _for more information._


# Canada
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 10 December 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year of a corporation, which is normally the fiscal period it has adopted for accounting purposes, cannot exceed 53 weeks. The tax year need not be the calendar year. Once selected, the tax year cannot be changed without approval from the tax authorities.
## Tax returns
Both the federal and the provincial/territorial corporate tax systems operate on an essentially self-assessing basis. All corporations must file federal income tax returns. Alberta and Quebec tax returns must also be filed by corporations that have PEs in those provinces, regardless of whether any tax is payable. Corporations with PEs in other provinces that levy capital tax must also file capital tax returns. Tax returns must be filed within six months of the corporation's tax year-end. No extensions are available. 
For taxation years beginning after 2023, all corporations (exceptions apply) must electronically file (e-file) their CIT returns via the Internet. Also, for information returns filed after 2023, filers that submit more than five returns annually (50 before 2024) must e-file via the Internet. Penalties are assessed for failure to e-file.
## Payment of tax
Corporate tax instalments are generally due on the last day of each month (although some CCPCs can remit quarterly instalments if certain conditions are met). Any balance payable is generally due on the last day of the second month following the end of the tax year. Effective 1 January 2024, corporations must make all tax payments or remittances of more than CAD 10,000 to the Receiver General for Canada electronically, except in special circumstances that preclude it.
## Functional currency
The amount of income, taxable income, and taxes payable by a taxpayer is determined in Canadian dollars. However, certain corporations resident in Canada can elect to determine their Canadian tax amounts in the corporation's 'functional currency'.
## Tax audit process
The tax authorities are required to issue an assessment notice within a reasonable time following the filing of a tax return. These original assessments usually are based on a limited review, if any, of the corporation's income tax return. However, the notice of assessment will identify any changes made (e.g. correcting discrepancies on any balances carried forward). While the tax authorities are required to review an initial return with due dispatch, there is no requirement to accept amended filings, although administratively these are generally allowed but are not given any priority. In general, the CRA targets its resources on high-risk taxpayers, with minimal resources spent on lower-risk taxpayers.
Traditionally, all corporations with gross income over CAD 250 million, and their affiliates, are assigned a large case file team and undergo an annual risk assessment. Corporations rated as high risk are generally audited annually. Medium-sized corporations (gross income between CAD 20 million and CAD 250 million) generally are selected based on a screening process and identified risks. Smaller corporations, which are usually CCPCs with gross income under CAD 20 million, have been subject to compliance or restricted audits, selected based on statistical data and a screening process. Audits of CCPCs are generally restricted to covering the current and one previous taxation year.
CRA officials have the authority to require persons to answer questions in any form specified by them and to provide reasonable assistance for any purpose related to the administration or enforcement of the relevant statute. Upon royal assent of the enacting legislation, draft legislative proposals:
  * allow the CRA to issue a new ‘notice of non-compliance’ and levy a monetary penalty
  * permit the CRA to require any information or documents to be provided under oath or affirmation
  * impose a penalty when the CRA obtains a compliance order against a taxpayer, and
  * extend the 'stop-the-clock' rules to apply when a taxpayer seeks judicial review of any CRA action in relation to the audit and enforcement process.


## Statute of limitations
A reassessment of the tax payable by a corporation that is not a CCPC may be made within four years from the date of mailing of the original notice of assessment, usually following a detailed field audit of the return and supporting information. The limitation period is three years for CCPCs. The three-year and four-year limits are extended a further three years in some cases (e.g. transactions with non-arm's-length non-residents). The CRA can also reassess tax, after the end of the normal reassessment period, on a gain from the disposition of real or immovable property if the taxpayer does not initially report the disposition. Reassessments generally are not permitted beyond these limits unless there has been misrepresentation or fraud. Different time limits may apply for provincial reassessments.
The reassessment period of a taxpayer is extended by:
  * three years for income arising in connection with a foreign affiliate of a taxpayer
  * a ‘stop-the-clock’ rule that applies when a requirement for information or compliance order is being contested in court; the reassessment period is extended by the amount of time during which the requirement or compliance order is being contested, and
  * three years to the extent the reassessment relates to a loss carryback previously claimed, where a reassessment is made to the loss as a consequence of a transaction involving a taxpayer and a non-arm’s-length non-resident, for taxation years in which a carried back loss is claimed.


The definition of 'transaction' used in the transfer pricing rules applies for the purposes of the extended reassessment period relating to transactions between a taxpayer and non-arm's-length non-resident persons.
## Appeals
A taxpayer that disagrees with a tax assessment or reassessment may appeal. The first step is to file a formal notice of objection within 90 days from the date of mailing of the notice of assessment or reassessment, setting out the reasons for the objection and other relevant information. Different time limits may apply for provincial reassessments. Corporations that qualify as 'large corporations' must file more detailed notices of objection. The CRA will review the notice of objection and vacate (cancel), amend, or confirm it. A taxpayer that still disagrees has 90 days to appeal the CRA's decision to the Tax Court of Canada, and, if necessary, to the Federal Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada. However, the Supreme Court hears very few income tax appeals.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Topics of interest to Canadian tax authorities include:
  * Transfer pricing (inbound and outbound), including the quantum and deductibility of: 
    * royalty payments made by Canadian corporations
    * goods and services
    * business restructuring expenses incurred by a group of corporations located in more than one country
    * interest rates and interest paid on loans if the funds derived from the loans are used offshore
    * guarantee fees paid by Canadian corporations
    * management fees and general and administrative expenses, and
    * ‘hybrid mismatch’ financial instruments (the CRA has been challenging a Canadian interest deduction by recharacterising debt as equity when the recipient of the interest is not taxable in their home country); _see Hybrid mismatch arrangements in the section for more information_.
  * Whether non-residents have a PE in Canada.
  * Treaty shopping to reduce Canadian WHT and capital gains tax.
  * Manipulation of tax attributes, including: 
    * surplus stripping to reduce Canadian WHT by increasing a Canadian corporation's paid-up capital and subsequently distributing the surplus as a return of capital
    * arrangements that manipulate the adjusted cost base of capital assets, and
    * the acquisition of tax losses realised by arm’s-length entities.
  * The requirement to withhold tax on certain payments made to a non-resident that relate to fees, commissions, or other amounts in respect of services rendered in Canada.
  * Transaction costs, including professional fees, related to business restructuring.
  * Deductibility of reserves (contingent or unsupported amounts).
  * Foreign exchange gains and losses (current or capital).
  * Cash pooling arrangements.


Canadian tax authorities also continue to focus their audit activity on employers who fail to withhold tax or apply for a treaty waiver of Regulation 102 withholding for commuters and business travellers (_see Withholding tax for non-resident employees in the section for more details_). The CRA also conducts ‘Employer compliance audits’ that focus on two main questions:
  * Who is the primary beneficiary of an employee benefit?
  * What is the value of benefits provided to employees?


When the employer is the primary beneficiary of the benefit, there would be no taxable benefit to the employee(s). The value of the benefit is generally the fair market value of the benefit, not the cost to the employer.
## General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR)
The GAAR was first introduced in 1988 and was designed to challenge transactions or series of transactions that would directly or indirectly result in a tax benefit when:
  * a taxpayer relies on specific provisions of the Income Tax Act to achieve an outcome that those provisions seek to prevent
  * a transaction defeats the underlying rationale of the provisions that are relied upon, or
  * an arrangement circumvents the application of certain provisions, such as specific anti-avoidance rules, in a manner that frustrates or defeats the object, spirit, or purpose of those provisions.


If GAAR applies, the CRA may deny any deduction, exemption, or exclusion in computing taxable income or the nature of any payment or other amount may be recharacterised to deny the tax benefit that would result from an avoidance transaction.
In response to a 2018 Federal Court of Appeal decision (_Wild v. Canada_ 2018 FCA 114), the Income Tax Act has been amended to provide that the GAAR can apply to transactions affecting tax attributes that have not yet become relevant to the computation of tax, for transactions undertaken after 6 April 2022 (and transactions before 7 April 2022 under notices of determination issued after 6 April 2022 in respect of the transactions).
To strengthen the GAAR, recently enacted legislation amends the GAAR by:
  * introducing a preamble to guide the interpretation of the GAAR, effective 20 June 2024
  * for transactions that occur after 2023: 
    * lowering the avoidance transaction standard
    * introducing an economic substance rule, and
    * applying a three-year extension of the normal reassessment period, and
  * implementing a 25% penalty, effective for transactions that occur after 19 June 2024.


## Foreign reporting
Reporting requirements apply to taxpayers with offshore investments. The rules impose a significant compliance burden for taxpayers with foreign affiliates. Failure to comply can result in substantial penalties. The filing due date of T1134 information returns for foreign affiliates is ten months after year-end.
## Exchange of tax information on digital economy platform sellers
Model rules developed by the OECD for reporting by digital platform operators with respect to platform sellers are enacted in Canada and require reporting platform operators that provide support to reportable sellers for relevant activities to determine the jurisdiction of residence of their reportable sellers and report to the CRA certain information about those sellers by 31 January of the year following the reporting calendar year.
This generally applies to platform operators that are resident in Canada for tax purposes, as well as platform operators that are not resident in Canada or a partner jurisdiction and that facilitate relevant activities by sellers resident in Canada or with respect to rental of immovable property located in Canada (certain exceptions apply). A partner jurisdiction will be identified as such by the Minister of National Revenue on the CRA’s website or by any other means that the Minister considers appropriate.
The rules apply to calendar years beginning after 2023. The first reporting and exchange of information will take place in early 2025 with respect to the 2024 calendar year.
## Tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance
In recent years, the federal government has made significant investments to strengthen the CRA's ability to unravel complex tax schemes and increase collaboration with international partners. Initiatives that have been introduced include:
  * hiring additional auditors to investigate high-risk multinational corporations
  * increasing the number of CRA annual examinations of high-risk wealthy taxpayers
  * increasing twelve-fold the number of transactions examined by the CRA
  * creating a special CRA programme to stop 'the organisations that create and promote tax schemes for the wealthy'
  * hiring additional auditors and specialists with a focus on the underground economy
  * developing robust business intelligence infrastructure and risk assessment systems to target high-risk international tax and abusive tax avoidance cases, and
  * extending the reassessment period by three years in respect of income arising in connection with a foreign affiliate.


Previously implemented tax measures to help the CRA combat international tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance follow:
  * Certain financial intermediaries are required to report to the CRA international electronic funds transfers of CAD 10,000 or more.
  * The ‘Offshore Tax Informant Program’ compensates certain persons who provide information that leads to the assessment or reassessment of over CAD 100,000 in federal tax (Quebec has a similar program, the 'Reward Program for Informants of Transaction Covered by the General Anti-Avoidance Rule and Sham Transactions').
  * Failure to timely file Form T1135 (Foreign Income Verification Statement), or to report all specified foreign property therein, will extend the normal assessment period for this form by three years.
  * The timeline to file Form T1134 (Information Return Relating to Controlled and Non-controlled Foreign Affiliates) has been reduced from 15 months to ten months after year-end (_see Foreign reporting above_).


There are now many offshore audits and criminal investigations with links to offshore transactions underway. The government is also aggressively pursuing those who promote tax avoidance schemes, imposing penalties on these third parties.
The federal government has made investments to improve the CRA's information technology systems, including replacing legacy systems, so that the infrastructure used to fight tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance continues to evolve.
The federal government has made recent investments to:
  * Assist with the implementation of a publicly accessible corporate beneficial ownership registry to be used by law enforcement, tax, and other authorities to access accurate and up-to-date information on the individuals who own and control corporations and to catch those who attempt to launder money, evade taxes, or commit other financial crimes.
  * Further combat tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance, allowing the CRA to fund new initiatives and extend existing programs, including:
    * Increasing GST/HST audits of large businesses with the greatest risk of non-compliance.
    * Modernising the CRA’s risk assessment process to prevent unwarranted and fraudulent GST/HST refund and rebate claims and improve the ability to issue refunds to compliant businesses as quickly as possible.
    * Enhancing capacity to identify tax evasion involving trusts and provide better service to executors and trustees.


  * Improve the CRA's ability to collect outstanding tax debts in a timely way.
  * Implement new technologies, tools, and IT infrastructure that match the growing sophistication of cyber threats and to improve the way benefits and services are delivered to Canadians.


The 2022 federal budget made a five-year commitment to:
  * Launch and lead a financial sector legislative review focused on the digitalisation of money and maintaining financial sector stability and security, with the first phase directed at digital currencies (including targeted consultations on crypto-assets; in November 2023, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions launched a consultation on the public disclosure of crypto-asset exposures by federally-regulated financial institutions in Canada).
  * Expand CRA audits of larger entities and non-residents engaged in aggressive tax planning.


The 2024 federal budget proposes changes that would ensure that CRA officials who carry out criminal investigations are authorised to seek general warrants through court applications to help fight tax evasion and other financial crimes.
## Mandatory disclosure rules
To facilitate the timely receipt by the CRA of information on arrangements that involve aggressive tax planning, Canada’s mandatory disclosure rules have been enhanced by:
  * changing the Income Tax Act’s existing reportable transaction rules
  * introducing requirements to report ‘notifiable transactions’ and for specified corporations to report uncertain tax treatments
  * extending the reassessment period in certain circumstances, and
  * introducing penalties for non-compliance that will apply to both taxpayers and promoters or advisers.


### Reportable transactions
Previous rules in the Income Tax Act required the reporting of a transaction to the CRA if it was considered an ‘avoidance transaction,’ as that term is defined for the purposes of the general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR), and it met at least two of three defined hallmarks. This resulted in only limited reporting by taxpayers.
To improve the effectiveness of the reportable transactions rules and to bring them in line with international best practices, the updated rules require that only one of the hallmarks be present for a transaction to be reportable. They amend the definition of ‘avoidance transaction’ for these purposes so that the rules apply if it can reasonably be concluded that one of the main purposes of entering into the transaction is to obtain a tax benefit. Additional amendments deal with promoters or advisers who promote these transactions and require them to also disclose these transactions.
### Notifiable transactions
A new category of specific transactions, known as ‘notifiable transactions', give the Minister of National Revenue, with the concurrence of the Minister of Finance, the authority to designate a transaction as a notifiable transaction. Similar to the approach taken by the United States, notifiable transactions include both transactions that the CRA has found to be abusive and transactions identified as transactions of interest. The description of a notifiable transaction sets out the fact patterns or outcomes that constitute that transaction in sufficient detail to enable taxpayers to comply with the disclosure rule. Effective 1 November 2023, five types of transactions have been officially designated as 'notifiable transactions,' including:
  * creating loss straddle transactions using a partnership
  * avoiding the deemed disposal of trust property
  * manipulating bankruptcy status to reduce a forgiven amount relating to a commercial obligation
  * relying on purpose tests in section 256.1 of the Income tax Act (tax attribute trading restrictions) to avoid a deemed acquisition of control, and
  * using back-to-back arrangements to circumvent the thin capitalisation rules and Part XIII WHT.


### Uncertain tax treatments
Specified corporate taxpayers are required to report particular uncertain tax treatments to the CRA (similar to the reporting regime in the United States) when the following conditions are met:
  * the corporation is required to file a Canadian return for the taxation year
  * the corporation has at least CAD 50 million in assets at the end of the financial year that coincides with the taxation year
  * the corporation or related corporation has audited financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS or other country-specific GAAP relevant for domestic public companies, and 
  * there is an uncertain tax position related to the corporation’s Canadian income tax reflected in the audited financial statements.


The requirement to report particular uncertain tax treatments also applies to a private corporation that meets the asset threshold if it, or a related corporation, has audited financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.
For each reportable uncertain tax treatment of a corporation, the legislation requires the corporation to provide prescribed information, such as the quantum of taxes at issue, a concise description of the relevant facts, the tax treatment taken, and whether the uncertainty relates to a permanent or temporary difference in tax.
### Effective date
The changes to the existing 'reportable transactions' rules in the Income Tax Act and new requirement for taxpayers to report 'notifiable transactions' are effective for transactions entered into after 21 June 2023. The requirement for 'specified corporations' to report 'uncertain tax treatments' is effective for taxation years beginning after 2022.
## Audit File Resolution Committee (AFRC)
The AFRC was established as a pilot project pursuant to the recommendations of the Offshore Compliance Advisory Committee. The AFRC includes senior representatives from the International, Large Business and Investigations, Domestic Compliance Programs, the CRA's Legislative Policy and Regulatory Affairs branches, as well as the Department of Justice. CRA auditors must refer files to the AFRC when the amounts are material, the issue is novel, or the file has implications in resolving other cases (i.e. when there are common issues present in a number of audit files that should be resolved in a consistent fashion). The AFRC’s mandate is to consider audit agreement proposals to ensure fairness and consistency as well as, when possible, to identify options that promote timely and efficient resolution of files at the audit stage.
Audit agreements may be beneficial in that they could reduce the overall tax liability, provide an acceptable resolution to an audit, and avoid additional costs if the issue were to be litigated. An audit agreement may also provide certainty in subsequent taxation years. However, entering into an audit agreement generally requires a waiver of objection and appeal rights in respect of the issues covered by the audit agreement.
## Voluntary Disclosures Program (VDP)
In certain circumstances, penalties for non-compliance with tax reporting and payment requirements may be waived through an application to the CRA's VDP. The taxpayer must meet five conditions to qualify for the programme. The application must:
  * be voluntary
  * be complete
  * involve the application or potential application of a penalty
  * include information that is at least one year past due, and
  * include payment of the estimated tax owing.


Key aspects of the VDP include:
  * two 'tracks' of disclosures: 
    * a Limited Program when there is intentional conduct to be non-compliant or for corporations with gross revenue exceeding CAD 250 million in at least two of their last five taxation years and any related entities; requires participants to waive their right to object and appeal in respect of the issue disclosed, and
    * a General Program when the Limited Program does not apply
  * a pre-disclosure discussion service
  * referral of transfer pricing applications to the Transfer Pricing Review Committee (and therefore, no relief will be granted under the VDP)
  * specialist review of complex issues or large dollar amounts
  * disclosure of the identity of an adviser who assisted the taxpayer in respect of the non-compliance, and
  * cancellation of previous relief if a VDP application was incomplete due to misrepresentation.


VDP relief is not considered for applications that depend on an agreement being made at the discretion of the Canadian competent authority under a tax treaty provision. If a VDP application does not qualify for VDP relief, a taxpayer may still qualify for penalty and interest relief under the taxpayer relief provisions.
## Sharing information for criminal matters
The CRA can use the legal tools available under the Mutual Legal Assistance Criminal Matters Act to facilitate the sharing of information related to tax offences under Canada’s tax treaties, TIEAs, and the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters. These tools include the ability for the Attorney General to obtain court orders to gather and send information. Tax information can be shared with Canadian mutual legal assistance partners for acts that, if committed in Canada, would constitute terrorism, organised crime, money laundering, criminal proceeds offences, or designated substance offences.
## Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS)
Canada has been and continues to be an active participant in the BEPS Action Plan, a project of the OECD and the G20. BEPS refers to tax planning strategies that exploit gaps and mismatches in national tax laws to shift profits to low- or no-tax locations. The government will act on the recommendations from the BEPS Action Plan (final report issued 5 October 2015) relating to:
  * CbC reporting (_see Country-by-country [CbC] reporting in the section for more information_)
  * transfer pricing guidance (_see Transfer pricing in the section for more information_)
  * treaty abuse (_see Treaty shopping below_)
  * minimum standards under the MLI, which includes the principal purpose test, an amended treaty preamble, and a modified dispute resolution procedure, including potential binding arbitration
  * the OECD's two-pillar approach to address tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy _(see Global minimum tax and the new international tax framework in the section and Digital services tax [DST] in the section for more information)_
  * interest deductibility limits (_see Interest deductibility limits in the section for more information_)
  * hybrid mismatch arrangements (_see Hybrid mismatch arrangements in the_  _section for more information_), and
  * the spontaneous exchange of tax rulings.


The government continues to work with its international partners to improve and update the international tax system and to ensure a coherent response to fight cross-border tax avoidance. In addition, the government has proposed consultations on enhancements to Canada's transfer pricing rules and has implemented expanded mandatory disclosure rules (_see Mandatory_ _disclosure rules above for more information_). 
### Spontaneous exchange of tax rulings
The CRA shares select Canadian tax rulings with certain countries, in accordance with BEPS Action 5. The types of tax rulings shared include cross-border rulings related to ‘preferential regimes’, transfer pricing legislation, and those providing a downward adjustment not directly reflected in the taxpayer’s accounts, as well as PE rulings and related-party conduit rulings. Canada will share a summary of the applicable ruling with the countries of residence of the immediate parent company, the ultimate parent company, and certain other parties.
## Treaty shopping
The government is committed to addressing treaty abuse in accordance with the minimum standard contained in the final OECD and the G20 BEPS report on treaty shopping (Action 6). The minimum standard requires countries to include in their tax treaties an express statement that their common intention is to eliminate double taxation without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance, including through treaty shopping arrangements. The minimum standard also requires the adoption of one of two approaches in addressing treaty abuse, either the limitation-on-benefits approach or the limited principal purpose test.
On 29 August 2019, Canada completed the process to ratify the OECD's Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (also known as the Multilateral Instrument [MLI]). The MLI covers the minimum standards, and various other recommendations, of Action 6 (treaty abuse) and Action 14 (dispute resolution), among other things. Canada has chosen to have the MLI apply to 75 of its 93 tax treaties (the Covered Tax Agreements).
With respect to treaty abuse, Canada adopted, as an interim measure, a principal purpose test for the Covered Tax Agreements, but intends to adopt a limitation on benefits provision, in addition to or in replacement of the principal purpose test, through bilateral negotiations. To meet the minimum standards for dispute resolution, Canada has agreed to implement mutual agreement procedure and binding arbitration. The MLI entered into force for Canada on 1 December 2019. If the MLI is also in force for a counterparty (i.e. a jurisdiction that has signed the MLI) to a covered tax convention, the MLI applies for that covered tax convention for:
  * WHTs on 1 January 2020, and
  * other taxes for tax years beginning on or after 1 June 2020. 


## Quebec ‘Tax Fairness Action Plan’
Quebec's ‘Tax Fairness Action Plan’ contains actions that address tax havens, aggressive tax planning, transfer pricing, and e-commerce with suppliers having no significant presence in Quebec, among other things. Many of the actions rely on cooperation with federal authorities. It is an evolving plan that is modified as challenges arise. Key actions relating to corporations include:
  * Improving income tax auditing of CIT. The CRA: 
    * will give the Quebec government CbC reports and ask other jurisdictions to give Quebec access to similar reports concerning those jurisdictions
    * should obtain permission from tax authorities of foreign governments with which Canada has tax treaties to transfer to Quebec information obtained under these treaties, and
    * will give Quebec certain foreign reporting information.
  * Collecting sales taxes on supplies of incorporeal moveable property and services to ‘specified Quebec consumers’ by requiring foreign suppliers with no significant presence in Canada, in addition to suppliers in other provinces and territories that supply goods and services in Quebec, to register for QST (_see Provincial retail sales tax in the section for more information_).
  * Increasing penalties in respect of GAAR-based assessments to 50% (from 25%) of the amount of the tax benefit denied.
  * Strengthening the mandatory disclosure mechanism, which requires reporting to Revenu Québec of certain transactions resulting in a tax benefit, and broadening the types of transactions that must be disclosed under this mechanism.
  * Requiring mandatory disclosure to Revenu Québec of nominee agreements made as part of a transaction or series of transactions.
  * Blocking access to public contracts for businesses and promoters that have used abusive tax avoidance strategies.
  * Establishing a special regime to counter tax schemes based on sham transactions by adding new penalties for taxpayers, advisers, and promoters, and extending the standard reassessment period for an additional three years.
  * Strengthening corporate transparency by requiring that information on beneficial owners be declared to the Registraire des entreprises du Québec (REQ) and scaling up the REQ’s oversight, compliance, quality inspection, and investigation functions and implementing technology to facilitate REQ information sharing.
  * Simplifying tax compliance, tightening regulations, educating taxpayers of their rights and responsibilities, and increasing inspections in certain sectors with a higher risk of tax evasion (e.g. renovation, construction, personal placement, transportation, money-services, and cryptocurrency).
  * Deploying new tax audit initiatives at Revenu Québec, including hiring of additional staff to combat aggressive tax planning, monitor high-risk sectors, increase tax debt collection efforts, and increase inspection activities in all sectors of activity, particularly those considered at risk of tax evasion.
  * Upgrading Revenu Québec service delivery to simplify taxpayer experience and fight tax evasion and fraud by modernising computer systems and strengthening information security.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 10 December 2024
Under the Income Tax Act, a corporation incorporated in Canada (federally or provincially/territorially) will be deemed to be resident in Canada. A corporation not incorporated in Canada will be considered to be resident in Canada under Canadian common law if its central management and control is exercised in Canada. Where a corporation’s central management and control is exercised is a question of fact, but typically it is where the board of directors meets and makes decisions, provided the board takes action.
A corporation incorporated outside of Canada but with its central management and control situated both in and outside Canada will be deemed to be a non-resident of Canada if it qualifies as a non-resident of Canada under treaty tie-breaker rules.
If a company incorporated in Canada is granted Articles of Continuance in another jurisdiction, the corporation is deemed to have been incorporated in the other jurisdiction and not to have been incorporated in Canada. However, a company incorporated in Canada that is continued into a foreign jurisdiction may still maintain residency in Canada under the common law principles for the determination of residency (i.e. central management and control discussed above). Similarly, a foreign corporation will become resident in Canada if it is continued in Canada or is a predecessor corporation of an amalgamated corporation that is resident in Canada.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Canada's tax treaties generally provide that the business profits of a non-resident corporation are not subject to Canadian tax unless the non-resident corporation carries on business in Canada through a PE situated in Canada and the business profits are attributed to that PE. Canada’s tax treaties may also restrict the imposition of branch tax to situations where the non-resident corporation carries on business in Canada through a PE situated in Canada and/or limit the applicable branch tax rate. While the wording of tax treaties varies, a PE generally is defined as:
  * a fixed place of business through which the business of the non-resident corporation is wholly or partly carried on
  * a place of management, a branch, an office, a factory, and a workshop; a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry, or any other place of extraction of natural resources; a building site, construction, or assembly project that exists for a specified period, and
  * a dependent agent or employee who has and habitually exercises an authority to conclude contracts in the name of the non-resident corporation.


In some circumstances, a Canadian PE may also arise where services are rendered in Canada and certain requirements (e.g. relating to the duration of the services) are met.
The Canadian domestic definition of PE (federal and provincial/territorial) generally mirrors the above. The interpretation of what constitutes a PE is expected to be re-evaluated in light of the final report issued in 2015 by the OECD and Group of 20 (G20) on Action 7, which is focused on preventing the artificial avoidance of PE status.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 10 December 2024
Business expenses that are reasonable and paid out to earn income are deductible for income tax purposes unless disallowed by a specific provision in the Income Tax Act. Some expenses are deductible subject to limitation (e.g. charitable donations, entertainment expenses, the cost of providing an automobile to employees). Deduction of capital expenditures is specifically prohibited, but special provisions may allow depreciation or amortisation of these expenditures.
Because Canadian corporations are taxable on worldwide income, there are no territorial limits on the deductibility of related expenses. Payments to affiliates are deductible if they reflect arm's-length charges. Transfers of losses and other deductions between unrelated corporate taxpayers are severely limited after an acquisition of control.
## Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation for tax purposes (capital cost allowance) is generally computed on a pool basis, with only a few separate classes (pools) of property. Annual allowances are generally determined by applying a prescribed rate to each class on the declining-balance basis. For example, the prescribed annual rate is 20% on most furniture and fixtures, 30% on automotive equipment, and 4% to 10% on most buildings. In the year of acquisition, only half of the amount otherwise allowable may be claimed on most classes of property (the 'half-year rule').
Generally, capital cost allowance (CCA) may not be claimed until the taxation year the property is available for use. The taxpayer can claim any amount of CCA up to the maximum. CCA previously claimed may be recaptured if assets are sold for proceeds that exceed the undepreciated cost of the class.
### Accelerated capital cost allowance (CCA)
The Accelerated Investment Incentive (AII) provides an increased first year CCA deduction for 'eligible' property acquired after 20 November 2018 and available for use before 2028 (generally equivalent to three times the usual first-year CCA deduction if before 2024 and generally equivalent to two times the usual first-year CCA deduction if after 2024 and before 2028).
The AII applies to all capital property subject to the CCA rules, except manufacturing and processing and specified clean energy equipment (_see below for enhanced rules that apply to these properties_), property previously owned by the taxpayer or a non-arm's-length person, or property transferred to the taxpayer on a tax-deferred 'rollover' basis.
A 100% CCA deduction can be claimed in the first year the property becomes available for use, for:
  * manufacturing and processing and specified clean energy equipment acquired after 20 November 2018 and available for use before 2024
  * zero-emission vehicles acquired after 18 March 2019 and available for use before 2024 that are generally automotive vehicles designed or adapted to be used on highways and streets (off-road vehicles and equipment specifically excluded), and
  * zero-emission automotive vehicles and equipment acquired after 1 March 2020 and available for use before 2024 that are generally trolley buses and vehicles designed or adapted to be operated exclusively on rails, i.e. off-road vehicles and equipment. To be eligible, the vehicle or equipment must be automotive (i.e. self-propelled) and fully electric or powered by hydrogen; vehicles or equipment that are powered partially by electricity or hydrogen (which includes hybrid vehicles) will not be eligible.


The 100% CCA deduction is gradually phased out for property that becomes available for use after 2023 and before 2028, as follows:
  * For class 53 property: 75% in 2024 and 2025 and 55% in 2026 and 2027.
  * For class 43 property: 55% in 2026 and 2027.


#### Accelerated CCA: Purpose-built rental housing
Draft legislative proposals provide an accelerated CCA rate of 10% (up from 4%) for new eligible purpose-built rental projects that begin construction after 15 April 2024 and before 2031 and are available for use before 2036. Eligible property will be new purpose-built rental housing that is a residential complex:
  * with at least four private apartment units, or ten private rooms or suites, and 
  * in which at least 90% of residential units are held for long-term rental.


The accelerated CCA will not apply to renovations of existing residential complexes, but new additions to an existing structure will be eligible, as will projects that convert existing non-residential real estate into a residential complex. The AII will continue to apply to eligible property put in use before 2028.
#### Accelerated CCA: Productivity-enhancing assets
Draft legislative proposals allow immediate expensing (i.e. 100% first year CCA deduction) for property that is acquired after 15 April 2024 and becomes available for use before 2027 for the following classes of assets:
  * Class 44 (patents or rights to use patented information for a limited or unlimited period).
  * Cass 46 (data network infrastructure equipment and related systems software).
  * Class 50 (general-purpose electronic data-processing equipment and systems software).


The accelerated CCA will be available only for the year in which the property becomes available for use and is prorated for a short taxation year. Property that has been used (or acquired for use) for any purpose before it is acquired by the taxpayer will be eligible for the accelerated CCA only if certain conditions are met. Property that becomes available for use after 2026 and before 2028 will continue to benefit from the AII.
### Immediate expensing of capital property for CCPCs
In the year that the eligible property becomes available for use, CCPCs could immediately expense up to CAD 1.5 million (shared among associated CCPCs) per taxation year of eligible property acquired after 18 April 2021 that became available for use before 2024. Eligible property consists of capital property subject to the CCA rules, other than property included in CCA classes 1 to 6, 14.1, 17, 47, 29, and 51.
### Eligible capital property (ECP)
Before 2017, three-quarters of capital expenditures for goodwill and certain other intangible properties were included in a cumulative eligible capital (CEC) pool and could be amortised at a maximum annual rate of 7%, on a declining-balance basis. A portion of proceeds could be taxable as recapture or as a gain on disposition.
Starting 1 January 2017, the ECP regime was repealed and replaced with a new CCA pool, Class 14.1. Transitional rules apply. 100% of eligible capital expenditures are included in Class 14.1 and subject to a 5% declining-balance CCA rate. The rules that apply to depreciable property, such as the ‘half-year rule’, recapture, and capital gains, also apply to the properties included in Class 14.1.
Special rules apply to expenditures that do not relate to a specific property of a business. Every business is considered to have goodwill associated to it (even if no expenditures on goodwill have been made). Expenditures that do not relate to a particular property will increase the capital cost of the goodwill of the business and, consequently, the balance of the Class 14.1 pool.
A receipt that does not relate to a specific property will reduce the capital cost of the goodwill of the business, and therefore the balance of the Class 14.1 pool, by the lesser of the cost of the goodwill (which may be nil) and the amount of the receipt. Any excess will be treated as a capital gain. Any previously deducted CCA will be recaptured to the extent that the receipt exceeds the balance of the Class 14.1 pool.
CEC balances at 31 December 2016 were transferred to the new Class 14.1 pool as of 1 January 2017. The CCA depreciation rate for the transferred property in the Class 14.1 pool is 7% until 2027. Proceeds received after 31 December 2016, relating to property acquired, expenditures made, or goodwill generated before 1 January 2017, reduce the Class 14.1 pool at a 75% rate.
## Mining and oil and gas activity
Generally, mining and oil and gas companies are allowed a 100% deduction for grassroots exploration costs. Other development costs are deductible at the rate of 30% on a declining-balance basis. Generally, pre-production mine development expenses are treated as ‘Canadian development expenses’ (CDEs) (30% declining balance) instead of as ‘Canadian exploration expenses’ (CEEs) (100% deduction). In addition, mining expenses incurred that relate to environmental studies, and community consultations that are required to obtain an exploration permit or meet a legal or informal obligation under the terms of the permit, will be treated as CEEs, which may provide an immediate 100% deduction.
Oil and gas expenditures related to drilling or completing a discovery well (or building a temporary access road to, or preparing a site of, any such well) are classified as CDEs.
The AII (_see Depreciation and amortisation above_) provides an enhanced first year deduction and also generally applies to eligible CDE and Canadian oil and gas property expenses incurred after 20 November 2018 (the short taxation year rule applies to the AII for resource expenditures) and before 2028. Capital property costs are subject to the depreciation rules (_noted above under Depreciation_).
Provinces levy mining taxes on mineral extraction and royalties on oil and gas production. Most are deductible for income tax purposes. In British Columbia a non-refundable 3% tax credit is available to qualifying corporations that develop natural gas, and have an establishment, in the province. The credit can reduce the effective British Columbia CIT rate to a minimum of 9% (from 12%). Any unused credit can be carried forward indefinitely.
ITCs are available federally (and in some provinces if certain criteria are met) to individuals who invest in shares to fund prescribed mineral exploration expenditures. The federal credit in 2024 for qualified 'flow-through' share investments is 15% of qualifying mining grassroots exploration expenditures. The credit can be used to offset current taxes payable or carried over to certain previous or subsequent taxation years. A 30% critical mineral exploration tax credit (CMETC) is available for eligible expenditures:
  * incurred in the exploration and mining of eligible specified minerals that are used in the production of certain parts for zero-emission vehicles, or advanced materials, clean technology, or semi-conductors, and
  * renounced under eligible flow-through share agreements entered into after 7 April 2022 and before 1 April 2027.


Eligible expenditures can only be renounced for either the CMETC or the 15% mineral exploration tax credit (_discussed above_). Recently enacted legislation includes lithium from brines as a mineral resource for purposes of the:
  * CMETC, for flow-through share agreements entered into after 28 March 2023 and before 1 April 2027, and
  * flow-through share regime, for eligible expenses related to lithium from brines made after 28 March 2023.


Recently enacted legislation introduces the carbon capture, utilisation, and storage refundable tax credit, and a refundable investment tax credit for clean technology manufacturing (including the extraction and certain processing activities related to specified critical minerals), both of which are relevant for the extractive sector (_see Federal environmental incentives in the section_).
The flow-through share regime for oil, gas, and coal activities has been eliminated for flow-through share agreements entered into after 31 March 2023, thereby no longer allowing the renunciation of oil, gas, and coal exploration and development expenditures to a flow-through share investor.
### Extractive Sector Transparency Measures Act
The Extractive Sector Transparency Measures Act requires public disclosure of government payments made by mining and oil and gas entities engaged in the commercial development of oil, gas, or minerals in Canada or elsewhere. It also applies to entities that control another entity that engages in these activities. However, an entity will be required to report only if it:
  * is listed on a stock exchange in Canada, or
  * has a place of business in Canada, does business in Canada, or has assets in Canada, and, based on its consolidated financial statements, meets minimum asset, revenue, and/or employee thresholds.


This mandatory reporting standard for extractive companies applies to payments of CAD 100,000 or more in a year that have been made to foreign and domestic governments at all levels, including Aboriginal groups. Both monetary payments and payments ‘in kind’ must be reported.
## Scientific research and experimental development (SR&ED)
Canada provides a generous combination of deductions and tax credits for SR&ED. Current expenditures on SR&ED can be deducted in the year incurred or carried forward indefinitely to be used at the taxpayer's discretion to minimise tax payable. _See Scientific research and experimental development (SR &ED) credit in the section for information on the tax credits currently available_.
## Start-up expenses
Expenses related to the incorporation, reorganisation, or amalgamation of a corporation (e.g. cost of affidavits, legal and accounting fees, costs of preparing articles of incorporation) are not deductible for income tax purposes (except for the first CAD 3,000 of incorporation expenses, which are deductible). They are considered to be eligible capital expenditures, for which 100% of the capital cost of the expenditure is included in Class 14.1 and subject to a 5% declining-balance CCA rate. Expenses incurred after the date of incorporation generally are deductible for income tax purposes if reasonable in amount and incurred to earn income from the business.
## Interest expenses
Interest on borrowed money used for earning business or property income, or interest in respect of an amount payable for property acquired to earn income, is deductible, provided the interest is paid pursuant to a legal obligation and is reasonable under the circumstances.
## Doubtful accounts and bad debts
A reasonable reserve for doubtful accounts may be deducted for tax purposes. The reserve calculation should be based on the taxpayer's past history of bad debts, industry experience, general and local economic conditions, etc. Special rules apply for determining reserves for financial institutions. A taxpayer can deduct the amount of debts owing that are established to have become bad debts during the year, provided the amount has previously been included in the taxpayer's income or relates to loans made in the ordinary course of business. Recoveries of bad debts previously written off must be included in income in the year of recovery.
## Business meals and entertainment
Deductions for business meals and entertainment expenses are limited to 50% of their cost. This includes meals while travelling or attending a seminar, conference, or convention, overtime meal allowances, and room rentals and service charges, etc. incurred for entertainment purposes. If the business meal and entertainment costs are billed to a client or customer and itemised as such, the disallowance (i.e. the 50% not deductible) is shifted to the client or customer.
## Insurance premiums
Insurance premiums relating to property of a business are generally deductible, but life insurance premiums are generally not deductible if the company is the named beneficiary. However, if a financial institution lender requires collateral security in the form of life insurance, a deduction is allowed for the associated net cost of any pure insurance for the period.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable donations made to registered Canadian charitable organisations are deductible in computing taxable income, generally to the extent of 75% of net income. A five-year carryforward is provided.
## Fines and penalties
Most government-imposed fines and penalties are not deductible. Fines and penalties that are not government-imposed are generally deductible if made or incurred by the taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing income from the business or property.
## Taxes
Federal, provincial, and territorial income taxes are not deductible in determining income subject to tax. The tax treatment of federal capital taxes and provincial payroll and capital taxes is discussed in the _section._
## Net operating losses
Net operating losses generally may be carried back three tax years and forward 20. Special rules may prohibit the use of losses from other years when there has been an acquisition of control of the corporation.
### Corporate loss trading
Where there has been an acquisition of control of a corporation, an anti-avoidance measure to support the restrictions on the deductibility of losses, and the use of certain other tax benefits, applies:
  * when a person or group of persons acquires shares of a corporation to hold more than 75% of the FMV of all of the shares of the corporation without otherwise acquiring control of the corporation, and
  * if it is reasonable to conclude that one of the main reasons that control was not acquired was to avoid the loss restriction rules.


## Payments to foreign affiliates
Interest, rents, royalties, management fees, and other payments made to related non-residents are deductible expenses to the extent that they are incurred to earn income of the Canadian corporation and do not exceed a reasonable amount. In certain cases, the receipt of these payments by a foreign affiliate of the Canadian corporation or of a related person can give rise to FAPI, which is taxable on an accrual basis in Canada.


# Canada
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 10 December 2024
Group taxation is not permitted.
## Transfer pricing
Canadian transfer pricing legislation and administrative guidelines are generally consistent with the OECD Guidelines. Statutory rules require that transactions between related parties be carried out under arm's-length terms and conditions. The CRA has indicated that it will apply the revised OECD guidance on transfer pricing by MNEs (published January 2022) arising from the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project (the BEPS final report was issued October 2015; _see Base erosion and profit shifting [BEPS] in the section for more information_). The government’s view is that the revised guidance is generally consistent with the CRA’s interpretation and application of the arm’s-length principle and that, consequently, CRA audit practices are not expected to change significantly.
On 26 September 2018, the Tax Court of Canada (TCC) issued its decision on a transfer pricing court case involving Cameco Corporation. The decision provides important guidance on the application of Canada’s transfer pricing recharacterisation rules, the use of hindsight in determining transfer prices, and the significance of contractual terms. Some insight can also be inferred for their implications relating to transfer pricing documentation. Certain principles that were set out in the TCC decision are already proliferating current dialogue in the Canadian transfer pricing landscape. On 26 June 2020, the Federal Court of Appeal (FCA) upheld the TCC's decision, and, on 18 February 2021, the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) denied the Crown's application for leave to appeal this decision to the SCC. Following this denial, the 2021 federal budget announced the government's intention to consult on changing the transfer pricing legislation to consider the FCA's decision. The government is concerned that perceived shortcomings in the current transfer pricing rules may encourage the inappropriate shifting of corporate income out of Canada and intends to update the legislation, with a view to protecting the integrity of the tax system while preserving Canada's attractiveness as a destination for new investment and business activity.
On 6 June 2023, the government released a consultation paper to gather stakeholder input on various questions and proposals related to Canada's transfer pricing legislation. Its main focus is on potentially significant amendments to the transfer pricing adjustment rule in section 247 of Canada’s Income Tax Act to provide greater clarity on the application of the arm's-length principle in Canada and bring Canada’s transfer pricing legislation in line with international consensus on this topic. The consultation also addressed certain administrative aspects of transfer pricing, including: 
  * documentation requirements, such as the potential adoption of master file/local file
  * updated penalty provisions, and
  * simplification possibilities, such as standardised pricing for low value-adding service, routine distribution activities, and inter-company financing arrangements.


The 2024 federal budget confirmed the government’s intention to proceed with legislative amendments to implement changes discussed in the transfer pricing consultation paper released on 6 June 2023, as modified to take into account consultations, deliberations, and legislative developments since its release.
Penalties may be imposed on adjustments to income if the taxpayer has been found not to have made reasonable efforts or is deemed not to have made reasonable efforts to determine and use arm’s-length prices. A taxpayer will be deemed not to have made reasonable efforts if the taxpayer does not maintain contemporaneous documentation for its related-party transactions that is complete and accurate in all material respects with regards to the criteria set out in the legislation. The documentation must be prepared on or before the taxpayer's documentation due date, which is six months after the end of the taxation year for corporations.
The transfer pricing penalty is 10% of the transfer pricing adjustment if the adjustment exceeds the lesser of CAD 5 million and 10% of the taxpayer's gross revenue for the year. The penalty is not deductible in computing income, applies regardless of whether the taxpayer is taxable in the year, and is in addition to any additional tax and related interest penalties.
Canada has an Advance Pricing Arrangement (APA) program that is intended to help taxpayers obtain a level of certainty on transfer prices acceptable to the local tax authorities and, when negotiated as bilateral or multilateral APAs, with tax authorities in other jurisdictions. On 22 February 2024, the CRA released its revised information circular IC 94-4R2, _International Transfer Pricing: Advance Pricing Arrangements_ , to provide updated guidance and increased transparency with respect to the administration of Canada’s APA program. Notable updates include emphasis on the CRA’s practice of requiring additional information and analysis earlier in the APA process (e.g. at the prefiling stage) and clarification on the criteria considered by the CRA in determining the suitability of requests for acceptance into the APA program.
Many of Canada's international tax agreements contain provisions concerning income allocation in accordance with the arm's-length principle. These include a Mutual Agreement Procedure, which is a treaty-based mechanism through which taxpayers can petition competent authorities for relief from double taxation resulting from transfer pricing adjustments. The OECD's Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (also known as the Multilateral Instrument [the MLI]) entered into force for Canada on 1 December 2019 and applies to some of Canada's tax treaties beginning 1 January 2020 (_see Treaty shopping in the section for more information_).
### Transfer pricing adjustments
When the Canadian transfer pricing rules have applied to adjust, for tax purposes, amounts related to transactions between a Canadian corporation and one or more non-arm’s length non-residents (a ‘primary adjustment’), the related benefit to the non-residents is treated by the CRA as a deemed dividend (a ‘secondary adjustment’), subject to WHT, which can be eliminated at the discretion of the Minister of Revenue if the amount of the primary transfer pricing adjustment is repatriated to the Canadian corporation.
For taxation years beginning after 18 March 2019, an ordering rule clarifies that adjustments resulting from the transfer pricing rules must be made before applying any other provisions of the Income Tax Act. This ordering could affect the determination of penalties under the transfer pricing rules, but it does not affect the existing exemption from the transfer pricing rules for certain loans and guarantees provided by Canadian-resident corporations to controlled foreign affiliates.
Downward transfer pricing adjustment requests involving a country with which Canada has a tax treaty must be reviewed by the Canadian competent authority under the mutual agreement procedures. Downward adjustment requests involving non‑treaty countries should also be referred to the Canadian competent authority for review.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
Annual CbC reporting is required for MNEs with total annual consolidated group revenue of EUR 750 million or more (approximately CAD 1 billion). The reporting includes key metrics for each country the MNE operates in, such as: revenue, profit, tax paid, stated capital, accumulated earnings, number of employees, and tangible assets, as well as a description of the main activities of each of its subsidiaries. The reporting is due within one year of the end of the fiscal year to which the report relates.
Form RC4649 ‘Country-by-Country Report’ is the CRA's reporting form that follows the CbC reporting format recommended by the OECD in its October 2015 BEPS report on transfer pricing documentation and CbC reporting. Publication RC4651 (E) ‘Guidance on Country-By-Country Reporting in Canada' provides further guidance that is generally consistent with the OECD’s recommendations, but includes several differences.
To facilitate the sharing of this information with its international treaty partners, Canada, along with many other jurisdictions, has signed the OECD’s Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on CbC reporting. The first exchanges between jurisdictions of CbC reports occurred in July 2018. Before any such exchanges, the CRA will have formalised an exchange arrangement with the other jurisdiction and ensured that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect the confidentiality of the reports. 
It is important to determine a Canadian entity’s CbC report filing obligation by identifying whether Canada has a qualified competent authority agreement with a particular country for purposes of exchanging CbC reports. If this agreement does not exist, a Canadian MNE must file a CbC report in Canada as a constituent entity, even if a CbC report has been prepared and filed by an ultimate parent entity or a surrogate parent entity in that particular country.
Canada and the United States have signed a bilateral competent authority arrangement to allow for the exchange of CbC reports. The reports should be exchanged no later than 15 months after the year end of an MNE group.
## Thin capitalisation
Thin capitalisation rules can limit interest deductions when interest-bearing debt owing to certain non-residents (or persons not dealing at arm's length with certain non-residents) exceeds one and a half times the corporation’s equity. The rules also apply to debts owing by:
  * a partnership of which a Canadian-resident corporation is a member
  * Canadian-resident trusts, and
  * non-resident corporations and trusts that operate in Canada.


Disallowed interest is treated as a dividend paid to the non-residents and subject to WHT.
## Interest deductibility limits
Recently enacted legislation introduces interest limitation rules that are consistent with the recommendations in the BEPS Action Plan (Action 4). The new rules are effective for taxation years beginning after 30 September 2023 and limit the amount of net interest and financing expenses that a corporation (and a trust, partnership, or Canadian branch of a non-resident taxpayer) may deduct in computing its taxable income to no more than the following fixed ratio of its ‘tax EBITDA’ (taxable income before interest expense, interest income, income tax, and deductions for depreciation and amortisation, as determined for income tax purposes):
  * 40% for taxation years beginning after 30 September 2023 and before 2024, and
  * 30% for taxation years beginning after 2023.


A ‘group ratio’ rule allows a taxpayer to deduct interest in excess of the fixed ratio, where the taxpayer can demonstrate that the ratio of net third party interest to book EBITDA of its consolidated group is higher than the fixed ratio; in this case, the interest limitation would be based on the higher group ratio if the Canadian members of a group of corporations and/or trusts jointly elect into the regime with respect to the relevant taxation year.
Denied interest can be carried back three years or carried forward indefinitely.
Exemptions are available for:
  * CCPCs whose associated group has taxable capital employed in Canada of less than CAD 50 million
  * groups of corporations and trusts whose aggregate net interest expense among their Canadian members is CAD 1 million or less, and
  * certain Canadian-resident corporations and trusts that carry on substantially all of their business in Canada and have minimal investments in foreign subsidiaries, provided certain conditions are met.


For taxation years beginning after 30 September 2023, draft legislative proposals provide an elective exemption from the excessive interest and financing expenses limitation (EIFEL) rules for:
  * certain interest and financing expenses incurred before 2036 relating to arm’s-length financing used to build or acquire certain purpose-built rental housing located in Canada, and
  * regulated energy utility businesses in Canada.


## Back-to-back loan arrangements
The Canadian Income Tax Act contains ‘back-to-back loan’ rules that prevent taxpayers from interposing a third party between a Canadian borrower and a foreign lender to avoid the application of rules that would otherwise apply if a loan were made directly between the two taxpayers. The back-to-back loan rules ensure that the amount of WHT on a cross-border interest payment cannot be reduced through the use of back-to-back loan arrangements. Anti-avoidance provisions also apply to certain back-to-back loan arrangements undertaken by taxpayers using an interposed third party:
  * in the thin capitalisation rules, and
  * relating to WHT on interest payments.


In addition, these back-to-back loan rules:
  * apply to cross-border payments of rents, royalties, or similar payments (an exception is available for certain arm’s-length royalty arrangements that do not have a main purpose of avoiding WHT)
  * include character substitution rules so the back-to-back loan rules cannot be avoided through the substitution of economically similar arrangements between the intermediary and another non-resident person, for interest and royalty payments
  * apply to back-to-back shareholder loan arrangements (if there are multiple intermediaries), and
  * apply to back-to-back arrangements involving multiple intermediaries, for interest and royalty payments and for shareholder debts.


## Hybrid mismatch arrangements
Hybrid mismatch arrangements are cross-border transactions that are characterised differently under the tax laws of different countries. For example, certain financial instruments may be treated as debt in one country and equity in another country. Hybrid mismatches can also involve certain entities that are treated as separate taxpayers in one country but are treated as fiscally transparent in another country. Recently enacted legislation (the first of two legislative packages) implements rules to eliminate the tax benefits arising from hybrid mismatch arrangements; the new rules are generally consistent with the recommendations of the BEPS Action Plan (Action 2) (with modifications for the Canadian income tax context).
The first package of legislation deals with ‘deduction/non-inclusion’ mismatches relating to three types of hybrid mismatch arrangements (including mismatches involving hybrid transfers of financial instruments and substitute payments relating to these instruments). Generally, these hybrid mismatches involve situations in which a payment relating to a financial instrument is deductible by the payer and is not included in the ordinary income of the recipient. For payments generally arising after 30 June 2022, taxpayers are required to work through a series of tests to determine whether the rules would apply to particular arrangements, and, if so, the following rules apply:
  * Primary Rule: A payment by a Canadian resident under a hybrid mismatch arrangement is not deductible in Canada to the extent that it is not included in the ordinary income of a non-resident recipient.
  * Secondary Rule: A payment made by a non-resident to a Canadian resident under a hybrid mismatch arrangement is included in ordinary income of the Canadian recipient to the extent the payment is deductible in another country (if the payment is a dividend from a foreign affiliate, no offsetting deduction will be available under the normal rules for foreign affiliate dividends).


The new rules are intended to align with the recommendations of the Action 2 Report and to be interpreted based on that report (except where the context otherwise requires). However, this first package of legislation contains notable deviations from the Action 2 Report, including:
  * treating interest payments that are non-deductible under these rules as deemed dividends for WHT purposes, and
  * applying the rules to arrangements involving notional interest deductions (when no interest is actually paid).


### Denial of foreign affiliate dividend deductions
In addition to the main operative rules outlined above, the rules include a new restriction on the deductions for certain dividends received from foreign affiliates. The new rule denies access to a deduction for a foreign affiliate dividend, to the extent the dividend is deductible for foreign tax purposes by the dividend payer (or by certain other entities that pick-up the dividend payer’s income for foreign tax purposes). Unlike the main operative rules, the application of this rule does not require a hybrid mismatch arrangement.
### Anti-avoidance rule
A targeted anti-avoidance rule addresses certain arrangements that produce outcomes substantially similar to those caught by the proposed rules, but which do not satisfy the technical requirements of those rules.
The new rules will apply to payments arising after 30 June 2022 (for these purposes, this can include amounts paid or accruing after 30 June 2022).
A second package of draft legislative proposals, which will implement the remaining recommendations in the Action 2 Report, to the extent they are relevant in the Canadian context, is expected to be released at a later date and to apply no earlier than 2023.
## Hedging and short selling by financial institutions
To curtail the creation of artificial tax deductions in a financial institution group that involves the ownership of Canadian shares on which tax-free dividends are received and then entering into an SLA and short sell arrangement on these shares to qualify for dividend compensation payment deductions, legislation enacted in June 2023:
  * denies a deduction for dividends received by a taxpayer on Canadian shares if a registered securities dealer that does not deal at arm’s length with the taxpayer enters into transactions that hedge the taxpayer’s economic exposure to the Canadian shares, where the registered securities dealer knew or ought to have known that these transactions would have such an effect
  * denies a dividend deduction for dividends received by a registered securities dealer on Canadian shares it holds if it entered into hedging transactions to eliminate all or substantially all of its economic exposure to the Canadian shares, and
  * provides that, when the dividend deduction is denied in these situations, the securities dealer will be permitted to claim a full (instead of two-thirds) deduction for a dividend compensation payment it makes under an SLA entered into in connection with the related hedging transactions.


These measures apply to dividends and related dividend compensation payments that are paid or become payable after 6 April 2022 (if the relevant arrangements were in place before 7 April 2022, the measures apply after September 2022).
## Controlled foreign affiliates and foreign accrual property income (FAPI)
Under Canada’s FAPI rules, Canadian corporations are taxed on certain income of controlled foreign affiliates (typically, certain income from property, income from a business other than active, income from a non-qualifying business, and certain taxable capital gains) as earned, whether or not distributed. A grossed-up deduction is available for foreign income or profits taxes and WHTs paid in respect thereof. In general, a foreign corporation is a foreign affiliate of a Canadian corporation if:
  * the Canadian corporation owns, directly or indirectly, at least 1% of any class of the outstanding shares of the foreign corporation, and
  * the Canadian corporation, alone or together with related persons, owns, directly or indirectly, at least 10% of any class of the outstanding shares of that foreign corporation.


The foreign affiliate will be a controlled foreign affiliate of the Canadian corporation if certain conditions are met (e.g. more than 50% of the voting shares are owned, directly or indirectly, by a combination of the Canadian corporation, persons at non-arm’s length with the Canadian corporation, a limited number of Canadian-resident shareholders, and persons at non-arm’s length with those Canadian-resident shareholders).
Income from an ‘investment business’ of a foreign affiliate is generally included in its FAPI. When the income attributable to specific activities carried out by a foreign affiliate accrues to a specific Canadian taxpayer under a tracking arrangement, such activities are deemed to be a separate business. Each separate business will need to meet specific conditions, including the ‘six employees’ test, to be excluded from the investment business definition.
When the principal purpose of a business carried on by an affiliate is to derive income from trading or dealing in indebtedness, the income from that business is generally included in its FAPI. Certain minimum capital requirements apply to the trading or dealing in indebtedness rules for an affiliate to qualify for the regulated foreign financial institution exception.
### Controlled foreign affiliate status
A foreign affiliate of a taxpayer is deemed to be a controlled foreign affiliate of the taxpayer if FAPI attributable to specific activities of the foreign affiliate accrues to the benefit of the taxpayer under a tracking arrangement.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 10 December 2024
A non-resident corporation will be subject to income tax at normal corporate rates on profits derived from carrying on a business in Canada. However, Canada's tax treaties generally restrict taxation of a non-resident's business income to the portion allocable to a PE situated in Canada.
In addition, a special 25% 'branch tax' applies to a non-resident's after-tax profits that are not invested in qualifying property in Canada. The branch tax essentially is equivalent to a non-resident WHT on funds repatriated to the foreign head office. In the case of a corporation resident in a treaty country, the rate at which the branch tax is levied may be reduced to the WHT rate on dividends prescribed in the relevant tax treaty (generally 5%, 10%, or 15%). Some of Canada's treaties prohibit the imposition of branch tax or provide that branch tax is payable only on earnings in excess of a threshold amount. The branch tax does not apply to transportation, communications, and iron-ore mining companies. Nor does it apply to non-resident insurers, except in special circumstances.
Whether or not a treaty applies, a non-resident corporation that has a PE in Canada may be subject to federal and provincial capital taxes (in Canada, only financial institutions are subject to capital tax). _See the section_.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 10 December 2024
## Foreign tax credits
Taxpayers that have foreign-source income and are resident in Canada at any time in the year are eligible for foreign tax credit relief. Separate foreign tax credit calculations are prescribed for business and non-business income on a country-by-country basis. All provinces and territories also allow a foreign tax credit, but only in respect of foreign non-business income taxes.
Income or profits taxes paid to foreign governments generally are eligible for credit against a taxpayer's Canadian income taxes payable. The credit in respect of taxes paid on foreign income is restricted to the amount of Canadian taxes otherwise payable on this income. Generally, foreign tax credits are available only to reduce Canadian tax on foreign-source income that is subject to tax in the foreign country.
Foreign business income or loss is computed for each foreign country in which a branch is located. Excess foreign business income tax credits may be carried back three years or forward ten. The foreign non-business income tax credit applies to all foreign taxes other than those classified as business income tax. No carryover is allowed with respect to the non-business income foreign tax credit. Unused foreign non-business income tax may be deducted in computing income.
## Regional incentives
In specified regions of Canada (i.e. Atlantic provinces, the Gaspé region, and Atlantic offshore region), a 10% federal ITC is available for various forms of capital investment (generally, new buildings, machinery and equipment, and/or clean energy generation equipment to be used primarily in manufacturing or processing, logging, farming, or fishing). The ITC is fully claimed against a taxpayer's federal tax liability in a given year. Unused ITCs reduce federal taxes payable for the previous three years and the next 20, or may be 40% refundable to CCPCs.
The provinces and territories may also offer incentives to encourage corporations to locate in a specific region. Income tax holidays are available in Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Quebec for certain corporations operating in specific industries (e.g. commercialisation of intellectual property in Quebec and aviation or marine technology in Prince Edward Island) or meeting certain conditions (e.g. job creation for Newfoundland and Labrador).
## Industry incentives
Canada offers many tax incentives at the federal, provincial, and territorial levels, for various industries and activities, including those related to:
  * research and development (_see below_)
  * film, media, computer animation and special effects, interactive digital media, and multi-media productions
  * manufacturing and processing
  * liquefied natural gas development, and
  * environmental sustainability (_e.g. see Federal environmental incentives below_).


### Scientific research and experimental development (SR&ED) credit
In addition to the SR&ED deduction, a taxpayer can benefit from a federal ITC, which is generally a 15% non-refundable credit on SR&ED expenditures that can be applied against federal taxes payable. Alternatively, this tax credit can be carried back 3 years or forward 20, to be applied against federal taxes owing.
A qualifying CCPC can qualify for a 35% refundable tax credit annually on its first CAD 3 million in expenditures. This enhanced credit is subject to certain capital limitations.
In addition to the federal SR&ED incentives, all provinces (except Prince Edward Island), as well as the Yukon, provide tax incentives to taxpayers that carry on research and development activities in the province or territory.
### British Columbia natural gas tax credit
A non-refundable natural gas tax credit under the British Columbia Income Tax Act is available to qualifying corporations that develop natural gas and have an establishment in British Columbia. The credit can reduce the effective provincial CIT rate to a minimum of 9% (from 12%). Any unused credit can be carried forward indefinitely.
### Federal environmental incentives
Recently enacted legislation introduces refundable ITCs, and applications are now being accepted, for:
  * Carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS), equal to: (i) between 37.5% and 60% after 2021 to 2030 and (ii) between 18.75% and 30% (i.e. reduced by 50%) after 2030 to 2040 of the capital cost of eligible carbon dioxide capture, storage, and transportation equipment that will be geologically stored or sequestered in concrete in Canada. Starting 28 November 2023, claimants must meet certain labour conditions to claim the full ITC rate; if not met, the ITC rate is reduced by 10 percentage points.


  * The development of clean technologies (e.g. wind, solar, geothermal), equal to 30% of the capital cost of eligible new equipment that is acquired and becomes available for use after 27 March 2023 (the rate is reduced to 15% in 2034, and the credit is eliminated after 2034); starting 28 November 2023, claimants must meet certain labour conditions to claim the full ITC rate; if not met, the ITC rate is reduced by 10 percentage points.
  * Clean hydrogen and clean ammonia production (via eligible pathways, e.g. electrolysis and steam methane reforming), equal to 15%, 25%, or 40% (depending on assessed carbon intensity of hydrogen produced) of eligible investments made and becomes available for use after 27 March 2023 (the rates are reduced by 50% in 2034 and the credit is eliminated after 2034); starting 28 November 2023, claimants must meet certain labour conditions to claim the full ITC rate; if not met, the ITC rate is reduced by 10 percentage points.
  * Clean technology manufacturing, equal to 30% of investments in certain depreciable property that is used for qualified zero-emission technology manufacturing activities and critical minerals extraction, processing, and recycling, that are made and become available for use after 2023 (the rates are gradually phased out starting in 203,2 and the credit is eliminated after 2034).


Draft legislative proposals introduce a refundable ITC for clean electricity generation, equal to 15% of eligible investments made after 15 April 2024 and eliminated after 2034 for projects that did not begin construction before 28 March 2023; certain labour and other conditions will be attached to this credit, which must be met for claimants to be eligible for the maximum rate.
The federal government also proposes to introduce a refundable ITC for electric vehicle (EV) supply chain investment, equal to 10% of eligible investments in buildings used in Canada in EV assembly, EV battery production, and cathode active material production that are acquired and become available for use after 2023 (the rates are reduced to 5% in 2033 and 2034, and the credit is eliminated after 2034). To qualify for this credit, the claimant must also claim directly or indirectly the ITC for clean technology manufacturing (_see above_).
Corporations can claim only one of the CCUS, clean technology, clean hydrogen, clean technology manufacturing, or clean electricity generation tax credits per property if a particular property is eligible for more than one ITC (exceptions apply) but could claim more than one ITC on the relevant portions of the same project (e.g. solar powered hydrogen products).

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 10 December 2024
WHT at a rate of 25% is imposed on interest (other than most interest paid to arm's-length non-residents), dividends, rents, royalties, certain management and technical service fees, and similar payments made by a Canadian resident to a non-resident of Canada.
Canada is continually renegotiating and extending its network of treaties, some with retroactive effect. This table summarises WHT rates on payments arising in Canada. The applicable treaty should be consulted to determine the WHT rate that applies in a particular circumstance.

Notes
  1. Interest: Canada does not impose WHT on interest (except for 'participating debt interest') paid or credited to arm's-length non-residents. Most treaties have an explicit provision for higher WHT on interest in excess of FMV in non-arm's-length circumstances.
  2. Royalties: A zero royalty rate generally applies to: 
     * copyright royalties and payments for a literary, dramatic, musical, or other artistic work (but not royalties for motion picture films, work on film or videotape, or other means of reproduction for use in television), and/or
     * royalties for computer software, a patent, for information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific experience (but not royalties for a rental or franchise agreement), or for broadcasting.
Most treaties explicitly provide for higher WHT on royalties in excess of FMV in non-arm's-length circumstances. A zero rate of tax may apply in certain cases.
  3. The treaty has been signed but is not yet in force. In the absence of a treaty, Canada imposes a maximum WHT rate of 25% on dividends, interest, and royalties.
  4. The lower (lowest two for Vietnam) rate applies if the beneficial owner of the dividend is a company that owns/controls a specified interest in the paying company. The nature of the ownership requirement, the necessary percentage (10%, 20%, 25%, or higher), and the relevant interest (e.g. capital, shares, voting power, equity percentage) vary by treaty.
  5. If the other state (Canada for the treaty with Oman) concludes a treaty with another country providing for a lower WHT rate (higher rate for Kenya), the lower rate (higher rate for Kenya) will apply in respect of specific payments within limits, in some cases. This is called a ‘most favoured nation’ provision.
  6. A 'most favoured nation' provision (_see note 5 above_) in Canada's treaty with Chile reduces the WHT rate on interest from 15% to 10% on 1 January 2019 (in certain cases, the 10% rate also applied between 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2018).
  7. Canada's treaty with China does not apply to Hong Kong.
  8. The treaty status of the republics that comprise the former USSR is as follows: 
     * Azerbaijan, Estonia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan: New treaties entered into force (_see table for rates_).
     * Other republics: No negotiations are underway.
Belarus, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan will not honour the treaty with the former USSR. As a result, Canada will impose a maximum WHT rate of 25% on dividends, interest, and royalties until a new treaty enters into force. For other republics that comprise the former USSR, the status of the former treaty with the USSR is uncertain. Because the situation is subject to change, Canadian taxpayers are advised to consult with the CRA as transactions are carried out.
  9. A 'most favoured nation' provision (_see note 5 above_) in Canada's treaty with Lithuania exempts certain royalties (_as mentioned in note 2 above_) paid or credited after 31 December 2018 from WHT.
  10. For the United States, the reduced treaty rates apply, subject to the Limitation on Benefits article.
  11. The treaty or protocol is under renegotiation.
  12. Canada has provided formal notice to the Russian Federation to suspend its tax treaty with Russia, effective 18 November 2024 for taxes withheld at source and in respect of other taxes. The suspension continues until otherwise decided by the Canadian and Russian governments.




# Canada
## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 10 December 2024
## Forms of business enterprise
Canadian law is based on the British common-law system, except in Quebec where a civil-law system prevails. The principal forms of business enterprise available in Canada are the following.
  * Corporation: A legal entity distinct from its shareholders, whether public or private, incorporated federally, provincially, or territorially.
  * Partnership: A business relationship between two or more 'persons' (i.e. individuals, corporations, trusts, or other partnerships) formed for the purpose of carrying on business in common. Not treated as a legal entity distinct from its partners.
  * Sole proprietorship: An unincorporated business operated by an individual that is carried on under the individual's own name or a trade name.
  * Trust: A relationship whereby property (including real, tangible, and intangible) is managed by one person (or persons, or organisations) for the benefit of another. May hold commercial enterprises.
  * Joint venture: Generally, the pursuit of a specific business objective by two or more parties whose association will end once the objective is achieved or abandoned. Not treated as a legal entity distinct from the participants.


Foreign investors usually conduct business in Canada through one or more separate Canadian corporations, although operation as a branch of a profitable foreign corporation may be preferable during the start-up period. In addition, foreign investors may participate as partners in partnerships carrying on business in Canada or as joint venturers.
## Cross-border tax compliance
### Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters
Under the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, Canada exchanges tax information with other signatories to the convention (member states of the Council of Europe and the member countries of the OECD), based on OECD standards, but is not required to collect taxes on behalf of another country, or provide assistance in the service of related documents. Canada will continue to negotiate a provision on helping to collect tax on a bilateral basis and has agreed to include such a provision in some of its bilateral tax treaties.
### Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
The CRS for the automatic exchange of financial account information between foreign tax authorities requires Canadian financial institutions to have procedures to identify accounts held by residents of any country other than Canada or the United States, and to report the required information to the CRA. Having satisfied itself that each jurisdiction has appropriate capacity and safeguards in place, the CRA will formalise exchange arrangements with other jurisdictions leading to the exchange of information on a multilateral basis. On 10 October 2022, the OECD released amendments to the CRS, which will:
  * require financial institutions to include additional information in their annual CRS reporting
  * align the CRS with the new Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) (_see 'Crypto-asset reporting' below_) and include crypto-assets in relevant CRS definitions, and
  * integrate certain frequently asked questions into the body of the CRS text and guidance.


Participating jurisdictions, including Canada, will need to agree to these amendments and update their domestic legislation to implement the more significant changes. The 2024 federal budget proposes, starting the 2026 calendar year, to implement amendments to the Canadian rules relating to the CRS that have been endorsed by the OECD in connection with the CARF, including changes relating to electronic money products and central bank digital currencies.
### US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
Canada reports enhanced tax information to the United States under an intergovernmental agreement between Canada and the United States to improve international tax compliance and to implement the US FATCA. For calendar years 2022, 2023, and 2024 FATCA reporting, the US competent authority will not consider a reporting Model 1 foreign financial institution to be in significant non-compliance of its requirements under the intergovernmental agreement solely because of its failure to report US taxpayer identification numbers for its pre-existing accounts (certain conditions apply).
### Crypto-asset reporting
The OECD has developed a framework for the automatic exchange of tax information relating to transactions in crypto-assets, the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF). The 2024 federal budget proposes to implement the CARF in Canada, starting the 2026 calendar year. The new reporting rules would apply to crypto-asset service providers that are resident in Canada, or carry on business in Canada, and that provide services effectuating exchange transactions in crypto-assets. These service providers will need to report certain information regarding their customers and crypto-asset transactions.
## Factual control
The Canadian Income Tax Act recognises two forms of control of a corporation: _de jure_ (legal) control and _de facto_ (factual) control. The concept of factual control is broader than legal control and is generally used to restrict access to certain corporate tax advantages. Legal control of a corporation is determined generally based on the right to elect the majority of the board of directors. Factual control is defined to exist where a person has directly or indirectly, in any manner whatever, influence that, if exercised, would result in control in fact of the corporation. Many court cases have discussed which specific factors may be useful in determining whether factual control exists.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 10 December 2024
## Inventory valuation
In most cases, all property included in inventory can be valued at fair market value (FMV), or each item can be valued at its cost or FMV, whichever is lower. Most well-established and reasonable approaches to inventory costing can be used for tax purposes, except for the last in first out (LIFO) method. Conformity between methods used for book and tax reporting is not mandatory, but the method chosen should be used consistently for tax purposes. Inventory must be valued at the commencement of the year at the same amount as at the end of the immediately preceding year.
## Capital gains
Half of a capital gain constitutes a taxable capital gain, which is included in the corporation's income and taxed at ordinary rates. Draft legislative proposals increase the taxable capital gain to two thirds of a capital gain for dispositions after 24 June 2024. Capital losses are deductible, but generally only against capital gains. Any excess of allowable capital losses over taxable capital gains in the current year can be carried back three years and carried forward indefinitely, to be applied against net taxable capital gains from those years, except in the case of an acquisition of control. No holding period is required. Intent is a major factor in determining whether the gain or loss is income or capital in nature.
Non-resident corporations are subject to CIT on taxable capital gains (50% of capital gains less 50% of capital losses; proposed to increase to two thirds of each for dispositions after 24 June 2024) arising on the disposition of taxable Canadian property. Taxable Canadian property of a taxpayer includes, among other things:
  * Real estate situated in Canada.
  * Both capital and non-capital property used in carrying on a business in Canada.
  * In general, shares in a corporation that are listed on a stock exchange if, at any time in the preceding 60 months: 
    * 25% or more of the shares of the corporation are owned by the taxpayer or persons related to the taxpayer, and
    * more than 50% of the FMV of the shares is derived from real property situated in Canada, Canadian resource properties, and timber resource properties.
  * In general, shares in a corporation that are not listed on a stock exchange if, at any time in the preceding 60 months, more than 50% of the FMV of the shares is derived, directly or indirectly, from property similar to that described above for shares of a public corporation.


However, in specific situations, the disposition by a non-resident of a share or other interest that is not described above may be subject to Canadian tax (e.g. when a share is deemed to be taxable Canadian property).
The general requirement is that a non-resident vendor of taxable Canadian property must report the disposition to the CRA and obtain a clearance certificate in respect of the disposition. If no certificate is obtained, the purchaser is required to withhold and remit to the CRA 25% of the sales proceeds.
Relief from the reporting and 25% withholding requirements may be available if specified conditions are met (e.g. if the gain from the disposition is not taxable in Canada by virtue of a tax treaty Canada has with another country). However, if the parties to the transaction are related, relief is available only if the CRA is notified.
The CRA can reassess tax after the end of the normal reassessment period (three years after the date of the initial notice of assessment for most taxpayers) on a gain from the disposition of real or immovable property if the taxpayer does not initially report the disposition.
## Dividend income
Dividends received by one Canadian corporation from another Canadian corporation generally can be deducted in full when determining taxable income. However, dividends received by a ‘specified financial institution’ on certain preferred shares are an important exception and are taxed at full corporate rates. Recently enacted legislation introduces rules that also prevent financial institutions from claiming this ‘dividends received’ deduction, for dividends received on shares that are mark-to-market properties (which are generally portfolio shareholdings), to be effective for dividends received after 2023; however, the dividend received deduction is not denied for dividends received:
  * on 'taxable preferred shares' even if the share is a mark-to-market property, or
  * by an insurance corporation, subject to certain conditions.


Further, draft legislative proposals remove the 'tax-indifferent investor' exception from an anti-avoidance rule that denies the dividend received deduction in connection with synthetic equity arrangements (SEAs) for dividends received after 2024; this will prevent taxpayers from claiming the dividend received deduction for dividends received on a share in respect of which there is an SEA, including SEAs traded on a derivatives exchange.
Dividends on most preferred shares are subject to a 10% tax in the hands of a corporate recipient, unless the payer elects to pay a 40% tax (instead of a 25% tax) on the dividends paid. The payer can offset the tax against its income tax liability. The tax is not imposed on the first CAD 500,000 of taxable preferred-share dividends paid in a taxation year. Nor does it apply to dividends paid to a shareholder with a 'substantial interest' in the payer (i.e. at least 25% of the votes and value).
Dividends received by private corporations (or public corporations controlled by one or more individuals) from Canadian corporations are subject to a special refundable tax of 38⅓%. The tax is not imposed if the recipient is connected to the payer (i.e. the recipient owns more than a 10% interest in the payer) unless the payer was entitled to a refund of tax in respect of the dividend. When the recipient pays dividends to its shareholders, the tax is refundable at a rate of 38⅓% of taxable dividends paid.
### Stock dividends
If the payer is resident in Canada, stock dividends are treated for tax purposes in the same manner as cash dividends. The taxable amount of a stock dividend is the increase in the paid-up capital of the payer corporation because of the payment of the dividend. Stock dividends received from a non-resident are exempt from this treatment. Instead, the shares received have a cost base of zero.
### Cross-border securities lending arrangements (SLAs)
In general terms, in a security lending and repurchase arrangement, a counterparty transfers or lends a Canadian share to a taxpayer and the taxpayer agrees to transfer or return an identical share to the counterparty in the future. Over the term of the arrangement, the taxpayer is obligated to pay to the counterparty amounts (dividend compensation payments) as compensation for all dividends received on the transferred or lent Canadian share.
The WHT rules are modified for dividend compensation payments that a Canadian borrower makes to a non-resident lender under an SLA, to address planning undertaken by certain non-residents that attempts to avoid the Canadian dividend WHT, as follows:
  * The rules apply to compensation payments made under both SLAs and 'specified SLAs' (equity-based financial arrangements, which are similar to SLAs).
  * All dividend compensation payments made under SLAs and specified SLAs are treated as dividends for WHT purposes, regardless of whether the arrangement is fully collateralised.
  * Certain rules apply for purposes of determining the WHT rate available under a tax treaty (the general effect of these rules is to make it more difficult for a lender to access the reduced WHT rates that are available under certain treaties where the dividend recipient owns at least 10% of the shares of the dividend payer [in terms of voting rights and fair market value]).


A relieving measure for dividend compensation payments made in respect of non-Canadian shares ensures that such payments are exempt from WHT if the related SLA is fully collateralised. The scope of an existing exemption for interest compensation payments is also expanded.
## Interest income
Interest that accrued, became receivable by, or was received by a corporation is taxable as income from a business or property.
## Rental income
Rents received by a corporation are taxable as income from a business or property.
## Royalty income
Royalties received by a corporation are taxable as income from a business or property.
## Derivatives
Derivatives are sophisticated financial instruments whose value is derived from the value of an underlying interest.
### Elective use of the mark-to-market method
Taxpayers can elect to mark to market all of their eligible derivatives held on income account. The election remains effective until it is revoked with the consent of the Minister of National Revenue. Without this election, income or losses from derivatives on income account are to be reported on a realised basis. For eligible derivatives that were previously subject to tax on a realisation basis, the recognition of any accrued gain or loss at the beginning of the first election year will be deferred until the derivative is disposed of.
### Character conversion transactions
Existing rules, intended to prevent fully taxable ordinary income from being recharacterised into more favourably taxed capital gains under a 'derivative forward agreement', provide an exemption to facilitate certain commercial transactions where the economic return from a purchase or sale agreement is based on the economic performance of the actual property being purchased or sold, rather than an underlying reference property. To prevent potential misuse of this exemption, the definition of derivative forward agreement has been amended to provide that the commercial transaction exemption is unavailable if it can reasonably be considered that one of the main purposes of the agreement to purchase a security in the future is for a taxpayer to convert ordinary income into capital gains.
## Foreign exchange gains and losses
The foreign exchange gains and losses of a Canadian taxpayer that arise from business transactions (i.e. on income account), including the activities of a branch operation, are generally fully includable in income or fully deductible. Any method that is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles may be used to determine foreign exchange gains or losses on income transactions, provided that the treatment is consistent with previous years and conforms to the accrual method of accounting.
A foreign exchange gain or loss that is on capital account is treated the same as any other capital gain or loss. The accrual method of accounting cannot be used for purposes of reporting gains or losses on capital account. This follows from the CRA's view that a taxpayer has not made a capital gain or sustained a capital loss in a foreign currency until a transaction has taken place. Therefore, paper gains and losses are disregarded.
### Debt parking to avoid foreign exchange gains
To avoid realising a foreign exchange gain on the repayment of a foreign currency debt, some taxpayers have entered into debt-parking transactions. As a result, the rules require any accrued foreign exchange gain on foreign currency debt to be realised when the debt becomes a parked obligation. The debtor will be deemed to have a gain, if any, that it otherwise would have if it had paid an amount (expressed in the currency in which the debt is denominated) to satisfy the principal amount of the debt equal to:
  * when the debt becomes a parked obligation as a result of it being acquired by the current holder, the amount for which the debt was acquired, and
  * in other cases, the FMV of the debt.


A foreign currency debt will become a parked obligation if:
  * at that time, the current holder of the debt does not deal at arm’s length with the debtor or, when the debtor is a corporation, has a significant interest (i.e. generally together with non-arm’s length persons, 25% or more of the votes or value) in the corporation, and
  * at any previous time, a person who held the debt dealt at arm’s length with the debtor and, when the debtor is a corporation, did not have a significant interest in the corporation.


Exceptions will apply to certain _bona fide_ commercial transactions, and related rules will provide relief to financially distressed debtors.
## Partnership income
For Canadian tax purposes, a partnership is treated as a conduit and the partners are taxed on their share of the partnership income, whether or not distributed. A corporation is not restricted from being a member of a partnership. Income is determined at the partnership level and then allocated among the partners according to the terms of the partnership agreement. However, certain deductions, such as depletion allowances, exploration and development expenses, and donations, will flow through to be deducted by the various partners directly, as will any foreign tax credits, dividend tax credits, or investment tax credits (ITCs). Partners generally may deduct expenses incurred directly, such as interest on borrowings to acquire partnership interests, in computing income from the partnership.
Corporate partners are generally prevented from deferring taxation on partnership income in respect of partnerships in which they (together with related parties) hold an interest greater than 10% (share of income or entitlement to assets); income from these partnerships must be accrued up to the end of the corporation’s taxation year. The accrual is based on the partnership income for the fiscal period ending in the corporation's taxation year (the 'formulaic amount'), unless a lower amount is designated by the partner. Penalties can apply if the designated amount reported is less than both the formulaic amount and the actual prorated income of the subsequent partnership fiscal period. Upon request, permission to change the partnership's fiscal period may be granted. Partnerships in multi-tier structures must adopt the same fiscal period (generally, 31 December).
## Joint venture income
An unincorporated joint venture is not recognised as a separate legal entity, and no specific statutory rules govern the taxation of a joint venture in Canada. However, many business arrangements that are set up as joint ventures may be considered partnerships, and treated as such for Canadian tax purposes. Whether a partnership exists in a particular situation is a legal question based on the specific facts and circumstances.
Consistent with the partnership anti-deferral rules (_discussed in Partnership income above_), corporate participants must report their actual share of joint venture income or loss up to the end of their own year-end.
## Non-resident trusts (NRTs) and offshore investment funds
An NRT will generally be deemed to be resident for Canadian tax purposes if (i) it has Canadian resident contributors or (ii) certain former Canadian residents have contributed to an NRT that has Canadian resident beneficiaries. However, an election can be filed to deem the creation of a separate notional trust for tax purposes, referred to as a ‘non-resident portion trust’. Canadian tax will apply only to the income or gains from the properties held by the trust that are not included in the non-resident portion trust. Properties included in the non-resident portion trust are those properties that have not been directly or indirectly contributed by a Canadian resident or certain former Canadian residents (or property substituted for those properties or income derived from those properties). Many direct or indirect transfers or loans of property or services can be deemed to be contributions to an NRT.
An NRT is deemed to be resident in Canada if a Canadian-resident taxpayer transfers or lends property to the trust (regardless of the consideration received) and the property held by the trust may revert to the taxpayer, pass to persons to be determined by the taxpayer, or be disposed of only with the taxpayer’s consent.
The offshore investment fund rules affect Canadian residents that have an interest as a beneficiary in these funds. If the rules apply, the taxpayer will be required to include in its income an amount generally determined as the taxpayer’s cost of the investment multiplied by a prescribed income percentage (i.e. the prescribed rate of interest plus 2%) less any income received from the investment. Also, for certain non-discretionary trust funds in which a Canadian-resident person, and persons that do not deal at arm’s length with the person, have interests in aggregate of 10% or more of the total FMV of the total interests in the trusts, the trust is deemed to be a controlled foreign affiliate of the Canadian beneficiary and is thereby subject to the Canadian FAPI rules (_discussed below_).
## Earnings of specified investment flow-throughs (SIFTs)
Certain earnings of SIFTs (i.e. publicly traded income trusts and partnerships) are subject to a SIFT tax and are deemed to be a dividend when distributed. The rules are intended to discourage corporations from converting to income trusts. The rules do not apply to Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) that meet certain conditions.
## Foreign income
Canadian resident corporations are subject to Canadian federal income taxes on worldwide income, including income derived directly from carrying on business in a foreign country, as earned. In addition, Canadian resident corporations may be taxable currently on certain passive and active income earned by foreign subsidiaries and other foreign entities. Relief from double taxation is provided through Canada's international tax treaties, as well as foreign tax credits and deductions for foreign income or profits taxes paid on income derived from non-Canadian sources.
Foreign investment income earned directly by Canadian resident corporations, other than dividends, is taxed as earned, with a non-business foreign tax credit and a deduction for foreign income or profits taxes available, subject to certain limitations. Dividends received by Canadian resident private corporations (or public corporations controlled by one or more individuals) from non-connected foreign corporations are subject to the special refundable tax of 38⅓% (_see above_), to the extent that the dividends are deductible in determining taxable income.
The tax treatment of foreign dividends received by a Canadian resident corporation will depend on whether the payer corporation is a foreign affiliate of the recipient. Dividends received by a Canadian resident corporation from foreign corporations that are not foreign affiliates are taxed when received, with a non-business foreign tax credit and a deduction for foreign income or profits taxes available, subject to certain conditions. Dividends received by a Canadian resident corporation from foreign affiliates may be permitted to flow tax-free, subject to certain limitations pertaining to the nature of the earnings from which the dividends were paid, the foreign income or profits taxes paid, and WHTs paid in respect thereof.
To date, 24 Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs) have entered into force (one on behalf of five jurisdictions), one has been signed (but not yet in force), and Canada is currently negotiating five other TIEAs. To encourage non-treaty countries to enter into TIEAs:
  * an exemption is available for dividends received by a Canadian resident corporation from the active business earnings of its foreign affiliates resident and carrying on their active business operations in non-treaty countries that have entered into a TIEA with Canada, and
  * active business income earned by foreign affiliates in non-TIEA, non-treaty countries that have not signed the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters will be treated as FAPI, which is taxable to the relevant Canadian resident corporation on an accrual basis, if a TIEA with Canada is not concluded within a specified period from a written request to commence negotiations or from the commencement of negotiations.


_See Controlled foreign affiliates and foreign accrual property income (FAPI) in the section for a discussion on foreign affiliates, controlled foreign affiliates, and FAPI_.
### Shareholder loan rules
Non-resident controlled Canadian corporations are permitted to make certain loans to foreign parent companies or related non-resident companies without being subject to the deemed dividend WHT if appropriate elections are filed. The election may be filed on a loan-by-loan basis, and the Canadian corporation must then include interest at a prescribed rate in taxable income. The legislation also applies to loans made by, or to, certain partnerships.
The shareholder loan rules include those that are similar to the existing back-to-back loan rules, except that the rules apply to debts owing to Canadian-resident corporations rather than debts owing by Canadian-resident taxpayers, for back-to-back shareholder loan arrangements.
A back-to-back shareholder loan arrangement is considered to exist when an ‘intermediary’ that is not connected with the shareholder:
  * is owed an amount by the shareholder (the shareholder debt), i.e. the intermediary lends an amount to the shareholder of the Canadian corporation, and
  * owes an amount to the Canadian corporation or has a specified right (as defined) relating to a particular property, i.e. the intermediary borrows an amount from the Canadian corporation, and


this obligation or property is linked to the shareholder debt (certain conditions must be met).
If the rules apply to the debt owing by a shareholder of a Canadian-resident corporation, the shareholder will be deemed to be indebted directly to the Canadian corporation.
### Cross-border surplus stripping
Section 212.1 of the Income Tax Act contains an ‘anti-surplus-stripping’ rule that applies when a non-resident person (or designated partnership) disposes of its shares in a corporation resident in Canada (the subject corporation) to another corporation resident in Canada (the purchaser corporation) with which the non-resident person does not deal at arm’s length. The rule is intended to prevent the tax-free receipt by the non-resident person of distributions in excess of the paid-up capital of its shares in the subject corporation and an artificial increase in the paid-up capital of such shares. This rule results in a deemed dividend to the non-resident person and a suppression of the paid-up capital of the shares that would otherwise have been increased as a result of the transaction.
An exception to the anti-surplus-stripping rule ensures the rule does not apply when a non-resident corporation is ‘sandwiched’ between two Canadian corporations and the non-resident corporation disposes of the shares of the lower-tier Canadian corporation to the Canadian parent corporation to unwind the structure.
Some non-resident corporations with Canadian subsidiaries have used this exception by reorganising the group into a sandwich structure to qualify for this exception in a manner that increases the paid-up capital of the shares of those Canadian subsidiaries. As a result, this exception has been amended to ensure that the exception does not apply when a non-resident corporation:
  * owns, directly or indirectly, shares of the Canadian purchaser corporation, and
  * does not deal at arm’s length with the Canadian purchaser corporation.


Comprehensive ‘look-through’ rules for partnerships and trusts ensure that the cross-border surplus stripping rules cannot be avoided inappropriately through situations where a non-resident disposes of an interest in a partnership that owns a Canadian subject corporation to a Canadian purchaser corporation, nor did they deal with similar planning involving trusts. A corresponding corporate immigration rule prevents the use of partnerships and trusts to circumvent the application of the corporate immigration anti-avoidance rule in similar circumstances. These rules allocate the assets, liabilities, and transactions of a partnership or trust to its members or beneficiaries, as the case may be, based on the relative fair market value of their interest.
### ‘Foreign affiliate dumping’ rules
Transactions described as ‘foreign affiliate dumping’ involve an investment in a foreign affiliate by a corporation resident in Canada (CRIC) that is controlled by a non-resident of Canada. When these rules apply, a dividend will be deemed to have been paid by the CRIC to its foreign parent, to the extent of any non-share consideration given by the CRIC for the ‘investment’ in the foreign affiliate, and any increase in the paid-up capital pertaining to the investment will be denied. The rules define ‘investment’ broadly to include:
  * an acquisition of shares in or a contribution of capital to the foreign affiliate
  * an indirect acquisition by the CRIC of shares of the foreign affiliate that results from a direct acquisition by the CRIC of the shares of another corporation resident in Canada if the total FMV of all of the shares of foreign affiliates that are held, directly or indirectly, by the other corporation exceeds 75% of the total FMV of all properties owned by the other corporation
  * transactions where the foreign affiliate becomes indebted to the CRIC (or a related Canadian company), and
  * an acquisition of certain options in shares or debt of the foreign affiliate.


The deemed dividend can be reduced to the extent of available paid-up capital, in accordance with the paid-up capital offset rules, if an election is filed with the Canadian tax authority by the tax return filing due date of the CRIC. Any remaining dividend amount will be subject to Canadian WHT (as reduced by the applicable treaty).
These rules also apply when the CRIC makes an investment in a non-resident corporation that is not a foreign affiliate of the CRIC but is a foreign affiliate of another corporation resident in Canada that does not deal at arm's length with the CRIC.
The scope of the foreign affiliate dumping rules has been extended to include situations where a CRIC is controlled by:
  * a non-resident individual
  * a non-resident trust, or
  * a group of non-resident corporations, non-resident individuals, and/or non-resident trusts, who do not deal with each other at arm's length.


## Taxation of insurance contracts
In response to the new accounting standard for insurance contracts (IFRS 17), changes to the taxation of insurance contracts, effective 1 January 2023:
  * limit the deductibility of a new insurance reserve, the contractual services margin in varying degrees, depending on the type of insurance
  * provide a five-year transition period on the remeasurement of insurance reserves under IFRS 17 and investment assets under IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments), and
  * change the tax base for purposes of Part VI Financial Institutions Capital Tax.


## Emissions trading regimes
Under emissions trading regimes, regulated emitters must deliver emissions allowances to the government. These allowances may be purchased by emitters, earned in emissions reduction activities, or provided by the government at a reduced price or no cost. Specific rules clarify the tax treatment of emissions allowances and eliminate the double taxation of certain free allowances. Specifically, emissions allowances will be treated as inventory for all taxpayers; however, the ‘lower of cost and market’ method cannot be used to value the inventory.
If a free allowance is received, there will be no income inclusion on receipt of the allowance. In addition, the deduction for an accrued emissions obligation will be limited to the extent that the obligation exceeds the cost of any emissions allowances that the taxpayer has acquired and that can be used to settle the obligation. If a deduction is claimed in respect of an emissions obligation that accrues in one year (e.g. 2024) and that will be satisfied in a future year (e.g. 2025), the amount of this deduction will be brought back into income in the subsequent year (e.g. 2025), and the taxpayer will be required to evaluate the deductible obligation again each year until it is ultimately satisfied.
If a taxpayer disposes of an emissions allowance otherwise than under the emissions allowance regime, any proceeds received in excess of the taxpayer’s cost, if any, for the allowance will be included in computing income.


# Canada
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 10 December 2024
As a general rule, corporations resident in Canada are subject to Canadian corporate income tax (CIT) on worldwide income. Non-resident corporations are subject to CIT on income derived from carrying on a business in Canada and on capital gains arising upon the disposition of taxable Canadian property (_see Capital gains in the section for more information_). The purchaser of the taxable Canadian property is generally required to withhold tax from the amount paid unless the non-resident vendor has obtained a clearance certificate.
Canadian CIT and withholding tax (WHT) can be reduced or eliminated if Canada has a treaty with the non-resident's country of residence. _A list of treaties that Canada has negotiated is provided in the section, along with applicable WHT rates_.
## Federal income tax
The following rates apply for a 12-month taxation year ending on 31 December 2024. For non-resident corporations, the rates apply to business income attributable to a permanent establishment (PE) in Canada. Different rates may apply to non-resident corporations in other circumstances. Non-resident corporations may also be subject to branch tax (_see the section_).
Federal rate (%)  
---  
Basic rate | 38.0  
Less: Provincial abatement (1) | (10.0)  
Federal rate | 28.0  
Less: General rate reduction or manufacturing and processing deduction (2) | (13.0)  
Net federal tax rate (3, 4) | 15.0  
Notes
  1. The basic rate of federal tax is reduced by a 10% abatement to give the provinces and territories room to impose CITs. The abatement is available in respect of taxable income allocated to Canadian provinces and territories. Taxable income allocable to a foreign jurisdiction is not eligible for the abatement and normally is not subject to provincial or territorial taxes.
  2. The general rate reduction and manufacturing and processing deduction do not apply to the first 500,000 Canadian dollars (CAD) of active business income earned in Canada by Canadian-controlled private corporations (CCPCs), investment income of CCPCs, and income from certain other corporations (e.g. mutual fund corporations, mortgage investment corporations, and investment corporations) that may benefit from preferential tax treatment.
  3. Provincial or territorial taxes apply in addition to federal taxes. Provincial and territorial tax rates are noted below.
  4. For small CCPCs, the net federal tax rate is levied on active business income above CAD 500,000; a federal rate of 9% applies to the first CAD 500,000 of active business income. Investment income (other than most dividends) of CCPCs is subject to the federal rate of 28%, in addition to a refundable federal tax of 10⅔%, for a total federal rate of 38⅔%. Access to the reduced federal tax rate on active business income of 9% is restricted for CCPCs that earn passive investment income exceeding CAD 50,000 in the previous taxation year and unavailable at CAD 150,000 of investment income. 


### Zero-emission technology manufacturers
CIT rates are temporarily reduced on eligible income from zero-emission technology manufacturing and processing activities by 50% (lowering the general rate to 7.5% and the CCPC rate to 4.5%) for 2022 to 2028 (recently enacted legislation extends it to 2031), then these rates will gradually rise back to status quo by 2032 (recently enacted legislation provides an extension to 2035). To qualify for the lower tax rates, at least 10% of the company’s gross revenues from all active businesses carried on in Canada must be derived from eligible zero-emission technology manufacturing and processing activities.
### Banks and life insurers
Banks and life insurers and their related financial institutions are subject to the following:
  * An additional 1.5% income tax. A CAD 100 million taxable income exemption is available to be shared among group members.
  * For the 2022 taxation year, a one-time 15% tax, based on the average of the corporation’s taxable income for taxation years ending in 2020 and 2021. A CAD 1 billion taxable income exemption was available to be shared among group members. The tax liability was imposed in the 2022 taxation year but is payable in equal amounts over five years (i.e. included in the 2022 through 2026 federal tax filings), and the amount required to be payable for that year reduces the Part VI Financial Institutions Capital Tax liability (_see Federal capital taxes in the section_) for that same year.


## Global minimum tax and the new international tax framework
138 OECD Inclusive Framework members, including Canada, have agreed to the October 2021 Statement on a Two-Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy, which proposes fundamental changes to the international corporate tax system. The changes would provide new taxing rights that:
  * reallocate some portion of the profits of large MNEs to countries where the MNE's customers are located (Pillar One), and
  * adopt a global minimum effective tax rate of 15% (Pillar Two).


### Pillar One
The main element of Pillar One is to allocate a formulaic share (Amount A) of the consolidated profit of certain MNEs to the market jurisdictions where the sales arise. Pillar One would apply to MNEs with global consolidated revenues exceeding 20 billion euros (EUR) (expected to be reduced to EUR 10 billion after seven years) and profitability thresholds greater than 10%; Pillar One includes certain exclusions for the regulated financial services and extractive industries. The profit to be reallocated to markets would be 25% of an MNE's profit before tax that exceeds 10% of revenue.
### Pillar Two
Under Pillar Two, the member jurisdictions have agreed to enact a minimum effective tax rate of 15% on profits earned by MNEs in each jurisdiction. This minimum tax would apply to MNEs with global consolidated revenues exceeding EUR 750 million. These MNEs will be required to compute their effective tax rate (ETR) in each country where they operate. If the ETR for a particular country is below 15%, a top-up tax will be imposed to raise that ETR to 15% (this top-up tax may be reduced by a substance-based income exclusion, which is computed based on the payroll costs and net book value of tangible assets located in the jurisdiction). The top-up tax will be collected under two charging rules. The main rule is the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR), which generally requires the ultimate parent of the MNE to pay the top-up tax computed for its foreign subsidiaries (and can also apply in certain other circumstances). The Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR) is a backstop rule, which collects any top-up tax that is not collected by the IIR. The UTPR allocates this residual top-up tax amongst all countries in which the MNE group operates (and which have adopted the UTPR), based on the employees and tangible assets located in those countries. A country may also choose to adopt a qualified domestic minimum top-up tax, which is based on the Pillar Two rules, but collects top-up tax on the income of entities located in that country (rather than foreign entities).
### Coming into force and other considerations
The OECD originally expected these changes to generally come into effect in 2023 but announced that the implementation of Pillar One will be deferred until 2024 at the earliest. Pillar One will require a multilateral convention to be developed and signed by the member jurisdictions and then implemented by each member. Pillar Two will be implemented through enactment or amendment of domestic tax rules by the participating jurisdictions and is expected to generally begin coming into effect in 2024. The Canadian government:
  * confirmed that Canada is currently working with its international partners to develop a multilateral convention to implement the Pillar One rules and that its preference is for a multilateral approach; however, because a multilateral convention is not yet in force, Canada has enacted a Digital Services Tax (DST) effective the 2024 calendar year that applies retroactively to in-scope revenues earned since 1 January 2022, and
  * announced that Canada will implement Pillar Two, along with a qualified domestic minimum top-up tax (which will apply to Canadian members of MNE groups that are within scope of Pillar Two). Recently enacted legislation to implement Pillar Two in Canada will introduce the IIR and qualified domestic minimum top-up tax, effective for fiscal years of MNEs that begin after 30 December 2023; draft legislative proposals bring the UTPR into effect for fiscal years of MNEs that begin after 30 December 2024 (for these purposes, an MNE is considered to have the same fiscal year as its ultimate parent entity).


## Provincial/territorial income tax
All provinces and territories impose income tax on income allocable to a PE in the province or territory. Generally, income is allocated to a province or territory by using a two-factor formula based on gross revenue and on salaries and wages. Provincial and territorial income taxes are not deductible for federal income tax purposes. The rates given apply for a 12-month taxation year ending on 31 December 2024 and do not take into account provincial tax holidays, which reduce or eliminate tax in limited cases.
Province/territory | Income tax rate (%) (1, 2)  
---|---  
Alberta | 8.0  
British Columbia | 12.0  
Manitoba | 12.0  
New Brunswick | 14.0  
Newfoundland and Labrador | 15.0  
Northwest Territories | 11.5  
Nova Scotia | 14.0  
Nunavut | 12.0  
Ontario (3) | 11.5 or 10.0  
Prince Edward Island | 16.0  
Quebec | 11.5  
Saskatchewan (4) | 12.0 or 10.0  
Yukon | 12.0 or 2.5  
Notes
  1. When two rates are indicated, the lower rate applies to manufacturing and processing income.
  2. In all provinces and territories, the first CAD 500,000 (CAD 600,000 in Saskatchewan) of active business income of a small CCPC is subject to reduced rates that range from 0% to 3.2%, depending on the jurisdiction.
  3. The lower Ontario rate applies to profits from manufacturing and processing, and from farming, mining, logging, and fishing operations, carried on in Canada and allocated to Ontario. Corporations subject to Ontario income tax may also be liable for corporate minimum tax (CMT) based on adjusted book income. The CMT is payable only to the extent that it exceeds the regular Ontario income tax liability. The CMT rate is 2.7% and applies when total assets are at least CAD 50 million and annual gross revenue is at least CAD 100 million on an associated basis.
  4. The manufacturing and processing reduction from the general rate is determined by multiplying the maximum rate reduction (2%) by the corporation's allocation of income to Saskatchewan.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 10 December 2024
## Consumption taxes
### Federal Goods and Services Tax (GST)
The GST is a federal tax levied at a rate of 5% on the supply of most property and services made in Canada. It is a value-added tax (VAT) applied at each level in the manufacturing and marketing chain. However, the tax does not apply to supplies that are zero-rated (i.e. taxed at 0%) or exempt. Examples of zero-rated supplies include basic groceries, medical and assistive devices, prescription drugs, feminine hygiene products, agriculture and fishing, and most international freight and passenger transportation services. Examples of exempt supplies include used residential real property and most health care, educational, and financial services.
Generally, registrants charge GST on their sales and pay GST on their purchases, and either remit or claim a refund for the amount of net tax reported (i.e. the difference between the GST charged and the GST paid). Suppliers are entitled to claim input tax credits (ITCs) for the GST paid or payable on their expenses, to the extent they are related to their taxable activities, i.e. in the course of making taxable and zero-rated supplies. Suppliers are not entitled to claim ITCs with respect to GST paid on expenses relating to the making of exempt supplies.
### Harmonised Sales Tax (HST)
Five provinces have fully harmonised their sales tax systems with the GST and impose a single HST, which includes the 5% GST and a provincial component. HST applies to the same tax base and under the same rules as the GST. There is no need to register separately for GST and HST because both taxes are accounted for under one tax return and are jointly administered by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). The HST rates follow.
Province | HST rate (%)  
---|---  
New Brunswick | 15  
Newfoundland and Labrador | 15  
Nova Scotia (1) | 15  
Ontario | 13  
Prince Edward Island | 15  
Notes
  1. The Nova Scotia government proposes to decrease the province's HST rate to 14% on 1 April 2025 (i.e. the provincial portion of the HST would decrease from 10% to 9%). 


### GST/HST and the digital economy
Non-resident vendors that are considered to be ‘carrying on business in Canada’ and making taxable supplies in Canada are generally required to register for GST/HST under the regular regime, regardless of whether they have a physical presence in Canada. In addition, non-resident vendors that neither have a physical presence in Canada nor carry on business in Canada may also have the obligation to register for and collect GST/HST under a simplified regime, including:
  * foreign-based digital businesses that supply intangible personal property and services to consumers (non-GST/HST registrants) in Canada
  * non-resident operators of digital/distribution platforms that facilitate the supply of intangible personal property and services to consumers (non-GST/HST registrants) in Canada
  * non-resident digital accommodation platforms that facilitate the supply of short‑term accommodation by private residential property owners, and
  * non-resident suppliers or non-resident operators of distribution platforms participating in transactions involving goods for sale that are located at fulfilment warehouses in Canada and sold to purchasers in Canada, if the non-resident vendor is:
    * selling goods directly to consumers in Canada on their own account, or
    * using an online marketplace platform to facilitate the sale of goods to consumers in Canada.


### Provincial retail sales tax (PST)
The provinces of British Columbia, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan each levy a PST (in addition to the 5% GST) at 7%, 7%, and 6%, respectively, on most sales of tangible personal property, software, and certain taxable services.
PST generally does not apply to sales of taxable goods, software, and services acquired by the purchaser for resale; registered purchasers can claim this resale exemption by providing to their suppliers either their PST number or a purchase exemption certificate. Certain exemptions also exist for purchases used in manufacturing, farming, and fisheries.
PST is administered by each province’s tax authority, separate from the CRA. Unlike GST/HST, PST is not a VAT and is not recoverable. Therefore, any PST paid on purchases by a business cannot generally be claimed as a credit or otherwise offset against PST charged on sales.
Alberta and the three territories (the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and the Yukon) do not impose a retail sales tax. However, the GST applies in those jurisdictions.
#### British Columbia PST
British Columbia requires certain out-of-province vendors to register for PST. Non-residents of British Columbia located:
  * in Canada that sell taxable goods or services, or
  * in or outside Canada that sell software and telecommunication services,


to customers for consumption or use in British Columbia are generally required to register for BC PST if their annual revenue from sales in the province exceeds CAD 10,000.
Businesses that facilitate sales or leases of certain goods, services, or software for third parties through their online platform, including accepting payment from a consumer (known as marketplace facilitators), are required to collect and remit BC PST on those sales and leases made in British Columbia. Marketplace facilitators are also required to charge BC PST on marketplace services they provided to resellers.
#### Manitoba PST
Manitoba requires certain businesses that do not have a physical presence in the province to register for PST. Businesses providing:
  * audio and video streaming services
  * sales of taxable goods by third parties through online marketplaces, and
  * bookings of taxable accommodation through online platforms,


to Manitoba consumers are required to register for Manitoba PST, regardless of whether they have a physical presence in Manitoba. Starting 1 January 2024, the threshold at which businesses must register for and collect Manitoba PST increased from CAD 10,000 to CAD 30,000 of taxable sales. Manitoba PST commissions have been eliminated for any filing period ending after 30 April 2024.
#### Saskatchewan PST
Saskatchewan has broad registration requirements for out-of-province sellers. Businesses that operate online selling platforms are required to register for and collect Saskatchewan PST if they:
  * create or facilitate the marketplace in which retail sales of tangible personal property, taxable services, or contracts of insurance for consumption or use in or relating to Saskatchewan take place, and
  * collect payment from a consumer or user of the tangible personal property, tax, taxable services, or contract of insurance and remit the payment to a marketplace seller.


Out-of-province sellers do not have to register for Saskatchewan PST if they only make sales to customers in Saskatchewan through online accommodation platforms or marketplace facilitators that are registered for Saskatchewan PST.
### Quebec sales tax (QST)
Quebec’s sales tax is a VAT structured in the same manner as the GST/HST. The QST is charged in addition to the 5% GST and is levied at the rate of 9.975% on the supply of most property and services made in the province of Quebec, resulting in an effective combined rate of 14.975%. Registrants charge QST on taxable supplies (that are not zero-rated) and can claim input tax refunds for QST paid or payable on their expenses/purchases, to the extent they are incurred/made in the course of their commercial activity. The resulting net tax is reported to Revenu Québec (Quebec’s tax authority) and is either remitted or claimed as a refund. Revenu Québec also administers the GST/HST on behalf of the CRA for most registrants that are resident in the province.
The mandatory QST registration rules, under the regular QST regime, also apply to non-residents of Quebec where they are carrying on business in Quebec. Suppliers that are not residents of, and have no physical or significant presence in, Quebec, and that make digital and certain other supplies to ‘specified Quebec consumers’ may be required to register for QST under a specified registration system.
The requirement to register may also apply to operators of digital/distribution platforms relating to taxable supplies of incorporeal moveable property or services received by specified Quebec consumers if these operators of digital platforms control the key elements of the transaction.
Quebec has harmonised its QST system with the federal GST/HST measures on the digital economy (_see above_). Operators of distribution platforms that sell foreign goods located in fulfilment warehouses in Canada and operators of short-term accommodation platforms are required to register and collect QST on certain sales made to Quebec consumers.
## Customs and import duties
Customs tariffs (also known as duties) are levied on goods imported into Canada. The amount of customs duty that applies to imported goods depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the duty (i.e. _ad valorem_ or specific), tariff classification, country of origin, and value for duty declared. The Tariff Schedule to the Customs Tariff, which is based on the World Customs Organization’s Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, sets out the customs duty rates for goods imported into Canada. Goods that originate from most countries with which Canada does not have a free trade agreement (FTA) or other preferential tariff arrangement will generally attract the ‘Most Favoured Nation’ (MFN) duty rate or tariff treatment. North Korea, Russia, and Belarus are currently not eligible for MFN, and imports of goods originating in these countries would normally be subject to a standard 35% duty rate (certain exceptions to the 35% rate may apply – rate may be higher or lower in limited cases for the General Tariff).
Canada has a number of FTAs that may present benefits to eligible traders. Canada's most significant FTA is the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA). The CUSMA applies to goods imported from both the United States (US) and Mexico, and exports from Canada to those countries as well. Most goods that originate in the CUSMA territory and qualify as originating for the CUSMA are eligible for duty-free treatment when imported into Canada from another CUSMA partner (some exceptions apply).
The Canada-United Kingdom Trade Continuity Agreement allows Canada and the United Kingdom (UK) to preserve benefits that were available to both when the United Kingdom was part of the European Union (EU) and that were relinquished upon Brexit. This agreement will serve as an interim 'stop-gap' until a new agreement can be fully negotiated. 
The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) entered into force on 30 December 2018 between Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Singapore, and Japan; on 14 January 2019 with Vietnam; on 19 September 2021 with Peru; on 29 November 2022 with Malaysia; on 21 February 2023 with Chile; and on 12 July 2023 for Brunei. On 16 July 2023, the United Kingdom became the 12th member of the CPTPP; it will enter into force with the UK only after all ratification procedures have been completed. China, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Taiwan, Ukraine, and Uruguay have submitted notification of intent to begin the CPTPP accession process.
Canada’s other FTAs are with Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the European Free Trade Association (which includes Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland), the European Union, Honduras, Israel, Jordan, the Republic of Korea, Panama, Peru, and Ukraine. Under these FTAs, the originating goods imported from these countries may be eligible for reduced tariff benefits at rates more favourable than the MFN rate.
Canada is also in negotiations with several other countries (e.g. Japan, India, and Dominican Republic) or country groupings (e.g. the Mercosur countries, consisting of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and the Association of South Asian Nations [ASEAN], which includes Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore). Like the CUSMA, these FTAs will set out the rules of origin for determining whether goods are eligible for preferential tariff treatment, among other things. Exploratory discussions have also taken place with China, Türkiye, Philippines, and Thailand, but progress may be stalled at the present time.
Canada also extends preferential tariff rates to many (but not all) products imported from certain countries via the General Preferential Tariff, the Least Developed Countries Tariff, the Commonwealth Caribbean Countries Tariff, the Australia Tariff, and the New Zealand Tariff. To qualify for preferential tariff rates, goods must meet various requirements with respect to the rules of origin and transshipment, among other things.
### Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) Assessment and Revenue Management (CARM)
The CBSA has launched a new initiative, the CARM, to transform and modernise the collection of duties and taxes for commercial goods being imported into Canada. The initiative targeted the revenue and cash management systems that were previously in place for assessing and collecting duties and taxes and replaced them with a simplified process that includes electronic payment options. The CARM became fully operational on 21 October 2024 and participation is mandatory for all Canadian-resident and non-resident businesses that import goods into Canada and their trade chain partners that interact with the CBSA; there will be a Release Prior to Payment (RPP) transition period, in which importers will be assigned RPP qualifying status for a 180-day transition period (allowing them to adapt to the new model while ensuring that border disruptions are mitigated). 
Importers that do not participate in the CARM will be required to formally disclose their goods and pay the applicable duties/taxes due at the border before customs will release their goods. The CARM had become available in October 2023 for selected industry partners who wanted to test their own internal systems and for software service providers to continue to certify their software with CARM; it was then launched internally at the CBSA in May 2024.
### Other import duties and levies
Importations into Canada may also be subject, in certain cases, to anti-dumping duties and/or countervailing duties, excise duties, and excise taxes. In limited circumstances, Canada may also impose a surtax on certain imports, as evidenced by recent tariffs on certain Chinese origin goods (e.g. steel and aluminium products and Chinese-made electric vehicles).
### Supply chain transparency and Canada’s Modern Slavery Act
Reporting standards and stakeholder activists are increasing the pressure for organisations to proactively identify and mitigate forced and child labour risks from their supply chains. The impact and exposure from supply chain disruption and regulatory complexity has made human rights due diligence a key priority for executives, both to act ethically and mitigate impact to the bottom line. In Canada, the Fighting Against Forced Labour and Child Labour in Supply Chains Act imposes a series of disclosure requirements on both government institutions and companies with connections to Canada. This legislation came into force on 1 January 2024, and affected entities were required to produce their first annual Slavery Report by 31 May 2024.
Generally, an entity that makes, buys, or imports goods produced outside Canada, or distributes, sells physical goods, or conducts business in Canada, must comply with these new rules. Entities impacted by the legislation include those:
  * listed on a Canadian stock exchange, or
  * that have a connection to Canada and meet at least two of the following conditions: 
    * Assets of CAD 20 million or more.
    * Revenues of CAD 40 million or more.
    * Employs an average of 250 or more employees.


Obligated entities must annually report the steps taken during the previous financial year to prevent and reduce the risk that forced labour or child labour is used at any step in the supply chain. All reports must be publicly available on the entity’s website and must disclose:
  * structure, activities, and supply chains
  * policies and due diligence processes
  * identification of areas that carry risk and measures taken to remediate it, and
  * employee training.


The consequences for non-compliance are serious and include financial penalties and criminal prosecution. Moreover, an importer’s goods may be deemed prohibited to enter Canada if they are found to be mined, manufactured, or produced wholly or in part by child or forced labour.
## Excise taxes and duties
### Luxury tax
A luxury tax applies on sale or import, for personal use, of:
  * luxury cars and personal aircraft with a retail sales price over CAD 100,000, and
  * boats with a retail sales price over CAD 250,000,


calculated at the lesser of:
  * 20% of the value above the sales price threshold, or
  * 10% of the full value of the luxury car, boat, or personal aircraft.


Certain exemptions apply. The luxury tax would not be assessed if the commercial importer is registered as a vendor with the CRA.
### Excise tax
Excise duties are levied at various rates on spirits, wine, beer, malt liquor, tobacco, and vaping products. When these goods are manufactured or produced in Canada, duty is payable on the goods at the point of packaging and not at the point of sale. When these goods are imported into Canada, duty is generally payable by the importer at the time of importation. Manufacturers who produce alcohol and tobacco in Canada must be licensed. Excise duties also apply to cannabis products, now that non-medicinal cannabis is available for legal sale. Persons who manufacture, produce, and/or sell cannabis products in Canada must be licensed.
Excise tax is imposed on automobile air conditioners and fuel-inefficient automobiles, in addition to aviation fuel, gasoline, and diesel fuel. A 10% federal excise tax is imposed on premiums paid for insurance against a risk in Canada if the insurance is placed by insurers through brokers or agents outside Canada or with an insurer that is not authorised under Canadian or provincial/territorial law to transact the business of insurance. Premiums paid under contracts for life, personal accident, marine, and sickness insurance, as well as reinsurance and insurance not available in Canada, are exempt.
## Tax on equity repurchases
Recently enacted legislation introduces a corporate-level 2% tax that applies on the net value of equity repurchased in a taxation year by a Canadian resident public corporation (exclusions apply). A _de minimis_ CAD 1 million exemption is available, which is determined on a gross basis (i.e. ignoring share issuances). The tax applies to repurchases of equity that occur after 31 December 2023.
## Property taxes
Property taxes are levied by municipalities in Canada on the estimated market value of real property within their boundaries and by provinces and territories on land not in a municipality. In most provinces and territories, a general property tax is levied on the owner of the property. Some municipalities levy a separate business tax, which is payable by the occupant if the premises are used for business purposes. These taxes are based on the rental value of the property at tax rates that are set each year by the various municipalities. School taxes, also generally based on the value of real property, are levied by local and regional school boards or the province or territory.
### British Columbia speculation and vacancy tax (SVT)
In British Columbia, an annual SVT is imposed on residential property in certain urban centres in British Columbia (i.e. Metro Vancouver Regional District, Capital Regional District and 26 other municipalities, of which 13 are newly subject to the SVT in 2024, with declarations commencing in January 2025); most islands in British Columbia are excluded, except Vancouver Island. The SVT targets foreign and domestic homeowners who do not pay income tax in British Columbia above a certain threshold, including those who leave their homes vacant. The tax rate, as a percentage of the property’s assessed value on 1 July of the previous year, is:
  * 2% for foreign investors and satellite families, and
  * 0.5% for British Columbians and all other Canadian citizens or permanent residents who are not members of a satellite family.


Up-front exemptions are available for most principal residences and for qualifying long-term rental properties and certain special cases. A non-refundable tax credit may also be available in varying amounts (depending on the type of owner) for owners subject to the SVT to reduce the amount of SVT owing.
### Federal tax on Canadian housing owned by non-residents
Starting 1 January 2022, an annual 1% federal underused housing tax (UHT) applies on the value of non-resident, non-Canadian owned residential property considered to be vacant or underused. In some situations, prior to 2023, the UHT also applied to some Canadian owners (i.e. certain corporations, partners, and trustees). Certain residential property owners in Canada are required to file an annual declaration for each Canadian residential property they own for the prior calendar year, by 30 April of the following calendar year, even if they claim an exemption from the tax. Failure to file the mandatory declaration could result in significant penalties. The tax generally applies to owners (other than Canadian citizens or permanent residents, in most cases), but exemptions are available to those who lease their properties to qualified tenants for a minimum period in a calendar year. The application of penalties and interest for the 2022 calendar year will be waived for any late-filed returns and for any late-paid tax, provided the return is filed and the tax is paid by 30 April 2024 (effectively extending the deadline for the 2022 return and payment by one year, to the same date as for the 2023 calendar year). Recently enacted legislation amends the UHT by:
  * eliminating the filing requirement for certain owners (i.e. ‘specified Canadian corporations', partners of ‘specified Canadian partnerships’, and trustees of ‘specified Canadian trusts’), effective the 2023 calendar year
  * reducing the minimum penalty for failing to file by the deadline, effective the 2022 calendar year, and
  * exempting certain employee accommodations, effective the 2023 calendar year.


## Land transfer tax
All provinces and territories levy a land transfer tax or registration fee on the purchaser of real property within their boundaries. These levies are expressed as a percentage, in most cases on a sliding scale, of the sale price or the assessed value of the property sold and are generally payable at the time title to the property is registered. Rates generally range from 0.04% to 5%, depending on the province or territory, but may be higher if the purchaser is a non-resident. Some exemptions (or refunds) are available. Additional land transfer taxes apply for properties purchased in the municipalities of Montreal or Toronto. Other municipalities may also impose these taxes and fees.
In British Columbia, a 20% land transfer tax (in addition to the general land transfer tax) is imposed on foreign entities (i.e. foreign nationals and corporations and certain Canadian corporations controlled by such foreign persons) and certain trusts and/or their trustees that have a foreign connection (a taxable trustee) that purchase residential property in the Metro Vancouver Regional District (but excluding residential property located on the Tsawwassen First Nations treaty lands), the Capital Regional District, the Regional District of Central Okanagan, the Fraser Valley Regional District, and the Regional District of Nanaimo. Failure to pay this tax or file the required forms can result in interest, plus significant penalties and/or imprisonment. Anti-avoidance rules capture transactions that are structured to avoid this tax.
Relief from the additional land transfer tax is available to property acquired on behalf of a Canadian-controlled limited partnership.
Refund from the additional land transfer tax is available, subject to certain qualifying conditions, to:
  * foreigners who become Canadian citizens or permanent residents within one year of purchasing a principal residence, or
  * foreign workers coming to British Columbia under the British Columbia Provincial Nominee Program who purchase a principal residence on or after their confirmation under that program.


In an effort to stop tax evasion when property ownership is hidden behind numbered companies and trusts, the British Columbia government requires trustees, partners of a partnership, and corporations that acquire property to identify all individuals with a beneficial interest in the trust, a partnership interest, or significant interest in the corporation on the property transfer tax return. For beneficiaries of trusts that are corporations, information about each director of the corporation must be disclosed. This applies to all property types, including residential and commercial, with exemptions for certain trusts (e.g. charitable trusts) and corporations (e.g. hospitals, schools, and libraries).
In Ontario, a 25% land transfer tax (in addition to the general land transfer tax and Toronto’s land transfer tax) is imposed on foreign entities (i.e. foreign nationals and corporations and certain Canadian corporations controlled by such foreign persons) and taxable trustees (i.e. trustees of a trust that has at least one trustee or beneficiary that is a foreign entity) that purchase residential property in the province. For this tax to apply, the land transferred must contain at least one, but not more than six, single family residence(s) (effective 27 March 2024, the tax also applies to a standalone purchase of a parking space or storage unit). The tax also applies to unregistered dispositions of a beneficial interest in such residential property when the purchaser of the interest is a foreign entity or taxable trustee. Failure to pay this tax can result in a penalty, fine, and/or imprisonment. Exemptions from this additional land transfer tax are available in certain circumstances (including for foreign workers coming to Ontario under the Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program or for refugees under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act who purchase a principal residence), and rebates of the tax can be obtained in certain situations.
In Nova Scotia, a 5% land transfer tax (in addition to municipal land transfer tax, if any) is imposed on non-residents of Nova Scotia that purchase residential real property. Exemptions are available for non-resident purchasers who move to (and become resident of) the province within six months of the transaction’s closing date.
## Federal capital taxes
The federal government does not levy a general capital tax. It imposes the Financial Institutions Capital Tax (Part VI Tax) on banks, trust and loan corporations, and life insurance companies at a rate of 1.25% when taxable capital employed in Canada exceeds CAD 1 billion. The threshold is shared among related financial institutions. The tax is not deductible in computing income for tax purposes. It is reduced by the corporation's federal income tax liability. Any unused federal income tax liability can be applied to reduce Part VI Tax for the previous three and the next seven years. In effect, the tax constitutes a minimum tax on financial institutions.
## Provincial capital taxes
The provinces do not levy a general capital tax, but most do impose a capital tax on financial institutions. Capital taxes are deductible for federal income tax purposes. The federal government had proposed to limit the deductibility of capital taxes, but has delayed implementing this proposal indefinitely. The territories do not impose capital taxes.
Provincial capital taxes on financial institutions are imposed at the following rates for 31 December 2024 year-ends.
Province | Banks, trust and loan corporations (%)  
---|---  
Alberta | -  
British Columbia | -  
Manitoba (1) | 6  
New Brunswick (2) | 4 or 5  
Newfoundland and Labrador (3) | 6  
Nova Scotia (4) | 4  
Ontario | -  
Prince Edward Island (5) | 5  
Quebec (6) | -  
Saskatchewan (7) | 4  
Notes
  1. Financial institutions in Manitoba with taxable paid-up capital of an associated group under CAD 4 billion are not subject to capital tax.
  2. New Brunswick’s capital tax rate is 5% for banks and 4% for other financial institutions. The first CAD 10 million of taxable paid-up capital is exempt from capital tax.
  3. In Newfoundland and Labrador, a CAD 5 million exemption (shared with related companies) applies if taxable capital for the related group is CAD 10 million or less.
  4. In Nova Scotia, a CAD 30 million exemption applies to trust and loan companies that have their head office in Nova Scotia. For other financial institutions, the capital tax exemption (shared with related companies) is CAD 5 million if taxable capital for the related group is CAD 10 million or less.
  5. In Prince Edward Island, the first CAD 2 million of taxable paid-up capital is exempt from capital tax.
  6. In Quebec, financial institutions are subject to a compensation tax of 2.8% on payroll. Payroll subject to the compensation tax is limited to CAD 1.1 billion annually. For independent loan, trust, and security trading companies that, in the year, are not associated with a bank, savings and credit union, or insurance corporation, the compensation tax rate is 0.9% and the maximum annual payroll subject to compensation tax is CAD 275 million (2.2% for savings and credit unions on a maximum annual payroll of CAD 550 million). The compensation tax rate on insurance premiums is 0.3%.
  7. Saskatchewan's rate for financial institutions that have taxable paid-up capital of CAD 1.5 billion or less is 0.7%. Financial institutions that qualified for the 0.7% capital tax rate in taxation years ending after 31 October 2008 and before 1 November 2009 are subject to a 0.7% capital tax rate on their first CAD 1.5 billion of taxable capital and a 4% capital tax rate on taxable capital exceeding CAD 1.5 billion. In Saskatchewan, the capital tax exemption is up to CAD 20 million (CAD 10 million plus an additional CAD 10 million, which is shared with associated companies).


## Additional taxes on insurers
All provinces and territories impose a premium tax ranging from 2% to 5% on insurance companies (both life and non-life). In addition, Ontario and Quebec impose a capital tax on life insurance companies. Quebec also levies a compensation tax on insurance premiums at a rate of 0.3%.
## Part III.1 tax on excess designations
Federal Part III.1 tax applies at a 20% or 30% rate if, during the year, a CCPC designated as eligible dividends an amount that exceeds its general rate income pool (GRIP), or a non-CCPC pays an eligible dividend when it has a positive balance in its low rate income pool (LRIP). A corporation subject to Part III.1 tax at the 20% rate (i.e. the excess designation was inadvertent) can elect, with shareholder concurrence, to treat all or part of the excess designation as a separate non-eligible dividend, in which case Part III.1 tax will not apply to the amount that is the subject of the election.
Eligible dividends are designated as such by the payer and include dividends paid by:
  * public corporations, or other corporations that are not CCPCs, that are resident in Canada and are subject to the federal general CIT rate (i.e. 15% in 2024), or
  * CCPCs, to the extent that the CCPC's income is: 
    * not investment income (other than eligible dividends from public corporations), and
    * subject to the general federal CIT rate (i.e. the income is active business income not subject to the federal small business rate).


Non-eligible dividends include dividends paid out of either income eligible for the federal small business rate or a CCPC's investment income (other than eligible dividends received from public companies).
## Payroll taxes
### Social security taxes
For 2024, employers are required to pay, for each employee, government pension plan contributions up to CAD 4,055.50 and employment insurance premiums up to CAD 1,468.77. However, Quebec employers instead contribute, per employee, a maximum of CAD 4,348.00 in Quebec government pension plan contributions, CAD 1,167.94 in employment insurance premiums, and CAD 650.48 to a Quebec parental insurance plan.
The government pension plan was enhanced starting 1 January 2019. Employers and employees are required to pay higher government pension plan contributions (to be phased-in over seven years).
### Provincial/territorial payroll taxes
Employers in British Columbia, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador, Ontario, and Quebec are subject to payroll tax. Maximum rates range from 1.95% to 4.3%. In addition, Quebec employers with payroll of at least CAD 2 million must allot 1% of payroll to training or to a provincial fund. Employers in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut must deduct from employees' salaries a payroll tax equal to 2% of employment earnings.
### Withholding tax for non-resident employees
Under Regulation 102 of the Income Tax Act, employers (whether residents of Canada or not) that pay salaries or wages or other remuneration to a non-resident of Canada in respect of employment services rendered in Canada are required to withhold personal income tax (PIT) unless a waiver has been received prior to commencing work physically in Canada. There are no '_de minimis_ ' exceptions, and this requirement applies regardless of whether the non-resident employee in question will actually be liable for Canadian income tax on that salary pursuant to an income tax treaty that Canada has signed with another country. Complying is time-consuming and administratively burdensome.
An amount paid by a ‘qualifying non-resident employer’ to a ‘qualifying non-resident employee’ is exempt from the Regulation 102 withholding requirement.
Generally, a ‘qualifying non-resident employer’ must meet the following two conditions:
  * is resident in a country with which Canada has a tax treaty (treaty country), and
  * is at that time certified by the Minister.


A ‘qualifying non-resident employee’ must meet the following three conditions:
  * is resident in a treaty country
  * is exempt from Canadian income tax under a tax treaty, and
  * either: 
    * is present in Canada for less than 90 days in any 12-month period that includes the time of payment, or
    * works in Canada for less than 45 days in the calendar year that includes the time of payment.


To become certified, a non-resident employer must file Form RC473 (Application for Non-Resident Employer Certification) with the CRA. Certification is valid for two calendar years (after which time employers must submit a new Form RC473), subject to revocation if the employer fails to meet certain conditions or to comply with its Canadian tax obligations.
The conditions to maintain non-resident employer certification include:
  * track and record, on a proactive basis, the number of days each qualifying non-resident employee is either working in Canada or present in Canada, and the income attributable to these days
  * evaluate and determine whether its employees meet the conditions of a ‘qualifying non-resident employee’
  * obtain a Canadian Business Number
  * complete and file the annual T4 Summary and slips, if required
  * file the applicable Canadian CIT returns if the corporation is ‘carrying on business in Canada’, and
  * upon request, make its books and records available to the CRA for inspection.


## Withholding tax on payments to non-residents for services rendered in Canada
Under Regulation 105 of the Income Tax Act, every person (including a non-resident), paying to a non-resident, a fee, commission, or other amount in respect of services rendered in Canada (excluding remuneration paid to non-resident employees that are subject to payroll withholding requirements; _see Withholding tax for non-resident employees above_) is required to withhold and remit 15% of the payment to Canadian tax authorities unless a waiver has been received before payment. Regulation 105 withholding is not a final tax, but an instalment payment against possible Canadian tax liability if the non-resident is determined to have a PE in Canada. A non-resident corporation that does not have a PE in Canada and is eligible under one of Canada’s tax treaties can file a ‘treaty-based’ corporate tax return to have the previously withheld Regulation 105 amounts refunded. These tax returns may result in the Canadian tax authorities challenging the non-resident’s assertion that no PE exists within Canada.
Draft legislative proposals give the CRA legislative authority to grant single waivers that cover multiple transactions occurring over a specific time period, subject to certain conditions (instead of having to obtain a waiver for each transaction), effective upon royal assent of the enacting legislation.
## Carbon taxes
In 2019, to advance the objectives of the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change (the Framework) and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the federal government passed the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act (GGPPA), which established a Federal Carbon Pricing Backstop (FCPB) programme. In accordance with the Framework, all provinces and territories were required to adopt a form of carbon pricing that meets the minimum requirements under the FCPB. Each province or territory either had to implement its own programme that would meet the minimum thresholds for the FCPB programme or be subject to the carbon pricing model under the GGPPA. The provinces and territories that do not have their own programmes that meet the FCPB thresholds are called 'backstop jurisdictions'. The carbon pricing under the GGPPA has two components:
  * Fuel charge: Part I of the GGPPA imposes a fuel charge on purchases, imports, and uses of certain types of fuels in certain backstop jurisdictions. The fuel charge rate started at CAD 20 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) as of 1 April 2019 and was increased by CAD 10 per CO2e tonne on 1 April each year until 2022; it then increases by CAD 15 per CO2e tonne on 1 April each year thereafter, until it reaches CAD 170 per CO2e tonne in 2030. The current rate is CAD 80 per CO2e tonne, which is equivalent to CAD 0.1764 per litre for gasoline and CAD 0.2139 per litre for diesel. The current rate for marketable natural gas is equivalent to CAD 0.1525 per cubic metre. Generally, the fuel charge is paid by a distributor upon the sale of the fuel. However, certain businesses are either required to register to remit the tax or can register for a purchase exemption. There are different types of registration, depending upon the operations of the particular business. Each type of registration will trigger specific calculations, compliance, and reporting requirements.
  * Output-based pricing system (OBPS): In addition to the fuel charge, the OBPS applies to industrial facilities whose greenhouse gas emissions exceed 50 kilotonnes CO2e of emissions under Part II of the GGPPA. Facilities that are registered under the OBPS should be able to purchase fuel for their use exempt from the fuel charge under Part I of the GGPPA. Facilities that have emissions above 10 kilotonnes CO2e may elect to opt into the OBPS programme in order to get similar treatment as their competitors and benefit from the exemption for fuel charge under Part I of the GGPPA. Entities registered for the OBPS are required to report their emissions annually.


The provincial and territorial carbon programmes vary by province or territory.
### Backstop jurisdictions
In the backstop jurisdictions, Part I of the GGPPA applies fully, but some of them have limited programmes for industrial emitters that may meet the federal standards under Part II of the GGPPA. In those jurisdictions that have a limited or full programme for industrial emitters, Part II of the GGPPA would not apply (either in a limited form or fully). The discussion below is in respect of the programmes in these jurisdictions.
  * Alberta became a backstop jurisdiction on 1 January 2020 after the province’s government repealed its carbon levy; as a result, the federal fuel charge under Part I of the GGPPA applies in Alberta. On 1 January 2020, Alberta implemented the Technology Innovation Emissions Reduction (TIER), which is mandatory for certain emitters whose greenhouse gas emissions exceed the 100 kilotonnes CO2e annual threshold but allows qualifying smaller greenhouse gas emitters (including oil and gas producers) to opt into the programme voluntarily. The TIER system meets the federal carbon pricing standards under the OBPS for those registered under the programme. Entities that are regulated under the TIER system are able to purchase the fuel exempt from the fuel charge under Part I of the GGPPA.
  * The GGPPA applies in Manitoba.
  * Starting 1 July 2023, the federal fuel charge (Part I of the GGPPA) applies in New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island (i.e. those provinces are backstop jurisdictions), because their pollution pricing systems no longer met the federal standard; however, the following provinces continue to use their own pollution pricing systems for industrial emissions: 
    * New Brunswick has had a provincial cap and trade programme for certain large emitters since 1 January 2021.
    * Newfoundland and Labrador has a performance-based system for offshore and onshore industries that establish certain reduction targets for large industrial facilities and large-scale electricity generation.
    * Nova Scotia has an output-based pricing system for large industrial emitters (before 1 January 2023, it had a cap and trade programme).
  * Ontario is a backstop jurisdiction, but the federal OBPS does not apply to Ontario businesses; instead, the province’s Emissions Performance Standards (EPS) programme applies.
  * Saskatchewan is a backstop jurisdiction and has a programme for large industrial emitters that has been accepted by the federal government since 1 January 2023 (before that date, the programme’s scope of application is limited and did not apply to all emitters). 
  * Yukon and Nunavut are backstop jurisdictions.


### Non-backstop jurisdictions
The following provinces and territories meet the federal standards under the FCPB and, as a result, Part I of the GGPPA does not apply in those provinces and territories (in certain provinces and territories, Part II of the GGPPA may apply):
  * British Columbia: Carbon tax is levied at CAD 80 per CO2e tonne (CAD 65 per CO2e tonne before 1 April 2024).
  * Northwest Territories: Carbon tax is levied at CAD 80 per CO2e tonne (CAD 65 per CO2e tonne before 1 April 2024).
  * Quebec: The province is a member of the Western Climate Initiative and imposes a cap-and-trade system.


## Digital services tax (DST)
Recently enacted legislation implements a DST, effective the 2024 calendar year, but retroactive to in-scope revenues earned since 1 January 2022. The DST was only to be imposed if a multilateral convention implementing Pillar One (_see Global minimum tax and the new international tax framework in the section_) had not come into effect by 31 December 2023, which it did not. 
The DST targets large global businesses earning revenue from certain digital services reliant on the engagement, data, and content contributions of Canadian users. The revenues subject to the DST are grouped into four categories: revenues earned from online marketplaces, social media, online advertising, and user data (‘in-scope revenue’). The DST is a 3% non-income tax that applies to in-scope revenue earned by entities (or members of a business group) with:
  * global revenue from all sources of EUR 750 million or more in the previous calendar year, and
  * in-scope revenue associated with Canadian users that exceed CAD 20 million in the particular calendar year.
