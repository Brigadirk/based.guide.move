## Foreign tax relief
Serbian residents are taxed on their worldwide income. When income generated in another country is taxed there, the taxpayer has the right to decrease the tax liability by claiming a tax credit to the tax authorities in Serbia. This tax credit is equal to the tax paid in another country, but it cannot exceed the amount of the tax that would have been paid in Serbia.
In case the income is received from a country with which Serbia has DTT in place, the method for avoidance of the double taxation prescribed by the DTT (credit or exemption) will be applicable.
## Tax treaties
_For a full list of Serbian DTTs, please see the section in the Corporate tax summary_.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 12 June 2024
Residents are taxable on their worldwide income, whereas non-residents are taxable on their Serbian-sourced income and worldwide income related to their work in/for the Republic of Serbia.
Tax rates are flat, range from 10% to 20%, and the definition of the taxable base depends on the type of income. _See_ _the section_ _for more information._
### Supplementary annual taxation
In addition to the PIT, all taxpayers are subject to supplementary annual PIT. This is an additional tax that is paid by individuals whose income exceeds a prescribed threshold. Certain types of income are excluded from supplementary annual PIT, such as investment income and capital gains.
If the individual is a Serbian tax resident, one is subject to Serbian supplementary annual tax on one's net worldwide income exceeding a prescribed threshold, whereas Serbian tax non-residents are liable to report their Serbian-sourced annual net income.
The progressive rates apply depending on the income level. For the taxable income exceeding prescribed thresholds, between three and six times the average annual salary*, the tax rate is 10%. For net income exceeding six times the average annual salary*, the tax rate is the previous 10% with an additional 15%. For taxpayers who, on the last day of the calendar year for which the supplementary annual PIT is determined, are less than 40 years of age, the annual sum of earnings and taxable income is additionally reduced by the amount of three average annual wages per employee paid in the Republic in the year for which the tax is determined.
* _As per official data published by the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia._

## Individual - Income determination

Employment income is considered to be the agreed salary, as well as other earnings of the employee, arising from employment. Employment income remains subject to PIT at a 10% flat rate after deducting the RSD 25,000 non-taxable salary cap, payable by a method of withholding. The taxable base is gross salary, including fringe benefits.
Other types of income (e.g. royalties income, business income, investment income, real estate lease income, capital gains, and other income) are subject to a flat rate tax that ranges from 10% to 20%, depending on the type of income concerned.
Any taxpayer who earns a salary and other revenues in or from another state, a diplomatic or consular mission of a foreign state, or an international organisation, or representatives of such a mission or organisation, shall calculate and pay PIT in accordance with the Law, provided tax has not already been charged and paid by the payer of the revenue.
## Employment income
The taxable person is the employee, but the employer is responsible for calculating and withholding PIT on behalf of its employees at the moment of salary payment.
The taxable base is gross salary reduced for the non-taxable salary cap of RSD 25,000 and includes fringe benefits such as company-provided housing and use of a company’s car. Use of a company’s car for both private and business purposes by an employee is taxed as salary, at a tax base equal to 1% of the car’s market value on 31 December of the previous year for each month of use.
