## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 12 June 2024
## Taxable period
The tax period in Serbia is the calendar year. However, entities have a possibility to opt for a different tax period other than the calendar year (subject to the approval of the Ministry of Finance), but still 12-months long. Once approved, such tax period must be applied for at least five years.
## Tax returns
CIT returns, together with all supporting documents (e.g. tax depreciation and tax credit forms), must be filed with the tax authorities not later than 180 days after expiration of the tax year.
A newly established company needs to register with the tax authorities within 15 days of registration with the Serbian Business Registry.
## Payment of tax
CIT is payable monthly in advance instalments by the 15th day of the following month for the prior calendar month. The amount of payable advances is determined on the basis of a company's CIT calculation for the previous year.
The due date for final settlement of CIT liability is the date of filing the annual tax return.
## Tax audit process
The tax authorities may undertake an unlimited number of tax audits in respect of the same taxes within a reviewed period. In principle, re-performing of an audit of the same tax within a reviewed period is based on existence of new facts that were previously unavailable to the tax authorities.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations period for assessment of tax liabilities is five years from the year in which tax should have been assessed. The statute of limitations for collection of tax liabilities is five years from the year in which tax was due for payment. This is with the exception of pension insurance contributions, which do not become statute barred.
The statute of limitations commences from 1 January of the year following the year in which the tax return/liability was due.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Historically, audits by the tax authority have been focused primarily on VAT, PIT, and social security contributions assessment.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 12 June 2024
A legal entity is considered to be a resident of Serbia if it is established or has its place of effective management and control in Serbia.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
A PE is any permanent place of business through which a non-resident conducts its business, especially a:
  * branch
  * plant
  * representative office
  * place of production, factory, or workshop, or


  * mine, oil or gas well, quarry, or any other place of extraction of natural


A PE includes a permanent or mobile construction site, construction, or assembly works, if they last longer than six months, namely: 
  * one or several construction or mounting projects executed concurrently or 
  * several constructions or assemblies that are performed without interruption one after the other.


If a person, while representing a non-resident taxpayer, has the authority to conclude contracts on behalf of that taxpayer and exercises such authority, it shall be deemed that the non-resident taxpayer has a PE with regard to the operations performed by the representative on behalf of the taxpayer.
A PE shall not exist if the non-resident taxpayer conducts its business through a commissioner, broker, or any other person that, in the conduct of its own business, acts in its own name but for the others account.
Neither shall the following make up a PE:
  * Keeping stocks of goods or materials belonging to a non-resident taxpayer exclusively for purposes relating to storage, presentation, or delivery, or using premises intended for such purposes exclusively.
  * Keeping stocks of goods or materials belonging to a non-resident taxpayer exclusively for the purpose of their being processed in another enterprise or by a sole trader.
  * Keeping a permanent place of business exclusively for the purpose of procuring goods or collecting information for the needs of a non-resident taxpayer or for the purpose of engaging in any other activity of preparatory or auxiliary for the needs of a non-resident taxpayer.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 12 June 2024
## Depreciation and amortisation
According to the CIT Law, assets qualifying for tax depreciation are tangible assets with useful life over one year, which are recognised as non-current assets under IFRS, excluding renewable natural resources, and intangibles. Goodwill cannot be depreciated for tax purposes.
Tax depreciable assets, except intangible assets, are divided into five groups, with the tax depreciation rates ranging from 2.5% to 30%.
Tax depreciation of fixed assets classified in tax depreciation groups II through V is calculated by using the straight-line depreciation method. In case amortisation costs calculated in accordance with the accounting rules are determined in the lower amount comparing to the amount of depreciation costs assessed by using tax depreciation rates, accounting depreciation is recognised as tax deductible cost.
Tax depreciation of intangible assets and leases recognised as assets is equal to their accounting depreciation.
Assets classified into groups II through V and which were acquired before 31 December 2018 are depreciated for tax purposes by applying the declining-balance method.
## Goodwill
Goodwill is not subject to tax amortisation.
## Start-up expenses
Generally, start-up expenses are tax deductible for CIT purposes.
## Interest expenses
Interest on related-party loans exceeding thin capitalisation and transfer pricing thresholds are not deductible (_see the section_).
## Bad debts
Bad debt provisions are generally tax deductible if they are at least 60 days overdue. Provisions have to be made individually for each receivable.
Write-off of individual debts, except for those from debtors who are at the same time creditors, is recognised as an expense under the following conditions:
  * They were written off as uncollectable.
  * The taxpayer has initiated a court procedure to collect debt or duly reported the receivables in case of liquidation or bankruptcy procedure over the debtor.


Taxable income should be increased for receivables that are written-off and do not meet the above requirements and for which tax-deductible provisions were previously made.
## Charitable contributions
Expenses for health care, scientific, educational, humanitarian, religious, ecological, cultural, and sport related purposes, as well as humanitarian aid given to the Republic of Serbia, its autonomous provinces, and the local government for sanitation of consequences that emerged during emergency situations, are deductible, at up to 5% of total revenues.
## Research and development (R&D) expenses
_See Research and development (R &D) double deduction in the section_.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties (both commercial and those charged by the authorities) are not deductible.
## Taxes
All taxes, duties, and contributions that do not depend on the profitability of the company are deductible in the tax period that the liability in this respect was settled.
## Other significant items
The following other expenses are not recognised for CIT purposes:
  * Non-documented expenses.
  * Provisions for receivables from entities that are creditors at the same time, up to the amount of the liability due to that entity.
  * Presents provided to political organisations.
  * Presents provided to related parties.
  * Penalty interest for late payment of taxes, contributions, and other charges.
  * Expenses related to forced collection of taxes and other liabilities.
  * Non-business related expense.
  * Share in the profit paid to employees or other individuals.
  * Calculated but unpaid redundancy payments (deductible when paid).
  * Expenses related to employment costs, apart from salaries (deductible when paid).
  * Impairment of assets (deductible in tax period in which asset is disposed of or used).
  * Direct write-off of receivables (under certain conditions).
  * Long-term provisions (deductible when paid).


The following other expenses are recognised for CIT purposes only up to a certain limit:
  * Business entertainment expenses, up to 0.5% of total revenues.
  * Membership fees paid to chambers of commerce and other associations (except political parties), up to 0.1% of gross revenue.


## Net operating losses
The taxpayer has the right to carry forward and utilise tax losses incurred over the following five years.
Carryback rules do not exist in Serbia.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Generally, there are no restrictions on the deductibility of royalties and service fees paid to foreign affiliates, provided they are at arm's length, appropriately documented (by agreements, contracts, calculation sheets, etc.), and incurred for business purposes only.
Payment of interest to foreign affiliates is restricted and regulated by thin capitalisation rules and transfer pricing rules (_see the section_).


# Serbia
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 12 June 2024
Tax grouping/consolidation is allowed to a group of companies where all members are Serbian residents and one company directly or indirectly controls at least 75% of the shares in another company. Each company files its own tax balance sheet, and the parent company files a consolidated tax balance sheet for the whole group.
In the consolidated tax balance sheet, losses of one or more companies are offset by the profits of other related companies. Each company is liable for the portion of tax attributable to its share of the group's taxable profit.
Once approved by the Ministry of Finance, tax grouping/consolidation applies for at least five years.
## Transfer pricing
A transfer price is the price of transactions between related parties. Related parties exist if there is a possibility of control or influence over business decisions between them. Ownership of 25% or more, or a majority of shares, is considered as potential control. Influence over business decisions exists when an associated party holds 25% or more, or individually holds the greatest portion, of votes in the taxpayer's management bodies. If the same persons participate in management or control of both companies, a connection between them will be deemed to exist.
Close family members are also regarded as related parties. Non-resident entities from tax havens are considered as related parties of resident entities. The Serbian Ministry of Finance prescribed the list of countries that are to be considered as tax havens for the application of relevant CIT Law provisions.
It is mandatory to prepare and submit annual transfer pricing documentation (in local language) together with the CIT return. It should be noted that the Master File / Local File concept envisaged by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD’s) Action 13 has not been introduced in local legislation, which prescribes mandatory content of annual transfer pricing documentation. A company should disclose all transactions with related parties (whether they are domestic, cross-border, or with a company located in a tax haven) at transfer prices and at arm's-length prices in its CIT return and document them within the annual transfer pricing documentation.
When a difference between arm’s-length prices and transfer prices is determined, positive differences (adjustments of expenses) and negative differences (adjustments of revenues) between these prices are included in taxable profit.
Serbian CIT Law recognises the following methods for determining arm’s-length prices:
  * Comparable uncontrolled price (CUP).
  * Cost plus.
  * Resale minus.
  * Transactional net margin (TNMM).
  * Profit split.
  * Any other method that allows determination of arm’s-length prices if none of the above methods can be applied.


It is mandatory to prepare and submit transfer pricing documentation together with the CIT return.
### Transfer pricing rules for intra-group loans
Any interest incurred on related-party loans exceeding the arm's-length interest rate is not tax deductible. Arm's-length interest is deemed to be the:
  * weighted average key policy rate for the tax period for loans denominated in dinars, and
  * weighted average interest rate at which domestic banks borrowed from foreign lenders in the related tax period for foreign currency loans.


These indicators are determined by the National Bank of Serbia and published by the Ministry of Finance. However, taxpayers are entitled to determine market interest rates by using all general methods for determining arm’s-length interest rates. In case the taxpayer decides to determine interest rates by applying general methods, it will be obligated to apply such interest rates for assessment of all related-party loans.
Transfer pricing rules in this respect are applied up to the amount of tax-deductible interest determined in accordance with the thin capitalisation threshold (_see below_).
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
A resident taxpayer that is considered to be the ultimate parent entity (UPE) of a multinational enterprise (MNE) group whose total consolidated group revenue in the previous year exceeds 750 million euros (EUR) is required to file a CbC Report. CbC reporting in Serbia is introduced and applicable as of 2020. There is no CbC notification requirement.
## Thin capitalisation
The interest and related costs will be fully deductible if the loans from related parties do not exceed four times the taxpayer's net equity (ten times for banks and leasing companies). The amount of a taxpayer's net equity for this purpose is calculated as the average of the total assets less total liabilities at the beginning and the end of the year, while the amount of loans from related parties is calculated as a daily average for the year.
In cases where the loans from related parties exceed the prescribed threshold, the amount of non-deductible interest will be calculated as proportional to the amount of loans exceeding the 4:1 (10:1) threshold.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no CFC rules in Serbia.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 12 June 2024
## Foreign tax credit
A Serbian entity is entitled to a tax credit for the WHT paid on foreign-sourced dividends and underlying CIT paid abroad (by its non-resident subsidiary), provided that the taxpayer holds at least 10% of the shares in the subsidiary for at least one year before filing a return. If the taxpayer holds less than 10% of the shares in the subsidiary, the tax credit should not exceed the amount of tax that would be paid in Serbia on that income, where the tax basis represents 40% of the received gross income. Non-utilised tax credit can be carried forward by the parent company for five years.
A resident taxpayer also has the right to decrease its tax liability for WHT paid abroad on interest and authorship fees. The tax credit should not exceed the amount of tax that would be paid in Serbia on that income, where the tax basis represents 40% of the received gross income. Carryforward of unused tax credits is not allowed.
## Tax holiday
A ten-year tax holiday is available for companies with a minimum investment in property, plant, and equipment (PPE) of RSD 1 billion. To qualify for the credit, a taxpayer must employ at least 100 new workers for an indefinite period. The tax holiday is available for the ten-year period in proportion to the investment made. The number of employees employed in the tax period in which the taxpayer qualified for the tax holiday must be retained throughout the whole tax holiday period.
## Research and development (R&D) double deduction
R&D costs related to R&D performed in the Republic may be double deducted for CIT purposes. The incentive does not apply on research costs incurred in extractive industries (finding of oil, gas, or mineral resources).
## Royalty income relief
80% of qualified royalty income generated by the copyright or similar rights holders (inscribed in relevant register in Serbia) can be excluded from the tax base. Qualifying income should be excluded upon decreasing this income for the amount of tax deductible R&D costs incurred in relation to development of such copyright/similar right.
## Investments into newly established companies performing innovative activities
Investments into newly established companies, performing innovative activities, entitles a taxpayer to a tax credit in the amount of 30% of the investments made. The maximum amount of tax credit cannot exceed RSD 100 million.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 12 June 2024
WHT is calculated and paid at the rate of 20% on payments such as dividends/share in profit, royalties (including neighbouring authorship rights, intellectual property rights, and related rights), interest income, income from market research services, accounting and audit services, and other legal and business consulting services, income from distributed surplus of a company in bankruptcy, revenues derived from the liquidation surplus of a company in liquidation, and lease payments for real estate and other assets made to a non-resident, unless a DTT applies to provide a reduced rate or exemption.
WHT is also payable on a non-resident’s income realised on the basis of performing variety, entertaining, artistic, sports, and similar programs in Serbia, which is not taxed as income of an individual (performer, musician, sportsman, etc.).
In order to benefit from application of a relevant DTT, non-residents (i.e. the income recipient) must provide a tax residency certificate on the form prescribed by the Serbian Ministry of Finance stamped by the relevant body from the non-resident's country of residence.
Special WHT rules apply in case of non-resident entities from tax havens. WHT is payable at the rate of 25% on royalties, interest, income from lease of immovable property and other assets, and service fees paid to non-resident entities from tax havens. Dividend payments to non-residents from tax havens are subject to WHT at 20%. The Serbian Ministry of Finance publishes a list of jurisdictions that are regarded as tax havens ().
WHT rates envisaged by applicable DTTs are provided in the following table.
Recipient | WHT (%) | Applicable from  
---|---|---  
Dividends (1) | Interest | Royalties (3)

Notes
  1. If the recipient company owns/controls at least 25% (5% depending on the relevant DTT) of the equity of the paying company, the lower of the two rates applies.
  2. The treaty has not been ratified by one of the parties.
  3. A tax rate of 5% will be applicable to literary, scientific, and work of art; films and works created like films; or other source of reproduction tone or picture. A tax rate of 10% will be applicable to patents, petty patents, brands, models and samples, technical innovations, secret formulas, or technical procedures.
  4. Only in cases when dividends are to be paid to Serbian residents. If paid to Malaysian residents, they are taxable at 20% in Serbia.
  5. A 0% rate is applicable in cases when the income recipient is the government or government owned banks. In all other cases, a higher rate envisaged by the DTT should apply.
  6. WHT rate refers solely to dividends distributed from Serbia. In Malta, WHT cannot be higher than CIT on profit before dividend distribution.
  7. A 0% rate is applicable in cases when the dividend income recipient is the government of the contracting state.
  8. Besides ownership requirement (_see Note 1_), 365 holding period criterion needs to be met in order to apply lower of the two DTT rates on dividend payments.

## United States (US) Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
FATCA is a set of regulations of the United States adopted in order to combat tax evasion. It requires that foreign financial institutions or other financial intermediaries participate in preventing tax evasion by reporting (i.e. providing) information concerning US 'account holders', which include bank account holders, investors, and shareholders, to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
The Republic of Serbia and the United States have begun active cooperation in relation to the implementation of FATCA regulation as of 2014. In accordance with the above-mentioned cooperation, as of 30 June 2014, Serbia has been treated as a jurisdiction with an 'agreement in substance' on the terms of an intergovernmental agreement (IGA), that is the United States had treated Serbia as the jurisdiction in which the Agreement was in force.
As a result of the cooperation, on 10 April 2019, the government of the Republic of Serbia and the United States signed an IGA to implement FATCA regulation. Serbia signed a Model 1 IGA to implement FATCA. 
Serbian Parliament adopted the Law Ratifying this IGA on 23 December 2019 (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia - International Agreements, No 16 оf 27 December 2019).
## Multilateral instrument (MLI)
On 5 June 2018, Serbia deposited its ratification instrument for the OECD Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting ('Multilateral instrument' or 'MLI').
The MLI enables jurisdictions to swiftly implement the results of the BEPS project into bilateral tax treaties worldwide. It modifies the application of thousands bilateral tax treaties concluded to eliminate double taxation.
Serbia is the sixth jurisdiction to deposit its ratification instrument after Austria, the Isle of Man, Jersey, Poland, and Slovenia. The MLI entered into force on 1 October 2018 for Serbia.
## Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes
Serbia joined the OECD’s Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes in March 2018, thus committing to implement the standard of transparency and exchange of information in international tax affairs.
At the end of the year 2023, the OECD’s Global Forum published a second-round peer review report on Serbia’s implementation of the standard on transparency and exchange of information.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 12 June 2024
Taxable profit is determined by adjusting the accounting profit as stated in the profit and loss statement (determined in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards [IFRS] and local accounting and audit legislation) and in accordance with the provisions of the CIT Law.
For taxpayers who, according to local legislation, are not obligated to apply IFRS, taxable profit is determined according to the special guidelines prescribed by the Ministry of Finance.
## Inventory valuation
Cost of materials and the purchase value of merchandise are tax deductible up to an amount calculated by applying the average weighted cost method or the first in first out (FIFO) method. If another method is used, an adjustment for tax purposes should be made.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are generated by the sale or other transfer against consideration of real estate, rights related to intellectual property, as well as shares, stocks, securities, certain bonds, investment units, and digital property. A capital gain is determined as the difference between the sale and purchase price of the asset concerned, determined in accordance with the provisions of the Law. If the amount is negative, a capital loss is realised.
Capital gains and operational profit are disclosed in the same tax return, but they are taxed separately. Consequently, capital gains/losses cannot be used to offset business losses/gains.
However, capital gains can be offset with capital losses occurring in the same period. A capital loss can be carried forward for five years.
The capital gains tax rate is 15%.
However, the rate applicable for capital gains incurred by non-residents is 20%, unless envisaged otherwise by a relevant DTT (_see the section for more information_).
## Dividend income
Dividends received by a Serbian company from another Serbian company are not subject to CIT.
Dividends received from a non-resident will be treated as taxable income of a Serbian company and subject to 15% CIT. However, a Serbian entity will have the right to decrease its tax liability by taking a tax credit for the WHT and underlying CIT paid in a subsidiary's country, provided that the taxpayer holds at least 10% of the shares in the subsidiary. If the taxpayer holds less than 10% of the shares in the subsidiary, the tax credit should not exceed the amount of tax that would be paid in Serbia on that income, where the tax basis represents 40% of the received gross income (_see the section for more information_).
## Interest income
Interest income will be included in accounting profit determined in accordance with IFRS and will be taxable at the CIT rate of 15%. A Serbian resident has the right to decrease its CIT liability for WHT on interest paid abroad. The amount of the tax credit should not exceed the amount of CIT that would be paid in Serbia on that income, where the tax basis represents 40% of the received gross income.
## Royalty income
Royalty income will be treated as business income and subject to the general CIT rate.
A resident taxpayer also has the right to decrease its CIT liability for WHT on royalties paid abroad. The amount of the tax credit should not exceed the amount of CIT that would be paid in Serbia on that income, where the tax basis represents 40% of the received gross income.
## Unrealised currency exchange gains
Unrealised currency exchange gains will be included in accounting profits under IFRS rules. Serbian legislation does not provide any exception of taxation of this income.
## Foreign income
Companies resident in Serbia are taxed on their worldwide income.
When profit generated in another country is taxed in the foreign country, a company has the right to decrease its tax liability by claiming a tax credit from the tax authorities in Serbia (_see the section for more information_).
There are no provisions that provide for the possibility that taxation of income earned abroad may be deferred.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
The VAT was introduced on 1 January 2005 and generally follows the European Union's (EU’s) Sixth Directive.
The standard VAT rate is 20% for most taxable supplies. A reduced VAT rate of 10% applies for basic food, daily newspapers, medicines, publications, public transportation services, utilities, etc.
In addition to these tax rates, there is a 0% tax rate with the right of deduction of the input VAT that applies to the export of goods, transport and other services directly related to exports, international air transport, etc.
The tax exemption without the right of deduction of the input VAT applies to trading in shares and other securities, insurance and reinsurance, and the lease of apartments, business premises, etc.
A taxpayer for VAT purposes is a person who independently, and in the course of its business activities, undertakes the supply of goods and services or import of goods. Business activity is defined as the permanent activity of a manufacturer, salesperson, or service provider for the purpose of gaining income, including the activities of exploitation of natural resources, agriculture, forestry, and self-employed activities. A branch or other operating unit can be a taxpayer.
Foreign entities that carry on taxable supply of goods and services in Serbia, as well as supply of goods and services for which a tax exemption is prescribed with the right to deduct input VAT, are required to register for VAT and to appoint a fiscal representative irrespective of the amount of the turnover in the previous 12 months. A foreign entity that performs a taxable supply of goods and services exclusively to VAT payers or entities referred to as governmental institutions (which includes the Republic and its authorities, the territorial autonomy and local self-government authorities, as well as legal entities established under law or other act of the Republic, territorial autonomy, or local government authority for the purpose of execution of activities of the state administration or local government) or performs supply of goods that are in the procedure of customs warehouse in accordance with customs regulations, as well as passengers transportation service by buses (in special case envisaged by the Law), has no obligation to appoint a fiscal representative in Serbia and to register for VAT. A foreign taxpayer that fails to register for VAT in Serbia may be subject to penalties for non-compliance. If a foreign supplier does not appoint a fiscal representative, VAT is due by the Serbian recipient of the goods or services.
The usual taxable period is a calendar month; however, if a taxpayer’s total annual turnover is less than 50 million Serbian dinars (RSD), the taxable period is a calendar quarter. For newly established businesses, the VAT period is the calendar month for the current and next calendar year. Taxpayers are required to submit returns within 15 days of the end of each taxable period. Tax debtors who are not taxpayers are required to submit returns within ten days of the end of the taxable period in which the tax liability arose.
As of 1 July 2018, VAT payers are obligated to submit a VAT assessment overview to the tax authorities, along with the VAT return.
As of 1 January 2019, foreign taxpayers have the right to a VAT refund even if they perform taxable supply of goods and services in Serbia to a Serbian VAT payer.

Goods imported into Serbia are subject to customs duty rates provided in the Law on Customs Tariff. These rates are _ad valorem_ (the only exception is related to the importation of other cigarettes containing tobacco, where a combined _ad valorem_ and specific customs duty rate is prescribed).

Non-residents (i.e. the income recipient) must provide a tax residency certificate (on the form prescribed by the Serbian Ministry of Finance stamped by the relevant body from the non-resident's country of residence or official translation of certificate issued by foreign tax authorities), and the income recipient must be the beneficial owner of the income.
