## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
Extensive VAT Act amendment was adopted. A registration threshold CZK 2,000,000 is newly calculated for calendar year. If the turnover exceeds CZK 2,536,500, the entity becomes a VAT payer immediately. A time limit for input VAT recovery was shortened and rules for its adjustment in case of overdue debts were modified. Small Business Scheme was extended. A number of other changes come info effect.
There are no other significant changes in corporate taxation envisaged for 2025.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
## Taxable period
A corporation may choose either a calendar year or an accounting year as its tax year for CIT purposes.
## Tax returns
CIT returns must be filed within three months of the end of the tax period. If filed electronically, the deadline is postponed by one calendar month (e.g. if the company is not subject to a mandatory accounting audit and has the calendar year as its CIT period, then the standard deadline for filing of the CIT return is 1 April of the following year, or 1 May of the following year if the CIT return is filed electronically).
If the CIT tax return of the taxpayer is prepared and filed by a registered tax advisor, or if the taxpayer is subject to a mandatory accounting audit, the CIT return filing deadline is extended to six months after the end of the tax period (e.g. if a company that is subject to a mandatory accounting audit has the calendar year as its CIT period, then the deadline for filing of the CIT return is 1 July of the following year).
In some special cases, a filing deadline of less than three months may apply (e.g. upon merger or liquidation). This shorter deadline may, however, be extended if approved by the tax office.
## Payment of tax
Tax payments are due on the same day as the filing deadline.
A company is obligated to make CIT advances based on its last known tax liability. The tax advances are paid semi-annually or quarterly, depending on the amount of the last known tax liability.
Upon filing a tax return, tax advances paid during the year for which the tax return is filed will offset the tax liability declared in the tax return. Any outstanding amount must be paid on the date the tax return is due. Any overpayment will be refunded upon request or may be credited against future tax liabilities.
## Tax audit process
There is no statutory tax audit cycle. Entities are picked by the tax authorities based on selected criteria (e.g. tax loss position, huge marketing costs) or randomly.
## Statute of limitations
The tax may be assessed within three years after the deadline for regular tax return filing. In certain cases (e.g. filing of supplementary tax return), such assessment period may be prolonged by one year, maximally up to ten years. If the company is in a tax loss position, the standard three-year period for tax assessment is extended by the period for which the carried-forward tax loss can be utilised in the future tax periods (i.e. it is extended by five years). Similar extension affect arises if the company utilises tax relief under the investment incentives.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The tax authorities seem to focus on marketing costs, management fees, transfer pricing in intra-group relations, entities in a tax loss position, entities with tax investment incentives, and entities with an R&D allowance. More and more attention is drawn to the topic of tax law abuse.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
## Tax residence
A company is resident in the Czech Republic for CIT purposes if it has:
  * its registered seat or
  * its place of management


located in the Czech Republic.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Under domestic law, the creation of a PE of a foreign tax resident in the Czech Republic is triggered by a fixed place available for carrying out business activities, long-term provision of services (for more than six months in any 12 consecutive months), or presence of a dependent agent, unless an applicable double taxation treaty (DTT) stipulates otherwise. For interpretation purposes, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Tax Commentary is followed. The Czech Republic tends to have a 'service PE' clause (i.e. clause stipulating that a PE is created by provision of services in the territory of the Czech Republic even without the existence of a fixed place of business) included in its DTTs.
It is possible to request the tax authority for a legally binding ruling confirming a chosen method of determination of the CIT base of the PE.


# Czech Republic
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
## General tax-deductibility rules
General requirements for an expense to be treated as tax deductible are:
  * the expense must be incurred to 'generate, assure and maintain taxable income'
  * the expense can be deducted only in the correct taxation period to which it relates, and
  * the taxpayer must be able to prove that the expense is tax deductible.


There are special rules regarding tax deductibility of special types of expenses (e.g. tax depreciation and amortisation, interest expenses).
## Depreciation and amortisation
Methods of tax depreciation are prescribed by tax legislation and are independent from depreciation methods for accounting purposes. Tax depreciation is calculated on an asset-by-asset basis, applying the straight-line or accelerated basis methods of depreciation at statutory rates. Under both methods, depreciation expense in the first year is lower than for subsequent years. The company may choose which method to apply to a new asset, but once the choice is made, it cannot be altered. All assets are classified into six groups, which determine the number of years over which the asset will be written off, as follows:
Depreciation group | Assets | Minimum depreciation period (years)  
---|---|---  
1 | Office machines and computers, tools | 3  
2 | Engines, motor vehicles, machines, audio-visual equipment, electric vehicle chargers | 5  
3 | Elevators, escalators, turbines, air conditioning equipment, electric motors, and generators | 10  
4 | Buildings made of wood and plastic, long-distance lines, and pipes | 20  
5 | Buildings (except for those listed in groups 4 and 6), roads, bridges, tunnels | 30  
6 | Administrative buildings, department stores, historical buildings, and hotels | 50  
### Tangible assets
‘Tangible assets’ (i.e. assets that are subject to tax depreciation) are defined by tax legislation generally as assets with economic useful lives greater than one year and acquisition prices higher than CZK 80,000 for assets acquired after 31 December 2020 (up to the end of 2019 the threshold was set at CZK 40,000; in 2020, taxpayers have a choice between CZK 40,000 and CZK 80,000 for assets acquired in that year). Certain assets, such as buildings, are always considered tangible assets.
Taxpayers are generally not obligated to depreciate a tangible asset for tax purposes every year. Depreciation may be interrupted in any year and continued in a later year without a loss of depreciation potential.
Tangible assets are generally depreciated by the taxpayer with ownership title. Certain exceptions apply, for instance, technical appreciation of a rented asset carried out by a tenant or a subtenant may be depreciated by that tenant/subtenant, subject to certain conditions.
Depreciation can start only once the assets are put into use and comply with the requirements of specific laws.
Certain assets have special depreciation methods (e.g. moulds are depreciated based on expected life or number of products).
The value to be used as the basis for tax depreciation depends on how the asset is acquired, for example:
  * Acquisition cost (construction and equipment costs, architect fees, legal fees, notary’s fees, etc.) if the asset is acquired for consideration.
  * Internal costs incurred if the asset is acquired or produced internally.


For passenger transport vehicle (i.e. basically personal automobiles of category M1) acquired from 1 January 2024 onwards, the maximum acquisition price from which tax depreciation can be claimed is limited to CZK 2 million. 
As a support of electromobility, emission-free vehicles put in use in 2024 through 2028 may be depreciated quicker, over 24 months. 
### Intangible assets
From 2021, ‘intangible assets’ were abolished as a separate asset category for income tax purposes for newly acquired property. From 2021 onwards, accounting amortisation of intangible assets will be treated as tax deductible cost. For assets acquired prior to 2020, `intangible assets" are a separate asset category for tax purposes defined as software, valuable rights, intangible results of research and development (R&D), and other assets regarded as assets for accounting purposes, provided that they:
  * were acquired from a third party or developed internally for the purpose of trading with them
  * have an acquisition price of more than CZK 60,000, and
  * have a useful life of greater than one year.


Pre-2020 intangible assets are amortised for tax purposes based on the number of years that the taxpayer has a licence for the assets if the licence is for a limited number of years. Otherwise, amortisation for tax purposes will vary depending on the type asset acquired prior to 2020 (e.g. audio-visual work is amortised over at least 18 months, results of R&D and software are amortised over at least 36 months).
For intangible assets acquired in 2020, the taxpayers have a choice of following the old or new tax treatment. 
## Goodwill and revaluation difference
Czech accounting regulations recognise two valuation options for allocating the purchase price for the purchase of the business (or its part) as a going concern: (i) revaluation difference (assets/liabilities are individually revaluated to fair market values) and (ii) goodwill (net book value of the assets/liabilities are taken over to the opening balance sheet). Both the revaluation difference and goodwill must be depreciated equally over 180 calendar months for tax purposes. Any other goodwill/revaluation difference (e.g. arisen within a merger) is disregarded for tax purposes.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses are directly deductible.
## Interest expenses
Interest as accrued and duly accounted for under Czech GAAP is generally tax deductible, with the following exceptions:
  * Interest disallowed based on the thin capitalisation restriction (_please refer to Thin capitalisation in the section_).
  * Interest disallowed based on the ATAD interest stripping restriction (_please refer to ATAD interest stripping rules in the section)_.
  * Interest disallowed based on the ATAD hybrid mismatch rules _(please refer to ATAD hybrid mismatch rules in the section)_.
  * Interest disallowed for its relation to income that is tax exempt or taxed outside the standard tax base.
  * Interest disallowed due to its relation to holding a subsidiary.
  * Profit-dependent interest.


## Bad debt
Doubtful or bad receivables that have not yet become statute-barred may be provisioned for under special rules. Generally, provisions may be created for trade receivables overdue for more than 18 months. Provisions of 100% may be created for debts overdue for 30 months. For receivables, banks, insurance companies, and defined financial institutions have their specific system for provisioning.
## Charitable donations
Certain charitable donations are deductible. The minimum deductible donation is CZK 2,000, and the maximum deductible donation is 10% of the CIT base (for donations in the tax periods ending from March 2020 up to February 2024, the cap is increased to 30% of the tax base - the period for application is expected to be prolonged). 
The deduction can also be claimed for donations made in tax periods ending between 1 March 2022 and 29 February 2024 to Ukraine, its territorial units, or legal or natural persons domiciled or resident in the territory of Ukraine. The legislation also expands the availability of deductions, which were previously available only to residents of the Czech Republic and the European Union, to Ukrainian residents.
## Travel expenses and meal allowances
Payments for travel expenses and meal allowances that are made to employees may generally be tax-deductible.
## Fines and penalties
Contractual fines and penalties are generally tax deductible on a cash basis. Non-contractual fines are not tax deductible.
## Taxes
Road tax, real estate tax, and most other taxes, with the exception of income taxes, are deductible, as are social security contributions paid by an employer with respect to employees.
## Other significant items
Fees paid to members of other statutory bodies of companies (i.e. board of directors of joint stock companies and cooperatives) for their services are deductible for tax purposes.
## Net operating losses
Losses incurred in a tax year may be carried forward to offset taxable profits generated in the following five tax years. There is no limitation as to the amount of the tax losses that can be carried forward. From 2020, tax losses may also be carried back for two years. The maximum amount of the loss that can be carried back is CZK 30 million.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Generally, deductions may be claimed for royalties, management service fees, and interest charges paid to foreign affiliates, provided such amounts are at arm’s length and the Czech company is able to prove that these payments meet the general rules for tax deductibility.


# Czech Republic
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
Currently, the Czech Republic does not permit group taxation. Each company in a group is taxed individually. Consolidated tax base applies only for the general partners and their shares in profit of their general partnership.
## Transfer pricing
For tax purposes, prices agreed between related parties have to meet the definition of the arm's-length principle, and these prices are often subject to tax audits by tax authorities. The consequences of incorrect transfer pricing and subsequent adjustments are tax exposure and penalties. In the case of companies receiving investment incentives, incorrect transfer pricing can result in additional penalties. Generally, pricing methods as described in OECD guidelines should be followed.
Although there is no legal requirement to keep transfer pricing documentation, in practice it is strongly recommended to keep it as the taxpayer bears the burden of proof upon challenge of prices by tax authorities.
Taxpayers may request the tax administrators to issue an advance pricing agreement (APA) regarding progressing or future transactions between related parties, as well as the determination of the tax base of PEs.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
The CbC report is an outcome of the Action Plan for Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) by the OECD that was implemented to the Czech legislation based on the EU Directive DAC IV. The CbC report is a transparent report disclosing the income, earnings, taxes paid, and other information on the economic activity of multinational groups reporting consolidated revenues of over EUR 750 million.
Czech entities that are part of a multinational group reporting annual consolidated revenues of over EUR 750 million were obligated to submit a one-off Notification. The Czech ultimate parents submitted the CbC report by 31 December 2017 for the first time. The report must be submitted every year within 12 months after the close of the relevant fiscal year.
From 2024, entities that are part of a group with a foreign element will be required to publish a tax report summarising the tax position of the group.
## Thin capitalisation
Thin capitalisation rules apply in the Czech Republic and may limit the tax deductibility of interest payments on debt financing from related parties as well as in certain cases from third parties (e.g. back-to-back financing with a bank interposed between two related parties).
Below is a brief summary of the thin capitalisation rules:
  * The tax-deductibility test applies not only to interest but also to all so-called ‘financial costs’ on loans (e.g. interest plus other related costs, such as bank fees).
  * Thin capitalisation applies only to related-party loans.
  * The debt-to-equity ratio for related-party loans is 4:1 (6:1 for financial services industry), i.e. interest on such part of the related-party loans by which the principal of these loans exceeds four times the accounting equity (based on Czech GAAP) of the borrower is tax non-deductible.
  * Unrelated-party loans (e.g. bank loans) guaranteed by a related party are not considered related-party loans for thin capitalisation purposes. If, however, a bank provides a back-to-back loan to a Czech entity where the loan is provided to the bank by a related party, such a bank loan to the Czech entity is considered a related-party loan.


## ATAD interest stripping rules
The EU ATAD rules limiting deductibility of interest and other borrowing related expenses have been implemented on top of the other rules (such as thin capitalisation). The ATAD interest deductibility rules apply to all interest expenses (i.e. on borrowing from related and unrelated parties). The ATAD test applies only to the interest expenses that successfully passed all other tax deductibility tests, which means that the ATAD rules can result in an additional amount of the interest expenses being disallowed.
Based on these rules, any 'net borrowing costs', defined as the excess of tax deductible borrowing costs over related taxable borrowing income, is only tax deductible up to:
  * 30% of a taxpayer’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) as defined for tax purposes, or
  * CZK 80 million per year (the safe harbour),


whichever is higher.
The borrowing costs include various types of interest-like expenses, such as actual interest expenses, expenses that are similar to interest, deemed interest expenses included in hedging instruments, interest element included in the financial leasing costs, interest capitalised in the value of assets and subsequently included in tax depreciation, and foreign exchange costs related to interest.
Any interest costs treated as tax non-deductible due to these rules may be carried forward for an indefinite period of time and used as a deduction in the years where the threshold has not been reached (it does not pass to the legal successor).
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
The EU ATAD rules regarding a CFC have been implemented in Czech domestic tax legislation. A CFC is defined as a Czech non-resident company in which the Czech company participates (alone or together with its related parties) by more than 50% on voting rights or profits.
If such a CFC does not carry out a 'genuine business activity', and the actual CIT that the CFC paid in the country of its residence is lower than one half of the CIT that the CFC would have paid if it had been a Czech tax resident company, or is located in a country included on the EU black-list of non-cooperating jurisdictions as at the end of the tax period reviewed, then the following types of income of the CFC must be included in the CIT base of the Czech controlling company in the proportion of the share of the Czech company in the capital of the CFC:
  * Interest income.
  * Royalty income.
  * Dividends.
  * Capital gains from sale of shares.
  * Financing lease income.
  * Insurance, banking, or other financial services income.
  * Income from sale of goods or provision of services between related parties with little value added.


This means that the above income must be taxed in the Czech Republic within the tax base of the Czech controlling company as if it the income was generated by this company.
## Hybrid mismatches
The EU ATAD rules aimed at preventing the effects of hybrid mismatch arrangements in relations between associated companies have also been implemented. These arrangements occur in situations where, for example, expenses are deducted twice in different countries, gains are not taxed, or a combination of both.
The aim is to prevent these mismatches. 'Non-taxation' occurring as a result of hybrid mismatches is preferentially addressed by applying the primary defensive rule (e.g. by not allowing a tax deduction if the income is tax-exempt in the other country).
If the rule is not enforced, the other country should apply the secondary defensive rule (to tax the income the given case). The hybrid mismatch rules are effective from 1 January 2020.


# Czech Republic
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
A foreign company can trade in the Czech Republic through a Czech branch. A branch usually creates a Czech PE of the foreign entity for CIT purposes (depending on the character of the activities carried out through the branch). The basis of taxation is the same as for corporations (i.e. tax base is calculated as taxable revenues less tax-deductible costs).
A branch is liable for tax on its attributable profits at the standard CIT rate. PEs of foreign companies may request for a binding ruling on the tax base determination.


# Czech Republic
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
## Research and development (R&D) allowance
Up to 100% of specific R&D expenses (or costs) incurred in a given tax year may be deducted from the tax base as a special tax allowance. These costs are therefore deducted twice for tax purposes: once as a normal tax-deductible cost and then again as a special tax allowance. An additional 10% may be applied as an allowance from the difference by which the current year qualifying costs exceed those of the prior period.
The following costs can be included in the R&D tax allowance:
  * Direct costs (e.g. personnel costs of R&D engineers, consumed materials).
  * Tax depreciation of fixed assets used for R&D activities.
  * Other operational expenses directly related to the realisation of R&D activities (e.g. telecommunications fees, electricity, water, gas).


Only qualifying expenses are deductible for tax purposes and must be separately identified from other expenses (or costs). This allowance does not apply to costs of purchased services or intangible results of R&D acquired from other entities, except for expenses (or costs) incurred from an R&D organisation. In addition, expenses that were supported from public sources are also excluded.
The taxpayer needs to inform the tax authorities about the intention to claim the R&D allowance, and by the date for filing of the CIT return for the year in which the allowance started to be claimed for a specific project the taxpayer must prepare a written project documentation in a format defined by the tax legislation.
Any non-utilised R&D allowance may be carried forward for three subsequent years.
A taxpayer may request a binding ruling with respect to R&D costs from the respective tax office in the event that the taxpayer is unsure of whether certain R&D costs are eligible for the allowance.
## Investment incentives
Investment incentives are available only to Czech entities (including Czech subsidiaries of foreign companies). Incentives include mainly a CIT relief, cash support for the creation of new jobs, cash support for training or retraining of employees, cash grant on capital expenditures, and a transfer of land at a specially reduced price.
Investment incentives are available in the manufacturing industry and also for support of technology centres, strategic services, data centres, and customer support centres.
The maximum amount of the support within the investment incentives is 20% to 50% from the eligible costs.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
Czech corporations are required to withhold tax on payments of dividends, interest, and royalties as follows (please note that this overview is indicative only and cannot be relied upon without checking the particular DTT, as each DTT has its own definition of dividends, interest, and royalties):

Notes
General note: The WHT rates stipulated by the relevant DTT can, in most cases, be applied by the Czech tax-resident corporation without the need to seek for a pre-approval or similar procedure with the Czech tax authorities. The Czech corporation must be prepared the prove to Czech tax authorities that the DTT provisions were applied correctly; usually the minimum requirement for the Czech corporation is to have available the tax residency certificate of the non-resident recipient of the income and confirmation that the recipient is the beneficial owner of the respective income.
  1. The general WHT rate for dividends is 15% (35% for dividends paid to residents of non-EU and non-EEA countries with which the Czech Republic does not have an enforceable DTT or TIEA in place). If the DTT provides for two rates, the lower rate usually applies if the recipient of the dividends is a company that directly owns at least a certain amount of the capital or a certain amount of the voting shares of the company paying the dividend.
  2. The general WHT rate for interest paid to non-residents is 15% (35% for interest paid to residents of non-EU and non-EEA countries with which the Czech Republic does not have an enforceable DTT or TIEA in place). Domestic law provides for exemption of interest based on the rules of EU Interest-Royalty Directive as incorporated into Czech law - see section Corporate - Income determination for details. Also, under domestic law, interest income from Czech governmental bonds is exempt. Furthermore, interest from bonds issued by Czech companies abroad (i.e. issued under foreign law) is also exempt from the WHT, provided that the bondholder is not a related party of the issuer. If the DTT provides for two rates, the lower rate applies mostly in situations when the interest is received by the government, the central bank, or a state-owned institution. 
  3. The general WHT rate for royalties paid to non-residents is 15% (35% for royalties paid to residents of non-EU and non-EEA countries with which the Czech Republic does not have an enforceable DTT or TIEA in place). Domestic law provides for exemption of royalties based on the rules of EU Interest-Royalty Directive as incorporated into Czech law - see section Corporate - Income determination for details. If the DTT provides for two rates, the lower rate applies mostly to cultural royalties.
  4. In case that Switzerland (based on the Swiss law) does not levy any WHT on royalties paid to the Czech tax resident (not only Swiss tax residents), then the Czech Republic is allowed to reduce 10% WHT (as stated in Article 12 of the CZ-CHE DTT) to 5% WHT rate as a reciprocity provision with regard to 0% WHT in Switzerland.
  5. There is no DTT in place with Taiwan. A special law was introduced by the Czech government (instead of a DTT) to implement the WHT rates with respect to Taiwan.
  6. On 11 August 2023, Russia suspended application of Articles 5-22 and 24 of the Czech-Russian DTT. The Czech Republic took reciprocal measures as of 29 September 2023.
  7. In 2024, Belarus suspended application of Articles 10, 11 and 13 for the period of 1 June 2024-31 December 2026. The Czech Republic took reciprocal measures for the period of 1 June 2024-31 December 2026.


Apart from dividends, interest, and royalties, Czech tax residents or Czech PEs are obligated to withhold tax from Czech-source income of non-residents, among others, in the following cases:
  * Payments for services provided by a non-resident in the Czech Republic.
  * Provision of gifts and similar consideration-free transfers.


This treatment has to be applied unless an applicable DTT stipulates otherwise.

## CIT base calculation
The starting point for the calculation of the CIT base is the accounting result as per the Czech accounting standards in the currency used for accounting purposes. If the company uses International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), which is obligatory for some companies (such as those that issued publicly traded securities), the IFRS accounting results need to be recalculated for CIT purposes to what they would have been under Czech accounting standards.
The tax non-deductible costs are then added and non-taxable revenues deducted from the accounting result.
## Capital gains
No separate capital gains tax is levied in the Czech Republic. Capital gains (i.e. gains from sale of shares and other assets) are included in the CIT base and taxed as ordinary income in the year in which they arise, unless they are exempt under the participation exemption (_see below_).
## Dividend income
Dividends received by Czech tax resident corporations from non-resident entities are subject to a special tax rate of 15%, unless exempt under the participation exemption regime (_see_  _below)_.
Dividends paid by Czech tax resident corporations to Czech resident entities are subject to 15% final withholding tax (WHT), unless exempt under the participation exemption regime.
Dividends paid by Czech tax resident corporations to Czech non-resident entities are subject to 15% final WHT, unless exempt under the participation exemption regime or unless the WHT rate is decreased under the relevant DTT. An increased WHT rate of 35% applies to dividends paid to entities that are not tax residents in any EU or European Economic Area (EEA) member state or in a country with which the Czech Republic concluded a DTT or tax information exchange agreement (TIEA).
## Participation exemption regime
Dividend income or income from the sale of shares in a subsidiary may be exempt from Czech taxation (i.e. WHT when a Czech company is paying dividends, CIT when a company is receiving dividends or generates the capital gain) if all of the following conditions are met:
  * The Czech or EU parent holds at least 10% of the shares of the subsidiary for at least 12 months; this time test may be met both prospectively and retrospectively.
  * The subsidiary is a tax resident of the Czech Republic or another EU member state.
  * Both the parent and the subsidiary have one of the legal forms listed in the Annex to the EU Parent/Subsidiary Directive.
  * The parent or the subsidiary are not exempt from corporate taxation or may not choose to be exempt, and the tax rate applicable to their income is greater than 0%.


Regarding dividends paid by a Czech subsidiary, provided that the conditions above are met, the exemption also applies when dividends are paid to a parent in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, or Switzerland.
Regarding dividends received or capital gains generated by a Czech parent company, the participation exemption may also be applied if the subsidiary is a tax resident of a country where a DTT with the Czech Republic is in place, the subsidiary has a legal form similar to a limited liability company or a joint stock company, it is subject to CIT at the nominal rate of at least 12% in a year when dividends are paid, and the time test of holding at least 10% share for at least 12 consecutive calendar months in that subsidiary is met.
## Interest and royalty income
Interest and royalties received by Czech tax residents are included in the standard tax base subject to the 21% CIT rate in tax periods starting in 2024 (previously 19%).
Czech-source interest and royalty income received by Czech tax non-residents is subject to 15% WHT, unless subject to domestic exemption or a DTT stipulates otherwise. An increased WHT rate of 35% applies to interest and royalties paid by Czech tax residents to entities that are not tax residents in any EU or EEA member state or in a country with which the Czech Republic concluded a DTT or TIEA.
Under domestic law (in line with the EU Interest and Royalty Directive), interest and/or royalty income is exempt if it is paid by a Czech resident to an EU resident recipient who is a beneficial owner of the interest and/or royalty income, provided that for at least 24 months before the payment:
  * the payer is in at least a 25% parent-subsidiary or at least a 25% direct sister relation to the recipient of the income and
  * the interest and/or royalty is not attributable to a Czech PE of the recipient.


The exemption is applicable subject to approval by the tax authorities.
## Exchange gains and losses
Realised foreign exchange (FX) gains and losses are accounted for in profit and loss accounts and represent taxable revenues or tax-deductible costs, respectively. The same treatment applies to unrealised foreign exchange differences.
From 2024, as an option and subject to notification to the tax administrator, taxpayers may choose to exclude the unrealised FX differences (i.e. FX differences resulting from revaluation of balance sheet assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency to CZK using the exchange rate as of the last day of the accounting period) from the CIT base. These excluded FX differences are then added back to the CIT base when realised.
The default functional currency for accounting and CIT purposes is CZK. From 2024, taxpayers may decide to keep their statutory accounting books in EUR, USD, or GBP, provided it is the actual functional currency of their economic environment. The accounting currency is then also used for CIT base calculation purposes. For other taxes, including VAT, CZK still has to be used. 
## Controlled foreign company (CFC) rules
The CIT base of the company can also be increased by income generated by foreign direct or indirect subsidiary of the company under the CFC rules. _See the section for more information_.


# Czech Republic
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
Corporate income tax (CIT) applies to the profits generated by all companies, including branches of foreign companies. Corporate partners in general partnerships (i.e. unlimited) and corporate general partners (i.e. unlimited) in a limited partnership are subject to CIT on their share of the profits in the partnership.
Czech resident companies are required to pay CIT on income derived from worldwide sources. Non-resident companies are required to pay CIT on income sourced in the Czech Republic.
The CIT rate is 21% for tax periods starting in 2024 (19% for the previous tax periods) and applies to all business profits, including capital gains from the sale of shares (if not exempt under the participation exemption regime)
In 2023 through 2025, a ’windfall tax‘ (60% CIT surcharge) applies to excess profits of large banks and companies within the energy sector. The excess profits are calculated on the basis of the average CIT base declared by the company in years 2018 through 2021, and this average CIT base is then increased by 20%. The part of the annual CIT base generated by the company in years 2023 through 2025 that exceeds this increased average CIT base for years 2018 through 2021 is subject not only to the standard CIT of 19% (21% in 2024 and 2025) but also to the additional CIT surcharge of 60% (therefore, the total CIT applying to these excessive profits is 79% [81% in 2024 and 2025]).
There is a special CIT rate of 15% levied on dividend income of Czech tax resident entities received from non-resident entities (unless subject to participation exemption).
A 5% CIT rate applies to income of certain investment funds, and a 0% CIT rate applies to pension funds.
## Pillar 2 minimum tax
Czech law implemented the GloBE rules, i.e. the Income Inclusion Rule (effective from 31 December 2023) and the Undertaxed Payments Rule (effective from 31 December 2024). Also, the Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax of 15% was introduced (from 31 December 2023), together with Transitional CbCR, UTPR Safe Harbours, and QDMTT Safe Harbour.
The Pillar 2 rules apply to multinational groups with presence in the Czech Republic. The groups are in scope if the revenue in their Consolidated Financial Statements as prepared in accordance with an acceptable Financial Accounting Standard of the ultimate parent entity (UPE) exceeds EUR 750 million based on at least two of the four fiscal years immediately preceding the fiscal year.
## Local income taxes
There are no regional or local income taxes in the Czech Republic.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is generally charged at 21% on supplies of goods and services within the Czech Republic.
Certain supplies (e.g. groceries [excluding most drinks], medicaments, drinking tap water, construction works related to social housing, hotel accommodation, admission to cultural, sport, theatre, or similar facilities, catering services, heat, and cold) are taxed at a rate of 12% starting 1 January 2024.
There is no VAT on books in printed or electronic form starting 1 January 2024.
Exports are generally exempt from VAT with a credit. Some supplies are exempt without a credit, including the lease of real estate (with certain exceptions), financial and insurance services, education, health, and welfare.
VAT deduction on personal cars is limited to CZK 420,000.
### VAT registration
Companies seated in the Czech Republic whose turnover exceeds CZK 2 million in a calendar year must register as a VAT payer with the tax authorities. If the turnover exceeds CZK 2,536,500, they become a VAT payer immediately.
For non-resident companies, there is no registration threshold, but they must register as a VAT payer(unless they opt-in for a SME scheme for the Czech Republic in the EU country of their establishment) if they:
  * make any supply subject to Czech VAT (unless the liability to declare and pay VAT is shifted to the recipient of the supply), or
  * supply goods from the Czech Republic to another European Union (EU) member state.


A company can register as a VAT payer voluntarily even if its turnover does not reach the threshold if it renders or is going to render taxable supplies or VAT exempt supplies with credit in the Czech Republic.
Under certain circumstances, companies not registered for VAT to whom VAT liability arises due to acquired goods or services become persons identified for VAT. A person identified for VAT only pays VAT from received supplies without being entitled to recover related input VAT in its VAT return.
### VAT returns and payments
The VAT return must be filed and tax paid within 25 days after the end of the taxable period. The taxable period is a calendar month (or calendar quarter under certain circumstances). All VAT payers registered in the Czech Republic have to submit a report, a so-called ‘control statement’. In the control statement, the VAT payers have to give detailed evidence of data from invoices that have been issued and received, so that the Czech Financial Administration can compare and check transactions with business partners. The control statement does not substitute for a VAT return. Legal entities have to file the report every calendar month, and the deadline for submission of the control statement is no later than 25 days after the taxable period. VAT payers have to submit all VAT reports to the Czech tax authorities electronically.
## Customs duties
The Czech Republic is an EU member state; consequently, the EU customs code applies.
## Excise taxes
Excise tax is charged on the production or import of certain products, such as tobacco, and tobacco products and heated tobacco products, wines, semi-products, spirits and pure ethanol, beer, fuel, and mineral oils.
## Energy taxes
Energy tax is charged on natural gas and certain other gases, solid fuels, and on electricity sold to final customers in the Czech Republic.
## Real estate tax
Real estate tax is payable annually by the owner of land or buildings. The amount of the tax is dependent on area, location, and usage of the land or buildings. Paved areas used for business purposes (such as concrete areas in logistics centres) are taxable, with taxpayers obligated to self-assess the tax. However, some areas (e.g. publicly accessible parking lands in shopping malls) are not taxable. Effectively from 2025, the calculation of tax will be affected by an inflation coefficient. 
## Real estate transfer tax
The real estate transfer tax was abolished in 2020. 
## Stamp duties
There are no stamp duties in the Czech Republic. Certain business operations in which a notary has to be involved by operation of law are subject to notarial fee.
## Payroll taxes
Employers (including economic employers and certain types of PEs) in the Czech Republic are obligated to submit monthly withholdings and an annual reconciliation in respect of their employees. The withholdings include personal income tax (PIT) and statutory social security and health insurance.
## Social security and health insurance contributions
Employers contribute 33.8% of the employee's gross salary to the state health and social security funds (9% for health insurance and 24.8% for social security). A cap on only the social security contributions applies, while the health insurance contribution is uncapped.
## Road tax
Road tax is payable annually with respect to vehicles (including private vehicles) used for commercial purposes. Rates vary depending on engine capacity and vehicle size. From 2022, the road tax was effectively abolished for cars, buses, and trucks up to 12 tons. Road tax for vehicles exceeding this limit remains in place.
## Exit tax
There is no separate exit tax as such. The exit taxation (implemented in line with the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive [ATAD]) is part of the CIT. The rate is thus the same as for the standard CIT, i.e. 19%. The tax is imposed upon the relocation of assets without a change of ownership (i) between the Czech company and its foreign PE whose income is exempt from Czech taxation based on a double tax treaty (DTT), (ii) between a Czech PE and the foreign headquarters if subsequent sales of such assets were not taxable in the Czech Republic, or (iii) when a Czech tax resident changes its tax residence if subsequent sales of such assets were not taxable in the Czech Republic.
A taxpayer shall be subject to the tax on the amount equal to the market value of the transferred assets, at the time of exit of the assets, less their values for tax purposes. The instalments may further defer the tax payment over the next five years.
The only exceptions are asset transfers related to financing of securities, assets posted as collateral, etc. if the assets are set to revert to the member state of the transferor within 12 months.
## Gambling tax
Gambling tax applies to the operation of a gambling game in the territory of the Czech Republic, provided the operation requires a gambling licence or the game a registration under the relevant gambling law.
The tax rate for technical gambling (land-based and on the web) is 35% and for other gambling games (e.g. dice, cards, roulette, bingo, odds betting, horse race betting, raffles, or poker) is 30%. The tax base is the gross gaming revenue (bets less pay-outs).
