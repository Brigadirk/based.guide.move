# Czech Republic
## Overview
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
The Czech Republic, a landlocked country in Central Europe, is bordered by Poland to the north, Germany to the west, Austria to the south, and Slovakia to the east. It is divided into 14 regions, with Prague as the capital. The official language of the Czech Republic is Czech, and the currency is the Czech koruna (CZK).
The Czech Republic split from Slovakia on 1 January 1993 and is now one of the most stable and prosperous countries in Central and Eastern Europe. The Czech Republic is a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (from 1995), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) (from 1999), and the European Union (EU) (from 2004).
Maintaining an open investment climate has been a key element of the Czech Republic's transition to a functioning market economy. As a member of the European Union, with an advantageous location in the centre of Europe, a relatively low-cost structure, and a well-qualified labour force, the Czech Republic is an attractive destination for foreign investment.
The Czech economy was growing six years in a row prior to 2020. However, in 2020, due to the impact of global COVID-19 pandemic, the gross domestic product (GDP) declined by -5.6%. In 2021, the GDP increased by 3.3%, and in 2022, there was an increase by 2.4%. In 2023, the GDP declined by -0.4%.
PwC has been present in the Czech Republic since 1990. Our tax practice focuses on corporate tax services, indirect tax services, selected personal income tax services, tax compliance and accounting services, legal services, and people and organisation services.
