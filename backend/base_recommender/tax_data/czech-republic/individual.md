## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
## Foreign tax relief
Based on Czech domestic tax legislation, when eliminating double taxation of income from abroad, the provisions of DTTs concluded by the Czech Republic are to be followed. Alternatively, in some cases, income from abroad can be exempt from taxation in the Czech Republic based on the local Czech legislation. If no applicable treaty exists, the income can be reduced by the tax paid on the income abroad.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
The Czech Republic has progressive personal income tax (PIT) rates (with two tax brackets applicable to almost all types of income) as follows:
  * Basic tax rate of 15% for annual gross income up to 1,676,052 Czech koruna (CZK).
  * Increased rate of 23% for annual gross income over CZK 1,676,052.


Certain types of capital income (such as dividends and interest income from bonds) are subject to the 15% tax rate.
An important change that will come into effect from 1 January 2025 is limitation for tax exemption of capital gains from sale of shares in companies. Until the end of 2024, a full tax exemption of capital gains from sale of shares is available to individuals if the individual owned the shares for a period exceeding three years for shares having the form of securities and five years for shares in other companies. From 2025, the maximum annual amount of income (i.e. the sales price of the shares) that can be tax exempt will be limited to CZK 40 million.
Extensive VAT Act amendment was adopted. A registration threshold CZK 2,000,000 is newly calculated for calendar year. If the turnover exceeds CZK 2,536,500, the entity becomes a VAT payer immediately. A time limit for input VAT recovery was shortened and rules for its adjustment in case of overdue debts were modified. Small Business Scheme was extended. A number of other changes come info effect.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
Czech tax residents are generally subject to Czech income tax on their worldwide income. Tax non-residents are generally taxed only on income considered Czech-source income.
## Personal income tax rates
The Czech Republic applies progressive taxation on income of tax residents as follows:
  * Gross annual income up to CZK 1,676,052 (the bracket is calculated as 36x average monthly salary) is subject to a 15% rate.
  * Gross annual income exceeding this threshold is subject to a rate of 23%.


The above rates apply to all types of income, except for income that has already been taxed by the final Czech withholding tax (WHT) at source (such as dividends or interest from bonds distributed by Czech companies) and except for certain types of foreign income included in the separate tax base (_see below_).
## Separate tax base
A special tax base with the rate of 15% applies to selected types of non-Czech investment income (e.g. dividends and interest from bonds from abroad).
Individuals can choose to include capital income from abroad in this separate tax base to which a flat 15% tax rate applies. However, tax allowances or tax-deductible items cannot be applied to reduce this tax base. The individual can thus decide whether to leave the capital income from abroad in the general tax base, which is subject to the progressive 15% and 23% rates but which can be reduced by tax allowances and deductible items, or to include this income in the separate tax base, which is subject to the flat 15% tax rate but cannot be reduced by tax allowances and deductible items.
## Local income taxes
There are no local taxes on income in the Czech Republic.

## Taxable period
The tax period is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
The basic filing and payment deadline is 1 April of the year following the tax period. As of 2021, an automatic extension to 1 May is possible for taxpayers filing electronically. The deadline of 1 July applies if a Czech registered tax advisor files the tax return, as long as a power of attorney authorising the registered tax advisor to prepare the return is filed by this deadline (i.e. before or together with the tax return at the latest). Further extension might be granted by the Czech tax authorities upon properly substantiated request. The same deadlines also apply to the payment of any outstanding annual tax liability (i.e. for taxpayers filing personally, it is 1 April or 1 May depending on the filing form; for tax advisors filing on behalf of taxpayers, it is either 1 April or 1 July). The deadline for tax refund is 30 days following the tax filing deadline (as detailed above) provided that the tax authorities approve the tax return.
## Payment of tax
Income tax is withheld monthly at source from income from employment for employees of a Czech company or branch and for employees of a foreign company assigned to work in the Czech branch of that foreign company. Czech law also contains a deemed employer rule whereby an employee of a foreign company who performs work for, and takes orders from, a Czech individual or company may be seen as an employee for payroll withholding purposes irrespective of the legal employment arrangements. Unless the relevant DTT provides otherwise, non-resident individuals working in the Czech Republic (e.g. consultants) who are not employees will be subject to 15% withholding by the Czech entity/person paying for the services.For all sources of income that have not been liable to Czech tax at source, individuals are responsible for making payments of tax in advance on the basis of prior-year liability. This usually applies to the employment income of foreigners assigned to the Czech Republic by an employer, regardless of whether the employer has a PE in the Czech Republic.


# Czech Republic
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
Generally, with the exception of employment income, necessary expenses incurred in earning income are deductible from income. Normally, deductions will be based on the actual expenditure incurred; however, for certain categories of income, a fixed percentage of gross income may be claimed as a deduction (e.g. lump-sum deductions of 80% for agricultural income or craft activities, 60% for a limited number of trading and entrepreneurial activities, 40% for activities pursuant to the special statutory provision, 30% for renting a property). However, the lump-sum expense deductions are applicable only up to the maximum amount of the respective percentage out of CZK 2 million (i.e. maximum CZK 1,600,000, CZK 1,200,000, CZK 800,000, or CZK 600,000, respectively).
Tax-deductible expenses are broadly defined in Czech tax law as expenses incurred to ‘attain, secure, and/or maintain’ taxable income, though specific restrictions are placed on certain costs.
## Employment expenses
No deductions are provided for expenditures incurred in connection with taxable income from employment. However, sums received by way of reimbursement for travel expenses are exempt from tax, provided they do not exceed statutory limits.
## Personal deductions
Personal tax base and tax deductions are generally available for Czech tax residents. Tax non-residents should have at least 90% of worldwide income from Czech sources to utilise them.
### Charitable contributions
Donations provided to certain organisations or individuals for the purpose of financing science, education, culture, etc. are deductible for an individual up to a maximum of 15% of the tax base*, provided the total value of the donations exceeds 2% of the tax base or is at least CZK 1,000. Blood donation is also considered a form of charitable donation, which is valued at CZK 3,000 per one blood collection.
* For the years 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025 the maximum limit was temporarily increased up to 30% of the tax base.
### Mortgage interest deduction
For interest paid on a mortgage, a deduction is applicable under several strict conditions up to:
  * CZK 150,000 per year for housing needs 'procured' after 1 January 2021.
  * CZK 300,000 per year for housing needs 'procured' before 1 January 2021.


### Old age savings products
As of 2024, there is a new tax deduction available for old age savings products. This deduction includes private pension insurance, life insurance premiums, and long-term investments products. This deduction is applicable up to CZK 48,000 per year under certain conditions.
## Personal allowances
Unlike other countries that permit personal exemptions and allowances in determining taxable income, the Czech Republic has adopted a system of tax credits (_see the section for more information_).
## Business deductions
Deductible expenses for an entrepreneur are generally the same as those permitted under the corporate income tax system (_see the section in the Corporate tax summary_). For example, fixed assets can be depreciated in accordance with statutory rates. Czech legislation also allows entrepreneurs to deduct travel expenses (within statutory limits), insurance costs, and research and development (R&D) expenditure.
## Losses
Losses arising from a source of income are offset against other sources of income in the year in which such income arises, with the exception of employment income. If an overall loss is realised, it can be carried forward and offset against taxable income (other than employment income) arising in the following five years. From 2020, tax losses may be carried back for two years.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
## Taxation on cash basis
Individuals are taxed in the Czech Republic on a cash basis (with certain exceptions). That means that, in general, income becomes taxable for the individual only after the income has actually been received by the individual.
## Employment income
The taxable income of employees includes all wages, salaries, bonuses paid, and any benefits in kind (subject to minor exceptions) received as a result of employment. Benefits in kind are valued in principle at open-market values, although a fixed rate of 12% _per annum_ of the purchase price is applied to cars provided by the employer to the employees for both business and private use. The reimbursement of travel expenses in excess of fairly low statutory limits is also a taxable benefit for the employee. Certain non-monetary educational, sporting, and health benefits are non-taxable up to the limit of CZK 23,278 (limit for 2025), provided that other conditions are met. Temporary accommodation provided by an employer as a non-monetary benefit is not taxable up to CZK 3,500 per month if arrangements are properly structured. A cash accommodation allowance is taxable. Employers may provide tax exempt cash catering allowance up to a limit of CZK 116.20 per work shift (limit for 2024). This benefit is being introduced in addition to already existing meal vouchers or company canteen as alternative forms of tax-advantaged catering support.Non-resident directors’ fees and fees payable to non-resident members of other statutory bodies of Czech companies are subject to a WHT of:
  * 15% for residents of the European Union, European Economic Area (EEA), or a DTT country (or a country with which the Czech Republic has an agreement on exchange of tax information in place).
  * 35% for the rest.


No further tax is payable on this income.
When paid to tax residents, directors’ fees and fees to members of other statutory bodies of Czech companies are taxed under the payroll administration rule. All resident and non-resident directors from EU member states and other countries from the European Economic Area may, however, file the tax return when they utilise their personal tax deduction(s).
## Capital gains
There is no separate capital gains tax in the Czech Republic. Capital gains constitute part of the aggregate individual income tax base subject to progressive PIT rates depending on the overall level of gross income.Gains on the sale of property are exempt if the individual has owned the property for longer than the specified time limit.
The main time limits are as follows:
  * Three years for direct ownership of securities (such as shares of a joint stock company) and five years for shares in other companies not represented by a security. As of 2025, this exemption will be limited by an annual cap for gross proceeds (i.e. sales price of the securities + other shares) of CZK 40 million; proceeds above the cap will be subject to standard progressive taxation.
  * Two years for one’s personal residence used for living immediately prior to the sale (five years for real estate in other cases - purchased until 2020).
  * Ten years for real estate not stated above (this limit does not apply if one uses the funds to provide for one's own housing needs) - applicable for real estate purchased as of 2021.
  * One year for cars, ships, and planes.


Note that the above applies to gains on property that do not form part of the individual's business property. Gains on business property are taxed based on principles similar to those that apply to companies.
Note that gross proceeds from the sale of shares below the limit of CZK 100,000 per taxable period are exempt from taxation.
## Dividend and interest income
Income from capital (i.e. dividends and other yields from securities, limited liability companies or limited partnerships, and interest and profit shares from silent partnerships) is taxable income and is generally treated as a part of the total annual tax base.
Dividends and other yields from securities or partnerships from limited liability companies or limited partnerships, profit shares from silent partnerships, and interest from deposit certificates and bonds paid by a Czech resident entity to a Czech tax resident are all subject to WHT of 15%. A WHT rate of 15% applies to income received by resident individuals from interest and other yields from savings on deposit accounts.
The rate of 15% also applies to income paid to Czech tax non-residents residing in EU/EEA states or in a state having concluded a DTT or an agreement on exchange of tax information with the Czech Republic. In other cases, the tax rate for this type of income is 35%.
WHT may be reduced under the applicable DTT. Several of these treaties further reduce the rate of WHT. Reduced WHT rates are only applicable if the individual remains tax resident in another jurisdiction (i.e. the other party to the DTT) and is not treated as a Czech tax resident as defined under the treaty.
Dividend income and interest from bonds received from abroad can be included in the separate tax base, which is subject to a flat 15% tax rate (_see the section_).
## Rental income
Income from the lease of real estate or the lease/rental of movable property represents another subgroup of taxable income. Deductible expenditures can be determined either as actual expenses or as a lump-sum percentage of taxable income (30%). Annual lump-sum expenses are limited to CZK 600,000.


# Czech Republic
## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
The following annual tax credits may be available to individual taxpayers for 2024:
  * General personal tax credit: CZK 30,840 (CZK 27,840 for 2021).
  * Dependent spouse tax credit: CZK 24,840 if the spouse lives with the taxpayer and does not have income in excess of CZK 68,000. Criteria for this deduction will be limited as of 2024 and applicable only in case that the spouse is taking care of a child who is no older than three years.
  * Child tax credit: CZK 15,204 for the first, CZK 22,320 for the second, and CZK 27,840 for the third and other following dependent child (under certain conditions). If the total tax is lower than the respective child credit, the taxpayer will receive a special tax bonus equal to the difference between the child allowances and one’s tax liability. Until 2020, the maximum amount of tax bonus was CZK 60,300 per year. As of 2021, this limitation was abolished.
  * Deduction for placement of child in a pre-school facility: Actual provable expenses up to the annual limit of CZK 16,200 (CZK 15,200 for 2021). This deduction is abolished as of 2024.
  * Disability tax credit: CZK 2,520, CZK 5,040, or CZK 16,140 (depending on the severity of disability).
  * Student tax credit: CZK 4,020 (for regular students up to 26 years old and university-level doctoral students up to 28 years old). This deduction is abolished as of 2024.




# Czech Republic
## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
An individual is considered a resident for tax purposes in the Czech Republic if either of the following conditions is met:
  * The individual has a permanent home in the Czech Republic (either an owned or rented residence where the individual has the intention to live permanently). The possession of a long-term visa does not, by itself, make an individual a tax resident in the Czech Republic.
  * The individual is present in the Czech Republic for 183 or more days in a calendar year. This includes the days of arrival and departure.


An individual not meeting the conditions of Czech tax residency is considered Czech tax non-resident. Non-residents present in the Czech Republic for less than 183 days in any 12-month period and working for a foreign employer with no taxable presence in the Czech Republic are not subject to Czech income tax on employment income from work performed in the Czech Republic (Czech-source income).
Generally, the following individuals are subject to Czech tax on Czech-source income, irrespective of the number of days of physical presence in the country:
  * All employees of a Czech company, including all branches.
  * Expatriate assignees whose salary costs are borne directly by or recharged to a Czech entity (or a permanent establishment [PE]).
  * Statutory representatives or members of the Board of Directors or Supervisory Board of Czech companies.


## Dual residency
If the individual is considered resident in more than one country, the final tax residency is determined based on the applicable double tax treaty (DTT). Most DTTs define an individual as a Czech tax resident if one has a permanent home in the Czech Republic, a strong personal and/or economic connection to the Czech Republic, a habitual place of residence in the Czech Republic, or Czech citizenship. _Please see the section for a list of DTTs_.

## Social security and health insurance contributions
Social security taxes are obligatory for an individual employed by a Czech company. Most foreign secondees working in a Czech company are obligated to pay Czech social security and health insurance unless the European Union (EU) regulation or social security treaty states otherwise. The rules on participation in the Czech social security and health insurance system are complex, and each secondee's situation should be reviewed individually.
Social security contributions provide funding for three separate funds: pensions, unemployment benefits, and sickness (together with other benefits). Entrepreneurs can choose whether to contribute to the sickness fund.
Health insurance covers medical care. An individual can choose the licensed insurance company to which one will pay health insurance contributions.
Mandatory contributions are calculated from the individual's gross remuneration. Income that is subject to income tax is generally subject to contributions into the social security and health insurance system.
The contribution rates calculated from the gross salary are as follows:
  * The employer: 24.8% for social security and 9% for health insurance.
  * The employee: 7.1% for social security and 4.5% for health insurance.


The payments are made by the employer (for both the employee's part deducted from one's gross salary and the employer's parts paid on top of the gross salary).
The maximum annual cap for the assessment base for calculation of contributions into the social security system is 48 times the average monthly wage per year (i.e. CZK 2,234,736 for 2025). This cap applies to both employees and entrepreneurs.
There is no cap for contribution for the health insurance.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is generally charged at 21% on supplies of goods and services within the Czech Republic.
Certain supplies (e.g. groceries [excluding most drinks], medicaments, drinking tap water, construction works related to social housing, hotel accommodation, admission to cultural, sport, theatre, or similar facilities, catering services, heat, and cold) are taxed at a rate of 12% starting 1 January 2024.
There is no VAT on books in printed or electronic form starting 1 January 2024.
Exports are generally exempt from VAT with a credit. Some supplies are exempt without a credit, including the lease of real estate (with certain exceptions), financial and insurance services, education, health, and welfare.
VAT deduction on personal cars is limited to CZK 420,000.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in the Czech Republic.
## Inheritance and gift tax
There is no inheritance tax.
Gifts are not taxed by a special gift tax, but rather they are included in the recipient's PIT. A tax exemption applies to gifts received from close relatives.
## Property tax
Property tax is paid each year from real estate owned by the taxpayer as at 1 January of the respective year. The amount is based on the type and size of the real estate, the purpose of usage, and the location.
## Tax on real estate acquisition
There is no real estate acquisition tax, transfer tax, or similar tax.
