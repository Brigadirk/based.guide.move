## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
## Foreign tax relief
Any foreign-source salary received by a resident individual is exempt from tax in Pakistan if the individual has paid foreign income tax in respect of that salary.
Where a resident taxpayer derives foreign-source income chargeable to tax in Pakistan, in respect of which the taxpayer has paid foreign tax, the taxpayer is allowed a credit of an amount equal to the lesser of the foreign income tax paid or the Pakistan tax payable in respect of the income.
Foreign-source income of a resident who is not a citizen of Pakistan is exempt if the individual is resident only by virtue of employment and one’s presence in Pakistan does not exceed three years. This exemption does not apply in the case of income from a business established in Pakistan and foreign-source income that is brought into or received in Pakistan.
## Tax treaties
Pakistan has executed tax treaties with more than 66 countries (_see the_ _section in the Corporate tax summary for a list of countries with which Pakistan has a tax treaty_). These conventions aim to eliminate double taxation of income or gains arising in one territory and paid to residents of another territory. The provisions of the tax treaties take precedence over the tax laws applicable in Pakistan with respect to taxation of Pakistan-source income of a non-resident person (_subject to certain restrictions now introduced in law; for detail, please refer to the section in the Corporate tax summary_). Most of the treaties are based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Tax Convention.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year is 1 July through 30 June.
## Tax returns and statements
An individual is required to file a return of income with the tax authorities on a fiscal year basis (1 July through 30 June). Filing of a revised return requires prior approval of the Commissioner, subject to certain limitations and conditions. The Commissioner is now also empowered to grant approval for revision of a return for a bona fide omission or wrong statement.
Every resident taxpayer filing a return of income is required to file a wealth statement (in the prescribed format) along with the return of income. The Commissioner can also require any person to furnish the said statement. For revision of a wealth statement, an intimation has to be filed with the Commissioner, who is empowered to disallow/disregard such revision in case he/she is of the view that the same has not been made for correction of bona fide errors or omissions. A taxpayer has been allowed to make revision of a wealth statement up to a period of five years. 
Every resident taxpayer being an individual and having foreign income equal to or in excess of 10,000 United States dollars (USD) or having foreign assets with a value of USD 100,000 or more is now also required to file a separate statement of foreign income and foreign assets in a prescribed format. The Commissioner can also require any person to furnish such statement.
All individuals (including salaried persons) are required to file their return/wealth statement for the year ended 30 June by 30 September. Late filing shall be liable to penalty proceedings.
Persons whose income was subject to the final tax regime were previously required to file a statement prescribed in the law in lieu of a return of income; however, such requirement has now been omitted. The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) is to prescribe returns for different classes of income or persons, including those covered by the final tax regime.
## Payment of tax
Income tax is withheld from salaries by the employer. The amount to be withheld is determined by applying to the salary the average rate of tax on the estimated income of the employee for the fiscal year.
Advance tax is payable by an individual (other than a salaried individual) in four instalments if the latest assessed taxable income is in excess of PKR 1 million.
## Statute of limitations
An audit of the tax return filed by a taxpayer can be conducted by the tax authorities within five years of the end of the financial year in which the return is filed. A person whose income tax affairs have been audited in any preceding four tax years shall have immunity from selection of audit. However, amendment proceedings may be initiated other than by way of selection of audit.
Tax authorities can probe into the source of unexplained offshore assets and foreign-source income irrespective of any time limitation.
The time period to pass an amendment order is 180 days from the issuance of show cause notice.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The tax authorities mainly focus their attention on taxpayers other than salaried individuals.

## Employment income
Employee’s gross salary is Pakistan-source income and taxable in Pakistan if it is earned from employment exercised in Pakistan or if it is paid by or on behalf of the federal government, a provincial government, or a local authority.
Salary is the amount received by an employee from employment. It includes leave pay, payment in lieu of leave, overtime, bonuses, commissions, fees, gratuities, work condition supplements, monetary and non-monetary perquisites, any allowances, including those paid on a fixed basis or not exclusively spent on behalf of the employer, profits in lieu of or in addition to salary, pensions, annuities, and tax reimbursement. In addition, amounts or perquisites paid or provided by an associate of the employer, a third-party under an arrangement with the employer or associate of the employer, a past employer or a prospective employer, or payments to an associate of the employee are also to be considered as salary.
_The extent of taxability and exclusions from income of some perquisites are discussed in the_ _section_.
## Equity compensation
### Employee share scheme
The fair market value of the shares determined at the date of issue under an employee share scheme, including as a result of the exercise of an option or right to acquire the shares, as reduced by any consideration paid by the employee for the shares, shall be chargeable to tax as salary. However, where shares are issued to the employee subject to restriction on the transfer of such shares, no amount shall be included in salary of the employee until the earlier of the time the employee has a free right to transfer the shares or at the time when the employee disposes of the shares.
The value of the right or option to acquired shares under an employee share scheme is not chargeable to tax
### Stock options
An employee is taxed on the exercise of an option on the fair market value of the shares as reduced by the cost to the employee on acquisition. The gain on sale is taxed in the year of disposal, considering the fair market value at the time of exercise of the option as a cost of the employee.
## Foreign-source income of returning expatriates
Foreign-source income of returning expatriates (citizens of Pakistan who were not resident in Pakistan during any of the preceding four tax years) shall be exempt from tax in the tax year of return and the succeeding tax year.
## Income from property
Income from property for all taxpayers has been made subject to uniform taxation on a net income basis at the applicable rates. This means that the separate block rates for chargeability of tax on property income of individuals or AOPs are no longer applicable. In the case that rental income is computed on a net income basis, certain specific deductions are allowed, including expenditure for the purpose of administration and collection charges (up to a threshold of 4% of gross receipts).
WHT rates applicable in case of payment of rent of immovable property to individuals or AOPs are:
Taxable income (PKR) | Tax on column 1 (PKR) | Tax on excess (%)  
---|---|---  
Over (column 1) | Not over  
0 | 300,000 | 0  
300,000 | 600,000 | 5  
600,000 | 2,000,000 | 15,000 | 10  
2,000,000 | 155,000 | 25  
These WHT rates shall increase by 100% in case the recipient of rental income is not an active taxpayer.
All payments made on account of rent of immovable properties shall be subject to the above WHT rates (if made to an individual or AOP), including in case of sub-lease.
Loss sustain under any heading of income is allowed to be set off against the person’s income under this heading.
## Capital gains
Capital gains on the sale, exchange, or transfer of movable capital assets, except for securities traded at a stock exchange, are taxable at normal slab rates prescribed for individuals. Capital gain arising on these capital assets held for more than one year, which was earlier taxable to the extent of 75% of the total gain, is now fully taxable.
### Capital gain on immovable properties
The gain arising on the disposal of immovable property shall be computed as the consideration received on disposal of the asset less the cost of the asset and is subject to tax as follows:

Capital gains relating to disposal of immovable properties situated outside Pakistan will be taxed at applicable slab rates irrespective of holding period.
Purchase of immovable property exceeding PKR 5 million and any other asset exceeding PKR 1 million by way of other than a banking channel shall not be considered as an eligible cost for the purpose of computation of capital gain, and the related asset shall not be considered as an eligible depreciable asset. Moreover, such action would also invite penal consequences for the purchaser. 
Purchase, sale, and transfer of immovable property is subject to advance tax at rates ranging from 3% to 4%, depending upon the gross consideration/fair market price of the immovable property. These rates are subject to increase in case buyer or seller are late filers / non-active taxpayers.

However, the rate shall be 25% for other funds in case of a company. In case of stock funds, if dividend receipts of the fund are less than capital gains, the rate of deduction shall be 15%. No tax shall be deducted if the holding period of a security is more than six years.
Loss on disposal of listed and other securities could earlier only be set off against capital gains (and not allowed to be carried forward). From tax year 2019 and onwards, such loss is now allowed to be carried forward and set off against future capital gains on such securities, up to a maximum of three tax years.

This deduction shall be full and final discharge of their tax liability.
## Dividend income
Dividend income received from a company (including mutual funds and real estate investment trusts [REITs], etc.) is generally subject to final tax at the rate of 15%; however, a different rate would apply in the following cases:
