## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 06 May 2024
Income is taxable when it accrues in or is derived from Singapore, whether or not the individual is resident in Singapore. Income derived from sources outside Singapore is only taxable if it is received in Singapore by a resident individual through a partnership in Singapore.
Resident individuals are entitled to certain personal reliefs and deductions and are subject to graduated tax rates ranging from 0% to 24%. Non-resident individuals are not entitled to any personal reliefs and deductions and are subject to tax at a flat rate of 24%. As a concession, employment income of non-residents is taxed at the higher of a flat rate of 15% or the graduated resident rates with personal reliefs. This concession does not apply to non-resident directors.
## Individual income tax rates
### Residents
A resident individual's taxable income (after setoff of personal reliefs and deductions) is subject to income tax at progressive rates. Current rates from the year of assessment 2024 (income year 2023) are shown below.
Taxable income (SGD) | Year of assessment 2024 onwards  
---|---  
Over (column 1) | Not over | Tax on column 1 (SGD) | Percentage on excess (%)   
0 | 20,000 | - | -  
20,000 | 30,000 | - | 2.00  
30,000 | 40,000 | 200 | 3.50  
40,000 | 80,000 | 550 | 7.00  
80,000 | 120,000 | 3,350 | 11.50  
120,000 | 160,000 | 7,950 | 15.00  
160,000 | 200,000 | 13,950 | 18.00  
200,000 | 240,000 | 21,150 | 19.00  
240,000 | 280,000 | 28,750 | 19.50  
280,000 | 320,000 | 36,550 | 20.00  
320,000 | 500,000 | 44,550 | 22.00  
500,000 | 1,000,000 | 84,150 | 23.00  
1,000,000 | 199,150 | 24.00  
For year of assessment 2024, all resident individuals will be granted a tax rebate of 50% of tax payable, capped at SGD 200.
### Non-residents
Non-resident individuals are taxed at a flat rate of 24%, except that employment income is taxed at a flat rate of 15% or at resident rates with personal reliefs, whichever yields a higher tax. A non-resident director’s remuneration does not qualify for the reduced rate, and withholding tax (WHT) at 24% must be deducted from remuneration paid to a non-resident director.
## Local income taxes
There are no other taxes on income in Singapore.


# Singapore
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 06 May 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year in Singapore is the calendar year. An individual’s income from a preceding calendar year is assessed to tax in the following calendar year (i.e. year of assessment).
## Tax returns
Each taxpayer is required to make an annual return of income and of such particulars as may be required to determine the personal reliefs and deductions. The tax return must be filed on a calendar-year basis and must be submitted by 15 April. If filed electronically, the deadline is 18 April.
## Payment of tax
The tax assessed is payable within one month of the date of the assessment whether or not a notice of objection to the assessment has been lodged with the tax authorities. The notice of objection must be lodged within 30 days of the date of the notice of assessment, failing which the assessment will be treated as final.
In the case of an employee, the tax authorities will, upon application, generally allow the payment of tax by monthly instalments with no interest, using the Interbank GIRO system (an interbank fund transfer system).
### Clearance for foreigners
Singapore does not have payroll withholding. When a foreign citizen employee ceases employment in Singapore or leaves Singapore for a period exceeding three months or on an overseas posting, the employer needs to notify the Singapore tax authorities and withhold all monies due (unless the Singapore taxes are fully borne by the employer) until tax clearance is issued. The notification must be made no later than one month prior to the date of cessation/departure. Foreigners are also subject to tax on unexercised/unvested stock options/awards on a deemed gain basis when they cease employment or leave Singapore.
As a concession, tax clearance need not be obtained in the following scenarios:
  * The employee is a Singapore permanent resident who is not leaving Singapore permanently. The employer should obtain a Letter of Undertaking from the employee stating that the employee has no intention to leave Singapore permanently after cessation of employment with the company. This administrative concession does not apply to overseas postings.
  * The employee is a non-Singapore citizen who: 
    * worked for 60 days or less in a calendar year (this excludes company directors and public entertainers)
    * worked for 183 days or more within a calendar year and earned less than SGD 21,000 annually
    * entered Singapore on or after 1 January 2007 and worked for 183 days or more within a continuous period straddling two years and earned less than SGD 21,000 annually (this excludes company directors and public entertainers)
    * worked for three continuous years or more and earned less than SGD 21,000 annually
    * transferred to another company in Singapore due to a company merger, a takeover, or restructuring or posting within the same group of companies, or
    * is away from Singapore for three to six months for training, business purposes, or overseas posting incidental to one's Singapore employment (subject to conditions).


## Tax audit process
The tax authority is the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS). It adopts a risk-based approach to identifying compliance risk, with a focus on improving the behaviour of taxpayers who pose a higher risk of non-compliance. The Singapore tax authorities also prioritise and tailor specific compliance programmes that aim to identify taxpayers who have made mistakes in their tax returns, create an audit presence in the community to deter non-compliance by other taxpayers, educate taxpayers on their tax obligations and how to comply with these, and identifying areas of tax law, policies, and processes where the tax system can be simplified.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations is four years from the year of assessment. It does not apply where there has been fraud or wilful default by the taxpayer.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The tax authorities are focused on self-employed taxpayers, who can include doctors, dentists, lawyers, accountants, consultants, commission agents, private tutors, renovation contractors, and bloggers.
Areas of focus include:
  * Timely filing of income tax returns.
  * Under reporting of revenue and wrongful claims of purchases/expenses by cash-based industries.
  * Arrangements that constitute tax avoidance.
  * Reconciliation of income declaration with assets purchased.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 06 May 2024
## Employment expenses
Employment expenses can be deducted from employment income if they are wholly and exclusively incurred in the production of the income in Singapore. These expenses must have been incurred by the employee in carrying out one's official duties and cannot have been reimbursed by the employer or of a capital/private nature.
## Personal deductions
### Charitable contributions
Generally, a 250% deduction may be claimed for qualifying donations to Community Chest or any approved institution of a public character (status accorded to certain charities).
### Mortgage deduction
Interest expense may be deductible, provided it is incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of taxable income. Mortgage interest is, therefore, deductible only where the property concerned yields income.
### Subscription fees
An individual can deduct annual subscriptions paid to professional institutes or societies in which membership is generally required as a condition of employment. Subscriptions paid to professional bodies or societies for professional updates, knowledge, and networking are generally allowed as a deduction as well if relevant to the individual’s employment duties. 
### Medical expenses
No deductions are allowed for medical expenses or for any other personal or household expenditure.
### Spouses
Spouses cannot transfer qualifying deductions (including excess capital allowances, trade losses, donations, and rental deficits) to each other.
Any unabsorbed trade losses or capital allowances can be carried forward to future years to be offset against the future income of the taxpayer until the amount is fully utilised, subject to existing rules. Any unutilised donations can also be carried forward to future years to be offset against the future income of the taxpayer, up to a maximum of five years.
## Personal reliefs
For year of assessment 2024 (income year 2023), the following amounts are deductible from the assessable income of a resident individual to arrive at the income subject to tax:
  * Spouse relief: SGD 2,000 provided the spouse is living with or supported by the resident individual taxpayer and the annual worldwide income of the spouse is not more than SGD 4,000 (SGD 8,000 from year of assessment 2025).
  * Handicapped spouse relief: SGD 5,500 for the maintenance of a handicapped spouse. There is no income threshold for this relief.
  * Earned income relief: Lesser of actual earned income or SGD 1,000 if age is under 55; increased for individuals who are 55 and over or are handicapped.
  * Child reliefs: 
    * Qualifying child relief: SGD 4,000 for each child under the age of 16 years or in full-time education provided the child’s annual worldwide income is not more than SGD 4,000 (SGD 8,000 from year of assessment 2025).
    * Handicapped child: SGD 7,500 instead of the qualifying child relief of SGD 4,000. There is no income threshold for this relief.
    * Working mother's child relief for each Singaporean child born or adopted before 1 January 2024, who satisfies all conditions under the qualifying child relief or handicapped child relief, is a percentage of the mother's earned income, subject to a cumulative maximum of 100% of her earned income. The percentages applicable for the first, second, and each subsequent child are 15%, 20%, and 25%, respectively. For qualifying Singaporean children born or adopted on or after 1 January 2024, the relief is SGD 8,000, SGD 10,000, and SGD 12,000 for the first, second, and each subsequent child, respectively.
Qualifying child relief and handicapped child relief may be apportioned and claimed as agreed between a husband and wife. The total relief claimed by husband and wife must not exceed the maximum claim available for each child.
  * Aged dependant relief: 
    * Aged parent or grandparent maintained by taxpayer in Singapore: SGD 5,500.
    * Aged parent or grandparent maintained and living with taxpayer in Singapore: SGD 9,000.
    * Handicapped aged parent or grandparent maintained by taxpayer in Singapore: SGD 10,000.
    * Handicapped aged parent or grandparent maintained and living with taxpayer in Singapore: SGD 14,000.
Relief for aged parents and grandparents are available subject to the dependant’s worldwide income not exceeding SGD 4,000 (SGD 8,000 from year of assessment 2025). There is no qualifying income threshold for handicapped aged parents and grandparents. Aged dependant relief may be shared by two or more taxpayers.
  * Grandparent caregiver relief: SGD 3,000 is available to working mothers with Singaporean children aged 12 years and below, subject to certain conditions. The caregiver’s annual income from any trade, business, profession, vocation, and/or employment must not exceed SGD 4,000 (SGD 8,000 in year of assessment 2025). There is no cap on the child’s age for dependent children who are handicapped and unmarried. This relief is in addition to the aged dependant relief (above).
  * Life insurance premiums: Life insurance premiums are deductible but subject to certain conditions, and the total deduction (i.e. contributions to the CPF and life insurance premium) is restricted to SGD 5,000.
  * CPF relief: Singapore citizens and permanent residents are allowed relief on contributions made to the CPF or an approved pension/provident fund but subject to the following limits: 
    * Contributions made up to the limit prescribed in the CPF Act.
    * For a self-employed individual, a relief on contributions made for each year of assessment is restricted to the lower of SGD 37,740 (i.e. CPF contributions up to the specified income ceiling of SGD 102,000) and the CPF contribution rate of 37% applied to the individual's assessable business income.
  * SRS relief: A relief on actual amount of SRS contributions, up to SGD 15,300 (for Singapore citizens and permanent residents) and up to SGD 35,700 (for foreigners) can be claimed against the income earned in the year in which the contributions are made (subject to income capping rules).
  * Educational expenses: Course fees (including tuition and examination fees) not exceeding SGD 5,500 relating to approved academic, professional, or vocational qualifications. Subject to certain conditions, the taxpayer can claim the relief within two years of assessment from the year in which the course is completed. This relief will lapse from year of assessment 2026.
  * Foreign domestic worker levy: Twice the amount of levy imposed on one foreign domestic worker is deductible against the earned income of a married woman or of a divorced or separated woman with dependent children living with her in the same household. This relief will lapse from year of assessment 2025.
  * Reservists: SGD 1,500 or SGD 3,000 for those who have completed or performed national service. An additional SGD 2,000 relief will be given to key appointment holders. A relief of SGD 750 each will also be given to Singaporean parents (who do not qualify for national service relief of their own) and wives of reservists against their own income.
  * CPF cash top-up relief: Lower of SGD 8,000 per year or the actual amount of cash top-up by the taxpayer or the employer to the taxpayer’s CPF retirement account. The taxpayer can claim a further relief of up to SGD 8,000 for top-ups made to the accounts of one's siblings, parents, parents-in-law, grandparents, grandparents-in-law, and spouse. For the taxpayer’s siblings and spouse, they must have derived income of not more than SGD 4,000 (SGD 8,000 from year of assessment 2025). In addition, individuals who make voluntary contributions to their own CPF healthcare accounts (Medisave) will be allowed tax relief up to a cap of SGD 37,740 less mandatory contributions for the year. Cash top-ups made from 1 January 2025 to the retirement account of an individual who is eligible for the matching grant under the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme will not qualify for this relief.


Additional reliefs are granted for dependant great-grandparents and handicapped siblings.
PIT reliefs are subject to a cap of SGD 80,000 per year of assessment.
## Business deductions
Where an individual carries on a trade, business, profession, or vocation, deductions are allowed for all outgoings and expenses incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of the income being assessed (except expenses specifically prohibited under the Income Tax Act), including capital allowances (fiscal depreciation) on most fixed assets except for land and non-industrial buildings. Qualifying self-employed persons may claim a deemed amount of business expenses based on a prescribed percentage of the gross income earned (known as the Fixed Expense Deduction Ratio) instead of the actual expenses incurred.
## Losses
Business losses and unutilised capital allowances may be offset against other sources of income such as employment, interest, dividend, and rental income in the same year. Any remaining unabsorbed losses and capital allowances can be carried forward, subject to certain conditions.
Current year unutilised business losses and capital allowances of up to SGD 100,000 can also be carried back to the year of assessment immediately preceding the year of assessment in which the loss and capital allowance arose.

## Individual - Other issues
Last reviewed - 06 May 2024
## Exchange controls
There are no exchange control regulations in Singapore, and, as a result, there are no restrictions on movement of funds out of Singapore. However, there is a reporting requirement if physical currency or bearer negotiable instruments brought into or out of Singapore exceed SGD 20,000.
## Tax equalisation or reimbursement plans
Generally, a tax reimbursement program is provided by an employer to alleviate the additional tax costs which may be incurred as a result of an overseas assignment. A tax reimbursement program may be modelled either as a ‘tax protection’ or ‘tax equalisation’ plan.
Under a tax protection plan, the company reimburses the employee for actual taxes paid in excess of the amount the individual would have paid in their home country if they had not been posted overseas. If the actual tax liabilities are less than the hypothetical home country tax, the employee is allowed to keep the difference.
In contrast, a tax equalisation plan ensures that the employee’s tax burden remains the same as if they had remained in the home country. If the individual’s actual taxes are greater than they would have incurred in the home country, the employer reimburses the excess, and if the actual taxes are less, the employer retains the excess.
Both plans require calculation of the hypothetical home country tax, which is generally determined on the base salary and other remuneration as if the employee had remained in the home country.
The amount that is reimbursed by the employer is a taxable benefit to the employee generally in the year in which the reimbursement is made. However, where the hypothetical tax amount deducted from payroll is treated as final (not to be reconciled on actual tax liability after year end), and/or the employee’s home country tax if any is not borne by the employer, the Singapore tax liability borne by the employer may need to be grossed-up in the same year.
## **Exchange of information (EOI)**
Generally, Singapore’s tax treaties and EOI arrangements include provisions for the exchange of information for tax purposes. Treaty partners may make a request to the Comptroller of Income Tax for information, or the exchange may take the form of spontaneous EOI or automatic EOI.
### Spontaneous EOI
Singapore has committed to spontaneously exchange certain rulings under the agreed framework for the compulsory spontaneous EOI set out in the BEPS Action 5 Report ‘Countering Harmful Tax Practices More Effectively, taking into Account Transparency and Substance’.
### International Tax Compliance Agreements
Singapore has also concluded the following international tax compliance agreements and will exchange information pursuant to those agreements as follows:
#### Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
Singapore has a Model 1 FATCA intergovernmental agreement (IGA) with the United States in place to help ease the compliance burden of Singapore-based financial institutions (SGFIs). All Reporting SGFIs must submit a FATCA Return to the IRAS, setting out the required information in relation to every US Reportable Account.
#### Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
SGFIs are required to establish the tax residency of all their account holders. Further, they will need to report to the IRAS the requisite information for each Reportable Account relating to tax residents of jurisdictions with which Singapore has a Competent Authority Agreement to exchange information. 
Singapore has also expressed its commitment to commencing automatic exchanges in crypto-assets reporting under the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework in 2027.

# Singapore
## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 06 May 2024
## Employment income
If the employment is exercised in Singapore, employment income is treated as earned in Singapore and is therefore taxable in Singapore. It generally does not matter where the employer is situated, where the remuneration is paid or which entities benefit from the services in determining the country of source of employment income.
Employment income includes salaries, bonuses, allowances, perquisites, and benefits in kind. All gains and profits derived by an employee due to employment is taxable unless exempted or given an administrative concession. Certain benefits in kind are accorded preferential rates, which are less than the actual cost to the employer.
The taxable value of housing accommodation provided to employees is the actual rent paid by the employer. In limited circumstances where there is no rent paid by the employer (e.g. employer-owned property), the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) may apply the annual (rental) value (AV) of the property, less the rent paid by the employee or other value deemed reasonable by the IRAS. The taxable benefit of furniture and fittings provided will be computed as a fixed percentage (40% or 50%, depending on whether the property is partially or fully furnished) of the AV of the property. If hotel accommodation is provided, the taxable benefit will be the amount paid by the employer, less any amount paid by the employee.
Home leave passage provided is fully assessable on the expatriate.
Where the employee is provided with a car benefit by the employer, the taxable benefit is calculated based on the prescribed formula which varies depending on whether the car provided is company-owned or leased, and whether actual running and maintenance costs are reimbursed by the employer. The taxability of other car-related items depends on the nature of the benefit.
The amount of tax borne by the employer is treated as additional income of the employee.
There are also concessions for certain benefits in kind (e.g. medical benefits [basic and non-basic], group medical, free/subsidised food and transport, transport and meal allowances/reimbursements, _per diems_), subject to certain conditions.
For group insurance policies (e.g. group term life insurance, group personal accident insurance) where employees are contractually entitled to the payout, the premiums paid by the employer will be taxable to the employee unless the employer elects not to claim a tax deduction for the premiums, in which case the premiums will be exempt to its employees. This concession does not apply to investment holding companies, tax exempt bodies, and service companies assessed on the 'cost-plus mark-up' basis.
Contributions made by an employer to a pension plan constituted outside Singapore on employment exercised in Singapore are taxable at the time the contributions are made. As a concession, mandatory contributions made to a pension/social security scheme operated by a foreign government may not be taxable, subject to certain conditions. This concession does not apply to investment holding companies, tax exempt bodies, and service companies assessed on the 'cost-plus mark-up' basis. In addition, this concession will be withdrawn with effect from year of assessment 2025, and employers’ contributions made on or after 1 January 2024 will be taxable on the employees.
Short-term visiting employees are not subject to tax on income from an employment exercised in Singapore if the employment does not exceed 60 days in a calendar year. This exemption, however, does not apply to a public entertainer or to a company director.
Area representatives of non-resident companies who reside in and use Singapore as a base for activities extending to other countries are assessed on the remuneration relating to the time actually spent in Singapore.
All retirement benefits other than CPF benefits, including gratuities and pensions, are generally taxable. Partial exemption may be possible in specified cases. The CPF scheme is only available to Singapore citizens and permanent residents and provides a lump sum at the normal retirement age, consisting of past contributions made at prescribed rates by the employee and the employer, as well as interest and other investment returns thereon. However, CPF contributions made under certain circumstances are deemed to be part of employment income, which is taxable.
Another retirement scheme is the SRS. Withdrawals from this scheme however may be fully taxable or 50% taxable, depending on whether certain specified conditions have been fulfilled. Penalties are levied for early withdrawals.
## Equity compensation
Gains derived from the exercise/vesting of stock options/awards granted during Singapore employment are taxable at exercise/vest unless a sale restriction is imposed. Non-Singapore citizens who cease employment in Singapore or leave Singapore for a period exceeding three months or on overseas posting will have to pay tax on any unexercised/unvested stock option/award on a deemed basis unless the tracking option is approved by the Singapore tax authorities for that individual. A refund may be claimed if the actual gain is less than the deemed gain that has been assessed. The claim must be filed within a prescribed period.
## Business income
Business income is income derived from carrying on a trade, business, profession, or vocation. It is taxable in the hands of the sole-proprietor or self-employed person. Identified intermediaries are required to submit income information of certain self-employed persons to the IRAS.
Deductions are allowed for all outgoings and expenses incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of the income being assessed (except expenses that are specifically prohibited under the Income Tax Act), including capital allowances (fiscal depreciation) on most fixed assets except for buildings and leasehold improvements. Qualifying self-employed persons may claim a deemed amount of business expenses based on a prescribed percentage of the gross income earned (known as the Fixed Expense Deduction Ratio) instead of the actual expenses incurred.
## Dividend income
Dividends received from a Singapore-resident company are exempt from tax in the hands of its shareholders.
All foreign-sourced income received by individuals is exempt from tax unless received by a resident individual through a partnership in Singapore.
## Interest income
Generally, interest income derived from Singapore-approved banks or licensed finance companies is not taxable.
All foreign-sourced income received by individuals is exempt from tax unless received by a resident individual through a partnership in Singapore.
## Rental income
Rental income derived from Singapore is taxable whether or not the individual is resident in Singapore. Individuals deriving passive rental income can opt to deduct 15% of gross rental income in lieu of the actual amount of deductible expenses incurred (excluding interest expenses, which can continue to be claimed based on the actual amounts incurred).
## Exempt income
  * Retrenchment benefits: Retrenchment benefits given by employers to compensate employees for the loss of employment and payments for restrictive covenants are not taxable as they are capital in nature.
  * Foreign-sourced income: Generally, foreign-sourced income received in Singapore is not taxable unless received by a resident individual through a partnership in Singapore.
  * Annuities: An annuity is a continuous yearly payment arising from an annuity policy bought from an insurance company, a gift or inheritance, or the sale of an asset or surrender of a right. Annuities received in Singapore are not taxable unless they are received from a partnership, SRS, or annuity policy bought by an employer in place of a pension or other employment benefits.
  * Alimony/maintenance payments: Income from alimony and maintenance payments is exempt.
  * Windfalls: Winnings from betting and other games of chance are not taxable as they are windfalls and not of income nature.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 06 May 2024
Individuals are resident in Singapore if they reside there, except for such temporary absences as may be reasonable and not inconsistent with a claim to be resident in Singapore. Individuals who are physically present or who exercise an employment (other than as a board director of a company) in Singapore for 183 days or more during the calendar year preceding the year of assessment are treated as tax residents for that year of assessment. As a concession, a foreigner who stays or works in Singapore for a consecutive period spanning three calendar years (not necessarily three complete calendar years) is considered a tax resident.
As a further concession, a foreigner who works in Singapore for a continuous period straddling two calendar years and stays in Singapore for at least 183 days will be considered a tax resident for those two years. This does not apply to directors of a company, public entertainers, and professionals.
Foreigners will also be treated as tax resident if they are issued with a work pass that is valid for at least a year, but their tax residency status will be reviewed based on the tax residency rule above at the point of tax clearance.
_See Payment of tax in the section for details on tax clearance for foreigners._

## Social security contributions
### Central Provident Fund (CPF)
The CPF is Singapore's national pension scheme. Contributions are payable by Singapore citizens and Singapore Permanent Residents (i.e. SPR obtained via immigration rules) only. Employers and employees contribute 17% and 20%, respectively, of ordinary monthly wages, up to an income ceiling of SGD 6,800 (from 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2024). Their respective maximum contributions are therefore SGD 1,156 and SGD 1,360 per month. The rates are applicable to Singaporeans and SPRs (from third year and onwards) aged 55 years and below.
These rates also apply to additional wages (e.g. year-end bonus), up to the maximum contributions below:
Total wages | Additional wages subject to CPF contribution (calendar year 2024)  
---|---  
Not more than SGD 102,000 | Annual ordinary wages not more than SGD 81,600* | Actual additional wages  
Annual ordinary wages exceed SGD 81,600* | Actual additional wages  
Exceed SGD 102,000 | Annual ordinary wages not more than SGD 81,600* | SGD 102,000 less annual ordinary wages  
Annual ordinary wages exceed SGD 81,600* | SGD 20,400 (SGD 102,000 - SGD 81,600*)  
* This rate above is based on the annual ordinary wage ceiling for calendar year 2024 (i.e. SGD 6,800 x 12).
Reduced rates apply for employees who are earning less than SGD 750 per month, as well as for those above 55 years of age, although these rates are being gradually increased.
The income ceiling will be increased to SGD 7,400 from 1 January 2025 and SGD 8,000 from 1 January 2026. The annual ordinary wage ceiling and maximum monthly contributions for employers and employees will be increased accordingly; however, the annual salary (comprising ordinary wages and additional wages) ceiling remains at SGD 102,000.
Foreign nationals and their employers are precluded from making CPF contributions. Foreign employees who become Singapore permanent residents, and their employers, may contribute at reduced rates for the first two years.

### Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS)
The SRS is a voluntary scheme to encourage employees and the self-employed to save for retirement over and above their CPF savings. The maximum amount to be contributed is subject to an income cap of SGD 102,000. Employers are allowed to contribute to their employees’ SRS accounts, subject to the contribution limits below. Employees will be taxable on these employer contributions, but will be allowed corresponding tax relief.
The contribution rate caps for contributions made to the SRS scheme are as follows.
Residency status | Rate cap (%) | Contribution cap (SGD)  
---|---|---  
Singapore citizens or permanent residents | 15 | 15,300  
Foreigners | 35 | 35,700  
## Capital gains taxes
There is no capital gains tax in Singapore. Where an individual enters into a series of capital transactions, however, the tax authorities may take the view that the individual is carrying on a business and assess that person to income tax accordingly.
## Goods and services tax (GST)
### Supplies made in Singapore and importation of goods
GST is charged at 9% on the supply of goods and services made in Singapore by a taxable person in the course or furtherance of one's business and on the importation of goods into Singapore.
The only exemptions from GST are prescribed financial services, the sale or rental of residential properties, the sale of digital payment tokens, and the import and local supply of prescribed investment precious metals. Zero-rating only applies to the export of goods and international services (subject to conditions).
_See the section in the Corporate tax summary for more information_.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth or net worth taxes in Singapore.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Estate duty has been abolished for deaths occurring on or after 15 February 2008.
## Property tax
Property tax is levied annually on the value of houses, land, buildings, or tenements.
For residential properties, owner-occupier tax rates range from 0% to 32% and non-owner occupier tax rates range from 12% to 36%. The tax rates depend on the annual value bands, which are subject to periodic revisions.
A one-off property tax rebate at tiered rates of 15% to 100% of property tax payable is provided for owner-occupied residential properties in 2024.
For non-residential properties, such as commercial and industrial buildings and land, the tax rate is 10%.
## Excise taxes
Excise duties are imposed on certain intoxicating liquors, tobacco products, motor vehicles, and petroleum products. Duties are also imposed on gambling and other games of chance.
## Other non-income taxes
### Stamp duties
Stamp duties are levied on written documents (as well as electronic instruments executed on or after 4 October 2018) relating to immovable properties, leases, and stocks and shares.
#### Immovable properties
Stamp duties are typically payable by the buyer (i.e. buyer’s stamp duty or BSD); however, seller's stamp duty (SSD) and additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) have been introduced as measures to cool the residential property market.
There is BSD of up to 6% for residential property and up to 5% for non-residential property on the purchase price or market value, whichever is the higher. There is an ABSD of up to 65% and an SSD of up to 15% on the price or market value of the property, whichever is the higher, depending on the type of property (residential or industrial), the residency status of the buyer, the holding period of the property, and the number of properties owned.
Foreigners of certain nationalities who fall within the scope of the respective free trade agreements will be accorded the same treatment as Singaporeans.
Certain transfers of equity interest in property-holding entities (PHEs) that own (directly or indirectly) primarily Singapore residential properties could attract additional conveyance duties (ACDs) for buyers (up to 71%) and sellers (at 12%) who are significant owners (as defined) of PHEs, as well as for a buyer who would become a significant owner after acquiring an equity interest in the PHEs. For acquisition of equity interest in a company, share duty remains payable in addition to the ACDs.
ABSD and ACDs are also levied on transfers of any residential property and equity interest in PHEs (where the significant ownership threshold is met) into living trusts where there is no identifiable owner of the property or equity interest at the time of transfer. Renunciation of interest in residential properties held in trust in certain scenarios will also attract applicable duties.
#### Leases
Leases attract duty at 0.4% of the total rent (for leases of up to four years) or 0.4% of four times the average annual rent for the period of the lease (for leases longer than four years), but leases with average annual rents not exceeding SGD 1,000 are exempt from stamp duty.
#### Stocks and shares
Instruments effecting the transfer of stocks and shares are subject to stamp duty of 0.2% on the purchase price or market value of the shares transferred, whichever is the higher.
## Local non-income taxes
### Foreign Worker Levy (FWL)
The FWL is a monthly levy that employers are liable to pay for each foreign employee (Work Permit or S Pass holders) hired. The levy rate depends on the employer’s industry and the ratio of foreigners to Singaporeans and permanent residents employed in the company.
### Skills Development Levy (SDL)
Employers are required to contribute a levy for each employee at 0.25% of the monthly total wages. The minimum payable is SGD 2 for an employee earning less than SGD 800 a month and the maximum is SGD 11.25 for an employee earning more than SGD 4,500 per month.
The SDL is channelled to the Skills Development Fund (SDF), which is used to support workforce upgrading programmes and to provide training grants to employees sent for training under the National Continuing Education Training system.
The SDL and SDF are administered by the Skills Future Singapore Agency with the CPF Board as the collecting agent.
