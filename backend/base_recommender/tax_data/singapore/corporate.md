## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 30 May 2024
## Taxable period
The tax basis period is the calendar year; however, the accounting period will generally be adopted.
## Tax returns
Tax is computed for each tax year based on the income earned in the preceding year (the tax basis period). The corporation files an estimate of its income within three months of the end of the accounting period followed by a return of income by 30 November of the tax year, and the tax is assessed by the Comptroller of Income Tax. All companies are required to file their tax returns electronically. There is no fixed date for the issue of assessments.
## Payment of tax
Assessed tax is payable within one month after the service of the notice of assessment, whether or not a notice of objection to the assessment has been lodged with the tax authorities. Application may be made to the Comptroller to pay estimated tax liabilities on a monthly basis. However, the Comptroller is under no obligation to grant such an application.
Late payment of tax will attract penalties, up to a maximum of 17% of the outstanding tax.
## Tax audit process
The IRAS adopts a risk-based approach to identifying compliance risk, with a focus on improving the behaviour of taxpayers who pose a higher risk of non-compliance. It also prioritises and tailors specific compliance programmes that aim to identify taxpayers who have made mistakes in their tax returns, create an audit presence in the community to deter non-compliance by other taxpayers, educate taxpayers on their tax obligations and how to comply with these, and identify areas of tax law, policies, and processes where the tax system can be simplified.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations is four years from the year of assessment, but does not apply where there has been fraud or wilful default by the taxpayer.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The IRAS is focusing its compliance efforts on the following:
  * WHT.
  * The timely filing of corporate tax returns.
  * Claiming of private or non-deductible expenses.
  * The classification of income and expenses for income taxable at concessionary and prevailing corporate tax rates.
  * The recognition of income from construction contracts and provisions claimed by construction companies.
  * Companies that are dormant and exempted from filing corporate income tax returns.
  * Taxability of income/gains from sale of properties.
  * Digital economy.
  * Deductibility of interest expenses and borrowing costs.


The IRAS is currently focusing its GST audit and investigation efforts on businesses involved in Missing Trader Fraud arrangements.


# Singapore
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 30 May 2024
In Singapore, the tax residence of a corporation is determined by the place where the central management and control of its business is exercised. This is taken generally to mean the place where the directors meet to exercise _de facto_ control. The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) has also set out its practice on how it administers the residency rule, including for foreign-owned investment holding companies and where the board of directors meetings involve the use of virtual meeting technology.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The presence of a PE is largely irrelevant, except for treaty purposes, as Singapore taxes with reference to the source of income rather than the presence of a PE.
However, a PE is a clear indication of source.
The definition of a PE in Singapore’s double taxation agreements (DTAs) is largely based on the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Model Tax Convention definition.
It is generally taken to be a fixed place through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on, and normally includes a place of management, a branch, an office, a factory, a workshop, and a place of extraction of natural resources, etc.
In addition, and subject to the terms of the relevant agreements, a non-resident may have a PE in Singapore if one:
  * has a building site or a construction, assembly, or installation project that lasts longer than a specified period, or supervisory activities connected with the building site or construction project
  * furnishes services (including consultancy services) through employees or other personnel in Singapore for more than a specified period, or
  * has an agent in Singapore who has, and habitually exercises, a general authority to negotiate and conclude contracts on behalf of the enterprise.


The Singapore tax legislation defines a PE more broadly than most of the DTAs; however, as mentioned above, this is largely irrelevant where a treaty can take precedence.


# Singapore
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 30 May 2024
## Depreciation
Tax depreciation is allowable at specified rates on buildings used in qualifying industry sectors, subject to conditions. In 2010, industrial building allowances were replaced by a Land Intensification Allowance. The latter provides for faster depreciation but is subject to approval as it is allowed as a tax incentive. Transitional provisions for industrial building allowances are available for taxpayers that committed to qualifying capital expenditure on or before 22 February 2010.
Tax depreciation is available on machinery and equipment on a straight-line basis over their specified working life for all types of business. In lieu of the straight-line basis, accelerated tax depreciation allowances can be claimed by all businesses on all machinery and equipment in equal instalments over three years. For the year of assessment 2024, depreciation allowance claims may be made over two years, with 75% of the cost written off in the first year of assessment, and the remaining 25% in the following year. 
A 100% depreciation allowance is available on capital expenditure incurred on computers, robots, standby generators, and prescribed automation equipment.
Writing down allowances on a straight-line basis over five years are allowable on the cost of acquisition of intellectual property (IP), subject to certain conditions. Taxpayers may make an irrevocable election to claim the writing down allowances over 10 or 15 years instead of five.
Gains on tax depreciable property (i.e. the excess of proceeds over tax base) are taxed as income to the extent that tax depreciation has been allowed; that is, there is a clawback of tax depreciation on the disposal of the asset.
## Goodwill
Payments for the acquisition of goodwill are generally capital in nature and not deductible.
## Start-up expenses
Generally, expenses incurred prior to the commencement of business are not tax deductible. However, most businesses are allowed to deduct expenses incurred in the 12 months immediately preceding the accounting year in which the business earned its first dollar of trading income. Deductible expenses are those that would have been allowed a deduction had they been incurred after the business commenced operations.
In addition, deductions and writing down allowances are available for certain types of pre-commencement expenditure (acquisition of plant and machinery, research and development [R&D], etc.) that are deemed to be incurred on the first day on which the taxpayer carries on business.
## Interest expenses
Interest incurred on capital employed in the production of income, and prescribed borrowing costs that are incurred as a substitute for interest or to reduce interest costs, will be allowed as a tax deduction.
## Research and development (R&D) expenses
For the years of assessment 2019 to 2028, enhanced tax deduction of 250% of qualifying expenditure is available for R&D carried out in Singapore, subject to conditions. Where the R&D is carried out overseas, a deduction of 100% of qualifying expenditure is allowed.
For the years of assessment 2024 to 2028, enhanced tax deduction of 400% for the first SGD 400,000 of qualifying R&D expenditure is available. _See Enterprise Innovation Scheme_ _in the_ _section for details_.
Expenditure incurred in relation to R&D cost-sharing arrangements are accorded the same tax treatment as R&D expenses.
## Intellectual property (IP) acquisition expenses
For the years of assessment 2019 to 2028, enhanced tax deduction of 200% is available for each of the following:
  * the first SGD 100,000 of qualifying expenditure incurred to register qualifying IP, and
  * the first SGD 100,000 of expenditure incurred to license qualifying IP.


For the years of assessment 2024 to 2028, enhanced tax deduction is available at 400% for the first SGD 400,000 of qualifying IP registration expenditure. For businesses that generate less than SGD 500 million in revenue for the relevant year, enhanced tax deduction is available at 400% for the first SGD 400,000 of qualifying expenditure incurred to license or acquire IP. _See_ _Enterprise Innovation Scheme_ _in the_ _section for details_.
## Bad debts
Bad trade debts and provisions for trade debts are deductible to the extent that they are incurred in the business and previously included as trading receipts. Doubtful debts are deductible if they are properly estimated and specific. General provisions for bad debts are not deductible.
Businesses that have elected to align their tax treatment of financial instruments with the accounting treatment prescribed by SFRS 109 (Financial Instruments) will be allowed a tax deduction for impairment losses on trade debts when recognised in the profit and loss account, to the extent that the debts are credit impaired. Correspondingly, any reversal of the credit impaired losses will be taxed.
## Charitable contributions
Donations are deductible only if they are made in cash or another prescribed form and to an approved recipient for the benefit of the local community. The deduction allowed for qualifying donations is generally 250% of the value of the donation. Businesses that send employees to volunteer and provide services to approved charitable institutions from 1 July 2016 to 31 December 2026 will be allowed to deduct 250% of the wages and incidental expenses incurred, subject to certain caps and conditions.
Qualifying donors with family offices operating in Singapore can claim a tax deduction (capped at 40% of the donor’s statutory income) for overseas donations made through qualifying local intermediaries. In addition, donors can claim a deduction (also capped at 40% of the donor’s statutory income) for qualifying cash donations towards overseas emergency humanitarian assistance causes made through designated charities from 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2028. Where both schemes apply, the total deduction will be jointly capped at 40% of the donor’s statutory income.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties imposed for violations of the law are not deductible.
## Taxes
Income taxes are generally not deductible in determining corporate income. However, irrecoverable GST is deductible under certain circumstances. The FWL and property taxes are deductible to the extent they are incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of income.
## Other significant items
Private automobile expenses are not deductible.
The tax deduction for medical expenses is limited to 2% of total payroll if the employer implements certain portable medical insurance or benefit schemes. Otherwise, the amount deductible will be limited to 1% of total payroll. Where the company is exempt or taxed at a reduced rate, the excess expenses will be taxed at the prevailing corporate rate.
A tax deduction for employee share-based remuneration (stock awards or stock option schemes) is allowed only if treasury shares in the company or its holding company are purchased to fulfil such obligations. A company may also claim a tax deduction when the share-based remuneration scheme is administered by a special purpose vehicle (SPV). The deduction is restricted generally to the lowest of the actual outlay incurred by the company, its holding company, or the SPV.
## Net operating losses
Loss carryover, including unutilised tax depreciation allowance, is unlimited, provided shareholdings in the loss-making corporation have not changed beyond 50% of the total number of issued shares. Additionally, for tax depreciation allowances to be carried forward, the same trade needs to be continued. The tax authorities may exercise discretion to allow carryover of tax losses and unutilised tax depreciation even when there has been a change in shareholding beyond 50%, absent any tax avoidance motives. Tax losses retained pursuant to the exercise of such discretion may only be deducted against income from the same trade or business in respect of which the losses arose.
Losses and tax depreciation of up to SGD 100,000 incurred by the company in the current year can be carried back for one year. The carryback of losses and tax depreciation is subject to the continuity of shareholding test, and additionally the same trade test applies for the carryback of tax depreciation.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments to non-residents, including foreign affiliates, are deductible, provided they are fair and reasonable, are revenue in nature, and can be seen to be relevant to earning the payer’s income.


# Singapore
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 30 May 2024
A company is allowed to transfer excess current year trade losses, current year tax depreciation, and current year approved donations (other than donations for overseas causes) to another company within the same group if certain conditions are satisfied.
Broadly, to qualify for group relief, companies must be incorporated in Singapore, belong to the same group of companies where, among other things, there must be at least a 75% ownership relationship between claimant and transferor, and have the same accounting year-end. In addition, a group must comply with certain prescribed offset and apportionment rules.
## Transfer pricing
The Income Tax Act contains specific provisions that provide the tax authorities with a right to make transfer pricing adjustments in cases where taxpayers do not comply with the arm’s-length principle.
The transfer pricing provisions include mandatory contemporaneous documentation requirements, penalties for non-compliance, and a surcharge to be imposed at 5% of the transfer pricing adjustment value. In general, businesses with turnover exceeding SGD 10 million are required to maintain contemporaneous transfer pricing documentation, subject to certain exemptions as defined. Failure to comply with these requirements (including contemporaneous transfer pricing documentation) could result in penalties being imposed. The tax authorities are also given the power to disregard the form of a transaction where the substance of it is inconsistent with the form.
The tax authorities have issued revised transfer pricing guidelines to supplement the provisions in the Income Tax Act. Guidance is also provided on matters relating to mutual agreement procedures (MAPs) and advance pricing arrangements (APAs).
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
Singapore has signed the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on the exchange of CbC Reports, and Singapore-headquartered multinational enterprises with global revenues exceeding SGD 1,125 million have to submit to the IRAS an annual CbC report containing the income, taxes paid, and other indicators of level of economic activities in every tax jurisdiction where they operate. The IRAS will exchange CbC reports with jurisdictions with which Singapore has entered into bilateral agreements for the exchange of CbC reports.
## Thin capitalisation
There are no formal thin capitalisation rules in Singapore. However, general anti-avoidance and transfer pricing provisions may operate to deny or restrict deductions taken.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no CFC rules in Singapore.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 30 May 2024
Tax rates on branch profits are the same as on corporate profits. There is no branch profits remittance tax on the repatriation of profits to the head office.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 30 May 2024
There are various tax incentives available to taxpayers involved in specified activities or industries identified as being beneficial to Singapore’s economic development.
Tax incentive applications are typically subject to an approval process during which the administering agency evaluates the applicant’s business plans in detail. Successful applicants are required to satisfy rigorous requirements and are expected to make significant economic commitments in Singapore.
Generally, applicants are expected to carry out substantive, high value activities in Singapore, and will be required to commit to certain levels of local business spending and skilled employment. Some factors that will be considered include the use of Singapore as a base from which to implement regional expansion strategies; introduction and anchoring of leading-edge skills, technology, and activities in Singapore; contributions to the growth of R&D and innovation capabilities; and potential spin-off to the rest of the economy.
## Pioneer tax incentive
Corporations manufacturing approved products with high technological content or providing qualifying services may apply for tax exemption for five to 15 years for each qualifying project or activity under the pioneer tax incentive. Corporations may apply for their post-pioneer profits to be taxed at a reduced rate under the Development and Expansion Incentive, _as discussed below_.
## Development and Expansion Incentive
Under the Development and Expansion Incentive, corporations engaging in new high-value-added projects, expanding or upgrading their operations, or undertaking incremental activities after their pioneer period may apply for their profits to be taxed at a reduced rate of not less than 5% for an initial period of up to ten years. The total tax relief period for each qualifying project or activity is subject to a maximum of 40 years.
## Investment allowance
Under the investment allowance, a tax exemption is granted on an amount of profits based on a specified percentage (of up to 100%) of the capital expenditure incurred for qualifying projects or activities within a period of up to five years (up to eight years for assets acquired on hire-purchase). Investment allowances of 100% of capital expenditure (net of grants) may be granted to businesses seeking to make substantial investment in automation, subject to a cap of SGD 10 million per project.
## Refundable investment credit
Companies making sizeable investments that bring high-value and substantive economic activities to Singapore in key economic sectors and new growth areas may apply for up to 50% investment credit on qualifying expenditure incurred during a qualifying period of up to ten years. The investment credit is to be offset against the company’s income tax payable, and any unutilised credits will be refunded to the company in cash within four years from when the company meets the conditions for receiving the credits. The scheme is intended to be consistent with the Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) Rules for Qualified Refundable Tax Credits.
## Incentives for internationalisation
The double tax deduction scheme for internationalisation allows companies expanding overseas to claim a double deduction for eligible expenses for specified market expansion and investment development activities. This includes qualifying manpower expenses incurred from 1 July 2015 to 31 December 2025 when Singaporeans or permanent residents of Singapore are deployed to overseas entities.
## Enterprise Innovation Scheme (EIS)
For the years of assessment 2024 to 2028, businesses that engage in the following qualifying activities will be allowed a 400% tax deduction or allowances for qualifying expenditure:
  * R&D projects conducted in Singapore (capped at SGD 400,000 of qualifying expenditure).
  * IP registration (capped at SGD 400,000 of qualifying expenditure).
  * Acquisition or licensing of IP rights (capped at SGD 400,000 of qualifying expenditure and available only to businesses that generated less than SGD 500 million in revenue in the relevant year of assessment).
  * Employee training (capped at SGD 400,000 of qualifying expenditure).
  * Innovation projects carried out with Polytechnics, the Institute of Technical Education, or other qualified partners (capped at SGD 50,000 of qualifying expenditure).


Qualifying businesses may opt to convert the above tax deductions to a cash payout. They would receive, in lieu of the deduction, a non-taxable cash payout of 20% of total qualifying expenditure of up to SGD 100,000 across all qualifying activities (i.e. maximum cash payout of SGD 20,000 per year).
## Intellectual Property Development Incentive (IDI)
The IDI scheme was introduced to encourage the use and commercialisation of IP arising from R&D activities of the taxpayer. An approved IDI company will be eligible for a reduced tax rate of either 5%, 10%, or 15% on a percentage of qualifying income derived from the commercialisation of certain IP. The percentage is determined by the modified nexus approach set out in the Action 5 report of the OECD base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project. The concessionary tax rate will increase at regular intervals as prescribed in the Income Tax Act.
## Mergers and acquisitions allowance
The mergers and acquisitions allowance allows a write-off of 25% of the value of qualifying mergers or acquisitions deals executed between 1 April 2015 and 31 December 2025. The amount of allowance, to be claimed over five years, is subject to a cap of SGD 5 million (for deals executed between 1 April 2015 and 31 March 2016) or SGD 10 million (for deals executed between 1 April 2016 and 31 December 2025) for all qualifying acquisitions made in the basis period for each year of assessment. This incentive is available to companies that are incorporated, tax resident, and carrying on a business in Singapore. A 200% tax allowance is also granted on transaction costs (capped at SGD 100,000 per year of assessment) incurred on qualifying deals.
## Financial services incentives
### Financial Sector Incentive (FSI) scheme
The FSI scheme covers a broad range of financial institutions, including bond intermediaries, derivative traders, fund managers, equity capital market intermediaries, operational headquarters, providers of high-value-added processing services supporting financial activities, providers of trustee and custodian services, and trust management or administration services. Financial institutions that plan to expand their Singapore operations and are prepared to meet various strict qualifying conditions may apply for this incentive.
Under the FSI scheme, income from certain high growth, high-value-added activities, such as services and transactions relating to the bond market, derivatives market, equity market, and credit facilities syndication, may be taxed at 5%, while a broader range of financial activities will qualify for a 13.5% tax rate.
The concessionary tax rates available under the FSI scheme will be revised to either 10% or 13.5% for new awards and renewals of existing awards approved on or after 1 January 2024.
### Finance and treasury centre (FTC)
Income derived by an FTC from approved FTC activities is taxed at a reduced rate of 8% or 10%. Approved activities include international treasury and fund management activities, corporate finance and advisory services, economic and investment research and analysis, and credit control and administration.
Interest payments to overseas banks and approved network companies are also exempt from WHT where the funds borrowed are used for approved activities.
### Debt securities incentives
A package of tax concessions is available to various players in the Singapore bond market, including those involved in certain Islamic financing arrangements.
### Insurance Business Development (IBD) scheme
The IBD scheme is an umbrella incentive for the insurance sector. Incentives offered under this scheme include a 10% concessionary tax rate for qualifying income of life, general, and composite insurers from carrying on insurance businesses from Singapore, and income derived from the provision of insurance broking and advisory services. This includes income from marine hull and liability insurance and captive insurance businesses.
### Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)
Distributions made to foreign non-individual investors by a listed REIT out of rental income from Singapore real estate are subject to a reduced tax rate of 10%, subject to certain conditions being met. Listed REITs investing in foreign properties can apply for tax exemption for certain foreign income received in Singapore. Distributions out of this income similarly are exempt.
Tax transparency treatment may be accorded for specified income of Singapore-listed REIT Exchange-Traded Funds (REIT-ETFs) so that there will be parity in tax treatment between investing in individual S-REITs and via REIT-ETFs with investments in S-REITs.
As a concession, Singapore-listed REITs are allowed to claim GST on expenses incurred for their business and for their special purpose vehicles, regardless of whether the REIT is eligible for GST registration, subject to a specified formula and certain conditions.
### Islamic financing arrangements
The income tax, stamp duty, and GST treatment of prescribed Islamic financing arrangements and Islamic debt securities (_Sukuk_) are aligned with that of the conventional financing contracts to which they are economically equivalent, subject to certain conditions.
### Infrastructure project finance incentives
Tax exemption is available for income earned from qualifying investments in qualifying infrastructure projects/assets. Income from qualifying project debt securities is also exempt. FSI companies that provide project finance advisory services related to qualifying projects/assets may enjoy certain tax concessions for their qualifying income.
### Sovereign wealth funds
Tax exemption is available for income derived by a sovereign fund entity and an approved foreign government-owned entity from funds managed in Singapore.
### Singapore Variable Capital Companies (VCC)
A VCC is treated as a company and a single entity for tax purposes. The tax exemptions for income from funds managed in Singapore and the existing GST remission for funds are extended to qualifying VCC. A 10% concessionary tax rate under FSI incentive for fund managers has been extended to approved fund managers managing an incentivised VCC. 
## Headquarters schemes
Depending on their level of economic commitments to Singapore, international headquarters can apply for various tax incentives, including concessionary tax rates on qualifying income.
## Maritime Sector Incentive (MSI) scheme
The MSI scheme is the umbrella incentive for the maritime sector. Incentives offered include tax exemption for shipping companies and a 10% concessionary tax rate for international freight and logistics operators. Approved ship investment managers are also taxed at 10% on qualifying management-related income. The scheme also includes approved ship investment vehicles, which are tax exempt on their qualifying vessel lease income; approved container investment enterprises, which are taxed at 5% or 10% on qualifying income from container-leasing; and approved container investment management companies, which are taxed at 10% on qualifying management fees. From income year 2023 (year of assessment 2024), qualifying shipping entities may opt to apply an alternative net tonnage basis of tax.
Qualifying ship operators and lessors under the MSI scheme also enjoy automatic tax exemption on gains from the disposal of vessels, vessels under construction, and new building contracts.
## Global Trader Programme (GTP)
International traders are taxed at concessionary rates of 5%, 10%, or 15% on qualifying income from physical trading, brokering of physical trades, and derivative trading income.
## Other incentives
Other incentives include tax exemptions for not-for-profit organisations and a concessionary tax rate of 8% or 10% for approved aircraft lessors.
## Foreign tax credit
_See Foreign income in the section for a description of the foreign tax credit regime_.


# Singapore
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 30 May 2024
Certain payments to non-residents are subject to WHT.
Unless a lower treaty rate applies, interest on loans and rentals from movable property are subject to WHT at the rate of 15%. Royalty payments are subject to WHT at the rate of 10%. The tax withheld represents a final tax and applies only to non-residents that are not carrying on any business in Singapore and have no PE in Singapore. Technical assistance and management fees for services rendered in Singapore by non-resident companies are taxed at the prevailing corporate rate. However, this is not a final tax. Royalties, interest, rental of movable property, technical assistance, and management fees can be exempt from WHT in certain situations or subject to a reduction in tax rates, usually under fiscal incentives or DTAs.
Payments made to public entertainers and non-resident professionals who perform services in Singapore are also subject to a final tax of 15% on their gross income. For public entertainers, this appears to be a final tax unless they qualify to be taxed as Singapore tax residents. However, non-resident professionals may elect to be taxed at the prevailing tax rate for non-resident individuals of 24% on net income if this results in a lower tax cost. 
Ship charter fee payments are not subject to WHT.
The WHT rates are shown in the following table.

## Exchange of information (EOI)
Generally, Singapore’s tax treaties and EOI arrangements include provisions for the exchange of information for tax purposes. Treaty partners may make a request to the Comptroller of Income Tax for information, or the exchange may take the form of spontaneous EOI or automatic EOI.
### Spontaneous EOI
Singapore has committed to spontaneously exchange certain rulings under the agreed framework for the compulsory spontaneous EOI set out in the BEPS Action 5 Report ‘Countering Harmful Tax Practices More Effectively, taking into Account Transparency and Substance’.
### International Tax Compliance Agreements
Singapore has also concluded the following international tax compliance agreements and will exchange information pursuant to those agreements as follows:
#### Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
Singapore has a Model 1 FATCA intergovernmental agreement (IGA) with the United States in place to help ease the compliance burden of Singapore-based financial institutions (SGFIs). All Reporting SGFIs must submit a FATCA Return to the IRAS, setting out the required information in relation to every US Reportable Account.
#### Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
SGFIs are required to establish the tax residency of all their account holders. Further, they will need to report to the IRAS the requisite information for each Reportable Account relating to tax residents of jurisdictions with which Singapore has a Competent Authority Agreement to exchange information. 
Singapore has also expressed its commitment to commencing automatic exchanges in crypto-assets reporting under the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework in 2027.
## Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
Companies incorporated in Singapore and Singapore branches of foreign companies are required by the Companies Act 1967 to prepare and present financial statements that comply with the Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (SFRS). In Singapore, the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) has the statutory authority to issue SFRS for adoption.
The broad policy intention is to adopt the IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB); however, the local economic and business circumstances and context, as well as the entity to which the IFRS would apply, is taken into consideration when evaluating the introduction of new IFRS for adoption in Singapore. The SFRS is principally based on and substantially similar to IFRS that are issued by the IASB. Singapore-incorporated companies that have issued, or are in the process of issuing, equity or debt instruments for trading in a public market in Singapore are required to apply Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS(I)s), Singapore's equivalent of the IFRS. Non-listed companies may voluntarily apply this framework.
Companies are required to submit financial statements as part of their tax return filing. The IRAS generally accepts financial statements prepared for statutory filing, although companies that have been allowed to prepare their financial statements using standards other than SFRS, such as IFRS or the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) adopted by the United States, may be required to explain and/or account for any differences and make the necessary tax adjustments, if any.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 30 May 2024
## Inventory valuation
There are no special rules as to which valuation basis should be adopted for inventories (stock-in-trade) in the case of a continuing business, as long as the basis is consistent from one year to another. However, a last in first out (LIFO) basis of valuation is not permitted for tax purposes. Generally, tax reporting conforms to book reporting.
Inventory that is appropriated on or after 16 November 2021 for a purpose other than for sale or disposal in the ordinary course of the trade or business is treated as having been sold at open market value (except for approved donations).
## Capital gains
There is no tax on capital gains. Where there is a series of transactions or where the holding period of an asset is relatively short, the tax authorities may take the view that a business is being carried on and attempt to assess the gains as trading profits of the corporation. The United Kingdom (UK) Badges of Trade, which are used in judicial decisions to distinguish capital and revenue transactions, are generally applied in determining this issue. They include the existence of a profit-seeking motive, the number of transactions, the nature of the asset, the existence of similar trading transactions or interests, the way the sale was carried out, the source of finance, the interval of time between purchase and sale, and the method of acquisition.
Gains derived by a company from the disposal of ordinary shares that take place between 1 June 2012 and 31 December 2027 will not be taxed if the company has held at least 20% of the ordinary shares in the investee company for a continuous period of at least 24 months prior to the disposal. This protection does not apply to gains derived by an insurance company or disposal of shares in certain companies that trade or hold immovable properties, as well as disposal on or after 1 June 2022 of unlisted shares in companies in the business of trading, holding, or developing immovable properties in Singapore or abroad.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, gains from the disposal of foreign assets on or after 1 January 2024 by any legal person (other than an individual), general partnership, limited partnership, or trust that does not meet the requisite economic substance requirements and is a member of a relevant group (i.e. its assets, liabilities, income, expenses, and cash flows are included in consolidated financial statements prepared by the parent entity of the group) are taxable when received in Singapore. _For further details on foreign-sourced income and the availability of foreign tax credit, refer to Foreign income below._
## Dividend income
Singapore dividends are exempt in the hands of the recipient.
## Interest income
Singapore-sourced interest income is taxable when it arises, and foreign-sourced interest is taxable when it is received in Singapore. _For further details on foreign-sourced interest income and the availability of foreign tax credit, refer to Foreign income below_.
## Royalty income
Singapore-sourced royalty income is taxable when it arises, and foreign-sourced royalty income is taxable when it is received in Singapore. _For further details on foreign-sourced royalty income and the availability of foreign tax credit, refer to Foreign income below_.
## Foreign income
A corporation, whether resident in Singapore or not, is taxed on foreign income when it is received in Singapore. Legislative provisions govern the basis of treating foreign income as received in Singapore. There are no special rules for taxing the undistributed income of foreign subsidiaries.
Where income is earned from treaty countries, double taxation is avoided by means of foreign tax credit granted under those treaties. For non-treaty countries, unilateral tax credit is given in respect of foreign tax on all foreign-sourced income. These foreign tax credits may be pooled, subject to certain conditions.
Foreign dividends, foreign branch profits, and foreign service fee income received in Singapore may be exempt from tax if they fulfil certain conditions.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 30 May 2024
Companies (resident and non-resident) that carry on a business in Singapore are taxed on their Singapore-sourced income when it arises and on foreign-sourced income when it is received in Singapore. Non-residents are subject to withholding tax (WHT) on certain types of income (e.g. interest, royalties, technical service fees, rental of movable property) where these are deemed to arise in Singapore (_for details, see the section_).
Tax on corporate income is imposed at a flat rate of 17%.
A partial tax exemption and a three-year start-up tax exemption for qualifying start-up companies are available.
Partial tax exemption (income taxable at normal rate):
Chargeable income (SGD) | Exempt from tax | Exempt income (SGD)  
---|---|---  
First 10,000 | 75% | 7,500  
Next 190,000 | 50% | 95,000  
Total | 102,500  
Start-up tax exemption (income taxable at normal rate):
Chargeable income (SGD) | Exempt from tax | Exempt income (SGD)  
---|---|---  
First 100,000 | 75% | 75,000  
Next 100,000 | 50% | 50,000  
Total | 125,000  
The start-up exemption is not available to property development and investment holding companies.
For income year 2023 (year of assessment 2024), eligible companies will receive a non-taxable CIT rebate cash grant of SGD 2,000. In addition, all companies will be granted a 50% CIT rebate, capped at SGD 40,000 if the company does not qualify for the CIT rebate cash grant or SGD 38,000 if it does.
Singapore adopts a one-tier taxation system, under which all dividends paid by Singapore-resident companies are tax-exempt in the shareholder’s hands.

## Goods and services tax (GST)
### Supplies made in Singapore and importation of goods
GST is charged at 9% on the supply of goods and services made in Singapore by a taxable person in the course or furtherance of one's business and on the importation of goods into Singapore.
The only exemptions from GST are prescribed financial services, the sale or rental of residential properties, the sale of digital payment tokens, and the import and local supply of prescribed investment precious metals. Zero-rating only applies to the export of goods and international services (subject to conditions).
Import reliefs (e.g. Major Exporter Scheme, Approved Contract Manufacturer and Trader Scheme) are available to ease the cash-flow burden of GST-registered businesses.
GST registration is required if a business makes taxable supplies in excess of SGD 1 million for a 12-month period. Voluntary registration is permitted if the taxable supplies are below the registration threshold, subject to conditions. A business may claim input tax credits on its purchases and expenses after its GST registration, subject to satisfying the prescribed input tax conditions.
### Overseas Vendor Registration regime
The Overseas Vendor Registration regime brings to tax business-to-consumer (B2C) supplies of remote services (i.e. digital services and non-digital services) and imported low-value goods. There are specific definitions for remote services and imported low-value goods.
Under the Overseas Vendor Registration regime, suppliers belonging outside Singapore are required to register, charge, and account for GST on supplies of remote services and imported low-value goods supplied to non-GST registered customers in Singapore. Under certain conditions, local and overseas operators of electronic marketplaces may also be regarded as the supplier of the supplies made by the overseas suppliers through these marketplaces.
Overseas suppliers that supply imported low-value goods and remote services to Singapore non-GST-registered customers in excess of SGD 100,000 in a 12-month period and have a global annual turnover of at least SGD 1 million are required to register for GST in Singapore.
### Reverse charge
Reverse charge applies to local businesses that are subject to input tax restriction due to the making of certain exempt supplies or carrying on of non-business activities. If these businesses are registered for GST, they are required to self-account for GST on their purchases of in-scope imported services procured from overseas service providers and on their purchases of imported low-value goods. These businesses may, in turn, claim the GST accounted for as their input tax, subject to the normal rules for input tax recovery.
If these businesses are not registered for GST, they would be liable for GST registration under the reverse charge rules if their purchase of in-scope services and imported low-value goods exceeds SGD 1 million in a 12-month period.
## Customs and excise duties
Singapore is essentially a free port with minimal import restrictions. Customs and excise duties are imposed on certain intoxicating liquors, tobacco products, motor vehicles, and petroleum products.
## Property tax
Property tax is levied annually on the annual value of houses, land, buildings, or tenements.
For residential properties, owner-occupier tax rates range from 0% to 32% and non-owner occupier tax rates range from 12% to 36%. The tax rates depend on the annual value bands, which are subject to periodic revisions. 
A one-off property tax rebate at tiered rates of 15% (capped at SGD 1,000 for private properties) to 100%, depending on the type of property, is provided for owner-occupied residential properties in 2024.
For non-residential properties, such as commercial and industrial buildings and land, the tax rate is 10%.
## Stamp duties
Stamp duties are levied on written documents (as well as electronic instruments executed on or after 4 October 2018) relating to immovable properties, leases, and stocks and shares.
### Immovable properties
Stamp duties are typically payable by the buyer (i.e. buyer’s stamp duty or BSD); however, seller's stamp duty (SSD) and additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) have been introduced as measures to cool the residential property market.
There is BSD of up to 6% for residential property and up to 5% for non-residential property on the purchase price or market value, whichever is the higher. There is an ABSD of up to 65% and an SSD of up to 15% on the price or market value of the property, whichever is the higher, depending on the type of property (residential or industrial), the residency status of the buyer, the holding period of the property, and the number of properties owned.
Foreigners of certain nationalities who fall within the scope of the respective free trade agreements will be accorded the same treatment as Singaporeans.
Certain transfers of equity interest in property-holding entities (PHEs) that own (directly or indirectly) primarily Singapore residential properties could attract additional conveyance duties (ACDs) for buyers (up to 71%) and sellers (at 12%) who are significant owners (as defined) of PHEs, as well as for a buyer who would become a significant owner after acquiring an equity interest in the PHEs. For acquisition of equity interest in a company, share duty remains payable in addition to the ACDs.
ABSD and ACDs are also levied on transfers of any residential property and equity interest in PHEs (where the significant ownership threshold is met) into living trusts where there is no identifiable owner of the property or equity interest at the time of transfer. Renunciation of interest in residential properties held in trust in certain scenarios will also attract applicable duties.
### Leases
Leases attract duty at 0.4% of the total rent (for leases of up to four years) or 0.4% of four times the average annual rent for the period of the lease (for leases longer than four years), but leases with average annual rents not exceeding SGD 1,000 are exempt from stamp duty.
### Stocks and shares
Instruments effecting the transfer of stocks and shares are subject to stamp duty of 0.2% on the purchase price or market value of the shares transferred, whichever is the higher.
## Foreign Worker Levy (FWL)
The FWL is a monthly levy that employers are liable to pay for each foreign employee (Work Permit or S Pass holders) hired. The levy rate depends on the employer’s industry and the ratio of foreigners to Singaporeans and permanent residents employed in the company.
## Payroll taxes
Singapore does not have payroll withholding. When a non-Singapore citizen employee ceases employment in Singapore, leaves Singapore for an overseas posting, or leaves Singapore for a period exceeding three months, the employer needs to notify the Singapore tax authorities once the fact of cessation/departure is known to the employer and withhold all monies due until tax clearance is issued (unless the employer is bearing full Singapore taxes for the employee). The notification must be made no later than one month prior to the date of cessation/departure, or two months from the date of cessation/departure where the employer is bearing full Singapore taxes for the employee. Non-Singapore citizen employees are also subject to tax on unexercised/unvested stock options/awards on a deemed gain basis when they cease employment or leave Singapore. As a concession, tax clearance need not be obtained in certain scenarios (_see Payment of tax in the section of the Individual tax summary for details_).
## Social security contributions
### Central Provident Fund (CPF)
The CPF is Singapore's national pension scheme. Contributions are payable by Singapore citizens and Singapore Permanent Residents (i.e. SPR obtained via immigration rules) only. Employers and employees contribute 17% and 20%, respectively, of ordinary monthly wages, up to an income ceiling of SGD 6,800. Their respective maximum contributions are therefore SGD 1,156 and SGD 1,360 per month. The rates are applicable to Singaporeans and SPRs (from third year and onwards) aged 55 years and below.
These rates also apply to additional wages (e.g. year-end bonus), up to the maximum contributions below:
Total wages | Additional wages subject to CPF contribution (calendar year 2024)  
---|---  
Not more than SGD 102,000 | Annual ordinary wages not more than SGD 81,600* | Actual additional wages  
Annual ordinary wages exceed SGD 81,600* | Actual additional wages  
Exceed SGD 102,000 | Annual ordinary wages not more than SGD 81,600* | SGD 102,000 less annual ordinary wages  
Annual ordinary wages exceed SGD 81,600* |  SGD 20,400 (SGD 102,000 - SGD 81,600*)  
* This rate is based on the annual ordinary wage ceiling for calendar year 2024 (i.e. SGD 6,800 x 12).
Reduced rates apply for employees who are earning less than SGD 750 per month as well as for those above 55 years of age, although these rates are being gradually increased.
The income ceiling will be increased to SGD 7,400 from 1 January 2025 and SGD 8,000 from 1 January 2026. The annual ordinary wage ceiling and maximum monthly contributions for employers and employees will be increased accordingly; however, the annual salary (comprising ordinary wages and additional wages) ceiling remains at SGD 102,000.
Foreign nationals and their employers are precluded from making CPF contributions. Foreign employees who become Singapore permanent residents, and their employers, may contribute at reduced rates for the first two years.
### Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS)
The SRS is a voluntary scheme to encourage employees and the self-employed to save for retirement over and above their CPF savings. The maximum amount to be contributed is subject to an income cap of SGD 102,000. Employers are allowed to contribute to their employees’ SRS accounts, subject to the contribution limits below. Employees will be taxable on these employer contributions but will be allowed corresponding tax relief.
The contribution rate caps for contributions made to the SRS scheme are as follows:
Residency status | Rate cap (%) | **Contribution cap (SGD)**  
---|---|---  
Singapore citizens or permanent residents | 15 | 15,300  
Foreigners | 35 | 35,700  
## Carbon tax
Carbon tax at a rate of SGD 25 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) of emissions is applied on the total greenhouse gas emissions of facilities that produce 25,000 or more tCO2e of emissions per year. The carbon tax applies uniformly to all sectors, without exemption, and takes the form of a fixed-price credits-based mechanism. The tax rate will be increased to SGD 45 per tCO2e of emissions for 2026 and 2027, and to SGD 50 to SGD 80 per tCO2e of emissions by 2030. Taxable facilities are allowed to use high quality international carbon credits to offset up to 5% of their taxable emissions.
