## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 07 February 2025
The Tax Procedure Code in Panama was introduced through Law 76 of 2019 with only a selected number of articles entering into force immediately or shortly after, meaning the majority of the Code had a delayed entry into force.
After an extension period was completed, the Code entered into force completely as of 1 June 2024. The entry into force of the Tax Procedure Code is a significant change for tax regulation in Panama as it includes a new set of regulations and obligations for taxpayers and for the Tax Authority.
Some of the main points to consider relate to the period and calculation for statute of limitations, tax queries to the Tax Authority and its effects, information requirements by the Authority, and the procedures for returning undue payments at the request of the interested party, among others.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 07 February 2025
## Taxable period
The accounting period is the period for which the company makes its accounts. Returns shall be made upon completion of the accounting period and may not exceed 12 months. For most companies, it is usually from 1 January to 31 December.
## Tax returns
The due date for filing is three months after the end of the fiscal year, with the possibility for an extension of up to one additional month.
## Payment of tax
Income tax payment shall be made depending on the income tax return and shall be made no longer than three months after closing of the corresponding accounting period.
Taxpayers must pay estimated taxes (usually the same amount as generated income) at the end of the sixth, ninth, and 12th month after the end of the corresponding accounting period.
## Tax audit process
Tax authorities select the taxpayers subject to audit based on internal criterion.
## Statute of limitations
The general Statute of limitations is as follows:
  1. After five years, direct and indirect taxes: a. The power of the Tax Administration to demand payment of tax debts which have been settled, self-assessed or by final resolution, and of the penalties imposed, counted from the day following the day on which the voluntary payment period ends. b. The power of the Tax Administration to determine the obligation and payment of taxpayers or delinquent taxpayers with their surcharges and interest, counted from the day following the date on which the regulatory period for filing the corresponding declaration ends. c. The power of the Tax Administration to impose tax sanctions, counted from the date on which the punishable infraction was committed, including administrative tax evasion, from the date on which the punishable infraction was committed. d. Among others.
  2. After three years: a. The power of the Tax Administration to determine the additional obligation and the additional payment of taxpayers or inaccurate taxpayers with their surcharges and interest, counted from the day after the self-assessment or voluntary determination was submitted through sworn statements or tax returns-settlement. b. The power of the Tax Administration to impose tax sanctions, counted from the date on which the punishable infraction was committed, including administrative tax evasion through additional determinations.
  3. After five years: the right to the refund of undue payments, over payments, or balances in favor of taxpayers, counted from the day after the undue payment, overpayment, or balance in favor was established.
  4. After eighteen months: the right to request and submit the rectification of self-assessments or voluntary determinations through tax returns, counted from the day following the expiration of the deadline for submitting the self-assessment or voluntary determination.


## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Among the topics of focus are non-deductible expenses, withholdings, and VAT.


# Panama
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 07 February 2025
A company is considered as a tax resident when it has been incorporated in Panama and if Panama is regarded as the place where the central management is located. Entities incorporated abroad may also be registered with the tax administration in order to avoid WHT.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Panama follows the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) PE rules.
The income referable to a PE or fixed place of business is the income obtained by the PE, as if it was an independent or different entity, taking into consideration the activities developed, assets used, and risks assumed.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 07 February 2025
Taxable income is determined by deducting from the Panamanian-source income all costs, expenses, and non-taxable income applicable and permitted by law. The deductibility of costs and expenses depend on the relation of such costs and expenses with the generation or preservation of income source. Special restrictions apply to the following:
  * Depreciation. 
  * Bad debt. 
  * Charitable contributions. 


Costs and expenses related to non-taxable income are not considered as deductible. Thus, the taxpayer must split the expenses and costs related to taxable transactions from those related to non-taxable transactions. The expenses and costs allocated to taxed transactions may not exceed the amount from multiplying the portion of taxable income from the total income by the total costs and expenses.
Example: | Taxable | Non-taxable | Total  
---|---|---|---  
Income | 100 | 50 | 150  
66.7% | 33.3% | 100%  
Costs and expenses | 83.38 | 41.62 | 125  
## Depreciation and depletion
The straight-line and sum-of-the-years-digits methods of depreciation are allowed, as well as any other method.
Assets | Straight-line (%)  
---|---  
Buildings | 3⅓ as maximum  
Machinery and equipment | 33 as maximum  
Furniture and fixtures | 33 as maximum  
Vehicles | 33 as maximum  
In the case of mines, depletion will be deductible during the useful life or depending on the state contract methodology.
## Goodwill
Goodwill expenses are deductible only when the transferring agent declares them as income.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses are deductible through the amortisation process, over a maximum term of five years.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are deductible only in cases where the interest relates to the generation or conservation of taxable income from a Panamanian source. No thin capitalisation rules are in force.
## Bad debt
A taxpayer may deduct bad debts by opting for one of the following options:
  * Deducting gains and losses annually to the value of such accounts in the fiscal year. 
  * Charging an annual profit and loss figure for the establishment of a reserve to meet contingencies of this nature. 


## Charitable contributions
Donations made in cash or in kind to the government, charitable or educational institutions, activities to promote HIV disease awareness, or political parties are deductible, with certain restrictions and limited to 1% of taxable income.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are not deductible.
## Taxes
The national and municipal taxes that affect capital, sales, and other operations related to taxable income producing activity are deductible.
## Net operating losses
Losses incurred by common taxpayers may be carried forward and deducted from taxable profits for the following five years, at a rate of 20% each year, but limited to 50% of taxable income. Loss carrybacks are not allowed, and losses are not allowed for estimated income tax purposes.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
A payment to a foreign entity (including affiliates) in a foreign country will be subject to WHT anytime it represents a deductible cost or expense for the payer. The tax base will be 50% of the remittance, and the income tax rate applicable is 25%.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 07 February 2025
In Panama, there are no group taxation rules.
## Transfer pricing
Transfer pricing obligation is extended to all the transactions carried out with related parties located abroad or under a special tax regime in Panama. There is an obligation to file an annual Transfer Pricing Informative Return (‘Form 930’), which includes all the operations carried out with related parties during the fiscal year under analysis. This report should be filed six months after the fiscal year has ended. The non-submission of this Form will be penalised with a fine equivalent to 1% of the total sum of operations carried out with related parties and will never exceed USD 1 million.
Regarding transfer pricing documentation, the taxpayer must present the Local File and Master File, in case the Panamanian Tax Authority requires it, within 45 working days, starting a day after the notification. The tax authorities are allowed to fine those taxpayers that fail to present the transfer pricing documentation; fines ranging from 1,000 to 5,000 Panamanian balboas (PAB) will be applied the first time, from PAB 5,000 to PAB 10,000 in case of recurrence, and the closure of the establishment for 2 to 15 days in case of non-compliance.
## Thin capitalisation
There are currently no thin capitalisation rules in Panama.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no provisions regarding CFCs in Panama.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 07 February 2025
For tax purposes, branches are considered separate entities from the head office and must therefore keep accounts separately and will have separate tax liability.
Branches located within the Panamanian territory must pay dividend tax through definitive WHT of 10% of net taxable income generated by the Panamanian branch, less all income taxes paid by the same corporation in Panama. This amount will be paid jointly on filing the corresponding income tax return.


# Panama
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 07 February 2025
## Foreign tax credit
Foreign tax credits are applicable only with countries with which Panama has signed a DTT (_see the section for a list of countries with which Panama has signed a DTT_).
## Free zones
Entities established in free zones may enjoy exemption from import duties on goods, income tax, sales tax, export tax, and selective consumption tax derived from royalties on exportation and re-exportation activities. Aside from trading activities, the following businesses may also apply for the regime: higher education centres, scientific research centres, specialised centres for health services, high technology businesses, assembling businesses, semi processed or finished products processing businesses, services businesses, environmental service businesses, general services, logistics services businesses, and manufacturing businesses.
## Tourism, industry, and agriculture allowances
The Incentive Law for Tourism Development grants several tax benefits (e.g. exemption from import duties on certain tourism services and related goods for companies dedicated to tourism), but only for those corporations with a signed tourism agreement with the government. Income tax exemptions may apply in special cases.
In general, income from individuals or corporations that engage in agricultural production activities will be exempted from income tax if annual gross income is lower than USD 350,000.
Forestry plantations were totally exempted from income tax payment until 2018 if the lot planted had been duly registered at the Forestry Registry of the Environmental National Authority and resolution with approval from this authority had been issued.
## Special laws
The Panamanian government has enacted special laws regarding tax exemptions for certain activities performed in Panama, such as call centres (Law No. 54 of 2001), and tax exemptions for certain appointed areas, such as the Panama Pacific Economic Zone (Law No. 41 of 2004) and Law No. 41 of 2007, which creates a special regime for the establishment and operation of regional headquarters in Panama (SEM Regime).
To become a more competitive and appealing country for direct foreign investment and given the success of the SEM Regime, as well as the need for multinational companies to carry out manufacturing activities, the government of Panama enacted Law No. 159 of 31 August 2020. Said law creates the Special Regime for the Establishment and Operation of Multinational Companies for the Provision of Services Related to Manufacturing, best known as the EMMA Law or EMMA license granting tax, labour, and immigration benefits.
By means of Law No. 8 of 2010, Real Estate Investment Societies may deduct the profits distributed to their shareholders, provided that these Real Estate Investment Societies:
  * raise long-term funds in a securities market
  * are registered in the National Securities Commission
  * distribute no less than 90% of their free cash flow
  * register in the General Direction of Revenues, and
  * withhold 20% of the profits distributed as an income tax advance payment on behalf of the shareholder, which may be deemed the definitive tax to be paid by the shareholder.




# Panama
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 07 February 2025
Royalties and commissions on services paid to foreign entities are taxed through the application of the corresponding tax rate (i.e. 25%) over 50% of remittance under the concept of WHT (effective tax rate is 12.5%). The taxpayer may decide not to withhold taxes and consequently not deduct the expense.
Payment of interest is also subject to income tax on 50% of the interest paid to a beneficiary abroad on loans invested in Panama, but the payer must proceed with the WHT even if one does not deduct the interest.
If the beneficiary is registered as a taxpayer in Panama before the tax administration, no WHT may be required.
If, according to a special law, the payment of interest, royalties, dividends, fees, etc. is exempt from WHT, said exemption will not apply if the beneficial owner of the payment can credit the taxes that would have been paid in Panama in its country of residence. In the event that the credit application is not allowed in the country of residence, the taxpayer must request a formal opinion from an independent expert stating the non-applicability of the tax credit in the country of residence.
Recipient | Dividends (%) | Interest (%) | Royalties (%)  
---|---|---|---  
Foreign corporations | 5/10/20* | 12.5 | 12.5

Panama has deposited its instrument of ratification for the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (Multilateral Convention or MLI), which now covers almost 1,700 bilateral tax treaties, thus underlining its strong commitment to prevent the abuse of tax treaties and base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) by multinational enterprises.
For Panama, the MLI is in force. The MLI establishes the principal purpose test (PPT), and, as a result, in each case it should be studied how the MLI can affect tax treaty applications.

## US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and the Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
Panama signed the Model 1 Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) for FATCA purposes with the US Treasury in order for Panamanian Banks to subscribe to the terms of FATCA. For this purpose, Law 51 of 2016 and Executive Decree 124 of 2017 were created to complement the IGA and establish the procedures and deadlines for the financial institutions required to perform the due diligence and send the reports to the Tax Authority.
In 2016, Panama committed to automatically exchange information starting in 2018, according to the CRS. Same as the IGA-FATCA, the CRS also includes the automatic information exchange of financial information for tax purposes, based on the agreements signed by the Tax Authority (DGI) and the CAAs.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 07 February 2025
Under the territoriality principle, the following will not be considered as taxable income:
  * All income produced outside Panama. 
  * All income generated from operations or services performed outside the Panamanian territory. 


## Inventory valuation
Inventory should be valued at the start of any business and, subsequently, at least once every accounting period. All assets must be grouped, depending on their nature, with certain characteristics indicated (e.g. the unit of measurement, the name of the asset, the price of the unit, the total value of units). Reference to the accounting records should also be included.
Inventories are generally stated at cost and can be valued using the compound average cost method, first in first out (FIFO) method, retail method, or specific identification method. Since all entities must keep legal records, any adjustment resulting from using different methods of inventory valuation for tax purposes and financial purposes should be recorded and must be reported to the proper authorities. Once a taxpayer adopts a method, they must maintain it for at least five years.
## Capital gains
_See Capital gains tax in the section for a description of how capital gains are taxed in Panama_.
## Dividend income
Panamanian legislation establishes that distribution of dividends of a Panamanian source are subject to definitive WHT, applied at the moment of distribution. Generally, dividends are subject to income tax at a rate of 10% without taking into consideration the way of payment, types of stock, assets, or money.
For companies with mixed-source income, dividend tax applies at a 5% rate on dividends paid from foreign-source income and from income derived from exports, as well as exempt income from banking account interests and interests and earnings derived from securities issued by the government.
Free zone users are taxed at a 5% rate as well for local-source income.
Loans to shareholders are deemed as dividend distributions, subject to a 10% withholding even in the cases where the 5% tax rate applies.
Notwithstanding the aforementioned, if the entity’s shares are issued to bearer, they will be subject to dividend tax at a rate of 20%.
Dividend tax is levied if the entity meets one of the following criteria: (i) requires an operation permit to operate in Panama, (ii) requires an operation key to operate at the Colon Free Zone, (iii) is established in a Fuel Free Zone, (iv) is established in a free zone or special zone, or (v) produces Panamanian-source taxable income. Dividend tax also does not apply to dividends paid on income received as a dividend if the entity is not required to withhold dividend tax or if the entity withheld the tax.
A complementary tax applies each tax year that the entity distributes less than 40% of the net profits after income tax. The complementary tax is an advance payment of the dividend tax, calculated on the difference of the distributed dividends and 40% of the net profits after income tax, and applies the corresponding tax rate. If complementary tax is paid, then the entity may offset the paid complementary tax with the dividend tax when the corresponding dividend is decreed.
### Inter-company dividends
The distribution of dividends derived from income received as dividends from other entities is not subject to income tax or dividend tax as long as the entity that paid the dividend in the first instance was exempt from withholding any dividend tax, or, if it was required to, made the corresponding withholding.
## Interest income
Interest income is subject to income tax to the extent that it reflects operations carried out in Panama. Foreign beneficiaries are subject to WHT. The tax base will be 50% of the remittance, and the income tax rate applicable is 25%.
## Royalty income
Royalty income is subject to income tax to the extent that it reflects operations carried out in Panama. Foreign beneficiaries are subject to WHT to the extent that the payer has a deduction. The tax base will be 50% of the remittance, and the income tax rate applicable is 25%.
## Foreign income
Panamanian resident companies are taxed on their income generated within the Panamanian territory. Any other income generated abroad will be exempt from income tax payment but may be subject to dividend tax (_see above_).


# Panama
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 07 February 2025
Panamanian income tax is levied based on the territoriality principle. Panamanian-source income is subject to taxation whether it is received by a resident or non-resident entity. Residency is only relevant to determine if the entity is subject to withholding tax (WHT) or not.
Corporations are subject to income tax at a fixed rate of 25%.
The tax base (i.e. amount to which the tax rate will apply) for companies whose taxable income is greater than 1.5 million United States dollars (USD) is the greater of:
  * net taxable income calculated on the normal basis or 
  * 4.67% of the gross taxable income (excluding exempted and non-taxable income and foreign-source income); this is called the alternate calculation of income tax (_Calculo Alternativo del Impuesto sobre la Renta_ or CAIR). 


If the entity's tax year results in a loss due to the alternative calculation, the taxpayer may request to the tax administration (the General Directorate of Income, i.e. _Dirección General de Ingresos_ or DGI) not to be subject to the CAIR.
The taxpayer may also request not to apply the CAIR if its effective income tax rate is higher than the applicable income tax rate (i.e. 25%). Here is an example of such an instance:
Net taxable income | USD  
---|---  
a | Total revenues | 2,000.00  
b | Deductible costs and expenses | 1,950.00  
c | Net taxable income | 50.00  
CAIR | USD  
d | Presumptive net taxable income (4.67% x a) | 93.40  
e | Income tax (25% x d) | 23.35  
CAIR effective tax rate  
f | Presumptive income tax (e) | USD 23.35  
g | Net taxable income (c) | USD 50.00  
h | Effective tax rate (f/g) | 46.70%  
The DGI has a six-month period to reach a decision on such requests; otherwise, the petition will be considered as granted.
## Local municipal tax
Local municipal tax is charged based on the gross income generated by the business through the corresponding accounting period; it also depends on the type of activity being conducted by the corporation. In most cases, it cannot exceed USD 2,000 per month for each activity performed.
An Annual Municipal Tax Return for the District of Panama or District of San Miguelito must be filed before the Municipal Authorities in the first 90 calendar days after the ending of the fiscal year. In case the taxpayer does not file the return before the deadline, a USD 500 penalty will be applicable.

## Movable goods and services transfer tax (ITBMS)
The movable goods and services transfer tax (_Impuesto de Transferencia de Bienes Muebles y Prestación de Servicios_ or ITBMS) is the Panamanian value-added tax (VAT).
The general tax rate is currently 7%.
Alcoholic beverages and hotel accommodation are taxed at 10%, and tobacco and tobacco-derived products are taxed at 15%.
ITBMS is calculated on the value-added through a method of tax credits (i.e. ITBMS paid on transactions to produce taxable transactions) and tax debits (i.e. ITBMS collected on transactions).
Exports are not taxed, and the ITBMS paid to generate the exports may be refunded. The sale of goods such as medicines, foods, and certain products for babies are not taxed and may allow the supplier to recover the ITBMS as an exporter if certain criteria is met.
Medical services and transportation, among other services, are not taxed but do not produce ITBMS credit for the supplier.
The statute of limitations is five years.
## Customs duties
All goods introduced into the Panamanian territory from another country are subject to customs duties. The duty rates are provided by the Panamanian Customs and Tariffs Office.
Customs duties may only be assessed by authorised customs brokers.
## Excise tax (selective consumption tax)
The selective consumption tax is applied to foods (sugar tax), goods (e.g. jewellery, expensive automobiles, guns, tobacco, alcoholic beverages), and services (e.g. mobile, cable TV, satellite TV) that are considered as non-essential. The tax base is the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) price plus import duties for imported items and sales price for all other activities. The tax is levied at only one stage: on the importation of the taxed products; on the sale of taxed goods produced in Panama; and, for services, when the service is invoiced, the service is completely rendered, or upon receipt of advance payments, whichever occurs first.
Different tax rates apply depending on the type of service or good, with a minimum of 5% on soft drinks and 100% on tobacco products.
## Immovable Property Tax
In Panama, all owners of real estate should pay Immovable Property Tax annually at a rate between 0% and 1.0%, depending on the value and use the property.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is charged at a rate of USD 0.10 per USD 100 (or fraction thereof) only on certain commercial contracts.
## Capital gains tax
In case of transfer of real estate property, a 2% real estate transfer tax plus a 3% income tax advance payment must be remitted (calculated over the gross transaction amount or the cadastral value, whichever is greater). The 3% may be deemed definitive; contrariwise, the tax will be assessed at 10% of the gain and the 3% of the advance payment will be credited. Any amount in excess may be subject to rebate.
The rates as described in the table below will be applicable to the transfer of real estate if:
  * the transferor's core business is the sale of real estate with new constructions
  * it is the first transfer of the real estate after the new construction is built, and
  * the construction permit was issued after 1 January 2010.

New housing construction | Rate (%)  
---|---  
Up to USD 35,000 | 0.5  
From USD 35,000 up to USD 80,000 | 1.5  
Greater than USD 80,000 | 2.5  
New commercial construction | 4.5  
When transferring new housing real estate, the real estate transfer tax (2%) does not apply if the transfer occurs within the next two years after an Occupancy Permit is issued.
The transfer of securities is subject to a 5% WHT, and the tax rate on capital gain is 10%. The law establishes the application of a 5% WHT that will be applied by the buyer. The seller may accept the WHT as definitive or perform the calculation of the gain, apply the rate of 10%, and deduct the applied WHT. In case the WHT is superior, the taxpayer can choose to claim the return of payments made in excess. In certain cases, for transfers in which there is no capital gain, withholding at source does not take place, provided that certain conditions are met.
Example:
Sales price (a) | 1,000  
---|---  
Cost (b) | 900  
Benefit (c) | 100  
WHT at 5% of (a) | 50  
Tax at 10% of (c) | 10  
Payment in excess | 40
