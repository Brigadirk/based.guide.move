## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 07 February 2025
Panama's tax system is based on a territorial concept of income. Citizens and residents are taxed on income earned from Panamanian sources. Non-residents are taxed only on income from Panamanian sources, and the tax on any type of income paid to a non-resident must be withheld by the payer. Citizens, residents, and non-residents are not taxed on exempt income (i.e. interest on Panamanian government securities, interest on savings accounts, and time deposits maintained with banks established in Panama).
## Personal income tax rates
Income tax is due on taxable income as follows:
Taxable income (USD*) | Tax on column 1 (USD) | Tax on excess (%)  
---|---|---  
Over (column 1) | Not over  
0 | 11,000 | 0 | 0  
11,000 | 50,000 | 0 | 15  
50,000 | 5,850 | 25

## Taxable period
Tax returns are filed on a calendar-year basis.
## Tax returns
All taxpayers, except employees having only one source of income from wages, salary, or other remuneration for personal services and whose monthly income tax is deducted by the employer, must file a tax return by 15 March of the following year.
Employees having only one source of income from personal services who want to take advantage of non-business expenses must file a tax return. Employees who receive representation allowances and salary in kind are required to file a tax return.
Tax returns and estimated income for the current year must be filed on forms prescribed and supplied by the income tax department.
## Payment of tax
There is WHT from wages, salaries, and other remuneration for personal services. The total amount of the taxpayer's estimated income tax is payable annually in three equal instalments on 30 June, 30 September, and 31 December. If the estimated amount paid exceeds the actual amount computed at the end of the year, the excess is applied against the current year's estimated income tax or against taxes due in subsequent years. If there is still an overpayment after applying the excess to the estimate for the current year, a refund may be obtained, provided the tax authorities determine that no additional tax is due.

Last reviewed - 07 February 2025
## Social security taxes
From January 2013, social security tax is assessed at a rate of 9.75% on wages and other compensation paid, including compensation in kind, for employees and 12.25% for employers. There is no maximum limit on the taxable amount.
## Educational insurance tax
Educational insurance tax is assessed at the rate of 1.25% for employees and 1.50% for employers, on salaries and wages paid. There is no maximum limit on the taxable amount.
## Capital gains tax
The transfer of real estate property and securities is subject to WHT on the gross transactions amount, but the taxpayer shall make a special income tax assessment to pay the capital gain and may request a rebate of the difference between the WHT and the capital gain.
In the case of the transfer of real estate property, a 2% real estate transfer tax plus a 3% income tax advance payment must be submitted (done over the gross transaction amount or the cadastral value, whichever is greater). The 3% may be deemed definitive; contrariwise, the tax will be assessed at 10% of the gain and the 3% of the advanced payment will be credited. Any exceeding amount may be subject to rebate.
The rates as described in the table below will be applicable to the transfer of real estate if:
  * the transferor´s core business is the sale of real estate with new constructions 
  * it is the first sale of the property after the new construction is finished 
  * the construction permit was issued after January 1 of 2011, and 
  * the land appraisal was made within the last two years prior to the transfer of the property. 

New housing construction | Rate (%)  
---|---  
Up to USD 35,000 | 0.50  
From USD 35,000 up to USD 80,000 | 1.50  
Greater than USD 80,000 | 2.50  
New commercial construction | 4.50  
When transferring new properties with new constructions, the real estate transfer tax (2%) will not apply.
If only the first criterion is met but none of the other three, then the income tax will have to be assessed under the ordinary regime.
The transfer of securities is subject to a 5% WHT, and the tax rate on capital gain is 10%. The law establishes the application of a 5% WHT that will be applied by the buyer. The seller may accept the WHT as definitive or perform the calculation of the gain, apply the rate of 10%, and deduce the applied WHT. In case the WHT is higher, the taxpayer can choose to claim the return of exceeding payments.
Example:
Sales price (a) | 1,000  
---|---  
Cost (b) | 900  
Benefit (c) | 100  
WHT at 5% of (a) | 50  
Tax at 10% of (c) | 10  
Payment in excess | 40  
The sale of fixed assets is subject to 10% tax rate on the capital gain, and there is no WHT.
## Consumption taxes
### Movable goods and services transfer tax (ITBMS)
The movable goods and services transfer tax (_Impuesto de Transferencia de Bienes Muebles y Prestación de Servicios_ or ITBMS) is the Panamanian value-added tax (VAT).
The general tax rate is currently 7%.

### Excise tax (selective consumption tax)
The selective consumption tax is applied to goods (e.g. jewellery, expensive automobiles, guns, tobacco, alcoholic beverages) and services (e.g. mobile, cable TV, satellite TV) that are considered as non-essential. The tax base is the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) price plus import duties for imported items and sales price for all other activities.
