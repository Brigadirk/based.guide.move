## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties

## Foreign tax relief
An individual resident in Greenland is entitled to deduct foreign income taxes paid or accrued on foreign-source income from the Greenlandic tax payable up to a maximum of Greenlandic tax paid on that part of the taxable income that is foreign-source income. Relief according to DTTs may be claimed if their provisions are more favourable.
Unutilised credits are not refundable and cannot be carried back or forward.
## Tax treaties
Greenland only has DTTs covering employee tax with Denmark, the Faroe Islands, Guernsey, Iceland, Isle of Man, Jersey, and Norway. Additionally, Greenland has exchange of information treaties with a number of small nations, such as Aruba, Bahamas, Cayman Islands, San Marino, Monaco, etc.
Greenland has introduced a limited international general anti-abuse rule whereby a taxpayer will not be granted the advantages of a DTT if it is reasonable to conclude, in light of all relevant circumstances, that granting this advantage is one of the principal aims of the arrangement or transaction, unless it is satisfied that granting the advantage in the concrete circumstances is in accordance with the content and purpose of the provision in question.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
On 1 January 2016, an amendment was adopted to the expat flat-tax regime that applies to individuals working in the extractive industries or involved in construction and installation outside existing towns and settlements.
The amendment states that such individuals are not tax liable on interest and dividends from sources outside Greenland, provided that the individual earns less than 350,000 Danish kroner (DKK) per income year from the employment that gives rise to Greenlandic tax liability. If there is no other income, such individuals are exempt from the duty to file a tax return.
The purpose of the amendment is to avoid unnecessary administration in connection with tax returns for taxpayers and the tax authority alike in a situation where there is unlikely to be tax revenue of any significance at stake.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
An individual may be taxed in Greenland on the basis of full or limited tax liability.
An individual who is resident in Greenland is subject to full tax liability on one’s worldwide income unless the individual is considered a resident of another country according to a double residence clause in a relevant double taxation treaty (DTT).
An individual who is fully tax resident in Greenland will, as a main rule, be taxed at up to 44%, depending on the municipality of taxation. Some deductions are applicable.
An individual not fully tax liable may have limited tax liability to Greenland. Limited tax liability is restricted to income from Greenlandic sources, listed in the Greenlandic Tax Act Section 2, including:
  * Salary for work performed in Greenland, unless the employment is exercised during stays not exceeding 14 consecutive days and the employee is employed by an employer who is neither resident nor has a permanent establishment (PE) in Greenland. An allowance (deduction) of the lesser of 10% of the income taxable to Greenland and DKK 1,000 is available. 
  * Certain other types of personal income, including income as an artiste or sportsman, director’s fees, pension distributions, economic education support from sources in Greenland, etc. 
  * Income arising from a business enterprise with a PE. 
  * Income from independent personal services performed either from a fixed base in Greenland or during a stay of 90 days or more. 
  * Income from shipping or air traffic within, or, in case of regular traffic, to or from Greenland. 
  * Income from real estate located in Greenland, including sale. 
  * Dividends from Greenlandic companies. 
  * Royalty income from Greenland. 


An individual with limited tax liability to Greenland will, as a main rule, be taxed at up to 44% on income from sources in Greenland.
## Personal income tax rates
Generally, individuals are subject to state taxes (national income tax) and municipal tax.
The tax percentages may be adjusted every year, and the 2020 percentages are as follows:
**Municipality** | **Municipality tax (%)** | **National tax (%)** | **Joint local municipality tax (%)** | **Total tax (%)**  
---|---|---|---|---  
Kujalleq | 28 | 10 | 6 | 44  
Sermersooq | 26 | 10 | 6 | 42  
Qeqqata | 26 | 10 | 6 | 42

Outside municipal areas | 26 | 10 | N/A | 36  
## Special regime for oil, gas, and mineral activities and certain construction activities
Individuals working in Greenland in relation to oil, gas, and mineral activities or construction activities outside existing towns and settlements are taxed at a flat rate of 35% with no deductions allowed, provided that they have not been taxable to a local Greenlandic municipality for six months prior to the commencement of the activities.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year is from 1 January to 31 December.
## Tax returns
Provisional taxes are withheld or collected on the basis of an estimated income for the current year. Accordingly, a preliminary tax return must be filed with the Greenlandic tax authorities.All individuals who are either subject to full or limited tax liability to Greenland are basically obligated to submit a tax return, including all necessary additional information regarding income, to the Greenlandic tax authorities by 1 May in the year following the relevant income year. However, foreigners who are taxable to Greenland under the special expat regime are exempt from lodging Greenlandic tax returns. The same applies to individuals with limited tax liability in the form of withholding tax (WHT) on royalties. 
A tax surcharge of DKK 200 per day (maximum DKK 2,000) is levied for late submission of the tax return.
When the final tax return has been reported, the Greenlandic tax authorities elaborate a final tax assessment that states whether the individual has an underpayment of tax, excess tax, or neither of the two.Individuals leaving Greenland have to file a tax return at the normal deadline.
## Payment of tax
Taxes on wages (including wages in labour hire-out situations) and dividends (and royalties for individuals with limited tax liability on royalties) are withheld at source on the basis of the preliminary tax return. 
When the final tax has been assessed during the year following the income year in question, an underpayment of tax or an excess tax may occur. Underpayment of tax is payable in three instalments with due dates on 20 September, 20 October, and 20 November in the year of the assessment and will include a surcharge of 8%. 
Overpayment of tax is due to be returned before 1 September including a surcharge of 2%.
## Tax audit process
Tax audits are a rather formless affair. A letter of intent to change the tax assessment, including a fact presentation, must be sent to the tax payer by the Tax Agency. 
## Statute of limitations
The tax authorities must send out the abovementioned letter of intent no later than 31 October in the fifth income year after the year under scrutiny. The same time bar applies to the taxpayer seeking to amend a prior year’s tax return. 
In case the Tax Agency or the taxpayer, for reasons unattributable to it and for which it is not responsible, did not know of information of either factual or legal nature that justify a change of the tax return, a tax return may be reopened even outside the stated time bar. Renewed assessment or application for reopening, as the case may be, must be processed no later than six months after the information justifying the change came to the attention of the Tax Agency or taxpayer.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
There are no relevant specific topics in focus for the Greenlandic tax authorities.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
## Employment income
All remunerations from employment, whether in cash or in kind, are subject to tax when the employee has obtained a legal right to the remuneration, regardless of where payment is made and regardless of whether remitted. The liability extends to any living or housing allowance and any reimbursement of tax or other personal liability, whether paid directly to an employee or borne by the employer on the employee’s behalf.
Payments to an employee for expenses of travel, entertainment, or any other service to be performed on behalf of the employer are taxable only to the extent that they are not actually expended in the performance of the service.
Employees who are given a free telephone, certain types of free housing, free food, and certain other benefits from their employer are taxed on fixed amounts, regardless of actual usage and saved private expenditures. The standardised values are published once a year in a tax value table. 
## Equity compensation
Share-based payments are, as a starting point, taxed as any other remuneration from employment, at a tax rate of 42% to 44%, depending on the local municipality in question. There is a very rare exception available upon application in case of ownership transfer by way of generational change, by which taxation may be deferred.
## Business income
In general, private business owners (i.e. individuals operating a business on their own account and risk) are comprised by the general tax rates, etc. as employees.
## Capital gains
As a main rule, capital gains are not taxable for individuals in Greenland. There are two exceptions: (i) ‘financial contracts’ (i.e. derivatives, etc.) and (ii) debentures with a nominal interest below 2% _per annum_. Capital gains on these two asset classes are taxable as normal income by tax rates of 42% to 44% (2014 percentages). 
## Dividend income
Dividend income is treated as normal taxable income.
Loans and security granted by a company to certain major shareholders are re-characterised as dividends.
## Interest income
Interest income is treated as normal taxable income.
## Rental income
Rental income is treated as normal taxable income.
## Exempt income
Foreigners subject to the expat flat-tax regime are not tax liable on foreign-sourced interest and dividends if their Greenlandic-sourced wage income is less than DKK 350,000 in the year in question.
There are marginal examples of other tax-exempt income, such as certain types of welfare payments, certain lottery prizes and winnings comprised by excise duties on lotteries and gambling, gifts from closely related family, certain types of payments of life insurance, and certain disability compensation, insurance payments concerning critical illness, and pension payments if the contributions are non-deductible in Denmark, the Faroe Islands, or in Greenland.

There are no other income tax credits than the ones already mentioned elsewhere.


# Greenland
## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
An individual becomes fully tax liable by taking up residence in Greenland or staying in Greenland for more than six consecutive months. Residence in Greenland is deemed to exist if an individual acquires a home in Greenland and takes up residence there. Generally, taxation commences from the date of arrival.
An individual who does not set up residence will become subject to full Greenlandic tax liability from the first day of one’s stay if one stays in Greenland for at least six consecutive months. When determining the six-month period, short stays outside Greenland due to holidays, etc. are included, whereas stays abroad due to employment may interrupt the six-month period.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
## Social security contributions
There are no Greenlandic social security contributions for individuals (only for employers). The rate applicable to employers is 1.1% on payroll (2.1% for the income year 2025).
## Mandatory pension scheme
All employees subject to full tax liability in Greenland must pay 10% in 2024 (11% in 2025 and onwards) to a Greenlandic pension fund based on the A-tax basis (salaries, etc). This does not apply for an employee who is a limited taxpayer staying in Greenland less than six months.
Greenlandic employees have to pay to a recognised pension fund. However, the Greenland tax authorities may, upon application, grant permission for contributions to a pension scheme established in Norway, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, or a country that is a member of the European Union (EU) for a period of up to two income years. This exception is based on certain conditions that must be met.
## Consumption taxes
There is no Greenlandic value-added tax (VAT).
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There is no Greenlandic tax on net wealth.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Inheritance is generally not taxable. If the deceased’s spouse continues with the joint estate as an undivided estate, the spouse will roll over into the deceased’s tax position. This provision has a narrow field of application outside of cases of the deceased running a business, given that almost no assets are subject to capital gains taxation. 
Gifts are generally taxable in Greenland as ordinary income. However, gifts to a spouse, children or stepchildren and their offspring, spouses of deceased children and stepchildren, parents, stepparents, and grandparents are exempt from tax. 
Gifts are taxable by normal tax rates of 42% to 44% (2014 percentages). 
## Property taxes
There is no tax in Greenland on property for private use. 
## Luxury and excise taxes
There are import and/or excise duties on a variety of consumables, including alcohol, tobacco, sugar, chocolate, coffee, tea, soft drinks, meat, poultry, perfume, and cosmetics. There are import duties on cars, mopeds, and snowmobiles. 
## Stamp taxes
Stamp tax is payable on a few documents, such as a deed of transfer of real estate, registration when mortgaging real estate, and transfer of ships (1.5% of the transfer sum), including on transfer of shares in companies that own ships.
