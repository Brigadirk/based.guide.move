## Multiple changes to tax legislation
A bill for changes to the Greenland tax legislation was approved on 14 November 2023. The bill includes various amendments and changes to the Greenland tax legislation, including (but not limited to):
  * The existing rule regarding taxation of employee paid travel costs (‘free travel‘), as well as the 2,000 Danish krone (DKK) threshold and base amounts, will be removed. In connection with the removal of the existing rule on travel costs paid by the employer, a new rule will be introduced, which stipulates that the value of travel costs paid by the employer for work travels is generally tax exempt for the employee. Furthermore, the value of travel costs paid by the employer for travel home (vacation) is tax exempt for the employee; however, only for one annual vacation travel.
  * The existing thin capitalisation rule (interest limitation) will be changed from a 2:1 debt-to-equity ratio to a 4:1 debt-to-equity ratio. The remaining conditions and exemptions in the thin capitalisation rule will remain unchanged.
  * Current Greenlandic tax rules stipulate that tax losses can be carried forward for future offsetting no more than five years (unless the tax losses derive from minerals and/or export of ice and water). According to the new rules, tax losses can be carried forward for ten years, under the condition that the taxpayer, each year before the tax return deadline, submits a specification of the tax losses and a declaration that the taxpayer will keep all accounting material relevant for the tax losses until, at least, two years after the utilisation of the tax loss.
  * A new rule regarding the 25% withholding tax (WHT) on interest accrual and/or payments from Greenland resident companies (debtor) to a non-resident creditor. However, the WHT only applies if the non-resident creditor (recipient of interests from Greenland company) is sub tax with a tax rate less than 15% or if there is no double tax treaty (DTT), which reduces the interest WHT, between Greenland and the country of the creditor/interest recipient.There are some exceptions where the interest WHT of 25% does not apply (e.g. if the recipient of interest is subject to controlling influence of a parent company resident in Denmark, Faroe Islands, or a country with which Greenland has a DTT, provided that the recipient will be subject to local controlled foreign company (CFC) taxation, should the local conditions therefore be met.
  * A new chapter 3b will be included in the Greenland tax legislation. Chapter 3b is a voluntarily tax regime for Greenland resident companies with revenue no less than 90% derived from activity related to either: 
    * mineral resources, 
    * exploitation of water resources for energy production, or
    * commercial exploitation of water and ice.
Furthermore, Greenlandic companies with revenue no less than 90% derived from commercial utilisation of hydrogen power in Greenland for energy intensive industrial production, production of energy, servers, or online data storage can also choose to be taxed under chapter 3b, provided that the company is a subsidiary to a company that is covered by the bullets above and who is the licence owner to the underlying licence for the activity.Group companies with activity associated with the above industries/activities can also be covered, under certain conditions.The tax calculation under chapter 3b follows the general Greenland tax principles but with the below special differences/treatments (note that the rules below do have certain aspects and conditions): 
    * Dividends received from Greenland resident or non-Greenland subsidiaries is not taxable (remains taxable if chapter 3b is not chosen).
    * No deduction for dividend distribution (contrary to the existing unique rule in Greenland) (remains taxable if chapter 3b is not chosen).
    * Dividend WHT of 24% will apply on dividend distributions (42% to 44% if chapter 3b is not chosen). However, if the dividend recipient is also covered by chapter 3b, the WHT is zero unless the distributing Greenland company is a conduit company and the dividend comes from a foreign subsidiary.
If a taxpayer decides to be taxed under chapter 3b, the taxpayer is bound to the chapter for at least five income years.


The law changes will have effect from the 2024 income year and going forward.
## New Greenlandic transfer pricing guidance
A new regulation has been issued on 17 October 2023, stating that certain companies must submit transfer pricing documentation within 60 days after the tax return deadline.
Whether the company is obligated to prepare and submit transfer pricing documentation depends on whether the controlled transactions reported in specific fields on the S40 form with the tax return exceed the threshold based on a special ’median value‘ calculation. The threshold for 2023 is DKK 500 million (DKK 250 million for 2024). 
The threshold will be gradually reduced, and from 2030 all entities with controlled transactions, regardless of size, must submit transfer pricing documentation every year.
The Greenlandic transfer pricing rules also apply to transactions between Greenlandic group entities (no joint taxation in Greenland).
## Change in corporate tax rate and on account tax
The corporate tax rate is 25% for both Greenlandic and foreign companies from 1 January 2020. Previously, a ‘surcharge’ of 6% of the corporate tax payable was applicable, hence the effective corporate tax rate was 26.5%. From 1 January 2022, a company is able to pay on account tax to the Greenland tax authorities. This on account tax has to be paid before the end of the year for the present tax year (the deadline is pushed in cases of income year not following calendar year). If the actual corporate tax exceeds the prepaid on account tax, there is a ‘surcharge’ of 6% of the corporate tax payable; consequently, the effective corporate tax rate is 26.5%. The tax with surcharge is due for payment on 1 November with final due date for payment 20 November. Oil and mineral licence holders are exempt from the 6% surcharge according to current practice.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
## Taxable period
The taxable period is the calendar year. Permission can be granted to use a 12-month period other than the calendar year, provided that the period starts on the first day of a calendar month.
## Tax returns
Tax returns are completed on the basis of audited financial accounts with adjustments for tax. Tax returns should be filed no later than four months following the end of the income year, meaning 1 May for companies using the calendar year as the income year. However, if the company submits tax returns via the official web portal for tax return submissions, the deadline is 15 June.
The tax system, in practice, is based on self-assessment. Tax assessments are made by the tax authorities on the basis of the tax return.
## Payment of tax
The corporate tax is due for payment by 20 November of the following year. Greenland does not have an on account tax system, so there are no advantages in paying the tax prior to this date.
### Penalties
A tax surcharge of DKK 200 per day (maximum DKK 5,000) is levied for late submission of the tax return.
## Tax audit process
Tax audit is a rather informal procedure, whereby questions for clarification and/or documentation may be asked by the Greenlandic Tax Agency. There are few rules governing audit other than statutory limitation rules.
## Statute of limitations
The general statute of limitations is 31 October in the fifth calendar year after that of the end of the relevant income year.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
There does not seem, presently, to be particular focus areas of the Greenlandic Tax Agency, and none have been publically announced.


# Greenland
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
A corporation is resident in Greenland for tax purposes if it is registered in the Danish Companies Register with its principal seat of business in Greenland or if it has its effective seat of management in Greenland. The effective seat of management is typically the place where the management decisions concerning the company’s day-to-day operations are made.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Non-resident companies are liable to tax in Greenland on business profits derived through a PE in Greenland. Generally, Greenland may be assumed to rely on the principles of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) model tax treaty in the determination of whether a PE exists. There is virtually no published practice on the issue. Apart from income from a PE, foreign companies are tax liable on income in connection with the exploration and exploitation of oil, gas, and minerals, regardless of whether a PE exists. This includes all activity ultimately serving the extractive industries, including all kinds of subcontractors and service providers to the industry.


# Greenland
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
The general deduction scheme is fairly standard, although the Greenlandic Tax Agency seems to have a restrictive view of the kinds of expenses that are deductible. One very unusual feature is that dividends paid are deductible for the distributing company.
## Depreciation and amortisation
Tax depreciation is not required to be in coherence with book depreciation.
Operating assets can be depreciated by 30% a year on a declining-balance basis, ships and aeroplanes can be depreciated by 10% on a straight-line basis, and buildings and installations can be depreciated by 5% on a straight-line basis. Oil and mineral licences can be depreciated over ten years (oil) and four years (minerals) on a straight-line basis. If the lifetime of the licence is shorter than ten or four years, the licences are depreciated over the lifetime of the licence on a straight-line basis.
Depreciation allowances that are recaptured as part of a capital gain on the sale of an asset are generally fully taxable.
A new rule, with effect from 1 January 2024, will make it possible to postpone a taxable gain related to sale of buildings, vessels, and airplanes, to be taxed the following income year, under the condition that new assets are acquired in that subsequent year. The taxable gain should then reduce the acquisition value of the buildings/vessels/airplanes acquired in the subsequent year. A surcharge of 1% per month will be added to the taxable gain in the tax calculation for the subsequent income year if no new assets were acquired.
## Goodwill
Goodwill can be depreciated as an operating asset (i.e. by 30% on a declining-balance basis).
## Start-up expenses
No specific rules in Greenlandic tax law govern the treatment of start-up expenses. Instead, these expenses are treated according to general tax law.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are generally deductible under Greenlandic tax law. However, there are some limitations (_see Thin capitalisation in the section_).
## Bad debt
Companies can deduct losses on bad debt for Greenlandic tax purposes only to the extent the losses are realised. Note that there is a high threshold for when a loss is deemed to be realised.
An exception to this rule is that financial institutions shall deduct provisions for bad debt and guarantee liabilities in accordance with the accounting rules applicable to them. The same applies to mortgage institutions, but only if they are domiciled in Greenland.
## Charitable contributions
Contributions to charity are not deductible for Greenlandic tax purposes.
## Pension expenses
Pension expenses are deductible as operating expenses.
## Payments to directors
Payments to directors are deductible as operating expenses.
## Research and development (R&D) expenses
R&D expenses may be deductible or not, depending on whether they are deemed operating expenses or capital expenses.
## Bribes, kickbacks, and illegal payments
There is no published practice on the deductibility of bribes, kickbacks, return commissions, and the like. In Danish and Greenlandic practice, illegal payments are generally not deductible. Since 2008, any bribery payments, whether in or outside Greenland and whether towards a national or international authority, have been a criminal offence. Consequently, it may reasonably be inferred that no such payments are deductible.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are not deductible for Greenlandic tax purposes.
## Taxes
Income taxes are, in general, not deductible for corporate tax purposes. Excise duties are deductible.
## Other significant items
A highly unusual item is that dividends distributed are deductible in the hands of the distributing company. If a decision to distribute is made before the deadline for filing the income tax return (1 May) on the basis of the preceding year’s profits, the deduction may be carried back into the preceding year.
## Net operating losses
With effect from 1 January 2024, tax losses can be carried forward for ten years (previously five years), under the condition that the taxpayer, each year before the tax return deadline, submits a specification of the tax losses and a declaration that the taxpayer will keep all accounting material relevant for the tax losses until at least two years after the utilisation of the tax loss. The filing of the declaration and specification must be performed digitally, and the accounting material should be shared with the Greenland tax authorities no later than 60 days after a potential request hereof.
Oil and mineral licence holders can carry losses forward indefinitely.
Tax losses may not be carried back and utilised in previous income years.
Tax losses are forfeited at ‘significant’ change of ownership or, unusually, activity of the company. Dispensation is available. ‘Significant’ is interpreted as 30% of ownership rights.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
A Greenlandic corporation can claim a deduction for royalties, management fees, and similar payments made to foreign affiliates, provided that such amounts are made on an arm’s-length basis and reflect services received. Interest at normal commercial rates paid to foreign affiliates generally will be allowed as a deduction but is subject to thin capitalisation (_see Thin capitalisation in the section_).


# Greenland
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
Joint taxation is not possible in Greenland.
## Transfer pricing
Greenlandic transfer pricing rules apply to transactions between related parties (e.g. intra-group transactions). The rules apply when a company or person directly or indirectly owns more than 50% of the share capital or 50% of the voting rights in another company.
Companies are obligated to disclose in the annual tax return certain information regarding type and volume of intra-group transactions.
A new regulation has been issued on 17 October 2023, stating that certain companies must submit transfer pricing documentation within 60 days after the tax return deadline.
Whether the company is obligated to prepare and submit transfer pricing documentation depends on whether the controlled transactions reported in specific fields on the S40 form with the tax return exceed the threshold based on a special ’median value‘ calculation. The threshold for 2023 is DKK 500 million (DKK 250 million for 2024).
The threshold will be gradually reduced, and from 2030 all entities with controlled transactions, regardless of size, must submit transfer pricing documentation every year.
The Greenlandic transfer pricing rules also apply to transactions between Greenlandic group entities (no joint taxation in Greenland). 
## Thin capitalisation
Greenland limits interest deductions according to the thin capitalisation rule. Up to and including 2023, the rule works to disallow gross interest costs and capital losses on related-party debt to the extent the overall debt-to-equity ratio exceeds 2:1. With effect from the 2024 income year, the existing thin capitalisation rule (interest limitation) will be changed to a 4:1 debt-to-equity.
Related-party debt is defined so as to include external bank debt if group member companies or shareholders have provided guarantees to the bank. This rule does not apply if the controlled debt is less than DKK 5 million.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
According to the Greenlandic CFC rules, a Greenlandic company has to include in its taxable income the CFC income of a foreign subsidiary if all of the following criteria are met:
  * The Greenlandic company, alone or together with other group companies, individual owners, and/or their next of kin, controls the foreign company.
  * During the income year, the subsidiary’s financial assets, on average, make up more than 10% of the subsidiary’s total assets.
  * The foreign company is taxed ‘substantially lower’ than under Greenlandic taxation.


There is no black or white list that exempts subsidiaries resident in certain countries.
CFC income is defined in some detail and includes a broad spectrum of passive and financial income.


# Greenland
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
Greenlandic PEs of foreign companies, and taxable income connected to oil, gas, and mineral activities, are taxed under the same rules and rates as Greenlandic resident companies. There is no branch profits remittance tax or other similar tax on branch profits. As a branch is considered to be the same legal entity as the headquarters, interest paid from the branch to the headquarters is not tax deductible.
Unusually, if one foreign company has more than one location or PE in Greenland, these are treated as separate taxable entities with no possibility of consolidation.


# Greenland
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
There are no tax credits or tax incentives in Greenland in general. However, current oil licence holders do, in their surplus royalty basis, qualify for an extra deduction in their capital and operating expenditure of 21.75%, 29.25%, and 36.75%, respectively, plus the Danish discount rate, provided that the surplus royalty basis never has been positive. This is akin to the so-called ‘uplift’ known to other oil tax regimes.
Newer licences are subject to different royalty regimes, including different ‘uplift’ regimes. _Please refer to Oil companies in the section_.
It is also possible for mineral licence holders to get a tax holiday from the corporate tax. However, this is only possible if the corporate tax is replaced entirely by other forms of fiscal levies or duties that provide the Greenlandic government with at least the same income as the corporate tax would have done.
## Foreign tax credit
According to Greenlandic tax law, relief is generally available to credit foreign tax paid on non-Greenlandic source profits against the Greenlandic tax on the same profits. If relief is offered by treaty, the level of relief is capped at the level offered by the treaty. There are only treaty provisions to this effect with Canada, Denmark, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Norway.


# Greenland
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
Greenland has the following WHTs:
  * Dividends: 36% to 44%, depending on the local municipality (may be reduced by treaty). It should be noted that paid dividends are deductible in the corporate tax base. Dividend WHT is reduced to 24% if chapter 3b is elected.
  * Interest: From 1 January 2023, both accrued and paid interest is subject to 25% WHT if the interest is not subject to minimum 15% taxation at the recipient side (certain exceptions apply reducing the WHT to zero).
  * Royalties: 30% (may be reduced due to treaty reduction).


Treaty rates are as follows:
Recipient | WHT (%)  
---|---  
Dividends | Interest | Royalties  
Denmark | 35 (zero if chapter 3b)* | 0 | 10  
Faroe Islands | 35 (5% if chapter 3b)* | 0 | 25  
Iceland | 35 (5% if chapter 3b)* | 0 | 15  
Norway | 35 (5% if chapter 3b)* | 0 | 10  
* Participation thresholds apply.
## Limited international general anti-abuse
Greenland has introduced a limited international general anti-abuse rule whereby a taxpayer will not be granted the advantages of a DTT if it is reasonable to conclude, in light of all relevant circumstances, that granting this advantage is one of the principal aims of the arrangement or transaction, unless it is satisfied that granting the advantage in the concrete circumstances is in accordance with the content and purpose of the provision in question.

## United States (US) Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
In relation to the US FATCA, a Model 1 Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) is treated as 'in effect' by the US Treasury as of 29 June 2014. The United States and Greenland have reached an agreement in substance, and Greenland has consented to disclose this status. In accordance with this status, the text of such IGA has not been released, and financial institutions in Greenland are allowed to register on the FATCA registration website consistent with the treatment of having an IGA in effect, provided that the jurisdiction continues to demonstrate firm resolve to sign the IGA as soon as possible.


# Greenland
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
Taxable income is generally calculated as income determined for accounting purposes, which is adjusted and modified for several items as prescribed by the tax laws. One typical timing difference is depreciation.
## Inventory valuation
There are no formal rules about inventory valuation in Greenland. Generally, inventory is valued at acquisition cost according to a first in first out (FIFO) principle.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are subject to capital gains taxes. _See Capital gains taxes in the section for more information_.
## Dividend income
Income from dividends is generally included in taxable income. There is no relief, such as participation exemption or the like, meaning that any form of Greenlandic holding structure is generally inefficient. Dividends from foreign companies, however, are tax free, provided that the recipient holds at least 25% of the shares in the distributing company for at least one year.
### Exception regarding chapter 3b
For Greenlandic companies with activity within the industries of mineral resources, exploitation of water resources for energy production, and who have elected to be taxed under chapter 3b, the below special differences/treatments apply (note that the rules below do have certain aspects and conditions):
  * Dividends received from Greenland resident or non-Greenland subsidiaries are not taxable.
  * No deduction for dividend distribution (contrary to the existing unique rule in Greenland)(remains taxable if chapter 3b is not chosen).
  * Dividend WHT of 24% will apply on dividend distributions (42% to 44% if chapter 3b is not chosen). However, if the dividend recipient is also covered by chapter 3b, the WHT is zero unless the distributing Greenland company is a conduit company and the dividend comes from foreign subsidiary.


If a taxpayer decides to be taxed under chapter 3b, the taxpayer is bound to the chapter for at least five income years.
## Interest income
Interest income is generally included in taxable income.
## Rental income
Rental income is generally taxable in Greenland; however, rental income from real estate located outside of Greenland is not taxable.
## Royalty income
Royalty income is taxable in Greenland.
## Partnership income
Partnership income is treated similarly to other income. Partnerships are generally fiscally transparent.
## Unrealised gains/losses
Unrealised gains/losses are not taxable in Greenland. Greenland does not use a mark-to-market principle on capital gains.
## Stock transactions
Gains and losses on equity transactions are taxable.
## Foreign currency exchange gains/losses
Foreign exchange gains/losses are taxable in Greenland if realised; however, only foreign exchange gains/losses on receivables are taxable, not on debentures.
## Foreign income
Greenlandic companies are taxable to Greenland on their worldwide income, except for certain income relative to foreign real estate; consequently, income from foreign PEs is taxable to Greenland.
The income of a foreign subsidiary may be taxed in the hands of its Greenlandic parent company if the subsidiary constitutes a controlled foreign company (CFC). _See Controlled foreign companies (CFCs) in the section for more information_.


# Greenland
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
Greenlandic companies are taxable to Greenland on their worldwide income, except for income from real estate outside of Greenland, which is exempt. Non-resident companies are liable to tax in Greenland on business profits derived through a permanent establishment (PE) in Greenland. Further, non-resident companies are tax liable in Greenland for business profits derived in relation to the exploration for or exploitation of oil, gas, and minerals, regardless of the existence of a PE. Very few DTTs offer relief since Greenland only has full-fledged DTTs covering corporate tax with Denmark, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Norway.
The corporate tax rate is 25% for both Greenlandic and foreign companies from 1 January 2020.
From 1 January 2022, a company is able to pay on account tax to the Greenland tax authorities. This on account tax has to be paid before the end of the year for the present tax year. If the actual corporate tax exceeds the prepaid on account tax, there is a ‘surcharge’ of 6% of the corporate tax payable; consequently, the effective corporate tax rate is 26.5%. The tax with surcharge is due for payment on 1 November with final due date for payment on 20 November.
Oil and mineral licence holders are exempt from the 6% surcharge according to current practice.
There are certain industry-specific/special-tax regimes in Greenland regarding mineral resources, exploitation of water resources for energy production, and commercial exploitation of water and ice (voluntary chapter 3b). Furthermore, it is determined in all oil exploration licences that oil licensees pay a so-called ‘surplus royalty’ on top of the corporate tax.
## Oil companies
All companies with mineral exploration licences (current and future) are required to pay a government royalty as a condition for grant of a production licence. The royalty terms form part of the licence conditions and vary with the age of the licence.
On licences issued prior to 2014, oil companies pay a ‘surplus royalty’ of 7.5%, 17.5%, and 30%, which should be paid when the internal rate of return exceeds, respectively, 21.75%, 29.25%, and 36.75% plus the official Danish discount rate, and pay (‘carry’) the state-owned oil company’s 12.5% share of the costs (8% for licences in the ‘open door area’). Newer licences apply a gross royalty of 2.5% and a surplus royalty of 7.5%, 17.5%, and 30%, which should be paid when the accumulated turnover exceeds 35%, 45%, and 55%, respectively. Further, the state participation is reduced to 6.25% (carried).
Nonetheless, the model licence terms for upcoming rounds in Baffin Bay contain surplus royalty levels of 7.5%, 10%, and 12.5% at 35%, 45%, and 55% internal rates of return, respectively. In other words, royalty levels are likely to differ between licences and should therefore be scrutinised.
## Mining companies
The standard licence terms for mining licences also include provisions on royalties. The standard term gross royalties are 5.5% on gemstones, 5% on uranium and Rare Earth Elements (REE), and 2.5% on all other minerals (excluding oil & gas). Paid or due corporate taxes and dividend WHTs may generally be deducted in the calculation of royalties due, except for uranium licences and gemstone licences. For gemstone licences, there is an additional ‘surplus royalty’ imputed on gross profits exceeding 40%. Detailed provisions apply.
The concrete licence terms should always be consulted rather than the standard licence terms.
## Tax exemption for specific licensed purposes
Companies with a public licence to explore and utilise specific types of feedstock or natural resources (e.g. water or ice) or to produce hydroelectric energy may be tax exempt to the extent this follows from the relevant licence. The purpose of this is to allow for replacement of corporate taxes with other payments stipulated by a licence grant, such as turnover based royalties or other forms of payment. This system duplicates the system already in place for licences under, for example, the Natural Resources Act (_råstofloven_), which comprises the exploitation of oil, gas, and minerals.
## Local income taxes
There are no municipal or local corporate income taxes or similar charges in Greenland; however, WHT rates differ by municipality (_see the section_).


# Greenland
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
There is no VAT in Greenland.
## Import duties
There are no general import duties on operating equipment in Greenland. However, if present in Greenland for more than an eight-month period, operating equipment has to be declared to the Greenlandic tax authorities for statistical purposes. There are import duties on some assets, such as cars, etc.
There are also import duties on alcohol, cigarettes, food products, etc. The fares vary depending on the exact goods in question.
## Excise duties
There are Greenlandic excise duties on fishing of some fish species, alcohol produced in Greenland, lottery and gambling activities, motor vehicles, and various other excise taxes. The duties depend on the exact circumstances.
## Property taxes
There are no property taxes in Greenland.
## Stamp taxes
Stamp tax is payable on a few documents, such as a deed of transfer of real estate and ships (1.5% of the transfer sum), including on transfer of shares in companies that own ships.
## Capital gains taxes
There are capital gains taxes on receivables, equity instruments, real estate, financial contracts (derivatives), and depreciable assets, including oil, gas, and mineral licences. The tax rate is identical to the general corporate tax rate, effectively 31.8% (30% for oil, gas, and mineral licence holders).
Losses on financial instruments may only be deducted from gains on financial assets.
## Payroll taxes
Other than social security contributions (_see below_), no additional payroll taxes are applicable in Greenland.
## Social security contributions
Employers (not employees) are obligated to pay 1.1% (2.1% for the income year 2025) of all paid wages and salaries as social security contributions (AMA).
AMA is based on the monthly grossed-up salary, including fringe benefits, for each employee on the same scheme as income tax.
All Danish, Greenlandic, and Faroese employers are subject to Danish social security payments (ATP). This applies to both foreign and Danish employees. However, foreign employees are exempt unless they are working in Greenland for more than six months.
Foreign employers are exempt from ATP unless they employ Danish employees who are not residents in Greenland.
## Environmental taxes
In Greenland, environmental taxes are paid on mineral oil products, which in Greenland are used for the production of heat, electricity, and motor fuel.
