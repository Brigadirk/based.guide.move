The Dominican Republic follows a territorial concept for the determination of taxable income. Dominican-source income is subject to tax, while foreign-source income is generally not. However, residents are subject to taxation on foreign investments and financial gains. In the case of individuals who become residents, this foreign-source income is taxed only after the third year.

If salaries are paid outside local payroll, individuals shall file a personal tax return. The personal tax return is due 31 March of the year after the tax year-end.
## Payment of tax

Other non-business expenses are not deductible.

## Employment income
Broadly, the entire remuneration in cash for personal services rendered in the Dominican Republic is subject to income tax, except Christmas bonus, contributions to the social security system, severance, and pre-notice payments. Non-cash compensations given to officers or employees by companies (compensations in kind) are taxed at a rate of 27% (Fringe Benefit Tax or FBT), which is undertaken by the company. These compensations include car, housing, relocation allowances expenses, club memberships, etc. However, the calculation for the FBT on vehicles is different. The table shown below includes the percentages that should be taken into account.
Calculation of FBT on vehicles  
---  
Ownership of vehicle | Assigned to habitual working employee | Personal use (%) | Values subject to proportionality  
Employer or rented to third party | In the office | 40 | Depreciation or rent, fuel, insurance, etc.  
Employer or rented to third party | Outside the office | 20  
Employee | In the office | 20 | Fuel, repairs and maintenance, insurance, etc.  
Employee | Outside the office | 10
