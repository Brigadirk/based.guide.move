## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
According to the principle of territoriality, taxes on salaries are due in Lebanon if one of the following conditions is met:
  * The beneficiary of the salary is resident in Lebanon, regardless of the source of funding.
  * The services that triggered the income are executed on Lebanese territory or have contributed to the welfare of a company located in Lebanon, even though the source of funding is outside Lebanon.
  * The source of funding is in Lebanon, regardless of where the beneficiary resides or where the effort was made.


## Personal income tax rates
Personal income tax (PIT) is levied on wages and salaries at progressive rates. Based on the 2022 Budget Law, the brackets for the progressive payroll tax rates are between 2% and 25%, on annual payroll tax brackets between LL 18 million and LL 675 million instead of annual payroll tax brackets between LL 6 million and LL 225 million effective 1 January 2022. 
These rates are reduced to half for retirement pensions and similar benefits.
Moreover, as per the 2022 Budget Law, the annual progressive brackets for income tax profits is increased to become between LL 27 million and LL 675 million applicable starting 1 January 2022.
Furthermore, as per the 2024 Budget Law, the annual progressive brackets for income tax profits is increased to become between LL 540 million and LL 13.5 billion.
PIT is also levied on business income (e.g. sole proprietorships, general partnerships) at progressive rates. The annual progressive brackets for income tax profits became between 4% and 25%, instead of between 4% and 21%, as per Article 24 of Budget Law 2019, which amended Article 32 of the Income Tax Law. The new rates for income tax profits are applicable starting the year 2019. .
## Tax on capital gains and investment income
A new Law no. 64, dated 26 October 2017, introduced new tax measures related to the capital gains on disposal of real estate (not other types of fixed assets) that is taxed at 15% instead of 10% (not applicable for individuals on up to two principal residences and if owned more than 12 years).
The 2022 Budget Law imposed a transfer tax, 3% for resident individuals and 5% for non-resident individuals, on capital gains realised by individuals on the disposal of shares in companies in case the disposed shares are shares of one of the following joint stock companies:
  * Companies whose primary activity is the acquisition of built and unbuilt real estate properties;
  * Companies who engage in the trading and development of built and unbuilt real estate properties; or
  * Companies that have more than 50% of their fixed assets as real estate properties


The gain from the disposal is the difference between the cost of acquiring the share and the actual disposal price.
The individual shareholder benefits from a 50% discount on the tax due if the transfer of shares is between the shareholders themselves or within the parents/children. Individual shareholders benefit from a full exemption of the tax due when they dispose of their shares in the remaining joint stock companies.
Moreover, Decision no. 323 issued 15 May 2023, addressed the tax treatment of income from disposal of shares realised by an individual as follows: 
  * 10% Movable capital tax when the shares disposed of are shares of Lebanese or foreign Limited Liability Company
  * Income Tax at progressive rates when the disposal of shares represents a commercial transaction for the resident individual 
  * Exempt from tax when the shares disposed of are shares of foreign Joint Stock Company 
  * Exempt from tax when the shares disposed of are not part of any of the above mentioned scenarios


## Tax on interest
The tax applied on interest and revenues from saving accounts, bank deposits, credit accounts, fiduciary accounts, debt securities, and certificates of deposits has increased as per Law no. 144 of Budget Law 2019.
The tax on interest revenue is set at 7% since the issuance of Law no. 64, dated 26 October 2017.

As per the 2022 Budget Law nonresident tax will be due on a quarterly basis within 15 days from the end of each quarter instead of the annual submission done along with the income tax filing.
Moreover, as per the 2024 Budget Law, non-resident tax should be settled in the same currency as the payment made to the non-resident party. In addition, the Law amended the withholding tax rates to be 3.4% on goods and 8.5% on services. This amendment becomes effective starting Q2-FY24.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
## Taxable period
The fiscal year is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
### Income derived from personal business
The deadline for filing tax returns for those taxed on real profits is before 1 April of the following year. For those taxed on a fixed lump-sum basis, the deadline is before 1 February of the following year.
### Payroll tax
It is the employer's responsibility to declare the payroll tax to the authorities on a quarterly basis during the first 15 days of the month following the end of the quarter. An annual declaration is also due by 28 February of the following year.
### Tax on capital gains and investment income
Tax on moveable capital income is withheld at source by the relevant company or organisation and is to be declared within one month of the declaration of any dividends, interest, or share revenue, or after the maturity of interest on bonds.
If taxpayers fail to submit a tax return, realisation penalties will be due.
## Payment of tax
The same deadlines for tax returns apply for tax payments.
If taxpayers fail to make payment, late payment penalties will be due.
## Tax audit process
The most common ways for the tax authorities to select companies or individuals for tax audits are the size of the business, the type of business, and certain risk assessment measures.
Tax audits typically cover a single type of tax.
In a typical situation, a tax audit is likely to take less than one year from first information request to substantive resolution.
## Statute of limitations
The tax administration has four years to collect its rights. The period is calculated from the end of the year that follows the current business year.
The taxable person may request a refund of excess tax within four years starting from the end of the year where the refund right was created.
The tax administration can exceed the statute of limitations in cases where a profit or revenue has been proven by a court order, arbitration, or inheritance clearance. The extension is limited till the end of the calendar year following the end of the year in which the tax administration was notified of such event.
The statute of limitations as per the Lebanese Tax Procedures Law is five years (e.g. 2017 will expire on 31 December 2022). However, due to the economic and financial crisis, as well as the lockdowns enforced by the pandemic's spread, the Lebanese Parliament approved and issued several laws suspending certain legal/tax liabilities and deadlines. Such laws were supported by additional application instructions and decisions issued by the MoF. As such, the MoF circulated an internal memo where it highlighted the deadlines for statute of limitations calculation purposes taking into consideration the above-mentioned suspensions. Under the statute of limitations, a company should keep its accounting books and documentation for ten years.

  * Annual schooling allowance of a maximum total amount of LL 6 million and for a maximum of three children.


University tuitions that teachers are exempt from on behalf of their children are not subject to tax within certain limits, with no need to obtain approval from the Ministry of Labour.
Article 47 of Budget Law 2019, which amended Article 47 of the Income Tax Law, defined the exempt benefits from payroll tax. Below are the amended exemptions:
  * Pensions given to the military martyr’s heirs or the wounded as per Article 85 of the National Defense Law.
  * Payroll benefits granted to midwives working at hospitals.


Article 38 of Budget Law 2022 provided exemption from payroll tax of salaries of the employees who have been permanently disabled as a result of the Beirut Port explosion are exempt from payroll tax.

Limited partnerships are allowed the same deductions as those available to corporations.

## Individual - Other issues
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
## Lump sum license fee
A new Decision no. 993/1, dated 21 November 2016, relating to imposing an annual lump sum license fee was introduced. The annual lump sum license fee for individual taxpayers assessed based on real profit is LBP 550,000, for individual taxpayers assessed based on deemed profits is LBP 250,000, and for taxpayers assessed on assumed profits is LBP 50,000. The above-mentioned license fees apply to local head offices, branches, outlets, and to any place in which the taxpayer carries on its activity or receives customers. For income tax purposes, the lump sum license fee is considered as a non-deductible expense.
Decision No. 260/1, dated 31 May 2019, states that, as of FY 2021, the annual lump sum fee will be applicable for all taxpayers subject to income tax as per the above.
## Principal forms of doing business
Lebanon's commercial law provides for a range of business entities available to both local and foreign investors. These are:
  * Sole proprietorships.
  * General partnerships.
  * Limited partnerships.
  * Joint-stock companies (SAL).
  * Limited liability companies (SARL).
  * Holding companies.
  * Offshore companies.
  * Representative offices and branches of foreign companies.


Joint ventures are commonly used for specific projects in the construction industry and other sectors, but are not recognised as separate corporate entities under local laws.
Although local commercial law is based on the French model, no mechanism exists for an individual or legal entity to incorporate himself or itself. One-shareholder companies are not allowed. The use of nominee share holdings, on the other hand, is commonly accepted practice. Unless Lebanese shares nominees are used to circumvent minimum local shareholding requirements (in real estate for example), the authorities do not normally object to their use.
With only a few exceptions in areas such as commercial representation, real estate, insurance, and banking, foreign investors are allowed to own 100% in a Lebanese company. Investors may acquire shares of existing local firms or establish their own companies in Lebanon. Every legal entity established in Lebanon will be treated as a Lebanese company.
Legal structures commonly used by foreigners in conducting business in Lebanon are SAL, SARL, and branch offices.


# Lebanon
## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
Under the income tax law in Lebanon, tax is levied based on income type. Accordingly, the income tax law divides income into the following three categories:
  * Chapter I: Profits from industrial, commercial, and non-commercial professions.
  * Chapter II: Salaries and wages and pension salaries.
  * Chapter III: Revenues from moveable capital (chapter III mainly covers all types of dividend income, board member appropriations from profits, and interest income, including interest on bonds and treasury bills).


The income tax law does not deal with what is known as global tax on income, where a progressive tax is levied on the individual's income grouped from different sources. Accordingly, where a taxpayer has income from different sources, each type of income will be taxed according to the tax chapter it falls under.
## Employment income
Income tax is imposed on all salaries, wages, bonuses, allowances, life annuities, pension payments, and other benefits in cash and kind derived by employees.
Certain types of income, such as those received by certain diplomatic representatives and nursing staff, are exempt from income tax.
### Stock options
The tax treatment of employee stock option benefits is not directly addressed in the income tax law or in its explanatory memos. In general, the benefit is a salary related benefit and is subject to tax in Lebanon. The benefit will be subject to social security contributions if it meets the criteria of continuity, consistency, and collectivity. The time at which a charge to tax or social security contributions can arise is shown below:
  * Grant date: No income tax and no social security contributions.
  * Vesting date: No income tax and no social security contributions.
  * Exercise date: Income tax and social security contributions.
  * Sale date: Whether it is an exercise gain or a sale gain, it is subject to income tax.


## Moveable capital income
A WHT at a rate of 10% is levied on an income derived from moveable capital generated in Lebanon. Such taxable income is comprised of:
  * Distributed dividends, interest, and income from shares.
  * Directors' and shareholders' fees.
  * Distribution of reserves or profits.
  * Interest from loans to corporations.


Individuals are exempt from capital gains tax on the transfer of shares.
Decision no. 323, issued on 15 May 2023, stated that individuals are subject to 10% movable capital tax if they dispose of shares in Lebanese or foreign limited liability companies when the disposal of shares does not represent a commercial transaction for the seller.
In addition, Decision no. 322, issued on 15 May 2023, defined the application procedures of Article no. 87 of the Budget Law of 2022 related to tax on foreign movable capital income stating that taxes on income from foreign shares, bonds, and other foreign movable capital should be settled in foreign currency starting 15 November 2022.
## Business income
Any individual of Lebanese or foreign nationality may engage in a business activity as a sole proprietor or become a partner in an existing or newly formed partnership. Under Lebanese law, there are two distinct types of partnerships, general partnerships and limited partnerships.
Sole proprietorships and general partnerships are taxed at progressive rates. Article 24 of Budget Law 2019 amended Article 32 on the Income Tax Law related to the annual progressive brackets for income tax on profits to become 4% to 25% instead of 4% to 21%. These rates are applicable starting from the year 2019.
The 2022 Budget Law amended the annual progressive brackets for income tax profits applicable starting 1 January 2022.
Limited partnerships are taxed at a flat rate of 17%.

## Social security contributions
Social security contributions are the following:
  * Borne by the employer: 8% for the maternity and sickness benefit schemes, on a maximum base of LL 90 million (amounting to LL 7,200,000 as a maximum per month), and 6% for the family benefit schemes, on a maximum base of LL 12 million (amounting to LL 720,000 as a maximum per month), in addition to 8.5% of total annual earnings for the end-of-service indemnity, with no ceiling.
  * Borne by the employee: 3% for the medical scheme, on a maximum base of LL 90 million (amounting to LL 2,700,000 as a maximum per month).


Salaries of foreign staff are normally subject to all contributions, except those for the end-of-service indemnity fund. However, foreign employees do not receive the family allowance benefits nor do they benefit from the medical reimbursements.
On February 1, 2024, the NSSF issued Memorandum no. 740 whereby it set the exchange rate to be used for the conversion of the salaries paid in foreign currencies to the highest official exchange rate published by the Central Bank (currently LL 89,500/USD 1). 
In addition, starting March 2024, the Council of Ministers enacted Decree no. 12962 which increased the monthly ceiling amounts for sickness and maternity social security contributions to be 5 times the minimum monthly wage. 
The Ministry of Labour legislated a Decision no. 224, dated 12 July 2017, giving the right for the insured whose mandatory membership in the National Social Security Fund is terminated due to retirement (age 60 to 64) or due to permanent disability to benefit from the sickness and maternity scheme in accordance with the terms and conditions of the insured workers.
## Consumption taxes
### **Value-added tax (VAT)**
**Threshold for registration at the VAT department:**
Mandatory registration applies to importers and exporters regardless of their turnover, while voluntary registration applies to the taxable persons who achieve a turnover exceeding LL 100 million over a period of one to 4 consecutive quarters.
Those wishing to benefit from special cases of recovery of tax with regards to exempt transactions shall apply a classification request to the Directorate of Value Added Tax to obtain a registration number and open a tax account allowing the submission of the refund requests.
Classified taxpayers are entitled to submit the refund request starting from the tax period during which they were classified until 31 December, once a year within a period of 20 days from the end of the calendar year, provided that the total refunded VAT amount is not less than LL 50 million (as per the 2022 Budget Law). Any additional amount will be carried forward to next year. The amount less than LL 5 million is carried forward to the following year.
The standard VAT rate in Lebanon is 11%. Unless specifically exempt, VAT is levied on all commercial transactions undertaken by business entities. Export of goods and services and export-related services, international transport, and some of the intermediate operations are zero-rated. Banking, financial services, and insurance operations are exempt from VAT.
The activities performed by nurseries from VAT are now exempt from VAT as per Article 56 of Budget Law 2019.
Sales of yachts, other boats, and pleasure craft with a length of more than 15 metres belonging to non-Lebanese also benefit now from the VAT exemption as per Article 65 of Budget Law 2019. The article also included diesel oil as goods exempt from VAT.
According to the 2022 budget law, fuel, industrial equipment, raw materials used in manufacturing and agriculture are exempt from VAT until 31 December 2024. Solar power equipment used to generate electricity are also exempt from VAT from 15 November 2022 until 31 December 2023 .
Any person who independently provides taxable or zero-rated supplies in the course of an economic activity and has a turnover that exceeds LL 150 million over four successive quarters becomes liable for VAT registration.
On 27 April 2023, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) published Decree no. 11230 in the Official Gazette, whereby Article 18 of the VAT Law no. 7308, which states that VAT should be calculated following the official exchange rate, was replaced to mention that in instances where the price of the service or good is denominated in foreign currency, and until a unified exchange rate is set, the counter value of the foreign currency to be used for VAT calculation purposes should be Sayrafa rate. 
Subsequently, on 15 February 2024, the 2024 Budget Law was published in the Official Gazette which introduced the following amendments. 
  1. Any taxable person who achieves a total turnover in excess of LL 5 billion over a period of one to four consecutive quarters must register for VAT. 
  2. Taxable persons whose total turnover was between LL 100 million and LL 5 billion during any of the years 2020 to 2023, are no longer required to register for VAT, and may submit a request to deregister in case they have already registered for VAT. 
  3. Persons whose turnover didn’t reach the threshold for voluntary registration and who engaged in contracts with governmental institutions involving transactions subject to VAT or exempt with the right to deduct VAT, can apply for registration with the VAT department if their total turnover exceeds LL 5 billion over one to four consecutive quarters.
  4. Importers and exporters should register for VAT irrespective of their turnover.

There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Lebanon.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Estate and gift tax rates vary from 3% to 45%, depending on the amount received and the affinity to the deceased or donor after deducting special exemptions applicable to estate beneficiaries. These tax rates apply cumulatively to all gifts and inheritances made by a specific donor to a specific recipient.
Aids, grants and subsidies received from public funds as well as donations up to LL 14.4 million are exempt from all duties, unless the donee is a non-profit organisation, a sports association, educational, artistic or religious organisation, then the exemption should not exceed LL 900 million as per Article 57 of Budget Law 2022.

## Built property tax (BPT)
The BPT is an annual progressive tax, ranging between 4% and 14%, on built property.
The 2022 Budget Law amended the net income brackets subject to built property tax effective starting the year 2022. The brackets were further amended as per the 2024 Budget Law. 
## Registration taxes
When transferring ownership of real estate, registration fees of approximately 6% are applicable. As of 26 October 2017, a 2% fee is considered part of the registration fee and should be paid within 15 days from the date the contract was concluded. The real estate should be registered during one year; otherwise, the 2% paid will no longer be recoverable.
## Stamp duty
Two kinds of stamp duties are levied. A proportionate stamp duty of 0.4% is levied on all deeds and contracts (written or implied) that mention specific payments or other sums of money. A fixed stamp duty ranging between a minimum of LL 1,000 and a maximum of LL 2 million is applicable on documents in accordance with schedules appended to the stamp duty law.
The 2022 Budget Law amended the Stamp Duty Law to state that the fixed stamp duty due on invoices, receipts and debit and credit notes should be settled through monthly declarations within 15 days after the end of the month starting 1 January 2023. 
The Ministry of Finance issued Decision no. 684 on 23 November 2023 to clarify that the Sayrafa rate is the exchange rate that should be used to convert the value of contracts and deeds (and any other similar documentation) denominated in foreign currency into the local currency (LL) for the purpose of calculating the respective stamp duty.
The 2024 Budget Law amended the Stamp Duty Law to state that; provided the stamp duty fee does not exceed LL 3 billion, the duty can be processed by marking machines operated by authorised individuals. 
In addition, the 2024 Budget Law increased the fixed amount of stamp duty LL 100,000 on contracts that do not contain a specific amount and LL 20,000 on unpaid invoices.
