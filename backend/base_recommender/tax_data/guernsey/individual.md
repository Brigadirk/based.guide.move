## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 27 January 2025
Guernsey operates a flat 20% income tax rate for all individuals resident in Guernsey or deriving Guernsey-source income.
The 2025 Guernsey Budget introduced a number of changes in the field of personal taxation.
The personal allowance has been increased from 13,900.00 British pounds sterling (GBP) to GBP 14,600.00, and earners of more than GBP 82,500.00 will have their allowance reduced by GBP 1 for every GBP 5 exceeding this limit. This withdrawal of allowances has been extended beyond the personal allowance (_see the section_).
Interim assessments for individuals will now be issued prior to the commencement of the year of charge with instalment payments now due at each calendar quarter (i.e. 15 April, 15 July, 15 October, and 15 January). This is expected to come into effect from the 2024 calendar year.
Social security rates have been increased from 6.9% to 7.0% for the employer contribution and from 7.2% to 7.4% for the employee contribution. Self-employed contributions have been increased from 11.9% to 12.2%. Lower earnings limits have been increased to GBP 184.00 (weekly) and GBP 797.33 (monthly), and upper earnings limits for both employer and employee have been increased to GBP 3,627.00 (weekly) and GBP 15,717.00 (monthly).
Couples are no longer subject to joint taxation, and each individual is now required to be responsible for their own taxes, including filing tax returns and making any payments due.
## Tax return due dates
The Guernsey Revenue Service has decided to initiate steps to reinstate the original annual filing deadline of 30 November as follows:
  * Calendar year 2023: 31 January 2025
  * Calendar year 2024: 30 November 2025
  * Calendar year 2025 onwards: 30 November

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 27 January 2025
‘Principally resident’ and ‘solely resident’ individuals are both liable to Guernsey income tax on their worldwide income. ‘Resident only’ individuals are either taxed on their worldwide income or alternatively taxed on Guernsey-source income and can opt to pay a set charge of GBP 40,000 (GBP 30,000 prior to 2021) in respect of non-Guernsey source income and no additional liability will arise on this income in Guernsey.
The revised Guernsey-UK DTA (in force from 1 January 2020 in respect of Guernsey income tax) clarifies that an individual electing to pay the standard charge remains liable to Guernsey income tax on his or her worldwide income.
## Personal income tax rates
Tax is payable at the rate of 20% on net income after allowances (_see the section for a description of allowances_).
It is possible for a Guernsey resident individual to elect for a cap on their income tax liability. Elections can be made for a liability cap of GBP 160,000 to apply for an individual or couple on non-Guernsey-source income, and the liability cap can be increased to GBP 320,000 if an election is made for the cap to apply to an individual or couples' worldwide income.
Furthermore, an election for a liability cap of GBP 60,000 can be made for individuals who purchase open market property on the island in excess of GBP 1,500,000 in the year they take up permanent residence. The cap is applied to an individual or couples' worldwide income and is also available for the three consecutive years after the year of arrival.
An encashment of a pension fund (i.e. both triviality payments and lump sum payments that are over the annual tax‐free lump sum limit) that comprises Guernsey tax relieved pension contributions shall be excluded from the income tax cap from 1 January 2020.
The annual tax-free lump sum limit for pensions schemes has been maintained at GBP 203,000.

Self-employed and non-employment related income will receive interim assessments for the calendar year with instalment payments due by the 15th day after the end of the relevant quarter in the calendar year (i.e. 15 April, 15 July, 15 October, and 15 January). A balancing payment may be required to be paid within 30 days of receipt of a final assessment from the Guernsey Revenue Service.

Pension contributions to Guernsey-approved schemes are also deductible up to GBP 35,000 for contributions above GBP 2,500.
Unauthorised pension payments will now face a penalty charge of 50%, which would be an income tax levied against the individual who received the unauthorised payment.
