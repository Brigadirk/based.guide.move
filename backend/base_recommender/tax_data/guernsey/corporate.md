## Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Pillar Two
BEPS Pillar Two focuses on ensuring a minimum level of taxation and is centred around the following two rules:
  * The income inclusion rule (IIR) based around existing controlled foreign company (CFC) rule principles.
  * The undertaxed payments rule (UTPR), which acts as a backup to the IIR by making a top-up tax adjustment in relation to profits of a constituent entity that is not in scope of the IIR.


Together, the IIR and UTPR are known as the global anti-base erosion (GloBE) rules. They would apply to certain multinational enterprise (MNE) groups with 750 million euros (EUR) or more in annual revenues and would by necessity rely on a common tax base. In essence, the GloBE rules would provide jurisdictions with the right to ‘tax back’ up to an agreed minimum rate of tax, where other jurisdictions have not fully exercised their primary taxing rights.
Guernsey has approved legislation to implement the OECD’s Pillar Two rules, effective 1 January 2025. Guernsey has implemented the Qualified Domestic Top-up Tax (DTT) and the Multinational Top-up Tax (MTT) for the Qualified Income Inclusion Rule, following the GloBE Model Rules with some modifications. Applying the rules and determining the impact are likely to be very complex and pose a number of practical challenges. 
## Tax return due dates
The Guernsey Revenue Service has decided to initiate steps to reinstate the original annual filing deadline of 30 November as follows:
  * Year of charge 2023: 31 January 2025
  * Year of charge 2024: 30 November 2025
  * Year of charge 2025 onwards: 30 November

## Taxable period
The tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December, although companies can adopt a year-end of their choice.
Investment companies are now required to compute their income and file their tax returns on a calendar year basis and not accounting year-end basis.
## Tax returns
The Guernsey Revenue Service has decided to initiate steps to reinstate the original annual filing deadline of 30 November as follows:
  * Year of charge 2023: 31 January 2025
  * Year of charge 2024: 30 November 2025
  * Year of charge 2025 onwards: 30 November


It is compulsory for all Guernsey companies to file their tax returns online.
The format of the Guernsey income tax return was altered in respect of the accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019 to allow the incorporation of the Economic Substance Regulations. 
Companies are required to disclose where they are captured by the Regulations, in what capacity, and make several declarations as to whether and how they meet the substance requirements.
Should a company meet the conditions below, a simplified return may be filed without a computation.
In order to qualify for a simplified return, a company must have none of the following:
  * Guernsey employees (other than Directors).
  * Guernsey resident beneficial owners.
  * Income from utilities (e.g. Guernsey water or electricity companies).
  * Income from Guernsey properties.
  * Income generated from the licensed cultivation of cannabis plants, including income from the use of those plants for the production of products such as hemp, supplements, and cannabidiol.
  * Income from the licensed production of controlled drugs and their licensed usage.
  * Income from banking business (with the exception of bank interest), regulated fiduciary activity, licensed insurance business (with respect to domestic insurance business), provision of fund administration services to unconnected third parties, investment management services, licensed insurance intermediary business, licensed insurance manager business, operating an investment exchange under the Protection of Investors (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 1987, compliance and other related activities provided to regulated financial services businesses, or the activity of operating an aircraft registration service within the Bailiwick.
  * Loans to Guernsey participators.
  * Made a request under Section 62AB (1) of the Income Tax (Guernsey) Law, 1975 in relation to treating dividends received by the company as belonging to the company and not deemed to the beneficial members (individual shareholders) for tax purposes.


Should a company have Guernsey-resident individual beneficial members and/or make loans to participators, it will be required to submit quarterly returns accounting for distributions and loans advanced.
Partnerships have an annual filing requirement along with submission of financial statements.
## Payment of tax
The Guernsey Revenue Service issues interim assessments with tax payable in four instalments due by the 15th day after the end of the relevant quarter in the year of charge (i.e. 15 April, 15 July, 15 October, and 15 January). If liabilities have not been determined, this may necessitate initially raising estimated assessments based on prior year figures and raising a final assessment when the figures are agreed. Once the Revenue Service has received the company’s income tax return, they will issue an assessment detailing the final balancing income tax payment due. This amount will be due to be paid within 30 days of the issuing of the final assessment.
## Tax audit process
The Revenue Service will assess each company tax return as and when it is received, and the turnaround time from submission of a return to the issue of a final assessment varies dependent upon the workloads of the Revenue Service but is generally dealt with in around three months.
## Statute of limitations
The Director can raise an assessment in respect of any income that has not been assessed at any time no later than six years after the end of the year of charge in which the income arose.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Guernsey passed regulations requiring certain legal entities carrying on relevant activities to demonstrate the existence of adequate economic substance on the Island. The legislation came into force on 1 January 2019 and for partnerships from 1 January 2022 (though partnerships that were established on or after 1 July 2021 are in scope from the date of establishment). The Regulations require companies and partnerships that are tax resident and carry on relevant activities in Guernsey to demonstrate that they each have a substantive presence in Guernsey commensurate with their level of activities in Guernsey.


# Guernsey, Channel Islands
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 27 January 2025
All Guernsey-registered companies are regarded as tax resident on the island unless granted exempt company status. In addition, a company will be treated as a resident in Guernsey (regardless of where it is incorporated) if shareholder control is exercised by persons resident on the island.
From 1 January 2019, Guernsey amended the laws governing corporate residence to include a ‘central management and control’ element into the test of corporate residence. From 1 January 2019, a company is tax resident in Guernsey if:
  * it is controlled in Guernsey, or is centrally managed and controlled in Guernsey in that year of charge, or
  * it is incorporated in Guernsey and has not been granted tax-exempt status.


An exception is granted where the company can demonstrate that it satisfies the following conditions, in which case, it will not be considered resident even if it is incorporated or controlled in Guernsey:
  * the company is tax resident in another jurisdiction under its domestic law
  * the company is centrally managed and controlled in this jurisdiction, and
  * either: 
    * the company is tax resident in this jurisdiction by reason of a double taxation treaty (DTT) where a tie-breaker clause applies, or
    * the highest rate of tax on a company in this jurisdiction is at least 10%.


The company must also show that its residency status in the overseas jurisdiction is not motivated by the avoidance, reduction, or deferral of the liability of any person to tax.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The Income Tax (Guernsey) Law, 1975 defines PE as including:
  * a branch
  * a factory, shop, workshop, quarry, or building site, or
  * a place of management.


Note that the fact that a body’s directors regularly meet at a particular place does not, in itself, make that place a PE of that body.


# Guernsey, Channel Islands
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 27 January 2025
Normally, business deductions are allowed if they are incurred wholly, exclusively, and necessarily for the purpose of the business.
## Depreciation

Assets | Basis | Rate (%)  
---|---|---  
Buildings:  
Stone, brick, concrete, or other substantial structures | Reducing-balance | 1.25  
Buildings of a less substantial construction | Reducing-balance | 5

Machinery and plant | Reducing-balance | 20  
Glasshouses:  
Expenditure in respect of initial allowance* | Straight-line | 10  
* Section 123 (3) of the Law defines expenditure and circumstances on which initial allowances can be claimed in respect of glasshouses.
## Goodwill
The amortisation of goodwill is not a deductible expense in Guernsey.
## Start-up expenses
Pre-trading expenditure incurred within the 12 months prior to the commencement of trade, which would have been allowable had it occurred on the first day of trading, may be allowed as a deduction in computing the profits of the first accounting period.
## Interest expenses
Interest is a deductible expense where it is incurred wholly, exclusively, and necessarily for the purposes of the business.
## Bad debt
Bad and doubtful debts discovered in the accounting period to have become bad or irrecoverable may be deducted from taxable profits, but the deduction may not exceed the amount written off as such in the books of the business.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable donations by companies are not deductible for Guernsey income tax purposes.
## Fines and penalties
Fines or penalties incurred are not deductible for Guernsey income tax purposes.
## Taxes
Income tax paid is not deductible in computing taxable income.
## Net operating losses
Losses from one class of income may be used to offset the profits from another class of income if both classes are subject to tax at the same rate. Unrelieved trading losses may be carried forward to offset future trading income.
Upon cessation of trade, operating losses arising from balancing allowances may be carried back to the previous two years of charge to be relieved against past trading profits.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Guernsey-source royalties and long-term interest are subject to taxation at source. Relief is obtained by the retention of the tax deducted. Short-term interest, unless owed to an authorised bank, is not deductible, unless the advance in respect of which it is paid is used wholly and exclusively for the purposes of trade. Other fees must be paid on an arm’s-length basis.


# Guernsey, Channel Islands
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 27 January 2025
Group loss relief may be claimed when both companies are members of the same group and the companies are either carrying on business in Guernsey through a PE or incorporated in Guernsey. Loss relief is available only against income taxed at the same rate.
A claim for group loss relief must be made by the claimant company within two years after the end of the calendar year in which the relevant accounting period ended, and the claim must be accompanied by a declaration by the surrendering company that it consents to the surrender.
## Transfer pricing
Guernsey does not currently have specific transfer pricing legislation in place. However, the general anti-avoidance provisions do apply.
## Country-by-country reporting (CbCR)
Guernsey has formally committed to the OECD model of CbCR and has already put in place the relevant implementing regulations for entities with accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2016. In addition, Guernsey has signed up to the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) to assist with the sharing of relevant information in relation to CbCR, as well as broadly adopting the OECD’s CbCR implementation package, to facilitate its implementation of this BEPS minimum standard.
Multinationals having global revenues of EUR 750 million or more are required to file annual reports to tax authorities at three levels. The first element (which taxpayers are generally required to provide for fiscal 2016) is a ‘country-by-country report’ that gives a detailed picture of business results for each country where the business operates (including things like number of employees, revenues, pre-tax profit, and taxes paid). Companies will also need to give an overall picture of their global business, aggregating data from all of the countries where one operates. In addition, companies will be required to report separately to each country where they operate with business and tax information about the local entities and operations in that country.
The disclosure of this business information will be accessible, through automatic information exchanges, to tax authorities wherever they have a presence (subject to certain conditions). Groups will need to consider how to explain their operational purpose of business arrangements, which may include tax advantages.
The deadline for submission of the CbCR report to the Guernsey tax authority is within 12 months of the end of the accounting period to which it relates.
Where there is no reporting obligation, there is a requirement to notify the Director of Revenue Service of the name of the entity that is undertaking the reporting and to provide certain other information. An entity must notify the Director by 30 November in the year following the last day of the accounting period if it is a constituent entity.
## Thin capitalisation
Guernsey does not currently have specific thin capitalisation legislation in place. However, the general anti-avoidance provisions do apply.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Guernsey does not currently have specific anti-avoidance legislation in relation to CFCs. However, the general anti-avoidance provisions do apply.


# Guernsey, Channel Islands
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 27 January 2025
Branch income is taxed in the same manner as companies, at the appropriate rate according to the activity being undertaken.
No further tax is withheld on the transfer of profits abroad to group companies, provided no Guernsey-resident individual has an interest in the company.


# Guernsey, Channel Islands
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 27 January 2025
In view of the low rate of tax, no special incentives are available to local businesses in Guernsey.
## Foreign tax credit
Guernsey has signed full double taxation treaties (DTTs) with Cyprus, Estonia, Hong Kong, Isle of Man, Jersey, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Mauritius, Monaco, Qatar, Seychelles, Singapore, and the United Kingdom and tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs) with 61 jurisdictions. Guernsey entered into a DTT with Bahrain on 29 September 2024. However, the agreement has not yet come into effect.
If no bilateral agreement exists, relief available to Guernsey-resident companies is the lesser of the other territory’s effective rate or three quarters of the Guernsey effective rate.


# Guernsey, Channel Islands
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 27 January 2025
Companies paying dividends to Guernsey resident individuals are required to deduct or account for the difference between the tax incurred by the company and the shareholder’s individual tax rate (20%) on actual distributions.
A company is required to withhold tax when it is acting as an agent and making payments to a non-resident liable to Guernsey tax.
Guernsey does not levy any other forms of withholding tax (WHT).
## Double taxation treaties (DTTs)
The table below sets out the rates of WHT applicable to the most common payments of dividends and interest under Guernsey domestic law where such a liability arises and the reduced rates that may be available under an applicable DTT. Please refer to specific treaties to ensure the values are up to date.
Recipient | WHT (%)  
---|---  
Dividends | Interest  
Resident corporations | 0 (1) | 0 (1)  
Resident individuals | 0/10/20 (2) | 0 (3)  
Non-resident corporations and individuals:  
Non-treaty | 0 | 0  
Treaty (4):  
Bahrain (5) | 0 | 0  
Cyprus | 0 | 0  
Hong Kong | 0 | 0  
Isle of Man | 0 | 0  
Jersey | 0 | 0  
Liechtenstein | 0 | 0  
Luxembourg | 0/5/15 (6) | 0  
Malta | 0 | 0  
Mauritius | 0 | 0  
Monaco | 0 | 0  
Qatar | 0 | 0  
Seychelles | 0 | 0  
Singapore | 0 | 0  
United Kingdom | N/A (7) | N/A (7)  
Notes
  1. Resident corporations receiving dividends and interest are not subject to any WHT.
  2. For resident individuals, if the income has been taxed on the paying company at 0%, a 20% deduction should be made. If the income has been taxed on the paying company at 10%, 10% WHT should be applied. If the income has been taxed on the paying company at 20%, there should be no deduction at source.
  3. Resident individuals are paid interest gross, without any WHT; however, individuals are required to file an annual tax return and pay 20% income tax on any interest received.
  4. Where a reduced rate of withholding is allowed by any treaty, whether on dividends or interest, it is usual for this reduced rate to be stated not to apply to amounts that are in excess of a normal commercial rate of interest, or where the dividend or interest is effectively connected to a PE in Guernsey of the recipient; such general limitations are not specifically indicated in the table. Moreover, note the general requirement for dividends and/or interest to be beneficially owned by the recipient in order to access benefits under a treaty.
  5. The DTT with Bahrain was signed on 29 September 2024 but is not yet in force.
  6. Dividends paid by a company that is a resident of Guernsey to a resident of Luxembourg may be taxed in Luxembourg. However, such dividends may also be taxed in Guernsey, and if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of Luxembourg, the tax charged may not exceed 5% of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company that directly holds at least 10% of the capital of the company paying the dividends or 15% of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.
  7. The Explanatory Note to the Guernsey-United Kingdom DTT specifically excludes dividends and interest from the scope of the DTT.

## Economic substance
The economic substance requirements apply to companies from 1 January 2019. Effective 1 July 2021 and 1 January 2022, the economic substance rules also apply for new partnerships and existing partnerships, respectively. A body, which is defined as a partnership or company, is subject to the Guernsey economic substance requirements if it is Guernsey tax resident, undertakes a relevant activity, and has gross income during an accounting period from that activity. The relevant activities are as follows:
  * Banking.
  * Insurance.
  * Fund management.
  * Financing and leasing.
  * Headquartering.
  * Shipping.
  * Distribution and service centres.
  * Pure equity holding companies.
  * Intellectual property holding business (i.e. IP company).


Please note that regulated Collective Investment Vehicles (CIVs) are in scope of the economic substance requirements if they meet the self-managed conditions.
## US-Guernsey intergovernmental agreement (IGA)
On 13 December 2013, Guernsey signed an IGA regarding the implementation of Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). The IGA has been ratified by Guernsey's Parliament and is embodied in The Income Tax (Approved International Agreements) (Implementation) (United Kingdom and United States of America) Regulations 2014. Its operative provisions came into force from 30 June 2014.
## UK-Guernsey IGA
On 22 October 2013, Guernsey signed a FATCA-style IGA with the United Kingdom (UK-Guernsey IGA) under which mandatory disclosure requirements may be imposed in respect of ‘Investors in the Fund’ who are UK resident or who are non-UK entities controlled by one or more UK resident individuals, unless a relevant exemption applies. The UK-Guernsey IGA has been ratified by Guernsey's Parliament and is embodied in The Income Tax (Approved International Agreements) (Implementation) (United Kingdom and United States of America) Regulations 2014. Its operative provisions came into force from 30 June 2014.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
Guernsey adopted global CRS on Automatic Exchange of Information on 1 January 2016. The first reporting took place in 2017.
## Mandatory Disclosure Regime (MDR)
On 11 March 2020, The government of Guernsey passed legislation introducing the MDR aligned to the OECD Model Mandatory Disclosure Rules for CRS Avoidance Arrangements and Opaque Offshore Structures.
At the time of writing, although the law had been made, it had yet to be brought into force.
Once in force, the law will require promoters, service providers, and, in some circumstance, users of CRS avoidance arrangements and opaque offshore structures to provide the Director of the Revenue Service with information about those arrangements and structures within a 30-day window of, broadly, the arrangement being made available.
It is intended that information relating to users resident in other jurisdictions will be exchanged with the tax authority of that jurisdiction in accordance with the terms of the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on the automatic exchange regarding CRS avoidance arrangements and opaque offshore structures, also ratified by the States of Guernsey on 11 March 2020.
## OECD's Inclusive Framework
The OECD has been working on a global solution to reform the international corporate tax framework, which will affect how large multinational enterprises are taxed around the world.
That framework is based on two broad work streams: Pillar One is essentially a proposal for partial re-allocation of taxing rights and Pillar Two proposes that large multinational enterprises will pay a minimum effective rate of tax of 15% on their profits.
Guernsey has approved legislation to implement the OECD’s Pillar Two rules, effective 1 January 2025. Guernsey has implemented the Qualified Domestic Top-up Tax (DTT) and the Multinational Top-up Tax (MTT) for the Qualified Income Inclusion Rule, following the GloBE Model Rules with some modifications. Applying the rules and determining the impact are likely to be very complex and pose a number of practical challenges. Entities that have to pay a top-up tax (whether MTT or DTT) need to consider whether these additional taxes impact the recognition and measurement of their deferred tax assets and liabilities. In addition, entities will need to consider the disclosure implications as there will be a need to make disclosures in advance of the rules becoming effective. Where entities are still evaluating the impact of the rules, a statement to that effect is required. Management will need to be able to support any statement that Pillar Two will not have a material impact, and we would expect the impact assessments to be complete if this is being asserted.

## Inventory valuation
Inventory is valued at the lower of historical cost or net realisable value. Use of last in first out (LIFO) is not permitted. Generally, there are no material differences between accounts prepared on a normal accounting basis and those prepared on a tax basis.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are not subject to tax in Guernsey.
## Dividend income
All dividends paid by a standard tax-paying company (0%) are deemed to have been paid from income arising after 31 December 2007 (i.e. after the introduction of the zero/ten tax regime), unless the company elects to have them treated otherwise.
### Stock dividends
Stock dividends may be treated as income.
## Interest income
Interest received from a Guernsey bank is taxable at 0%.
Interest income received by a standard tax-paying company is taxable at 0%.
_Please refer to the section for further information on companies liable to tax at the company intermediate rate (10%)_.  _Please also note our comments in the section._
## Royalty income
Royalty income is treated as income for corporate income tax purposes. Any royalty income received by a standard-tax paying company is taxable at 0%.
## Foreign income
Resident corporations are liable to tax on their worldwide income. Income tax is levied on foreign branch income when earned, and on investment income from foreign dividends, interest, rents, and royalties. Double taxation is mitigated either through unilateral relief (by giving credit for foreign taxation of up to three-quarters of the effective Guernsey rate) or by treaty relief.


# Guernsey, Channel Islands
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 27 January 2025
Resident corporations are liable to tax on their worldwide income. Non-resident corporations are subject to Guernsey tax on their Guernsey-source income.
Companies pay income tax at the current standard rate of 0% on taxable income; however, income derived from certain businesses may be taxable at a 10% or 20% rate.
Income derived from the following business is taxable at 10%:
  * Banking business.
  * Domestic insurance business.
  * Insurance intermediary business.
  * Insurance management business.
  * Custody services business.
  * Licensed fund administration business.
  * Regulated fiduciary activities.
  * Regulated investment management services to individual clients (excluding collective investment schemes).
  * Operating an investment exchange.
  * Compliance and other related activities provided to regulated financial services businesses.
  * Operating an aircraft registry.


'Banking business' is broadly defined as income that arises as a result of the provision of credit facilities by any type of company and the utilisation of customer deposits. Income derived from licensed fiduciaries (with regulated activities), licensed insurers (in respect of domestic business), licensed insurance intermediaries, and licensed insurance managers is also taxable at 10%.
Income derived from the exploitation of property located in Guernsey or received by a publicly regulated utility company is subject to tax at a higher rate of 20%. In addition, income from retail businesses carried on in Guernsey where taxable profits exceed 500,000 British pounds sterling (GBP) and income derived from the importation and/or supply of hydrocarbon oil and gas are also taxed at 20%.
Finally, income derived from the cultivation of cannabis plants and income from the use of those cultivated cannabis plants or parts of those cultivated cannabis plants or licensed production of controlled drugs is taxable at 20%.
## Exempt bodies
Certain collective investment schemes (CISs), unit trusts, and partnerships may qualify for exempt status, which will place them completely outside the Guernsey tax regime (though please note the Economic Substance Regulations in Guernsey may apply to certain bodies with exempt status). In addition, anybody that forms part of, or contributes to, the overall structure of a CIS may claim exempt status. This removes doubt in relation to the entities that are involved in the management or support of a CIS qualifying for exempt status. For each year for which exempt status is sought, a charge of GBP 1,600 is levied.
One of the following conditions, among others, must be met for the body to be considered exempt:
  * The body is beneficially owned outside of Guernsey.
  * No Guernsey-resident individual or company has a beneficial interest in the body (with the exception of shareholders, loan creditors, or nominees/trustees).


## Loans to participators
If a company makes loans with preferential terms to an individual or entity connected with the company, this will be deemed to be income in the hands of the debtor, and the creditor company will be required to account for, withhold, and pay the tax. Certain exemptions apply.
## Local income taxes
Guernsey does not operate any local government taxes.

Last reviewed - 27 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
Guernsey does not currently operate a VAT or goods and service tax (GST). However, a proposal to introduce GST from 2027 was included in the 2025 Budget.
## Customs and excise duties
In accordance with the European Community (EC) Customs Code and the Implementing Regulation, Customs Import Duty is liable on all goods arriving in the Customs territory of the Community. The rates of duty are set by the European Community and are the same in all countries of the European Community.
The rates vary according to the commodity. Some may be as high as 22%, while, for other goods, the rate may be free.
The Channel Islands are not within the fiscal territory of the European Union (EU), and, as such, the Community Regulations that concern excise duties do not apply. Excise duty is classed as an internal tax.
The rates are reviewed annually by the States of Guernsey and set at budget time, which is usually in November. These cover Guernsey and Alderney, while Sark has its own rates set by the Chief Pleas.
An additional 15% rate of duty is applicable on some goods originating in the United States (US).
## Property taxes
Income from Guernsey land and buildings is subject to Guernsey income tax at 20%. No other property taxes apply.
## Transfer taxes
Guernsey does not levy transfer taxes.
## Document duty
Document duty is payable in respect of ‘chargeable transactions’ of real property in Guernsey.
Document duty is paid on a graduated-rates basis and ranges from 2.25% to 5.5%. This is applied depending on the value of transfers in interests in Guernsey property conveyed and on the registration of bonds securing loans on real property.
For 2024, a down-sizing incentive has been introduced to charge 0% document duty on the first GBP 400,000 of a replacement principal private residence, subject to meeting certain conditions. This is expected to end on 31 December 2024.
In addition, an additional document duty of 2% on each bank will be charged on all residential properties that are not the principal private residence of the purchaser or a family member.
Document duty may also apply in respect of the transfer of shares in which the underlying company holds Guernsey situs real property.
Document duty is payable by the purchaser of the real property.
There are several exemptions available for certain categories of transactions. Please contact a member of the PwC Guernsey Tax Team for further advice.
## Stamp taxes
Guernsey does not levy any stamp duties.
## Payroll taxes
The Employee Tax Instalment (ETI) Scheme is a scheme whereby the employer deducts income tax from its employees and pays this over to the Guernsey Income Tax Office.
The ETI Scheme applies to all employees. For the purposes of the ETI scheme, an employee is an individual holding or exercising an office or employment, including a company director, part-time workers, casual workers, and sub-contractors.
The ETI Scheme operates on a quarterly basis. Throughout each quarter, the employer should deduct tax from their employees on each payday. Details of the gross weekly or monthly wage and deductions made must be recorded and returned with the relevant remittance by the 15th day of the month following the end of the relevant quarter (e.g. tax deducted during the first quarter needs to be submitted by 15 April).
## Social security contributions
An employer, for the purposes of Social Insurance, is anyone who has employees. An employee is anyone who is gainfully occupied in employment under a contract of service in Guernsey or Alderney.
In general, contributions are required from both employer and employee in respect of any employed person who is over school-leaving age and under 65. Social security contributions are levied on the gross employment income of the employee at 7.0% for the employer and 7.4% for the employees from 1 January 2025.
Employer social security contributions for 2025 are calculated on a monthly lower earnings limit of GBP 797.33, which is the level of earnings at which an employer becomes liable for the payment of contributions. The upper limit for 2025, which is the highest level of earnings on which contributions are calculated, is GBP 15,717 per month.
