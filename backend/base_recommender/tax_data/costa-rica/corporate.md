**Use of Electronic Receipts:**
In Costa Rica, the implementation of electronic invoicing systems began in 2017 however, its massive adoption occurred in 2018, as of then, taxpayers that carry out lucrative activities in Costa Rica are required to issue an electronic receipt that supports the sale or acquisition of goods and the rendering of services; that said, taxpayers that are part of the Simplified Tax regime are not under the obligation to issue electronic receipts even though they could voluntarily choose to issue receipts if they wanted to do so.
Electronic receipts must comply with a series of requirements and technical specifications based on the law and current regulations; version 4.4 of the document “Technical Specifications and Format of the structures of the Electronic Receipts”, is the most updated and will become effective as of June 1, 2025.
The Regulations of Electronic Vouchers for Tax Purposes govern the aspects related to electronic vouchers, this regulatory body also contemplates some exceptions, so that the following are not under the obligation to issue electronic vouchers:
  * The State (including autonomous and non-autonomous institutions that by special law enjoy exception), municipalities and public universities.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 15 January 2025
## Taxable period
The fiscal period matches the calendar year, but there are special cases in which the taxpayer may request the approval of a fiscal period different than the calendar year.
## Tax returns
The general rule is that all companies must file the tax return two and a half months after its fiscal closing.
The tax system is one of self-assessment with occasional audits by the Tax Administration.
## Payment of tax
Taxpayers are required to make partial payments on account of income tax in each fiscal period, in accordance with the following general rules:
  * The basis for calculating instalments is the tax determined in the immediately preceding year, or the arithmetic average of the last three fiscal periods, whichever is greater. In the case of taxpayers who, for any reason, have not declared in the three previous fiscal periods, the basis for calculating the partial payment quotas will be determined using the declarations that they have submitted and, if it is the first, by a well-founded estimate that they must provide to the Tax Administration.
  * 75% of the amount of the determined payment on account must be divided into three equal instalments, which must be paid successively no later than the last business day of the months of June, September, and December of each year (considering that the recently modified ordinary fiscal period is equal to the calendar year from January 1 to December 31).
  * From the total tax that is paid when submitting the affidavit, the instalments corresponding to that fiscal period must be deducted. The resulting balance must be paid within two months and 15 calendar days following the end of the respective fiscal period.


## Tax audit process
For a tax audit to begin, it is necessary that the Tax Administration send a notification to the taxpayer to be audited. The taxpayer is selected according to one of the selection criteria previously established, and this should be indicated in the communication at the beginning of the tax audit. The Tax Administration must start the audit within two months of the communication to the taxpayer.
Once the audit is completed, the auditors hold a meeting with the company and invite them to correct the issues found.
If the company does not accept the correction, it can start the described procedure and pay the respective tax until that procedure has finished along with the corresponding interest.
## Statute of limitations
The action of the Tax Administration to determine a tax liability will be under the statute of limitations of four years. The same term is valid to demand the payment of the tax and its interests.
The aforementioned term is extended to ten years for taxpayers non-registered with the Tax Administration, those that are registered but have filed returns qualified as fraudulent, or those that have failed to file the tax return.
The term of the statute of limitations should be counted as of the first day of the month following the date when the tax should be paid.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Important topics for tax audits are transfer pricing, sales tax credits, gross margin on sales, employee benefits, and income tax.


# Costa Rica
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 15 January 2025
In most cases, the place where a company is incorporated is regarded by Costa Rican authorities as the corporate residence.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
According to Costa Rica's tax system, a PE is understood as any fixed site or place of business where the activity of the non-domiciled person is carried out, totally or partially.
The following are considered PEs:
  * Administrative centres.
  * Branches.
  * Agencies.
  * Offices.
  * Factories.
  * Workshops.
  * Mines, quarries, and any other place of extraction of natural resources.


A PE also includes:
  * The works, a construction, or an installation or assembly project, or inspection activities related to them, but only when such works, project, or activities continue for a period or periods that total or exceed, in total, more than 183 days in any 12-month period that begins or ends during the fiscal year considered.
  * The provision of services by a company, including the services of consultants, through its employees or other personnel hired by the company for that purpose, but only in the event that activities of that nature continue (in relation to the project or with a related project) during a period or periods that total or exceed in total more than 183 days in any 12-month period that begins or ends during the fiscal year considered.


The Tax Administration also applies the criteria of the Organisation for Economic and Co-operation and Development (OECD) to determine when an entity can be considered a PE of a company in a determined state. Accordingly, the Tax Administration takes into consideration the following conditions to determine the existence of a PE:
  * The existence of a business centre (i.e. facilities such as an office or business centre or, in certain cases, machinery).
  * Said business centre must be permanent (i.e. must be established in a determined place with a significant level of permanence).
  * The company must develop its essential activity through this permanent centre (i.e. the persons who depend in a way or another on the company [the staff] must develop the company's business inside the country on which the permanent centre is located).


Note that the Costa Rican Tax Administration uses these OECD criteria to support and base its administrative resolutions; consequently, they hold a significant importance for the Costa Rican tax system. Regarding these criteria, the OECD has established as a generally accepted principle that a company will be treated as the owner of a PE in a determined state if a person acts on behalf of that company under certain circumstances, even if they are not in the presence of a permanent business centre in said state. These circumstances are as follows:
  * The person must be an agent on behalf of the non-domiciled company: A dependent agent, individual, or company, under an employment regime or outside of this, that, due to the nature of its activities or to the scope of its faculties, involves the non-domiciled company in commercial activities of certain significance.
  * The person or local company must be a dependent agent with enough faculties to celebrate and subscribe agreements on behalf of the non-domiciled company. The faculties of the person or local company must be sufficient to involve the non-domiciled company in business activities inside the country on which the person or local company are situated.
  * The agent must be authorised to negotiate all elements and details of agreements on which the non-domiciled company is involved and obligated, even if said agreement is signed by another person in the country on which the non-domiciled company is located. In other words, it isn't simply a mere authorisation to sign the agreement.
  * The faculty to subscribe agreements must include those agreements that are part of the main commercial activity of the company.
  * The agent must take risks on behalf of the abroad domiciled company.
  * The agent must act according to detailed instructions or general control of the abroad domiciled company.
  * The concept of PE under this context implies that this agent uses its authority on a repeated basis and not only on isolated cases. The faculties must be exercised regularly in the country on which the agent is located, a characteristic that is determined according to the real commercial situation. A person or company whose activities are limited to the following conditions and circumstances does not form a PE: 
    * Its activities consist only in storage, expose, or delivery of goods and merchandise that belong to the company domiciled in another country.
    * Its activity consists only in purchase of goods or merchandise or compiling information for the abroad domiciled company.
    * Its activity consists only in developing any other auxiliary or preparatory activity for the company.
  * To consider a person as a PE of a company in a state, it must be determined if the activities that this person develops are, by themselves, an essential and significant part of the activities of the company as a whole, which is why every case must be studied and analysed according to its own particular circumstances.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 15 January 2025
In general, any costs and expenses that are useful, necessary, and pertinent to produce actual or potentially taxable income will be deductible from the company's gross income, as long as they are duly supported by documentation authorised by the law and they comply with the following requirements:
  * They are necessary expenses to obtain actual or potential income, taxed under the law.
  * Any withholding obligations, as stated in other sections of the law, have been carried out.
  * The supporting documentation is authorised by the Tax Administration.


However, the Tax Administration may reject or disregard the expense or cost, in whole or in part, if it is considered as excessive, inadmissible, or not indispensable to obtain taxable income.
## Depreciation
The straight-line and sum-of-the-years-digits methods of depreciation are allowed over the following useful lives:
**Assets** |  **Useful life (years)**  
---|---  
Buildings |  50  
Machinery and equipment |  10  
Furniture and fixtures |  10  
Vehicles |  10  
Agricultural plantations |  2 to 10  
The Tax Administration, at the request of the taxpayer, can adopt technically acceptable special depreciation methods in cases duly justified by the taxpayer. In addition, the Tax Administration can authorise, through general resolution, accelerated depreciation methods on new assets acquired by corporations with monetary activities requiring constant technological updates, higher installed production capacity, and productive reconversion processes in order to maintain and strengthen their competitive advantage.
## Goodwill
From an income tax perspective, the CIT Law states that goodwill is considered as a non-deductible expense.
## Start-up expenses
A company’s organisational expenses may be deducted in the tax year in which they are paid or credited, or, if they accumulate, in five consecutive tax years, starting from the date of start of productive operations, until the balance is exhausted.
Organisational expenses are those costs and expenses that are necessary to initiate the production of taxable income that, in accordance with the law, are deducted from gross income.
## Interest expenses
Interest and other financial expenses paid or incurred by the taxpayer during the fiscal year directly related to the management of their business and the creation of taxable income are deductible from gross income if those interest expenses are not capitalised.
Note that those interest expenses with rates that exceed the usual market rates will not be considered deductible expenses by the Tax Administration.
The Law on Strengthening Public Finances, Law number 9635 establishes a limit on the deduction of non-bank interest; said deduction is 20% of the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) for each tax period. 
There is a temporary provision stating that, for the first year, the above-mentioned limit will be 30%, decreasing 2% each year until it reaches the 20% ultimate floor. The deductions limit established for every year is:
**2021** |  **2022** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2025** |  **2026** |  **2027**  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
30% |  30% |  28% |  26% |  24% |  22% |  20%  
## Bad debt
Manifestly uncollectible unpaid debt will be deductible if this debt is originated in habitual operations from the taxpayer's business and all legal actions towards its collection have been exercised.
## Charitable contributions
All donations duly supported by documentation that are given to the government, public institutions, municipal corporations, public universities, to the Social Protection Board, to the Educational Boards, to the Costa Rican Red Cross, and other institutions, such as those foundations and associations with non-charitable, scientific, and cultural ends that are authorised by the Tax Administration to receive deductible donations, among other entities, will be deductible from gross income.
The Income Tax Law, Law number 7092 establishes a limit on donations of 10% of the net income calculated by the donor contributor, without considering the donation.
## Taxes
Regarding the income tax, penalties, interests over any tax obligation, all other expenses related to the company's habitual commercial activity will be considered deductible, if they can be properly proved.
In VAT´s case, tax credit can be accrued from expenses required for the company's habitual commercial activity, which means it can be offset against the debit balance.
Any other tax is able to have its own exception to non-deductibility, which may be established in its own special law.
## Net operating losses
With the changes made to the Income Tax Law Regulations by Executive Decree 41818, as of June 17, 2019, all companies that have tax losses in a fiscal period may deduct them in the following three fiscal periods. In the case of agricultural companies, the deduction may be made in the following five periods. 
This section did not receive any modification when Executive Decree 43198 replaced the old regulation with the new one on December 17, 2021.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Corporations may claim deductions for royalties, technical and management service fees, and interest charges paid to foreign affiliates if they have withheld the proper tax (25% for royalties, franchises, and professional services and 15% for interest). However, the deductions for technical, management service fees, and royalties may not exceed 10% of gross sales in the aggregate if paid to the parent company.


# Costa Rica
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 15 January 2025
There is no group taxation in Costa Rica.
## Transfer pricing
According to the Code of Tax Rules and Procedures of Costa Rica (Law No. 4755), published on 3 May 1971, article 12 states that the agreements between individuals are not admissible against the Treasury regarding tax matters.
On 10 June 2003, Interpretive Guideline No. 20-03, called Tax Treatment of Transfer Prices, was approved. This Guideline established the application of the principle of arm's-length in transactions between related parties. It was basically based on the comparison of the conditions of a determined operation with those transactions carried out by independent companies (i.e. those prices must be equivalent or reasonable to the corresponding similar transactions made between independent companies).
This Guideline attributed to the Tax Administration the power to analyse the operations carried out between related parties when the agreed valuation determines a tax lower than that resulting from the application of the arm’s length, in which case, it must proceed to practice the relevant adjustments.
By 10 September 2012, through Law No. 9069, Article 12 of the Code of Tax Rules and Procedures was modified, establishing that the elements of the tax obligation, such as the definition of taxpayer, taxable event, and others, may not be altered by acts or agreements of individuals, which will not produce effects before the Administration, without prejudice to their legal-private consequences. However, none of the laws indicated above covered essential aspects of the application of transfer pricing, such as:
  * Application of transfer pricing standards
  * Applicable analysis methods
  * OECD Guidelines, and
  * Advance pricing agreements (APAs).


On 13 September 2013, the Ministry of Finance issued the General Decree No. 37898-H to control the operations carried out between related parties with the objective of regulating the provisions related to the application of Guideline 20-03.
With the issuance of this Decree, taxpayers were forced to evaluate the prices agreed upon in operations involving goods or services sold to local or foreign related parties, considering the prices that would have been agreed upon between independent parties in accordance with the arm’s-length standard. This decree reaches any operation or transaction carried out by companies resident in the country with:
  * local and foreign related parties
  * individuals or companies resident or domiciled in jurisdictions of lower taxation or in tax havens, and
  * related parties benefiting from the Free Zones Regime.


On 13 September 2016, in the official newspaper La Gaceta, No. 182, the Resolution DGT-R-44-2016, corresponding to the Informative Return of Transfer Pricing, was published. In this regard, taxpayers must submit their transfer pricing statement on the last business day of the month of June of each year and include all operations carried out during the fiscal period of the taxpayer. However, in Resolution DGT-R-28-2017, the Tax Administration suspended this requirement, and so far, it has not been defined when it should be submitted.
On 21 April 2017, the official newspaper La Gaceta, No. 75, Resolution DGT-R-16-2017, corresponding to the transfer pricing documentation, was published. This document indicates that the information must be available to the Tax Administration to be provided upon request.
Resolution DGT-R-001-2018, of 11 January 2018, established the obligation to file the country-by-country (CbC) report, to all the parent companies residing in the country, where their global income amounts to more than 750 million euros (EUR). The taxpayers to whom said requirement applied had to submit the first declaration no later than 31 December 2018, for the transactions corresponding to the 2017 period.
In 2019, the regulation regarding transfer pricing suffered a transformation, when, on 4 December 2019, in the official newspaper La Gaceta, No. 202, it was published the Public Finance Enhancement Law, Law No. 9635, which added a Chapter XXXl, that incorporates a new article 81 bis to the Title V of the General Dispositions, of the Income Tax Law, Law No. 7092. After it, on 26 June 2019, it was published in the official newspaper La Gaceta, No. 145 the Executive Decree No.41818-H, called “Modifications and additions to the Bylaws of the Income Tax Law, Executive Decree No. 18445-H, from 9 September 1988 and its reforms”. Within this new Decree it was regulated the transfer pricing practice described in the above-mentioned article 81 bis, derogating the previous Executive Decree No. 37898-H.
On 13 November 2019, the General Tax Directorate published the Resolution DGT-R-49-2019, where there are established the new requirements for the documentation in regards to transfer pricing; derogating in the act, the Resolution DGT-R-16-2017. As a brief resume, the resolution confirms that the taxpayers that perform operations with related parties must keep for the lapse mentioned on the article 109 of the Tax Code, the documentation that supports the transactions between related parties and the compliance of the transfer pricing regulations that show they match the transactions between independent parties. In this sense, the information must be available for the Tax Administration upon request.
## Thin capitalisation
The Income Tax Law, Law number 7092 does not establish thin capitalisation rules in the strict sense, only the 20% limit on the deduction of non-bank interest .
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
In Costa Rican legislation, there is no mention of CFC rules.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 15 January 2025
## Foreign tax credit
Costa Rica’s tax system does not allow for the possibility of foreign tax credits.
As an exception, taxpayers considered as non-qualified entities that obtain foreign source passive income, may credit the analogous tax withheld or paid abroad against the Costa Rican applicable tax regarding the same income.
## Free zones
Entities covered by the Free Trade Zone Law may enjoy exemption from import duties on goods, income tax, VAT, export tax, selective consumption tax, real estate transfer tax, and WHT on payments abroad, as well as the discretionary use of foreign currency generated abroad. However, due to rules established by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in force from year 2015, the manufacturing companies can apply to the Free Trade Zone Regime whether the sale of their products is in Costa Rica or outside Costa Rica as long as they comply with the requisites established in the Law. This same rule was extended by means of the Law 9689/2019 to the service companies, under which they can sell their services internally or abroad without any cap or restrictions. Right now, there are proposed regulations under discussion to implement the new rules brought by the Law 9689/2019. 
## Drawback industries
Special benefits exist for industries that import semi-manufactured materials for assembly in Costa Rica and export finished products. Benefits consist of duty-free imports of raw materials for subsequent export as manufactured products. Machinery for these industries may also be imported duty-free.

# Costa Rica
## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 15 January 2025
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS) regimen
Costa Rica has made important steps to comply with the CRS developed by the OECD.
The first step was the reform through Law No. 9296 of 18 May 2015 to article 106 quater to the Code of Tax Rules and Procedures through which the procedure called ‘Procedure to request financial information for the exchange with other jurisdictions by virtue of an international agreement’ empowers the Costa Rican Tax Administration to implement the automatic exchange of information that is foreseeably relevant for tax purposes in cases in which an international agreement for the exchange of tax information is executed.
Taking into consideration that Costa Rica acceded to the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters through Law No. 9118 of 7 February 2013, and by virtue of the adhesion of Costa Rica to the Declaration on the Automatic Exchange of Information in Matter Prosecutor of the OECD, signed in May 2014, Costa Rica has implemented the Standard for the Automatic Exchange of Financial Information in Tax Matters as the tool through which Costa Rica will exchange information automatically with other jurisdictions, annually.
Because one of the core issues that the OECD has recorded in the Multilateral Agreement between Competent Authorities on the Automatic Exchange of Information on Financial Accounts is the implementation of the ‘Standard for the Automatic Exchange of Information on Financial Accounts in Tax Matters’ or ‘Common Reporting Standard for Financial Accounts’, known as the Common Reporting Standard (CRS), which establishes that the financial institutions of the countries committed to the exchange of information that is the subject of the mentioned Convention must apply the due diligence procedure to identify the financial accounts that will be subject to the report, and in order to comply with the aforementioned international agreement, the Ministry of Finance of the Government of Costa Rica issued Resolutions No. DGT-R-006-2017 and No. DGT-R-006-2018, referring to the due diligence in the supply of information of the financial and non-financial entities for the automatic exchange of tax information according to the OECD CRS rules.
In these resolutions, the Costa Rican tax authorities define the individuals, terms, procedures, and compliance deadlines that must be complied with by entities required to provide the information foreseeably relevant for tax purposes referred to in the financial accounts that they must report, as established by the CRS. The obligation of the institutions of the financial system to submit to the Tax Administration the information referring to the accounts and payments according to the Standard for the Automatic Exchange of Information on Financial Accounts in Tax Matters, adopted by the Council of the OECD, is established and indicates the general requirements of the obligation to report by Costa Rican financial institutions, with respect to each foreign account, the general due diligence requirements, the review procedures for pre-existing accounts of individuals, review procedures for new accounts of individuals, review procedures for pre-existing entity accounts, review procedures for new entity accounts, special due diligence rules, and a series of definitions.
## Tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs)
Costa Rica has a TIEA with the United States (US), effective since 12 February 1991, but it was replaced by another agreement on November 12, 2019 whereby both countries agree to exchange information, from and/or in relation to public and private entities and individuals, at the request of the party's corresponding authority in relation to any tax relevant issue. On November 12, 2019 this TIEA was replaced by the law 9449.
In April 2018, with the objective of meeting the current standard of fiscal transparency established by the OECD with respect to the exchange of information for fiscal purposes and mutual assistance, the governments of Costa Rica and the United States signed a new information exchange agreement between both countries. The agreement was signed but must be submitted to the Legislative Assembly for ratification.
Under this agreement, both countries will offer assistance through the exchange of information in order to determine, settle, and collect taxes, as well as to collect and execute tax claims, or to investigate or prosecute tax matters. All this information will be treated confidentially between both parties.
This new agreement shows the commitment of Costa Rica to carry out an effective exchange of information in accordance with the standards of the Global Forum of Transparency and Exchange of Information of the OECD.
Currently, Costa Rica has valid TIEAs with Argentina, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Ecuador, El Salvador, Faroe Islands, Finland, France, Greenland, Guatemala, Guernsey, Holland, Honduras, Iceland, Mexico, Nicaragua, Norway, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, and Sweden.
In addition, Costa Rica also signed, in 2013, the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, thanks to which Costa Rica can exchange tax information with all the countries that have this convention in force; currently, 117 countries have signed it.
## Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) agreement
In November 2013, Costa Rica`s Treasury Department and the Deputy in charge of negotiations of the US embassy in Costa Rica signed an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) in which they committed to share financial information, with the objective of guaranteeing transparency in financial transactions that US citizens perform in Costa Rica, with the aim of justifying and supporting the application of the policy established in the FATCA Law. The IGA will allow Costa Rica`s financial entities to comply with the provisions established in FATCA. The IGA was chosen under Model 1, in which each entity must submit a report to the Treasury Department, and it will be this entity that oversees the transfer of information to the United States Treasury Department.
By means of Law No. 9296 of 18 May 2015, a vehicle by which the IGA can be implemented in Costa Rica was created. Under such Law, the Tax Code was modified to include an article 106 quater in which the obligation was established for financial entities (and any other entity that, even without being classified as such, runs any type of financial activity) to provide the Tax Administration with all the information of its clients that is foreseeably relevant for tax purposes and that is required for the implementation of international instruments that contemplate the exchange of information on tax matters in any of its modalities. Thus, such financial information may be transferred by the Tax Administration to jurisdictions with which international instruments have been subscribed that contemplate the exchange of information on tax matters.
In order to obtain said information, the judicial authorisation procedure contained in article 106 ter of this Code, or the authorisation established in article 615 of the Commercial Code of Costa Rica, will not be required.
By means of Law No. 9416 of 14 November 2016, penalties were established for those financial entities that fail to comply with the provision of the pertinent information, and it was also established that said information must be handled in a confidential manner by the tax authorities.
## Free-trade bilateral treaties
Costa Rica is a full member of the Central American Common Market, which guarantees free trade among the countries of the area. It also has a free-trade bilateral treaty in force with Canada, the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), Chile, China, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), Mexico, Panama, Peru, and Singapore. The US-Central American-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) entered into force on 1 January 2009. Additionally, there is a free commerce and cooperation agreement with the European Union (EU) in force since 2013. These agreements aim to provide favourable conditions for the exchange of merchandise between contracting parties.


# Costa Rica
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 15 January 2025
## Inventory valuation
Inventories are generally stated at cost and can be valued using the compound average-cost method, first in first out (FIFO), retailer method, or specific identification method. Since all entities must keep legal records, any adjustment resulting from different methods of inventory valuation for tax and financial purposes should be recorded.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are taxed at 15%, which will be paid either through withholding at source or, when the tax cannot be withheld, it must be declared by the taxpayer. In addition, a global system is established that allows taxes that were withheld to be applied as payments on account of the tax on profits when said profits come from goods or rights that are used in the lucrative activity of the taxpayer.
Special rules apply for the 'first sale', and there are certain exemptions listed in the law (e.g. corporate reorganisation).
## Dividend income
In the Income Tax Law, Law number 7092, dividends are taxed as income from movable capital at 15%. The distribution of dividends is exempt when the parent company is another capital company domiciled in Costa Rica, when the latter develops an economic activity subject to income tax, or in the case of a controlling company of a group or regulated financial conglomerate.
### **Stock dividends**
Dividends paid in the form of stock of the distributing company are allowed and are exempt from taxes.
## Interest income
As a result of the Law No. 9635, interest is taxed as income from movable capital at a rate of 15%, unless considered the result of the usual economic activity, in which case it would become part of the global income with a maximum ordinary rate of 30% applicable to local source income.
It must also be considered that, as an exception established by Law No. 10.381, offshore source income can be considered as taxable income for entities that belong to a multinational group if deemed as non-qualified entities, such income would be deemed as taxable with a 15% rate. 
Income generated from interest abroad prior to the enforceability of Law No. 10.381 was considered as taxable by the authorities due to the wider interpretation that was validated by judicial authorities and even by the Constitutional Chamber.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 15 January 2025
The Costa Rican tax system is based on the principle of territoriality, as a result of which only income considered to be of Costa Rican source should be subject to taxation. These are defined as income generated exclusively in the national territory from services rendered, goods located, capital invested, and rights used in Costa Rica.
In the year 2023, Costa Rica passed a reform aimed at excluding Costa Rica from the “gray list” of the European Union and within the changes proposed, the taxation of foreign source passive income was incorporated under exceptional conditions. That said, if an entity belonging to a multinational group does not comply with the appropriate substance requirements in the country for the generation of its passive income, income from dividends, interest, royalties, capital gains, real estate income and other passive income could be subject to taxation in Costa Rica.
The CIT is calculated on the corporation's net income, which equals gross income minus deductible expenses. Gross income includes all income derived from any economic activity carried out in Costa Rica.
Corporate income is taxed at a 30% rate. However, the law establishes special rates for small companies whose gross income does not exceed ¢119,629,000 Costa Rican colones (CRC). For this category, the following rates apply:
  * 5% on the first CRC 5,642,000 of annual net income.
  * 10% on the excess of CRC 5,642,000 and up to CRC 8,465,000 of annual net income.
  * 15% on the excess of CRC 8,465,000 and up to CRC 11,286,000 of annual net income.
  * 20% on the excess of CRC 11,286,000 of annual net income.


In addition, the following exemptions are established for micro and small businesses registered with the Ministry of Economy, Industry, and Commerce (MEIC) or with the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG):
  * 0% of the tax on profits in the first three years of commercial activities.
  * 25% of the tax on profits in the fourth and fifth year of commercial activities.
  * 50% of the tax on profits in the sixth year of commercial activities.


Non-residents are also subject to the principle of territorial source income; however, the method of taxation will depend on the presence of the non-resident in Costa Rica:
  * Permanent Establishments (PE): Non-resident entities that operate in Costa Rica through a PE must be taxed on income from local sources as if they were a local taxpayer.


Entities without permanent establishment: Non-residents that do not constitute a permanent establishment are subject to withholding taxes on Costa Rican source income. Withholding rates vary according to the type of income but range from 5% to 30%.
## Local income taxes
There are no provincial income taxes in Costa Rica; however, there is a municipal tax. The rate depends on the municipality in which the company is located, but the most regular method of calculation is to apply a percentage over net income or sales.
