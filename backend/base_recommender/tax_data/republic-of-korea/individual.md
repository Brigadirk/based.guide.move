## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
## Foreign tax relief
A tax credit for foreign income taxes paid abroad by Korean residents, up to a limit of the amount of Korean income taxes before the foreign tax credit times the ratio of foreign source income to worldwide total taxable income. Any excess over the maximum allowable credit may be carried forward for ten years. Alternatively, foreign tax paid can be deducted from taxable income.
## Tax treaties
### Double taxation avoidance agreements
Korea currently has income tax treaties with 95 countries as of July 2024: In order to apply the reduced withholding rates under tax treaties, an application form must be submitted to the Korean entity paying the income (acting as a withholding agent) with a document providing that the applicant is a beneficiary of domestic-source income.

### Tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs)
Besides income tax treaties to avoid the double taxation, Korea concluded TIEAs with many countries, including certain tax havens and those that provisionally reached such agreements. TIEA coverage extends to Andorra, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, and Cook Islands, to name a few. TIEAs cover information required for the administration and enforcement of domestic tax laws, including details on taxpayer registration, corporate ownership details, companies’ accounting records and financial statements of a specific transaction, and individual or corporate financial transaction information. TIEAs establish a framework for Korea to curb abusive tax avoidance transactions using tax havens, as well as unveil and levy taxes on offshore tax avoidance transactions. In addition, Korea is one of 147 countries that have joined the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters as of January 2024.
### Social security (totalisation) agreements
Korea currently has social security agreements in effect with Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Iran, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mongolia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Quebec, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Uruguay, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam as of December 2024. The social security agreements are intended to help those who have contributed premiums to the national pension plans of two different countries; it allows them to obtain benefit eligibility by combining total periods of coverage in both countries (i.e. totalisation). Nonetheless, the agreement must be reviewed since detailed provisions can vary depending on the respective agreement.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
The applicable period for special tax concession for foreign employees or engineers has been extended under the latest amendment of the Individual Income Tax Law (‘IITL’). Foreign employees working in Korea may elect to have their employment income subject to a flat tax rate of 19% (rather than a progressive income tax rate with the highest marginal tax rate) for 20 years from the date they start working in Korea. This flat tax rate can be elected for those who initially started to work in Korea not later than the end of December 2026.
Currently, 50% tax-exempt treatment is allowed for wages received by a qualified foreign technician/engineer providing services in Korea to a domestic entity for ten years from the date one starts to render services in Korea. This treatment shall apply for those who start to work in Korea not later than the end of December 2026. In addition, a 70% tax reduction is applicable to wages received by the above qualified expatriate, if one works in the categories of raw materials, parts, and equipment, for the first three years as long as one started to work in Korea not later than 31 December 2022.
Another noticeable change in the recently amended IITL is a new provision that outlines a special withholding treatment concerning non-resident omnibus accounts. Under the new provision, when a non-resident receives Korean-source income through the non-resident omnibus account, the company paying Korean-source income to the non-resident is mandated to withhold income tax upon making the payment. To avail of income tax exemption, non-taxation, or a reduced rate as per the applicable income tax treaty, the non-resident must initiate the process by filing a tax refund request with the pertinent district tax office.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
A taxpayer in Korea, who is liable to pay the income tax on their income, is classified into resident and non-resident for income tax purposes (_see the section for more information_).
A resident is subject to income tax on all incomes derived from sources both within and outside Korea. Foreign residents who have stayed in Korea for longer than five years during the last ten-year period are taxed on their worldwide income. However, foreign residents who have stayed in Korea for five years or less during the last ten-year period are taxed on Korea-source income, and foreign-source income is reportable only in the case where foreign-source income is paid by a Korean entity or transferred to Korea.
A non-resident is subject to income tax only on income derived from sources within Korea. When a non-resident who does not have a domestic place of business has Korea-source income to report through an annual tax return, most provisions concerning the tax rates and the filing procedures of residents shall apply to them. However, in calculating taxable income and tax amount, a non-resident is not entitled to claim any personal exemptions for their dependants (except for themselves), income deductions, and tax credits.
## Personal income tax (PIT) rates
The following tax table summarises the basic global income tax rates applicable for the income received from 1 January 2023 and thereafter.
Annual taxable income (KRW* thousands) | Tax rate**  
---|---  
Over (column 1) | Less than | Tax on column 1 (KRW thousands) | Marginal tax rate (%)  
0 | 14,000 | 0 | 6

1,000,000 | 384,060 | 45  
* Korean won
** Before applying the local income tax.
## Local income tax
Besides the above PIT, there is also a local income tax that is assessed at a rate of 10% of the PIT rates.
  * PIT is paid to the National Tax Service (NTS).
  * Local income tax is paid to the city or the province that is the domicile of the taxpayer.

Annual taxable income (KRW thousands) | Tax rate  
---|---  
Over (column 1) | Less than | Tax on column 1 (KRW thousands) | Marginal tax rate (%)  
0 | 14,000 | 0 | 0.6  
14,000 | 50,000 | 84 | 1.5  
50,000 | 88,000 | 624 | 2.4  
88,000 | 150,000 | 1,536 | 3.5  
150,000 | 300,000 | 3,706 | 3.8  
300,000 | 500,000 | 9,406 | 4.0  
500,000 | 1,000,000 | 17,406 | 4.2  
1,000,000 | 38,406 | 4.5  
## Alternative minimum tax (AMT)
The AMT, with exceptions, will be calculated at the greater of 45% of income tax liability (35% applied to income tax liabilities of up to KRW 30 million) before exemptions or actual tax after exemptions.
The AMT is applied to business income of a resident individual and Korean-source business income of a non-resident individual, but it is not applied to employment income.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
## Taxable period
PIT will be assessed for one year from 1 January to 31 December. If a resident should move out of the country, relocating the domicile or residence, the PIT shall be imposed for the period from 1 January to the date of departure from the country.
## Tax returns
A resident with global income, retirement income and capital gains is required to file a return on the relevant tax base for the tax year. The return is required to be submitted even if there is taxable income but no tax base or a deficit in the particular year.
An individual income tax return is to be filed and the income tax paid during the period from 1 May to 31 May of the year following the tax year concerned except for certain specified cases. If a taxpayer fails to fulfil these obligations, a penalty tax shall be imposed.
Class A wage and salary earners who receive other income, such as interest, dividends, property or Class B salary income, which are not subject to periodic income tax withholding, must file a tax return on their composite income. For certain types of interest and dividends that are subject to tax withholding at source, the amount withheld is considered to be the final tax and the income may be excluded from total taxable income.
Expatriates who receive only Class A salary income and/or retirement income are not required to file a tax return prior to leaving Korea but to submit the documents necessary for the year-end settlement to their employer. However, expatriates who receive income other than Class A salary income shall file their tax returns prior to leaving Korea for the period from 1 January to the date of departure from Korea.
## Payment of tax
A taxpayer who receives only Class A employment income and/or Class A retirement income is generally not required to file an annual individual income tax return. Employers are required to withhold income taxes at source on a monthly basis, finalise their employees' tax liability, and file the final tax settlement receipt with the tax authorities no later than 10th of March of the following year. On the other hand, the employers are not required to withhold Korean taxes at the time of payment of Class B income; however, the individual is required to declare this income annually and pay income taxes thereon on a voluntary basis.
Alternatively, the individual may elect to pay Class B income taxes through a licensed taxpayers’ association, which collects and remits such taxes on a monthly basis. Taxpayers who join such an association are eligible to receive a 5% credit of income tax payable.
In case where an annual tax return is required, the relevant taxes shall be paid with the return due by 31 May of the following year.
## Tax audit process
The tax authority in Korea is the National Tax Service (NTS). Audit targets are picked by random sampling. As part of the government’s commitment to identify and tax the underground economy, a continued focus and close watch is placed on offshore tax avoidance and evasion, hidden assets of high net-worth individuals or businesses under borrowed names, suspected wealth transfers, and shadow cash transactions.
## Statute of limitations
The time limits to assess national tax are five years (seven years in respect of cross-border transactions) from the date when the national tax is assessable, unless otherwise are specified by the Basic National Tax Act. For example:
  * Ten years with respect to an inheritance tax or gift tax.
  * Ten years if a taxpayer evades any national tax, or has it refunded or deducted, by fraudulent or other unlawful means.
  * 15 years for fraud or unjustifiable means involving cross-border transactions. For this purpose, the term 'cross-border transaction’ means when a party or parties to the transaction include(s) non-resident(s) or foreign corporation(s) (excluding domestic business places of non-resident[s] or foreign corporation[s]); and transactions for offshore assets or offshore services between Korean residents.
  * Seven years if a taxpayer fails to file a written tax base by the statutory due date (ten years in respect of cross-border transactions).
  * 15 years in case of the non-compliance with inheritance or gift tax return obligation or fraudulent or omitted filing or such tax or refund or deduction of such tax by unlawful means.


## Topics of focus for tax authorities
  * The NTS established the Offshore Compliance Enforcement Center (OCEC) to prevent and investigate offshore tax evasion. The importance for the exchange of information among nations has become a major issue for the individual income tax administration.
  * Korea has participated in the global initiatives led by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and G20 to tackle offshore tax evasion and avoidance by concluding agreements to exchange tax information with an increasing number of countries.
  * In a bid to tighten control of offshore income and prevent cross-border tax evasion attempts, the law requires Korean residents or domestic companies to report their offshore financial accounts if the aggregate balance of these accounts exceed KRW 0.5 billion at the end of each month during the year. For these purposes, offshore financial accounts mean not only bank accounts and stock brokerage accounts, but also bonds, derivatives, fund transaction-related accounts, or cryptocurrency (or other virtual assets) trading accounts. A penalty will be imposed for each failure to comply with the reporting requirements. Where the under-reported or unreported amount exceeds a certain threshold (KRW 5 billion at present), up to two-year imprisonment or fines of no more than 13% to 20% of the under-reported or unreported amount will be imposed.


### Law for reporting of specified financial transaction information
The Act on Reporting and Using Specified Financial Transaction Information is aimed at tackling tax fraud and evasion through financial transactions in borrowed names and suspicious cash transactions. Regulations of the Act require financial institutions to report to the Korea Finance Intelligence Unit (KoFIU): (i) suspicious transactions where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the assets received with respect to the financial transaction are illegal or that a customer conducting the financial transaction is involved in money laundering activities (suspicious transaction report or STR) and (ii) daily cash transactions by a trader totalling KRW 10 million or more (currency transaction report or CTR). In this case, transaction details must be reported within 30 days from the transaction date.
The regulations permit the NTS to access data held by the KoFIU in instances where there is evidence of alleged tax evasion and where KoFIU data is used to collect taxes in arrears. In instances that are deemed more closely related to alleged tax evasion, the Act also requires the KoFIU to disseminate information to the NTS and the Customs Service. In addition, the scope of KoFIU raw data disseminated to law enforcement agencies, including the NTS, includes CTRs in the amount of KRW 10 million or more.
In a bid to prevent possible abuse of FIU data, the Act imposes the reporting requirement for the KoFIU to the concerned CTR traders with respect to CTR raw data disseminated to law enforcement agencies, including the NTS and the Customs Service. However, the reporting may be postponed for up to 6 months if there is a risk of evidence destruction, administrative proceeding, obstruction to progress, etc.

The tax credits amount to KRW 150,000 for one child aged 8 or older, KRW 350,000 for two children, and KRW 300,000 per child for the third and more per year. This child tax credit shall also apply to grandchildren with effect from 1 January 2024.
### Tax credit for charitable contributions
The tax credit rate is 15% for the donation amount up to KRW 10 million and 30% for the excess. If total donations made from 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2024 exceed KRW 30 million, an additional deduction equivalent to 10% of the excess amount will be applied.
### Tax credit for education expenses
The tax credit rate is 15% for education expenses with certain limits (KRW 9 million for each dependant attending university or college, KRW 3 million for each dependant attending preschool to high school, no limit for the taxpayer).
### Tax credit for insurance premiums
The tax credit rate is 12% for qualified insurance premiums paid for the following types of insurance (beneficiary can be either the taxpayer or the dependants who have no income for the year): life insurance, life insurance for the handicapped, damage and accident insurance, fire and burglary insurance, and insurance similar thereto. The maximum tax credit is KRW 120,000 _per annum_. The national health insurance and unemployment insurance premiums shall be fully tax deductible.
### Tax credit for medical expenses
The tax credit rate is 15% for medical expenses paid up to KRW 7 million, but only if they exceed 3% of total employment income. However, medical expenses paid for taxpayers, dependants aged 65 or older, or the handicapped, are not subject to the KRW 7 million limit for the tax credit. With effect from 1 January 2024, the limit will no longer apply to medical expenses paid for children aged six or younger.
### Tax credit for individual pension premium
The tax credit rate is 12% for the pension premium paid up to KRW 9 million _per annum_. However, the tax credit rate becomes 15% for the taxpayer whose income is less than KRW 45 million _per annum_.
### Mortgage interest deduction
A deduction for housing and long-term mortgage interest is available to wage earners who do not own a home, or who own only a house of a certain size, and who have subscribed to a particular savings program for home ownership.
## Other deductions
There are other itemised deductions available under the Special Tax Treatment Control Law. A taxpayer also must submit supporting documents to claim the following deduction:
  * A deduction for expenditures paid by credit cards, cash receipts, debit cards, or check cards up to a certain limit depending on the nature of expenses and level of employment income.


## Personal deductions
Korean tax law provides all resident taxpayers with the following standard personal deductions from individual taxable income.
### Basic deductions
  * For the taxpayer: KRW 1.5 million per year. Non-residents of Korea are allowed to claim only the personal deduction for themselves.
  * For a spouse who lives with the taxpayer and has an adjusted gross income of less than KRW 1 million _per annum_ : KRW 1.5 million per year.
  * For each eligible dependant who lives with the taxpayer and has an adjusted gross income of less than KRW 1 million _per annum_ : KRW 1.5 million per year.


### Additional deductions
  * Handicapped person in the taxpayer's household: KRW 2 million for each handicapped person. The handicapped person may be the taxpayer, spouse, or other dependants.
  * Person aged 70 or older: KRW 1 million for each taxpayer, spouse, or dependant aged 70 or older in the taxpayer’s household.
  * Female taxpayer: KRW 500,000. To qualify for this additional deduction, the female taxpayer should be a head of household with dependants but no spouse or should be a married woman, and the qualifying female taxpayer should have an annual taxable income of KRW 30 million or less (approximately KRW 40 million in total annual compensation).
  * Single parent: KRW 1 million. In case a single parent claims the female taxpayer deduction above, only the single parent deduction of KRW 1 million is allowed.


## Business deductions
All business-related expenses, such as moving expenses, travel expenses, automobile expenses, and certain amounts of entertainment expenses, are tax deductible. Alternatively, reimbursements for such expenses can be claimed by the business as deductible expenses and need not be included in the individual's taxable income.
## Losses
Business losses excluding rental losses are deductible against employment income, pension income, other income, interest income, and dividend income in order to calculate the tax base. Unused losses can be carried forward for ten years. However, rental losses are deducible against only rental income and unused rental losses can be carried forward for ten years.
Capital losses are deductible only against capital gains. Unused losses may not be carried forward.

## Individual - Other issues
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
## Work permits and visas
Under the Korean Exit and Entry Control Act, a foreigner who wishes to reside in Korea must enter Korea using an entry visa which allows for an appropriate period of stay (theoretically not less than 91 days but normally six months or longer). If a visa is granted for a period of 90 days or less, it cannot normally be extended beyond such period while the foreigner is in Korea. As a result, such a visa holder cannot become a resident of Korea. In this regard, under the Immigration Regulations, if a visa having a period of stay of 90 days or less is granted by a Korean Consulate outside Korea, the Consulate normally notifies the visa applicant that ‘no extension will be allowed after entering Korea’.
In some cases, a foreigner who is a citizen of a country with which Korea has entered into a visa abolishment agreement (e.g. Britain) may enter Korea without a visa by obtaining a visa abolishment stamp at the Korean port of entry. However, if a foreigner has entered Korea by using a visa abolishment stamp, such a foreigner, in principle, cannot:
  * obtain any visa status
  * obtain any extension of the period of stay in Korea, or
  * become a resident of Korea.


The appropriate visa status is determined on the basis of the activities to be engaged in by the foreigner.
The first alternative is a Technology Inducement Contract (TIC), which has been reported to the relevant ministry under the Foreign Investment Promotion Law (FIPL). Under this arrangement, employees of the foreign licensor would enter Korea for work under the TIC. Second, the expatriates may be dispatched to Korea for work at a foreign entity’s branch office in Korea. Third, expatriates may be hired by the Korean company (foreign invested company or joint venture under the FIPL). Certain types of visa status appear to be most suitable for the expatriates who enter Korea (i.e. the E-4 [Technician], D-7 [Commerce], D-8 [Investment], and F-3 [dependant of an expatriate]). 
Korean visas should be obtained from a Korean consulate or embassy in any foreign country with which the Republic of Korea has diplomatic relations. The required documents vary depending upon the applicable visa status. The Korean Consulate concerned may also require additional documents and these documents may be different at each Korean Consulate.
## Foreign exchange issues
Generally, residents of Korea are allowed to possess foreign exchange except for the cases set forth in the Foreign Exchange Transaction Act. Foreign payment and receipt in small amounts (not exceeding a specified threshold) does not require an underlying transaction document, confirmation, or reporting to a foreign exchange bank. Even now it controls transactions with foreign countries and foreign payment/receipt, with the objectives of international balance equilibrium, stabilisation of currency, and the effective operation of foreign currency funds. 
As the government has been stepping up its efforts to clamp down on offshore tax evasion, rules of the Foreign Exchange Transaction Act have been amended to address such efforts. The foreign exchange transaction regulations allow the Customs Service and the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) to request each other access to the respective party’s probing into foreign exchange transactions unless there is a justifiable reason to decline such a request. The rules provide a legal framework to allow the Customs Service and the FSS to team up for the joint inspection of hybrid transactions. Previously, depending on the transaction type, the examination authority of foreign exchange transactions was divided between the Customs Service (commodity exports/imports) and the FSS (service and capital transaction).

# Korea, Republic of
## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
Individual income can be categorised as taxable, non-taxable, or tax-exempt. Taxable income includes global income, capital gains, and severance pay, each of which is subject to tax on a unique tax calculation structure. 
There are certain elements of income on which the government has waived its taxing rights, whether or not an application for exemption is filed by an individual. There are other items of income for which a taxpayer can apply for tax exemption.
Global income is subject to global taxation and includes employment income (salaries, wages, bonuses, and other amounts received for employment services rendered), interest income, dividend income, personal business income (including rental income), pension income, and other income (prize winnings, royalties, rewards, etc.).
## Employment income
Although the legal terminology for the classification of employment income has been deleted in the tax laws, employment income can be classified into Class A or Class B income, depending on the income source.
### Class A employment income
Class A employment income is employment income paid or borne by a Korean entity (including a Korean office of a foreign corporation or a permanent establishment [PE]) or paid by a foreign entity but charged back (or to be charged back under a prior agreement) to a Korean entity. Such income is subject to payroll withholding taxes on a monthly basis.
### Class B employment income
Class B employment income is employment income paid by a foreign entity but not claimed as a corporate tax deduction by the Korean entity through a recharge. The employer is not required to withhold Korean taxes at the time of payment of Class B income; however, the individual is required to declare this income annually and pay income taxes thereon on a voluntary basis. Alternatively, the individual may elect to pay Class B income taxes through a licensed taxpayers’ association, which collects and remits such taxes on a monthly basis. Taxpayers who join such an association are eligible to receive a 5% credit of income tax payable (credit ceiling of KRW 1 million per individual).
Despite the above, the recently amended Individual Income Tax Law (IITL) requires a domestic company using foreign secondees to withhold payroll income tax at 19% when the domestic company pays service fees to the foreign corporation that has dispatched foreign secondees. The domestic company shall be subject to withholding obligation when all of the following conditions are met: (i) the total amount of service fees paid to a foreign corporation in return for services via foreign secondees exceeds KRW 2 billion _per annum_ , (ii) the sales revenue of the domestic company exceeds KRW 150 billion or total assets exceed KRW 500 billion during the preceding fiscal year, and (iii) the domestic company engages in air transportation, construction business, and professional, scientific, technical service, and financial service business.
### Special tax concession for foreigners working in Korea
Foreign expatriates and employees who will start to work in Korea no later than 31 December 2026 are able to apply for a flat income tax rate of 19% (excluding local income tax) on their employment income rather than the normal progressive income tax rates of between 6% and 45% (excluding local income tax). In this case, any other income deductions, tax exemption, and tax credit are forfeited. If a foreign expatriate or employee wants to choose the 19% flat tax application, they are required to submit an application to the Korean tax authorities at the time of filing the annual tax return or to their employer at the time of monthly withholding or year-end settlement. A foreign expatriate or employee can choose the 19% flat tax rate as a monthly employment income withholding tax (WHT) rate with submission of an application to Korean tax authorities.
The flat tax rate is applicable for a 20-year period, starting with the first day of work in Korea to the end of the tax year immediately preceding the year in which the 20-year anniversary of the first day of work falls.
In addition, the flat income tax rate is not applicable for foreigners working for a company that is regarded as a related party to the foreigner. A related party for these purposes is defined as: (i) a corporation where the concerned employee has a direct or indirect controlling influence on the corporation’s management or (ii) a private company that is owned by a relative(s) of the concerned employee.
### Non-taxable items of employment income
The following elements, among others, are excludable from employment income:
  * Reimbursement of business expenses, including social membership costs and entertainment expenses incurred by an employee for business purposes.
  * Cost of a company car, driver, related maintenance, and insurance expenses provided by an employer, provided that the car is owned or leased in the name of the employer and certain conditions (i.e. business usage ratio, mileage report, etc.) prescribed under the Corporate Income Tax Law are met. Non-deductible expenses on the corporate tax return will be deemed as the concerned employee’s salary.


The following elements of employment income, among others, are non-taxable:
  * Employer-provided housing qualifying under certain conditions (e.g. residential property [not a hotel] leased in the name of the employer and related costs paid by an employer directly to a landlord on behalf of an employee, except for a shareholding director). However, utility costs paid by an employer are taxable to the employee.
  * Pre-arranged, fixed allowance for a personal automobile used for business purposes, up to KRW 200,000 per month.
  * Relocation and moving expense reimbursements.
  * Reasonable amounts of employer-reimbursed home-leave travel expenses for expatriate employees.
  * Pay of up to KRW 1 million (KRW 3 million for construction and deep-sea fishing) per month for furnishing service overseas.
  * Meal costs of KRW 200,000 or less per month in case that the meal isn't provided by an employer.
  * Childcare or maternity leave benefits, shorter work hour benefits during the childcare period, and spouse maternity leave benefits as indicated in the Employment Insurance Act.


Non-taxable income should be added back to reportable income when the flat tax rate is elected. 
Employer-provided housing qualifying under certain conditions will be permanently excluded from employment income of foreign workers subject to special tax concession for flat tax rate.
## Equity compensation
There is no taxable event at grant or on the vesting date of stock option as the stock option is taxed on exercise date. The spread between the market price of the stock and the amount paid by the employee for the stock pursuant to the plan, if any, is subject to income tax at exercise as employment income. However, stock options exercised by former employees would be treated as other income for resident taxpayers (for non-resident taxpayers, the Korean-sourced portion will still be treated as employment income).
For any other equity-based compensation, such as restricted stock or restricted stock unit, the taxation point differs depending on the equity plan.
## Pension income
Pension income includes public pension income and private pension income. Public pension income includes national pension income, pension income for civil servants and veterans, etc. The national pension income shall be taxable while the national pension premium is fully tax deductible. Public pension income tax shall be withheld every month. Private pension income includes income received from individual retirement pension accounts, private pension deposits, severance pension based on defined contribution schemes, etc. Private pension income tax shall be withheld between 3% and 5%. In principle, pension income shall be taxed as global income. In case the amount of private pension income is less than KRW 15 million _per annum_ , the taxpayer can choose either separate taxation or global taxation.
## Severance pay
Severance pay received upon either retirement or leaving a company is included in an individual’s taxable income but is taxed separately from global income or capital gains. A deduction depending on the service period and additional deduction depending on income level are available. The calculation method differs depending on the year in which the employee retires or leaves and the total service period of the employee.
## Business income
Personal business income consists of gains, profits, income from trade and commerce, dealing in property, rents, royalties, and income derived from any ordinary transactions carried on for gain or profit.
Rental income is the income accruing from the lease of the following assets, which are property or the rights to property; registered or recorded vessels, aircraft, automobiles and heavy equipment, factory facilities or mining facilities, and mining rights. An individual engaged in the business of the rental of real properties is also taxed on the deemed rental income calculated at the financial institutions’ interest rate on the lease security money as well as the recognised rental income.
The taxable amount of business income is what remains after the necessary expenses have been deducted from the gross revenues for the respective year.
## Capital gains
Gains arising from the disposal of capital assets are included in an individual’s taxable income but are taxed separately from global income. Certain capital gains are specifically exempt for tax purposes. These include gains from certain transfers of farmland and other real estate; gains from the transfer of a house, including land, per household with certain conditions; and gains from the transfer of stocks of companies listed on the Korean Exchange.
However, exceptionally, when the total stake of a shareholder together with any related parties (called major shareholder) in a listed company is 1% or more (2%/4% or more for a company on KOSDAQ/KONEX), or total market value of the stock held by a shareholder is KRW 5 billion or more (KRW 4 billion or more of the total market value of shares in a venture firm), the capital gains are taxed at the rate of 22% to 27.5% (if the holding period is less than one year, 33% would be applied), including the local income tax. If the stake is in a small-sized company, the gains are subject to tax at 11% (including the local income tax). 
Capital gains and losses shall be added up by each category (e.g. real estate, stock) on an annual basis. There are basic deductions of KRW 2.5 million _per annum_ and a special deduction for retaining for a long-term period.
Gains from the disposal of foreign assets (except for foreign shares) are taxable where the transferor has been a Korean resident for five years or more at the time of sale. Capital losses are deductible only against capital gains. Unused losses may not be carried forward.
## Dividend income
Dividend income received from both domestic and foreign corporations are taxable. Most dividend income earned from Korean sources is subject to 15.4% tax withholding at source. Foreign resident taxpayers who have stayed in Korea for longer than five years during the last ten-year period are required to include any dividends received from non-Korean sources in global income and to pay taxes thereon at the greater of basic global income tax rates or 15.4%. Foreign resident taxpayers who have stayed in Korea for five years or shorter during the last ten-year period are required to include dividends received from non-Korean sources in global income only if the foreign source income is paid by a Korean entity or transferred to Korea.
## Interest income
Interest income earned on other than National Savings Association deposits from both domestic and foreign corporations is taxable. Most interest income earned from Korean sources is subject to 15.4% tax withholding at source. Foreign resident taxpayers who have stayed in Korea for longer than five years during the last ten-year period are required to include any interest received from non-Korean sources in global income and to pay taxes thereon at the greater of basic global income tax rates or 15.4%. Foreign resident taxpayers who have stayed in Korea for five years or shorter during the last ten-year period are required to include any interest received from non-Korean sources in global income only if the foreign source income is paid by a Korean entity or transferred to Korea.
Financial income, including interest and dividends, shall be subject to global taxation in cases where the annual financial income exceeds KRW 20 million.
## Income from the transfer of financial investment instruments 
The separate taxation of income arising from the transfer of financial investment instruments had been deferred for two years until 1 January 2025, but recently the Korean government has decided to revoke the new system. 
## Income from virtual assets
_For information on the taxation on the virtual assets, see the section in the Corporate tax summary_.
## Other income
Other income denotes specifically designated categories of income that could not fall into interest, dividend, business, employment, pension and retirement, and capital gains. It normally includes income derived from occasional activities that a taxpayer would not intend to continue, and income earned from temporary activities without employment. The following are the examples of other income.
  * Prize winnings and other similar money or goods.
  * Money or goods in a lottery, sports betting game, etc.
  * Fees for use of copyrighted materials received by any person other than the creator of the material.
  * Royalties received as consideration for using films or tapes for radio or television broadcasting, or from such use of other similar assets or rights.
  * Gains from the alienation of mining rights, fishing rights, industrial property rights, individual information, industrial secrets, trademarks, goodwill (including certain leases of stores), rights derived from the permission to exploit earth, sand, and stone, the right to exploit and use subterranean water, etc.
  * Rent derived from a temporary lease of real estate or personal property, goods, or places.
  * Damages or indemnity payments for breach or cancellation of a contract.
  * Bribe, taking a bribe for a favour given, etc.


Most other income, net of given deductions or actual expenses, is subject to a 22% tax withholding at source (including the local income tax).
## Exempt income
Individuals can request a tax-exempt treatment for certain types of income (specified below) by submitting an application to the appropriate tax authorities through their employers.
  * 50% reduction in income tax on wages received by a qualified foreign technician/engineer providing services in Korea to a domestic entity under an engineering technology inducement agreement or by a foreign researcher working in a qualified research centre of a foreign-invested company for ten years from the date one starts to render services in Korea as long as one has started to work in Korea not later than 31 December 2026.
  * With effect from 1 January 2020, 70% income tax reduction for wages received by the above expatriates for the first three years during the prescribed ten-year period, as long as one serves in the category of raw materials, parts, and equipment businesses and has started to work in Korea not later than 31 December 2026.

## Tax credits
Certain tax credits against global income tax liability are available for resident taxpayers. These include the items shown below. 
### Credit for Class A and Class B wages
A maximum credit of KRW 740,000 per year is available for Class A and Class B wages:
Where the calculated tax amount is KRW 1,300,000 or less, the credit allowance is the calculated tax amount multiplied by 55%.
Where the calculated tax amount is more than KRW 1,300,000, the credit is KRW 715,000 plus 30% of the calculated tax amount in excess of KRW 1,300,000, subject to the maximum of KRW 740,000 per year if annual wages do not exceed KRW 33 million. In case annual wages exceed KRW 33 million, the annual credit threshold shall be lowered to KRW 660,000, KRW 500,000, and KRW 200,000 depending on the income bracket (the higher the income, the lower the tax credit) with effect from 1 January 2023.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
## Territoriality and residency
A taxpayer in Korea, who is liable to pay the income tax on their income, is classified into resident and non-resident for income tax purposes, as listed below.
  * Resident: Any individuals having a domicile in Korea or having a residence within Korea for 183 days or more in a tax year, individuals having an occupation that would generally require them to reside in Korea for 183 days or more, or individuals who are deemed to reside in Korea for 183 days or more in a tax year by accompanying families in Korea or by retaining substantial assets in Korea. On the other hand, even when a person has a job overseas and stayed there for more than 183 days in a tax year, but they have their general living relationship, including their family and property, in Korea, they still can be regarded as a resident of Korea. Generally, residency is determined on a ‘facts and circumstances’ test and evaluated on an individual basis.
  * Non-resident: An individual who is not to be considered a resident. Should a foreigner be classified as both a resident of Korea and a resident of the home country, the taxing rights over such non-resident are placed in direct competition with each other. In that case, the primary country of residence is selected in accordance with the provisions regarding determination of residency under the tax treaty between the two countries (_see Tax t_ _reaties in the_ _section for more information_).

## Social security contributions 
There are four types of social security contributions in Korea, namely: National Pension (NP), National Health Insurance (NHI), Employment Insurance (EI), and Worker’s Compensation Insurance (WCI).
### National Pension (NP)
Assuming the employee is enrolled as a 'workplace-based insured person' under the NP scheme, employers are required to contribute an amount equal to 4.5% of salaries to the national pension fund. Employees are also required to contribute an amount equal to 4.5% of their salaries. As such, the total contribution rate is 9% of salaries per annum with both the employer and the employee splitting the 9% contribution equally. The employee contributions to the NP scheme are deductible in calculating taxable income.
National pension contribution is capped at a monthly salary of KRW 6,170,000, and the maximum monthly pension contribution to be paid by an employee is KRW 277,650 (subject to change every July) for the period from July 2024 to June 2025.
Foreigners working in Korea are required to contribute to the NP scheme unless there is a social security agreement between Korea and their home country and the individual remains under the home country social security scheme (_see Social security agreements under the section for more information_).
Foreign participants (with few exceptions) withdrawing from the NP scheme due to a permanent departure cannot get a refund unless their home country has a social security agreement with Korea, or applies the same treatment to Koreans on a reciprocity rule in the absence of a social security agreement. Social security contributions paid to a foreign country are not deductible against Korean income under the Korean income tax law.
### **National Health Insurance (NHI)**
In general, foreigners working in Korea are required to subscribe to the NHI program, which is mandatory for all foreign expatriates and employees who earn employment income in Korea.
Assuming the employee is enrolled as a 'workplace-based insured person' under the NHI scheme, as of 1 January 2025, the applicable premium rate, including long-term care insurance, is approximately 8.008% of the monthly wages (currently capped at a monthly contribution of KRW 9,579,760 in total, subject to change in 2026); split equally between employers and employees at approximately 4.004% each. The employee contributions to the NHI program are deductible in calculating taxable income.
By submitting relevant documents, certain foreigners can exempt themselves from the mandatory NHI scheme if they are already covered by insurance from their home country, foreign insurance company, or an employer that provides them with the equal or higher level of medical coverage as prescribed in the Korean NHI Law.
### Employment Insurance (EI) 
The obligation to contribute EI differs depending on the taxpayer's nationality and visa type. In general, a foreigner who holds a D-7, D-8, and D-9 (trade management) visa is required to participate in EI. Foreigners from certain countries are exempt from the EI obligation under a reciprocity principle, if the foreigner's home country does not require mandatory participation by Korean nationals' in the country's equivalent social security contribution.
Currently, the employee contribution rate for EI is 0.90% starting from July 2022, but the EI rate for employers varies starting from 1.15% to 1.75% depending on the number of employees and type of industry. In other words, in addition to the 0.90% contributions to EI, employers are required to make 0.25%~0.85% contributions to employment stabilisation insurance and occupational competency development insurance.
### Worker’s Accident Compensation Insurance (WCI) 
WCI is a state-run social security program for workers with work-related injuries, disease or disability, or any circumstance exposed to danger that can result in death while at work. Making contributions to WCI is compulsory only for employers. The contribution rate is imposed by the social security office considering working environments (currently from 0.56% to 18.56% of total wages and payroll, depending on the type of industry). 
### Other
There is also a severance pay system that requires no employee contribution. Severance pay, or retirement income, is taxed separately from global income.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
All corporations and individuals that supply goods or services, regardless of whether for profit or not, are subject to 10% VAT. VAT is levied on supplies of goods and services, and on the import of goods into the country.
Certain basic commodities such as farm products, health services, government transactions and other specified transactions are exempt from VAT. Exported goods are zero-rated, i.e. no VAT is applied on the final sale.
VAT is actually borne by the final consumers, because the taxpayer pays VAT on its purchases (input tax) but charges VAT on its sales (output tax). The tax to be paid to the authorities is the difference between the taxpayer’s output tax and input tax for a tax period.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
No net wealth/worth taxes exist in Korea at this time.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
The Inheritance and Gift Tax Law covers both gift tax and inheritance tax. Inheritance tax is imposed on the transfer of property without consideration as a result of death or if an individual is missing. Gift tax is imposed as a result of giving property with a donatives’ intent and receiving consideration less than the market value of the gift. The tax rates range from 10% to 50%, excluding local income tax, on the taxable income.
Gift tax is considered a supplement to inheritance tax. Thus gift tax is not imposed when inheritance tax has been imposed. If gift tax has already been imposed and inheritance tax is to be imposed on property including the gift property, the gift tax previously imposed is deducted from the inheritance tax.
No estate tax separate from inheritance tax exists in Korea.
## Property tax
An annual tax ranging from 0.07% to 5%, with some exceptions, is charged on the statutory value of land, buildings, houses, vessels and aircraft. Five times the property tax rate is applied to manufacturing facilities that are newly constructed or expanded in the Seoul metropolitan/concentrated area within five years after the relevant registration date.
## Acquisition tax
Acquisition tax is charged on the price of real estate, motor vehicles, construction equipment, golf membership, vessels, etc., of which acquisition cost exceeds KRW 500,000. The rate ranges from 1% to 12% for acquisition. A weighted rate is charged on acquisitions in the Seoul metropolitan/concentrated area or on acquisition of luxury items, such as villas, golf courses, and yachts.
## Luxury and consumption taxes
The individual consumption tax (ICT) is assessed on certain goods and activities as enumerated in the ICT Law. The ICT only applies to those individuals, entities, and businesses described in the ICT Law; all other goods and services are not subject to the ICT.
In principle, the ICT applies to a person who manufactures and distributes taxable goods; a person who sells taxable goods, except for the customer who may occasionally sell a taxable good; a person who moves imported goods out of a bonded area; operators of taxable places such as a race course, Turkish bath, golf course, casino, etc.; operators of taxable entertainment establishments such as a cabaret, night club, saloon, etc.
