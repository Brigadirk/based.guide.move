## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
Korea’s National Assembly approved the government's Bill to amend 15 tax laws, including the Corporate Income Tax Law (CITL), on 21 December 2023. The approved Bill includes measures to refine domestic global minimum tax rules, which are implemented from the fiscal year starting on or after 1 January 2024, and generally aligned with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two Model Rules and Administrative Guidance on the Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) Model Rules (note that the application of the Undertaxed Payment Rule [UTPR] will be delayed by one year, revising the effective date to 1 January 2025, in consideration of global progress in UTPR implementation). Furthermore, the Bill introduces new reporting requirements concerning offshore trusts and employee stock-based compensations to bolster regulations against tax avoidance.
The approved Bill includes amendments aimed at fostering corporate investment by extending and expanding the existing tax credits. Notably, the Bill adds bio-pharmacy to the list of designated national strategic technology sectors, such as semiconductors and secondary batteries, which are eligible for preferential higher rates of research and development (R&D) tax credits to qualifying expenditures and facility investments aimed at commercialising technologies. In addition, the Bill raises the basic deduction rate for video content production costs by two or three percentage points and provides an additional credit of 10% to 15% for expenditures meeting specific criteria. Additionally, a new tax credit is introduced for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and middle-scale enterprises investing in film, TV series, and over-the-top (OTT) content made through specialised companies in the cultural content industry. Moreover, the approved Bill reinstates tax credits for investments in overseas natural resource developments, which had been sunsetted in 2013. This move aims to support corporate investments in securing core minerals, extending the application of the tax credit until 2026.
Under the approved Bill, the application period for special tax for rural development is extended by ten years, lasting until 30 June 2034. This extension is intended to continuously enhance the industrial competitiveness of the agricultural and fisheries sector to cope with the expanded opening of the agricultural and fishery market.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
## Taxable period
In Korea, the taxable year is on a fiscal-year basis as elected by the taxpayer according to relevant law or articles of incorporation. However, it cannot exceed 12 months.
## Tax returns
A corporation must file an interim tax return with due payment for the first six months of the fiscal year, and the filing/payment must be made within two months after the end of the interim six-month period.
A corporation must file an annual tax return with due payment for the fiscal year, and the filing/payment must be made within three months (four months for the consolidated tax return) from the end of the fiscal year. In case the external audit is not completed and the financial statements are not fixed, a corporation can request for extension of tax filing by one month with delinquent interest of 2.9% per annum (effective for the period from 20 March 2023).
## Payment of tax
Generally, CIT amount should be paid by the due date for the tax return filing. However, where the tax amount to be paid by a resident corporation exceeds KRW 10 million but is KRW 20 million or less, the excess over KRW 10 million may be paid in instalments within one month from the tax return filing due date (two months for SMEs). 
Where the tax amount to be paid exceeds KRW 20 million, 50% or less of the tax amount may be paid in instalments.
## Functional currency
In instances where the taxpayer adopts to use a foreign currency as its functional currency according to K-GAAP or K-IFRS, there are three ways to calculate the CIT base: (i) calculate the tax base using the financial statements in functional currency and translate the tax base into Korean won based on either the announced foreign exchange rate as of a year-end or average foreign exchange rates for a year; (ii) prepare the financial statements in Korean won (as if the taxpayer does not use a foreign currency as its functional currency) and calculate the tax base; or (iii) compute the tax base in Korean won based on the balance sheet in functional currency converted into Korean won based on announced foreign exchange rate as of year-end and income statement in functional currency converted into Korean won based on announced foreign exchange rates as of each transaction date. Once elected, the same method must be consistently used.
## Tax audit process
There are two main categories of tax audits, periodic (regular) and non-periodic (special) tax audits. Periodic audit is conducted to verify compliance with tax obligations where an alleged non-compliance is found as a result of the tax compliance measurement analysis, where the random selection of sample items to be verified is used and where a company has not been subject to any tax audit for the last four years (i.e. period of audit cycle for large companies) or longer. Non-periodic audit is conducted where a taxpayer does not comply with tax compliance obligations under tax laws, where transactional facts are not in line with what was reported (e.g. transactions without authentic documentation, disguised or fictitious transactions), where concrete information on its tax evasion is reported, and where an obvious evidence of omission or error is found from the submitted documentation.
In case of a periodic audit, an official notification of an intended tax audit must be made 15 days prior to the audit. The notification must be given in writing with prescribed details, including tax items and period subject to audit and reason for examination.
## Statute of limitations for national tax assessment
The statute of limitations is generally five years from the statutory filing due date of the annual CIT return but is extended to seven years in case of ‘cross-border’ transactions when a party or parties to the transaction include(s) non-resident(s) or foreign corporation(s) (excluding domestic business places of non-resident(s) or foreign corporation(s)). However, the statute of limitations is extended further in the following cases:
  * Seven years if a taxpayer does not file its tax base by the statutory due date (ten years involving cross-border transactions).
  * Ten years if a taxpayer evades taxes by fraud or unjustifiable means (15 years involving cross-border transactions).


## Statute of limitation for collection of unpaid national taxes
The statute of limitation for the tax authorities’ collection of national taxes is five years (ten years for national tax payable worth KRW 500 million or more) from the date (e.g. tax return filing due in case of a self-assessed tax like CIT) on which the government’s right to collect a national tax becomes exercisable.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The recent topics of focus for tax authorities are as follows:
  * Implementation of new tax information reporting systems as planned in the BEPS project.
  * Increased tax audit on tax avoidance through internal transactions (including artificial avoidance of PE status) or gifts among group companies and major shareholders.
  * Focused audits aimed at booming or emerging industries and new forms of tax evasion schemes based on online platforms.
  * Increased scrutiny over the prevention of offshore tax evasion through a cross-border tax information exchange program.
  * Selection of tax audit targets through a sophisticated analysis and verification system by adding new measures, including accounting transparency such as auditor's opinion, hours spent for external audit, etc.
  * Increased application of forensic and electronic audit schemes and use of big data analysis to examine potential tax avoidance.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
A corporation having its head office or principal office in Korea is a resident corporation. A corporation with a place of effective management in Korea is also treated as a resident corporation.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The term 'permanent establishment' is defined as any fixed place of business in Korea where the business of a foreign entity is wholly or partly carried on.
The following places will trigger a PE of a foreign entity, among others:
  * The place where the employee(s) of the foreign entity provides services in Korea for more than six months within 12 consecutive months.
  * The place where the employee(s) of the foreign entity continuously or repeatedly renders similar services in Korea for two or more years, even if each service visit is for less than six months within 12 consecutive months.


Also, in the absence of a fixed place in Korea, if a foreign entity has a dependent agent in Korea (i) who has the authority to conclude contracts on its behalf and who has repeatedly exercised that authority or (ii) who, even if having no such authority, repeatedly performs a principal role in the course of concluding contracts, it will be deemed to have a PE in Korea.
Exceptions to a PE in Korea for a non-resident corporation are limited to specific places of business used only for preparatory or auxiliary nature, and such fixed places include purchasing or storage of goods not for sale, advertising, publicity, collecting or furnishing of information, etc. Even though the specific place where activities of preparatory or auxiliary nature are performed, it could be regarded as a PE in one of the following cases:
  * A foreign entity or its foreign related party has a Korea PE at the same place where the specific place for preparatory or auxiliary activities exists or at a different place in Korea and the activities performed via the PE and the specific place are complementary to each other.
  * Even if the foreign entity or its foreign related entity has no PE in Korea, the activities of the specific places exceed preparatory or auxiliary nature as a whole.


Liaison offices of foreign corporations that undertake non-sales functions (e.g. market survey, collection of market information) in Korea are subject to new reporting requirements. With effect from 1 January 2022, these liaison offices must prepare the required information, such as its status, head office, as of 31 December of each year and submit it to the Korean tax authorities by 10 February of the following year. With effect from 1 July 2022, they are required to submit the information on input value-added tax (VAT) invoices received from supplier.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
In general, expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business are deductible, subject to the requirements for the maintenance of support documents.
A corporation’s disbursements of more than KRW 30,000 for goods or services provided are required to be supported by qualifying payment evidence, such as credit card sales vouchers, cash receipts, tax invoices, and those vouchers and invoices stored in the company’s enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. The corporation is required to maintain these documents for five years (seven years if cross-border transactions were involved). If the corporation fails to maintain proper evidence, a 2% penalty shall be levied on the amount of disbursement (subject to a ceiling per year).
Accrued expenses are not deductible until the expenses are fixed or determined.
## Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation of all property, plant, and equipment (PP&E), which includes buildings, machinery, and vehicles, used in business to generate income is allowed as a deduction for CIT. Generally, interest on debt acquired to purchase, manufacture, or construct PP&E must be capitalised until the PP&E is operational. This does not apply to the interest associated with the expansion or improvement of existing PP&E. A detailed list of fixed assets, gross values (including capitalised interest), the useful lives of the assets, and the current year’s depreciation charge must be submitted to the tax authorities when filing the annual CIT return.
The tax law allows the following methods for calculating depreciation:
  * Straight-line or declining-balance method for tangible fixed assets, other than plant and buildings.
  * Straight-line method for plant, buildings, and intangible assets.
  * Service-output or straight-line method for mining rights.
  * Service-output, declining-balance, or straight-line method for tangible fixed assets used in mining.


In determining depreciation using a straight-line method, salvage value of the assets is regarded as zero. However, where the declining-balance method is used, 5% salvage value is required. Changes in the depreciation method must be approved by the tax authorities in advance, and such approval may only be obtained in exceptional cases (i.e. merger between two corporations having different depreciation methods). Although the tax law specifies the standard useful lives for each type of assets, the useful life of a fixed asset can be increased or decreased by 25% of the standard useful life at the taxpayer’s election. The elected depreciation method and useful life should be consistently applied. Also, a taxpayer can apply for a change to the useful life within 50% of the standard useful life, which requires an approval from tax authorities.
The standard useful life and the scope of elective useful life for assets are provided in the following tables:
Tangible fixed assets | Standard useful life (years) | Scope of elective useful life (years)  
---|---|---  
Vehicles (excluding those used for transportation businesses and leasing service of machinery, equipment, and consumer goods), tools, equipment, and fixtures | 5 | 4 to 6  
Ships and aircraft (excluding those used for fishery, transportation, and leasing service of machinery, equipment, and consumer goods) | 12 | 9 to 15  
All buildings and constructions of brick structure, block structure, concrete structure, mud structure, mud wall structure, wooden structure, wooden frame mortar structure, and other structures | 20 | 15 to 25  
All the buildings and constructions of steel-frame/iron bar concrete structures, stone structures, brick/stone structures, steel-frame structures | 40 | 30 to 50  
Note that machinery and equipment used for specific industries shall be subject to different useful lives from four years (e.g. bag manufacturing) to 20 years (e.g. water supply service).
Intangible fixed assets | Useful life (years)  
---|---  
Goodwill, design rights, utility model rights, trademarks | 5  
Patents | 7  
Fishery rights, extraction rights under the law of development of mineral resources at the sea bottom (may elect activity method), right of management for toll roads, water rights, right of use for electricity and gas service facilities, right of use for tap water facilities for industrial use, right of use for general tap water facilities, right of use for heating facilities | 10  
Mining rights (may elect activity method), right of use for exclusive telegraph and telephone facilities, right of use for exclusive sidetracks, right of management for sewage disposal, right of management for tap water facilities | 20  
Right of use for dams | 50  
Note that for used fixed assets (including assets acquired through mergers or spin-offs) that have been used for more than half of their standard useful lives, a new useful life may be filed with the tax authorities of between 50% of the standard useful life and the standard useful life.
According to the CITL, depreciation is generally allowed for tax deduction only when expensed for book purposes. However, in order to alleviate any dramatic increase in tax burden due to decreased depreciation expenses through the adoption of K-IFRS, additional expense deduction may be allowed through tax adjustment. For tax purposes, depreciable assets acquired by a company adopting K-IFRS on or before 2013 may be depreciated up to the tax deduction limit computed without the adoption of K-IFRS. Depreciable assets acquired by a company adopting K-IFRS after 2014 may be depreciated using the standard useful lives only if they are the same type of existing assets used for the same business line and the calculation method of deduction is regulated.
## Deduction of company car expenses
For company cars provided to officers or employees (whether owned or leased), the CITL requires a company to have appropriate operation records or sufficient evidence supporting the usage for company business purposes in order to claim the deduction of company car expenses. Without the maintenance of operation records, a company is allowed to deduct company car expenses up to KRW 15 million per year. Out of company car expenses, the deduction of the depreciation of a company car is limited to KRW 8 million annually for CIT purpose. In addition, the deduction of company car expenses, including depreciation, shall be disallowed for the portion of private use as evidenced by operation records.
## Goodwill
Amortisable goodwill for tax purposes is defined as ‘value transferred with consideration, apart from transferred assets included in business transfer, valuated appropriately by considering business premium factors of the transferor such as permission/licence, legal privileges, geographical advantages, trade secrets, credit, reputation, transaction partners, etc.' Goodwill shall be amortised over five years using the straight-line method for tax purposes.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses, such as incorporation expenses, founders’ salary, and registration fees and taxes, are deductible if the expenses are recorded per the articles of incorporation and are actually paid.
## Interest expenses
Interest incurred in the ordinary course of business is deductible as long as the related loan is used for business purposes. There are, however, a number of exceptions to the general rule, as follows:
  * If a company’s borrowings from an overseas controlling shareholder, or from a third party under a payment guarantee by the shareholder, exceed two times (six times in case of banking business) the equity invested by the shareholder, the interest and discount as to the relevant excessive borrowing will be disallowed and further treated as a dividend to the shareholder (in case of the borrowings from the shareholder).
  * If a company’s net interest expense for the borrowings from foreign related parties exceeds 30% of the company’s adjusted taxable income, the excess interest shall be treated as non-deductible expense.
  * If the interest expense on a hybrid financial instrument paid by a company to a foreign entity is not included in the taxable income of the foreign entity within an appropriate period (as designated by the tax law), it shall be included in the taxable income of the company for the year when the appropriate period ends.
  * Debenture for which the creditor is unknown.
  * Bonds and securities on which recipient of interest is unknown.
  * Construction loans and loans for the purchase of land and fixed assets up to the date on which the assets are acquired or completed must be capitalised as a part of the cost of the asset and depreciated over the life of the asset. Interest after the date of completion or acquisition is deductible as incurred.
  * Interest on loans related to non-business purpose assets or funds loaned to related parties.
  * Interest on related-party loans if the period from the borrowing date to interest payment date exceeds one year.


## Contingent liabilities
In general, contingent liabilities are not deductible, except for reserves under the following items, which are counted as deductible expense within the tax limit:
  * Reserves for bad debts.
  * Liability reserves and emergency reserves prescribed in the Insurance Business Law.
  * Reserves for cash surrender value made by insurance companies under the Insurance Business Act.
  * Reserves for non-profit organisations.
  * Reserves for the write-off of a compensation claim set aside by trust guarantee funds, etc. as stipulated under tax law in each business year.


The amounts enumerated below are also counted as deductible expenses in calculating income for the business year:
  * The amount of gains from insurance claims used to acquire the same kinds of fixed assets as the lost fixed assets, or to improve the damaged fixed assets within two years after the first day of the business year following the business year in which the gains fall.
  * The amount of a beneficiary’s share of construction costs received by a domestic corporation engaged in the electricity or gas business, etc. used for the acquisition of fixed assets.
  * The amount of certain national treasury subsidies actually used for acquisition or improvement of fixed assets for business.


## Bad debt
For companies that are not financial institutions, a doubtful accounts reserve is allowed as a deduction for tax purposes at the greater of 1% on the tax book value of the receivables at a year-end or actual bad debt ratio (deductible bad debts in a current year divided by the tax book value of receivables as of the preceding year-end). Bad debts are allowed as a deduction when certain legal proceedings are satisfied or the statute of limitations for the claims has lapsed.
## Charitable contributions
Donations to public interest entities, such as government bodies and social welfare organisations, as well as donations for academic research, technical development, etc., are classified as donations subject to the 50% limitation, which are tax-deductible at up to 50% of the taxable income for the concerned fiscal year after deduction of net operating loss (NOL). Other qualified donations to public entities prescribed by the CITL are also tax-deductible at up to 10% of the taxable income for the fiscal year after the deduction of donations subject to the 50% limitation and NOL.
The amount in excess of such deduction limit may be carried over for ten years. Donations other than the above qualified donations will not be deductible for tax purposes.
## Employee remuneration
There is no statutory limit for employee remuneration as long as it is reasonable, which includes salaries, wages, stipends, bonuses (except bonuses paid based on the disposition of accumulated profits), retirement payments, pensions, and meal and housing allowances, as well as all other kinds of subsidies, payments, and compensation. Remuneration of foreign employees is determined according to their employment contracts.
## Pension expense
Employers hiring one or more employees are required to set aside severance pay or retirement pensions for their employees. Defined contribution (DC) and defined benefits (DB) are the two available schemes for the retirement pension system. Under the DC scheme, the premiums paid by the employer are deductible upon payment, while deductions for the reserve under the DB scheme are subject to a tax deduction limit.
## Payment for executives or directors
Bonuses paid to executives or directors in excess of the amount determined in the articles of incorporation or payment policy resolved at a shareholders’ meeting, etc. or bonuses paid based on the disposition of accumulated profits are not deductible. Also, severance benefits paid to directors in excess of the amount determined in the articles of incorporation or payment policy resolved at a shareholders’ meeting, etc. or the amount prescribed in the tax law in absence of relevant article under the articles of incorporation or payment policy are not deductible.
## Entertainment expenses
Entertainment expenses (renamed to corporate business promotion expenses, effective 1 January 2024) of more than KRW 30,000 (KRW 200,000 in case of expenditure for congratulations and condolences) on an event basis must be supported by corporate credit card vouchers, cash receipts, or tax invoices in order to be deductible. In addition, the entertainment expenses in excess of the tax limit are not deductible. 
The deductible limit for entertainment expenses in a business year is computed as:
  * an amount calculated by multiplying KRW 12 million (KRW 36 million for an SME) by the number of months in the respective business year divided by 12, plus
  * an amount calculated by multiplying the sales revenue for a year by the rates listed in the following table (in the case of transactions between related parties, 10% of the amount calculated by multiplying the sales revenue by the following rates shall be applied).

Amount of gross receipts (KRW) | Rate  
---|---  
10 billion or less | 0.3%  
Over 10 billion up to 50 billion | KRW 30 million + 0.2% of the excess over KRW 10 billion  
Greater than 50 billion | KRW 110 million + 0.03% of the excess over KRW 50 billion  
## Insurance premiums
Insurance premiums paid to an insurance company are deductible if the business enterprise is the listed beneficiary. Insurance premiums for which the beneficiary is the employee are also deductible; however, they are treated as salaries for the employees and are subject to WHT on earned income (this excludes the severance insurance premium or social security taxes that are borne by employers).
## Fines and penalties
Fines, penalties, and interest on underpayment of taxes are not deductible.
## Taxes
Income taxes are generally not deductible in determining income subject to CIT.
## Net operating losses (NOLs)
In general, an NOL carryforward is allowed for 15 years for the NOL incurred in the fiscal year starting on or after 1 January 2020 (10 years for the NOL incurred in the fiscal year starting on or after 1 January 2009). The CITL restricts a company from deducting the NOL in excess of 80% of the taxable income for the fiscal year beginning 1 January 2023 and thereafter. NOL carryforward of a Korean branch of a foreign company is also restricted to 80% of current-year taxable income. However, SMEs and certain qualifying companies under recovery process, etc., which will be exempt from this rule, are allowed to deduct the NOL carried over from prior years without limitation. Generally, NOL carryback is not allowed. However, SMEs can elect to carry back an NOL for one year if they have duly filed tax returns for the year when NOL was incurred and the preceding year.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
With sufficient supporting documentation and under the arm’s-length principle, interest, royalty, and management service fees paid to foreign affiliates are deductible for CIT purposes.
Under the LCITA, the following conditions must be met in order for intra-group service fees, such as a management service fee charged by a foreign related party to a domestic company, to be deductible:
  * The services must be provided based on an agreement entered into by the service provider prior to the provision of service.
  * The provision of the service can be verified by a schedule of services, description of services, description of the company providing services and its employees, detailed explanation of expenses incurred, and other supporting documentation.
  * A company must be able to anticipate the company’s additional profit or reduced expense through the services provided by a foreign affiliate.
  * Payment for the provided services should be consistent with arm’s-length standards.




# Korea, Republic of
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
The consolidated corporate tax filing system can be adopted for a domestic corporation in cases where two or more wholly owned subsidiaries exist. A taxpayer may elect the consolidated filing scheme upon approval from the tax authorities, but it cannot be revoked for at least five years after the election of the consolidated tax filing.
## Transfer pricing
The LCITA authorises the tax authorities to adjust the transfer price based on an arm’s-length price and to determine or recalculate the taxable income of a domestic company (including PE of a foreign company) when the transfer price for the transaction between the domestic company and its foreign related party is either below or above an arm's-length price.
The LCITA lists the following methods for determining an arm's-length price: the comparable uncontrolled price (CUP) method, the resale price method, the cost-plus method, the profit-split method, the transactional net margin method, and other reasonable methods. Other reasonable methods can be used only if it is unfeasible to apply one of the aforementioned methods.
The method used and the reason for adopting that particular one for an arm's-length price determination, as well as the details of international transactions and condensed income statement of foreign related parties having the transaction with a taxpayer, must be submitted to the tax authorities by a taxpayer in the prescribed forms within six months from the end of the month that a fiscal year-end date belongs to. However, the disclosure requirement will be exempt if the transaction amount for each type of disclosures does not exceed an annual threshold (e.g. in case of the details of international transactions, KRW 5 billion for goods and KRW 1 billion for services as well as intangibles, respectively). The exemption from the requirement will apply to transactions made in fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2023. 
To address consistency with international standards on transfer pricing rules, the tax reform for 2019 introduces a new rule to clarify and establish the principles for determining the arm’s-length prices of the transactions involving intangibles and addressing an appropriate remuneration for the functions performed, such as development, enhancement, maintenance, protection, and exploitation of intangibles. The principles of determining the arm’s-length price in a cross-border intangible transaction and addressing an appropriate remuneration in the transaction provide that the comparable uncontrolled price (CUP) method or profit split method would take precedence over other transfer pricing methods; and the companies performing the functions and assuming the relevant risks regarding the development, enhancement, maintenance, protection, and exploitation of intangibles should get appropriate remuneration for the contributions they made.
### Transfer pricing documentation requirement
In line with the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action 13, the LCITA includes a reporting requirement for multinational companies in Korea to submit a consolidated report (including local file and master file) on their cross-border, related-party transactions, affecting not only Korean corporations but also foreign corporations having a PE in Korea that meet all of the following conditions: (i) annual gross sales of a Korean company or a Korean branch exceeding KRW 100 billion and (ii) international related-party transactions exceeding KRW 50 billion per year. Required information to be submitted for reporting includes organisation, business, intangible assets, related-party transactions, etc. relating to the group and the local entity. Failure to comply with the reporting requirement will result in a penalty and eventually lead to the assessment of an estimated tax. A penalty of up to KRW 100 million is imposed for failing to submit the documentation or for submitting incorrect information. A penalty of up to KRW 200 million may be imposed every 30 days after the first penalty assessment was imposed until the documentation is submitted, depending on the lateness of the submission.
The LCITA introduces the requirement to submit country-by-country (CbC) reporting following the implementation of the transfer pricing rules requiring multinationals in Korea to submit local files and master files on their cross-border transactions. The CbC report must be filed within 12 months from the month following the month that the fiscal year-end of a domestic company belongs to unless exemption under the LCITA is applicable.
## Thin capitalisation
In cases where a Korean company borrows from its overseas-controlling shareholder and the debt-to-equity ratio exceeds 2:1 (6:1 in case of financial institutions), a portion of interest expense on the excess borrowing is characterised as dividends to the shareholder subject to Korean WHT (reduced rate if a tax treaty applies) while being treated as non-deductible in computing taxable income of the company.
In line with the OECD’s recommendation on the limitation of interest deductions (BEPS Action 4), the new rule shall restrict interest deduction on top of the existing thin capitalisation rule. Deduction of net interest (i.e. the amount of interest expense paid to overseas related parties minus the interest income received from overseas related parties) claimed by a domestic company for the borrowing from foreign related parties shall be limited to 30% of the adjusted taxable income (i.e. taxable income before depreciation and net interest expenses) of the domestic company. If both the thin capitalisation rule and 30% interest deduction rule apply, the rule triggering the larger amount to be disallowed is applicable.
## Controlled foreign corporations (CFCs)
Under the Korean CFC rule, when a Korean national or company directly or indirectly owns at least 10% in a foreign corporation and the foreign company’s average effective income tax rate for the three most recent consecutive years is 16.8% or less (the level of 70% of the top marginal CIT rate of 24% at present from the tax year beginning on or after 1 January 2023), the undistributed earnings of the CFC shall be deemed to be paid as a dividend to the Korean national thereby subject to CIT in Korea.
_For more information on the CFC rule, see Foreign income in the_ _section_.
### Special tax treatment on income attributed to an overseas transparent entity
Effective 1 January 2023, a new rule shall allow a special tax treatment on income attributed to an overseas transparent entity in the hands of a Korean resident or company to prevent the possibility that overseas investments of the resident or company might be subject to foreign income tax that would arise as a result of the reverse-hybrid entity rules in foreign countries. Under the new rule, the term ‘overseas transparent entity’ that is eligible for the special tax treatment refers to an entity that meets the following two requirements: (i) it should be a foreign corporation under item 3 of Article 2 of the CITL, an overseas investment vehicle under Article 93-2 of the CITL, or an unincorporated association established in a foreign country and treated like a corporation under Korean tax laws (the ’foreign corporation, etc.’), and (ii) a shareholder, an investor, or a beneficiary in the foreign corporation, etc. (the ’investor‘) rather than the foreign corporation should be directly liable for tax on income derived by the foreign corporation, etc. according to the tax laws of the country where the foreign corporation, etc. was established. To obtain the special tax treatment, a resident or a domestic corporation that is the investor in the overseas transparent entity must file an application with the concerned district tax office. Upon application for the special tax treatment, the income attributed to an overseas transparent entity is considered to be attributed to a Korean resident or company and subject to income tax under domestic tax laws.
## Deduction limit on hybrid financial instruments
In a commitment to implement the hybrid mismatch rules recommended by the OECD (BEPS Action 2), a new rule was introduced in 2018 to limit expense deductions for hybrid mismatch arrangements. Hybrid financial instruments include financial instruments that are treated as a debt in Korea but treated as an equity in a foreign country. In principle, interest expense deduction for Korean tax purposes will be denied for the amount of payment that is not taxed in a counterpart jurisdiction. Domestic corporations that engage in transactions of prescribed hybrid financial instruments shall submit a statement of adjustments to interest expenses concerning hybrid financial instruments by the filing due date of the CIT return for the relevant fiscal year. Effective 1 January 2023, a new penalty of up to KRW 30 million per instrument shall be imposed against the failure to comply with the submission requirement.
## Related-party transactions
Under the CITL, the tax authorities may recalculate the corporation’s taxable income when CIT is considered to be unreasonably reduced due to transactions with related parties not in accordance with fair market value. Generally, if the discrepancy between the transaction price and fair market value exceeds the lesser of 5% of the fair market value or KRW 300 million, the transaction will be subject to this provision.


# Korea, Republic of
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
In general, a branch office of a foreign corporation is taxed for Korean-source business profits in the same manner as resident companies.
Remittance of accumulated profits or retained earnings from a Korean branch to its foreign head office is subject to reporting to a designated foreign exchange bank in Korea under the Foreign Exchange Transaction Act.
If the tax treaty between Korea and the country in which a foreign head office is residing allows the imposition of a branch profits tax, the tax is imposed on the adjusted taxable income of the Korean branch.
Where applicable, the branch profits tax is levied in addition to the regular CIT, which is imposed at the rate of 20% (or at a reduced rate as provided in an applicable tax treaty).

## Foreign tax credit
Taxes imposed by foreign governments on income recognised by a resident taxpayer are allowed as a credit within the limit against the income taxes to be paid in Korea. The excess foreign tax credit can be carried forward for up to ten years from the fiscal year starting 1 January 2021.
Indirect foreign tax credit is also available for a Korean parent company in cases where the dividends from a foreign subsidiary are included in the taxable income of the Korean parent company. For dividends received on or after 1 January 2023, the conditions on the indirect tax credit loosen the required shareholding ratio for a foreign subsidiary to 10% or more from 25% or more. Foreign subsidiaries eligible for the indirect foreign tax credit shall be limited to those where a domestic parent has been directly holding 10% of the subsidiary’s outstanding shares for at least six months as of the dividend record date, effective 1 January 2023.
## Special tax exemptions for SMEs
A special deduction on corporate taxes is available for SMEs when they are engaged in a qualified business. The tax deduction ratio ranges from 5% to 30%, depending on corporate location, size, business types, etc., with a cap of KRW 100 million if the number of regular employees does not decease. This incentive is applied to taxable income arising in the tax years that end before 31 December 2022.
A 50% to 100% reduction of CIT is available for new start-up SMEs for the first five years, provided that they are located in areas other than metropolitan and overpopulated ones and engage in specified businesses (including but not limited to manufacturing, mining, restaurants, audio-video production, telecommunications, computer programming, advertising, and amusement facilities, excluding a company trading crypto currency).
## Investment incentives
### Integrated investment tax incentive system
Under the previous investment tax incentive schemes, various tax credits were available for qualified investments in some specified categories of facilities for research and testing, vocational training, productivity enhancement, safety and protection, energy saving, new growth-engine technology commercialisation, etc. as well as qualified investments in certain business assets acquired by SMEs, etc. Under the new tax credit scheme effective from 1 January 2021, they have been simplified and integrated into a single investment tax incentive scheme. 
The integrated investment tax credit scheme has replaced the previous positive list of qualified investments with a negative list system whereby the investment tax credit should be generally available for most of business-purpose tangible assets and certain listed intangible assets.
However, specified industries and assets will be excluded from the integrated investment tax incentive if they are specifically prohibited under tax laws or subordinate rules. The scope of specified industries ineligible for the integrated investment tax incentive includes real estate rental and supply, as well as consumption service businesses hotels, certain entertainment bars, and other businesses for entertainment purposes, etc. The scope of the assets for business purposes ineligible for the investment tax credit (‘non-qualifying business assets’) includes land, buildings, and other tangible business assets as listed in the enforcement rule (e.g. vehicles, carriages, tools, appliances and fixtures, ships, aircraft, buildings, including auxiliary installations and structures). It also contains the scope of the business assets to which the integrated tax credit will exceptionally apply even if they fall in the category of non-qualifying business assets. They include:
  * facilities used for research and development (R&D) and human resources development, energy conservation, and environment preservation, as specified in the enforcement rule, and
  * certain vehicles and transport equipment and vessels directly used by SMEs mainly engaging transportation business, vessels directly used by SMEs mainly engaging in fishing industry, certain construction machinery directly used by a construction company, etc.


This tax credit scheme allows a basic credit for qualifying investment for a current year plus an additional credit of 3% (limited to twice the basic credit amount) for incremental investment over the average investment for the previous three years. The basic credit rate is 1% (5% for middle-scale companies and 10% for SMEs), while the higher rate of 3% (6% for middle-scale companies and 12% for SMEs) shall apply to investment in facilities to commercialise new growth and source technologies. For qualified investment to commercialise national strategic technologies, such as semiconductor, secondary battery, and vaccine, the basic tax credit of 15% (25% for SMEs) shall be applied to such investment made after 1 January 2023 until 31 December 2024. In addition to the base credit, the additional tax credit at a rate of 3% (4% for investment in national strategic technologies) shall be applied to such investment while it shall not exceed two times the amount of basic credit. Under the temporary investment tax credit reintroduced in 2023 since it expired 12 years ago, further hiked basic credit rates of 3% to 25% and additional credit rate of 10% will only be applicable to investment made in a fiscal year that 31 December 2023 belongs to.
### Tax credit for production costs of video contents
The Korean tax law provides tax credits for expenses incurred to product or manufacture specific broadcasting programs and films, such as television dramas, animations, documentaries, etc., and theatre movies ('video contents including video on over-the-top service') until the end of December 2022. On qualifying production costs of video contents, the applicable credit rates are 5% for large companies, 10% for middle-scale companies, and 15% for SMEs. With effect from 1 January 2024, an additional tax credit of 10% will be extended to large and middle-scale companies, with a further incentive of 15% for SMEs, provided they fulfil the criteria outlined in the Presidential Decree.
### **New tax credit for investment in cultural content business**
Where an SME or a middle-scale company invests in films, TV series, and over-the-top (OTT) contents through a specialised cultural contents business company during the period between 1 January 2024 and 31 December 2025, a tax credit is available at 3% of the investment amount multiplied by the ratio of qualifying expenditures to the invested amount. Qualifying expenditures refers to certain expenditures used for the production of video contents prescribed in the Enforcement Decree, excluding entertainment expenses, advertising and public relations costs, and specific labour-related expenses, such as severance allowances. 
### Tax credit for increasing employment
The STTCL provides for a tax incentive for increasing the number of full-time employees from the preceding year, with certain limits. The tax credit will not apply to companies engaged in businesses falling under the category of consumption-oriented services (e.g. entertainment and beverage service). In case of certain employees, including youth employee, disabled employee, or employee over 60 years old, the amount of tax credit varies up to KRW 11 million (KRW 12 million in non-metropolitan area) per increased full-time employee for SMEs, up to KRW 8 million for middle-scale companies, and up to KRW 4 million for large companies. In case of new hire of other full-time employees, the tax credit amount (subject to ceiling based on the total number of increased full-time employee) is KRW 4 million per increased full-time employee for middle-scale companies and KRW 7 million for SMEs (KRW 7.7 million for SMEs in non-metropolitan area). The tax credit is applied to taxable income of the fiscal year of employment increase and the two subsequent years (for a large company, only one subsequent year). The unused tax credit can be carried forward to the next ten years. This tax credit is applicable for increase in full-time employment until the end of the 2024 fiscal year.
### Tax credit for increase in corporate payroll
The tax law applies tax credits at 10% for middle-scale companies and 20% for SMEs on the excess of an increase in corporate payroll in a year over an increase in average corporate payroll in the preceding three years (subject to certain requirements, including an increase in the number of full-time employees in a year as compared to the number of the employees in the preceding year). The tax credit is applicable until the year that 31 December 2025 belongs to. The unused tax credit can be carried forward to the next ten years.
### Integrated employment-related tax credit
An integrated employment tax credit regime has been introduced in January 2023 to replace various tax credits aimed at encouraging employment and job creation. Previously, a number of tax credits separately applied to qualifying companies where there was an increase in the number of full-time employees from the preceding year, retired female employees were re-hired in SMEs and middle-scale companies, non-regular jobs were transitioned into regular ones, or employees returned to their job after parental leave. Under the integrated tax credit system, most companies, except those operating in consumption-oriented service businesses, will be entitled to a tax credit (subject to a ceiling) for an increase in certain qualifying employees, including youth employee, disabled employee, etc., at KRW 4 million for large companies, KRW 8 million for middle-scale companies, and KRW 14.5 million for SMEs (KRW 15.5 million for SMEs relating to the increase in a non-metropolitan area) and a tax credit for an increase in other full-time employees at KRW 4.5 million for middle-scale companies and KRW 8.5 million for SMEs (KRW 9.5 million for SMEs relating to the increase in a non-metropolitan area) in the year of employment and the following one year (the following two years for SMEs and middle-scale companies) in the event of a net increase in the number of employees until the year that 31 December 2025 belongs to. For this tax credit, the age range of youth employee is expanded to be between 15 and 34 years (rather than 29 years previously) to promote the youth employment, while the tax credit will also be applicable to women with career interruptions. However, if the number of full-time workers decreases within two years after applying the credit, an amount equal to the tax credit claimed will be collected.
## Research and development (R&D) tax incentives
To stimulate R&D activities, the STTCL provides tax incentives of tax credits. Among many other available incentives, tax credits for R&D activities are favoured by many Korean companies. These include a tax credit for research and manpower development expenses, a tax credit for technology transfer, and tax credits for merger or acquisition of a technology innovative SME. As a percentage of total tax incentives for corporate investment in Korea, the R&D tax credit is the largest. Korea was placed in 2020 among the OECD countries that provide the largest level of total government support to business R&D as a percentage of GDP, at a rate equivalent to 0.29% of GDP, according to the latest report published by the OECD ('R&D Tax Incentives: Korea, 2023'). Moreover, business enterprise expenditures on R&D amounted to 3.9% of gross domestic product in Korea in 2021, which is more than double the OECD average and the second highest business R&D intensity according to the OECD Reviews of Innovation Policy: Korea 2023.
### Tax credit for development of research and manpower
Under the STTCL, R&D expenditures qualified for tax credit shall be categorised into three technology areas, such as the general area, new growth engine and core technology area, and national strategic industry technology area. The category of technologies for national strategic industry that has been introduced for R&D expenditures incurred on or after 1 July 2021 specifically includes the semiconductor, secondary battery, vaccine, hydrogen, and future mobility sectors, which are fundamental to the national economy and other industries.
Companies presently elect to claim a tax credit in relation to qualifying R&D expenditure at either (i) 0% to 2% (8% for middle-scale companies, 25% for SMEs, and 15%/10% for companies disqualified from SMEs during the grace periods) of the current R&D expenses or (ii) 25% (40% for middle-scale companies, 50% for SMEs) of the incremental portion of the R&D expenses in a current year over the expense in the previous year. The incremental method can be applied only when the R&D expenses for the prior year exceed the average R&D expenses for the previous four years. However, for the R&D expenditures in qualified new growth engine and core source technology areas designated in the Presidential Decree (e.g. future automobile technology, artificial intelligence including block-chain technology and quantum computing, next generation software and information security, robotics including wearable robots, air and aerospace technology, bio-health, and carbon-neutral, etc.), the preferred credit rates ranging from 20% to 40% will apply, depending on the type of company. The highest rates of tax credit (that are 10% higher than the credit rates for new growth or source technologies) shall be allowed for qualifying R&D expenditure related to national strategic industry technologies prescribed in the Presidential Decree, applicable to expenditure incurred on or after 1 July 2021. The unused credit can be carried forward to the next ten years.
### Tax credit for technology transfer among SMEs (Korean patent box regime)
Tax credit and reductions have been introduced to facilitate the transfer of technology between companies so as to enhance technical competencies and the recovery of funds invested in technology more efficiently. CIT on income derived by SMEs and specified middle-scale companies from the transfer of patents, etc. to a Korean national is reduced by 50%. The tax law also grants a 25% exemption of CIT on income derived by SMEs and middle-scale companies from the leasing of patents or utility model rights where the company has first filed a registration of such rights. This temporary credit is applicable to transfers or leases taking place until the end of December 2026. The unused credit can be carried forward to the next ten years.
### Tax credit for merger or acquisition of a technology innovative SME
In cases where a domestic company merges with a technology innovative SME in a qualified manner, the merger company shall be permitted to take a 10% tax credit with respect to the payment made for the merger, up to the value of the acquired technology. This 10% tax credit will also be available for a company that acquires shares in a technology innovative SME in a qualified manner no later than the end of December 2024. In this case, if any of requirements for a qualified manner fails to be met, the amount of tax credited will be collected. The unused credit can be carried forward to the next ten years.
## Corporate restructuring incentives
### Tax deferral for qualified merger
In principle, a merger is considered a taxable transfer of assets and liabilities of a merged company to a surviving company or a new company. Mergers of two domestic corporations are eligible for deferred taxation on the gain from the taxable transfer when meeting certain requirements (e.g. business operation for at least one year prior to the merger registration date, at least 80% of the merger consideration must be paid in the stocks of the surviving company, business continuation until at least the last day of the fiscal year when the merger is registered, and continuous employment of at least 80% of employees of the merged company by the surviving company).
For those mergers meeting the requirements for tax deferral (‘qualified merger’), the recognition of gain from the transfer of assets and liabilities from a dissolving company is deferred unless a certain event occurs. If, within two years from the date of the merger, the surviving company disposes of or discontinues the business of the merged company, or the shareholders of the merged company dispose of their shares, or, within three years from the date of the merger, the number of employees of the surviving company falls under 80% of the aggregate number of employees of the merged and surviving companies as of one month before the registration date, the tax deferral on the gains upon a qualified merger shall be immediately terminated and deferred taxes shall be recaptured, while the gain for the fair market value of the assets and liabilities transferred from a dissolving over their tax book value will be included in taxable income of a surviving company and other tax attributes (e.g. tax credits carried over from a dissolving company) claimed by a surviving company will be recaptured.
## Inbound investment incentives
The Korean government intends to embrace the BEPS initiatives taken by the OECD. In the tax reform for 2019, most inbound incentives and benefits available for foreign direct investment (FDI) have been abolished. Based on the former STTCL, they include 100% exemption from individual or corporate income tax for the first five years and a 50% reduction in such taxes for the following two years in proportion to the foreign shareholding ratio for foreign-invested companies that engage in certain qualified high-technology businesses and foreign investors in specially designated areas, such as foreign investment zones, free economic zones, free trade zones, and strategic industrial complexes exclusively developed for foreign invested companies.
However, the existing local tax, customs duty, and VAT exemptions have been sustained for qualifying foreign investment. They include the exemption from local taxes, such as the acquisition tax and the property tax on the property acquired by a qualified foreign invested company for up to 15 years, as well as the exemption from customs duties, import VAT, and individual consumption tax on imported capital goods.


# Korea, Republic of
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
A foreign corporation with income derived from sources in Korea is subject to normal CIT rates on such income if it has a Korean PE. If a foreign corporation has no PE in Korea, it will be subject to tax on its Korean-source income on a withholding basis in accordance with the tax laws and the relevant tax treaty, if applicable. 
With effect from 1 January 2023, non-residents or foreign corporations without a PE in Korea and a qualified overseas financial institution (as approved by the Korean tax authority) are exempt from WHT on Korean-source interest income and capital gains derived from government bonds, currency stabilisation bonds, and other bonds specified in the Enforcement Decree of the CITL. The non-resident or foreign corporation and qualified overseas financial institution must file an application with a district tax office to receive the tax exemption. Where a Korean resident or a domestic corporation is included among the investors in an overseas collective investment vehicle that meets the requirements specified in the CITL and its Enforcement Decree, the domestic investors must file and pay tax directly on the interest income and capital gains that are exempt from WHT.
For a tax resident of a country having a tax treaty with Korea, reduced WHT rates may apply to Korean-source income, subject to the substance-over-form principles of Korean tax laws. An application form and documents supporting the substantive ownership of the Korean-source income must be submitted by a foreign entity to the Korean entity paying the income (acting as a withholding agent) in order to apply the treaty rate. The documentation requirement for the substantive ownership shall apply to application for a reduced tax treaty rate on or after 1 January 2023. If such application is not provided or a substantive owner of Korean-source income cannot be identified in the submitted documents, the withholding agent should withhold income tax at the non-treaty rate under the Korean tax laws.
For dividends, interest, and royalties, the WHT rates are limited as follows:
Recipient | WHT (%)  
---|---  
Dividends | Interest | Royalties  
Resident corporations (1) | 0 | 14/25 | 0  
Resident individuals (1) | 14 | 14/25 | 0

  30. According to the protocol, 5% rate applies for interest on the loans granted by a bank or an insurance company, etc.
  31. 5% rate applies when a beneficial owner directly holds 25% or more of the shares of the company paying the dividends. 10% rate applies if a beneficial owner directly owns 10% or more of the shares of the company paying the dividend. In other cases, 15% rate applies.
  32. 0% rate applies to royalties for any copyright of literary, artistic, or scientific work, including cinematograph films, and films or tapes for television or radio broadcasting.
  33. 5% rate applies to royalties paid for the use of or the right associated with any copyright of literary, artistic, or scientific work, including software, and motion pictures and works on film, tape, or other means of reproduction for use in connection with radio or television broadcasting. 10% rate applies to royalties paid for the use of or the right to use a patent, trademark, design or model, plan, secret formula, or process. 15% rate applies to royalties paid for the use of or the right to use industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment, or for information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific experience.
  34. Generally, 14% rate applies if interest arises from bonds issued by a Korean company or government bodies. Exceptionally, for the interest on foreign currency denominated bonds issued by a Korean government body or a Korean company outside Korea, 0% WHT on the interest paid to a foreign corporation having no PE in Korea may be applicable.
  35. 0% rate applies if a recipient of interest income is the government, central bank, etc.
  36. Payments for the leasing of industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment, etc. are classified as rental income subject to 2% WHT unless the payment is treated as royalty under an applicable tax treaty.
  37. 5% rate applies to royalties in respect of payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment, or for information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific experience. 7.5% rate applies to technical fees.
  38. Fees for technical services are subject to the same WHT rate for royalties.
  39. Lower rate applies for the payments received as consideration for the furnishing of technical assistance.
  40. Agreement between the Korean Mission in Taipei and the Taipei Mission in Korea for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income is effective for the fiscal year starting on or after 1 January 2024 and, in case of WHTs, for payments made on or after 1 January 2024.


If a foreign company is located in a foreign jurisdiction designated by the Minister of Economy & Finance, any Korean-source income of such foreign company will be subject to the domestic withholding rate of 20% regardless of whether or not the foreign company is resident of a treaty country unless it obtains a prior approval from the Korean tax authority for the entitlement to the tax treaty benefits. Currently, only Labuan is designated as such a jurisdiction. The foreign company may claim a refund of any excess WHT paid within five years from the 11th day of the month following the month when the WHT is paid if it proves to the Korean Tax Office that it is entitled to the reduced treaty rates as the substantive and beneficial owner of the income.

## Exchange controls
Most transactions involving foreign exchange generally do not require approval or reporting under the Foreign Exchange Transaction Act (FETA), with a few exceptions as prescribed by the FETA. Receipt of foreign exchange from outside Korea is freely permitted, and payments to foreign companies for non-capital transactions are not regulated. Most restrictions on Korean companies’ foreign currency transactions with foreigners have been removed. However, the government continues to monitor certain flows of foreign currency in an attempt to minimise incoming speculative currency and outgoing capital flight.
Advance reporting is no longer required for certain capital transactions falling below specified thresholds, while post-transaction reporting is mandatory. For instance, foreign currency loans obtained by a Korean company of which accumulated balance during a year is USD 50 million or less or loans provided by a Korean resident to its foreign subsidiary of which repayment date is less than one year should be reported to a foreign exchange bank within one month from the date when the transaction is completed. Foreign currency deposits should be reported in advance unless expressly designated for post-transaction reporting. The agency to which the reporting should be made differs based on materiality of the transaction amount or transaction type.
In addition, unless expressly specified for the exemption from reporting, post-transaction reporting to the appropriate agency is required for transactions such as netting receivables and payables with a foreign resident, third party payments where a payment is made to a foreign resident other than the transaction counterpart, and cross calculation, which is similar to netting, but the concerned company opens a bank account in which the offsetting takes place for future receivables and payables. 
## Automatic exchange of tax information
The Korea-United States (US) agreement on Automatic Exchange of Tax Information was ratified by the National Assembly on 7 September 2016. Based on the agreement, the tax authorities of both countries collect financial information on financial accounts held by individuals and entities and exchange this information. Korea-based financial institutions conduct their Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) due diligence procedures and report information on certain financial accounts held by US individuals and entities to the NTS, and then, the NTS will report this information to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The type of information generally includes the name, address, tax identification number, account number, account balance as of the end of a relevant reporting period, and gross amount of income (such as interest and dividends). Korea committed to implement the OECD Common Reporting Standard Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement in October 2014, ensuring automatic exchange of information with 108 countries by 2023.
Since 2017, Korea has exchanged with foreign countries certain information on financial accounts and income according to the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreements to automatically exchange information based on Article 6 of the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters. The NTS should be motivated to actively mobilise its infrastructure to exchange offshore financial and non-financial tax information for the purpose of pursuing taxpayers suspected of being engaged in offshore tax avoidance and conducting tax audits of such tax avoidance.
## Choice of business entity
The following types of commercial entities are permitted in Korea:
  * Corporation (_Hoesa_): There are five classes of corporation, outlined as follows: 
    * Limited corporation: 
      * _Chusik Hoesa_ (CH): A corporation incorporated by one or more promoters, with each shareholder’s liability limited to the amount of contributed capital. This type of entity is the most commonly used in Korea.
      * _Yuhan Hoesa_ (YH): A corporation incorporated by one or more members, with each member’s liability limited to the amount of that member’s contribution to the corporation.
      * _Yuhan Chegim Hoesa_ : A corporation incorporated by one or more members, with each member’s liability limited to the amount of that member’s capital contribution. With significantly fewer restrictions for establishment and operation, _Yuhan Chegim Hoesa_ provides more flexibility and self-control than YH.
    * Unlimited corporation: 
      * _Hapmyong Hoesa_ : A corporation incorporated jointly by more than two members who are responsible for corporate obligations if the assets of the corporation are insufficient to fully satisfy those obligations.
      * _Hapja Hoesa_ : A corporation composed of one or more partners who have unlimited liability and one or more partners with limited liability.


  * Partnership: _Hapja Johap_ is a legal form of partnership allowed under the Commercial Code.
  * Joint venture: A joint venture is generally established as a domestically incorporated corporation whose shareholders have limited liability regarding the obligations of the corporation under the Commercial Code.
  * Branch: A foreign corporation can perform its business operation in Korea by setting up a taxable presence in the form of a branch office. The branch office is subject to normal CIT rates on Korean-source business income under the CITL.
  * Liaison office: A foreign corporation can establish a liaison office, which is not allowed to perform preliminary or auxiliary business activities in Korea.
  * Sole proprietorship: Sole proprietorship is not a legal form of entity in Korea.


## Guidance on taxation of a foreign transparent entity
A foreign transparent entity, such as a partnership, that is established outside Korea (only if having no place of effective management in Korea) would be categorised as a foreign corporation under the Korean tax law if one of the following conditions is met:
  * Endowed with a legal personality pursuant to the law of the country in which it was established.
  * Only comprised of partners with limited liability.
  * A domestic entity whose characteristics are the same as, or similar to, the characteristics of a foreign entity defined as a corporation under Korean laws.


If a foreign transparent entity does not meet any of the above, it is not treated as a corporation under the Korean tax law. Consequently, any Korean-source income earned by the foreign transparent entity is regarded as being earned by each investor and taxed at the investor level. 
If a foreign corporation receives Korean-source income via an overseas investment vehicle (OIV) as defined under the Korean tax law, it would be regarded as the substantive owner earning the Korean-source income. However, under certain circumstances, an OIV can be deemed as a substantive owner of Korean-source income if it meets certain conditions, such as bearing income tax liabilities on the Korean-source income in its country of establishment or being recognised as a beneficial owner under a relevant tax treaty executed between the country and Korea and satisfying requirements for the tax treaty benefits under an applicable tax treaty. If a list of investors to an OIV is not disclosed, however, the OIV shall be subject to taxation as a non-resident according to the Korean tax laws.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
Gross income consists of gains, profits, income from trade and commerce, dealings in property, rents, royalties, and income derived from any transactions carried on for gain or profit.
## Inventory valuation
Inventories generally are stated at either the lower of cost or market (LCM) or cost method. Any one of LCM and six cost methods, including specific identification, first in first out (FIFO), last in first out (LIFO), weighted-average, moving-average, and retail method, can be elected for tax purposes. The method elected should be applied consistently each year unless an application for change has been submitted before three months from the year-end. Different valuation methods may be used for different categories (i.e. manufactured goods and merchandised goods, semi-finished goods and goods in process, raw materials, supplies in stock) and different business places.
For inventory costing under Korean International Financial Reporting Standards (K-IFRS), LIFO is not an acceptable accounting method. Consequently, in a year when a taxpayer first adopts K-IFRS and duly reports the change of inventory valuation method from LIFO to one of the other costing methods (e.g. FIFO, weighted average), the taxpayer is allowed to exclude the inventory valuation gain arising from the change and include it in its taxable income over the next five-year period using a straight-line method.
## Stock valuation
The valuation of securities or bonds shall be made using the cost method. For the cost method, the weighted-average cost method or moving-average cost method shall be applied for the purpose of valuation of securities, and the specific-identification method may be used only for valuation of bonds.
## Capital gains
Generally, capital gains are taxed at the same CIT rates as ordinary taxable income. For the purposes of taxation, gross income does not include income derived from gains from certain capital transactions, such as capital surplus, gains on reduction of paid-in capital, etc. However, gains from treasury stock transactions are taxed, and losses are deductible from taxable income.
Note that capital gains from the disposal of non-business purpose land or houses may be subject to additional capital gains tax at the rate of 10% (40% in the case of non-registered land or houses) in addition to the normal CIT.
## Dividend income
All distributions to shareholders are taxed as dividend income, whether paid in cash or in stock.
Before the amendment of the CIT Law at the end of December 2022, the ratios of deduction of dividends from a subsidiary from taxable income differed depending on the type of holding company and subsidiary (i.e. qualified holding company vs. other holding companies; and listed subsidiaries vs. unlisted subsidiaries) and the ownership percentage held by a domestic parent company in its domestic subsidiary paying a dividend. Effective 1 January 2023, dividends received from a domestic subsidiary in which the dividend receiving company has at least 50% ownership are 100% deductible. Where the ownership is at least 20% but less than 50%, 80% deduction is available, while the 30% deduction is available where the ownership is less than 20%. For dividends received before 1 January 2023, the dividend receiving company can elect to apply the dividend received deduction ratios before or after the amendment of the tax law for the year that started before 1 January 2023 but will end after 1 January 2023. 
Also, with effect from 1 January 2023, 95% of the dividends received by a domestic parent company from its foreign subsidiary shall be deductible where the domestic company owns at least 10% of the voting stocks or interests in the foreign subsidiary (5% for a foreign subsidiary carrying on an overseas natural resources development business) and meets prescribed requirements. Deemed dividends from undistributed earnings of a foreign subsidiary under the Korean controlled foreign company (CFC) rules and other prescribed dividends shall not be eligible for the 95 % dividend received deduction. Previously, a domestic company had to add such dividends to its taxable income, and it could claim an indirect foreign tax credit for foreign income tax paid by the foreign subsidiary relating to the dividends. For the dividends received from 1 January 2023, a domestic company could claim an indirect foreign tax credit only if it does not claim 95% exclusion of the dividends received from a foreign subsidiary.
## Interest income
Except for certain cases, all interest income must be included in taxable income. Generally, interest income is included in taxable income as it is received.
## Rental income
Income from the leasing of property shall be included in taxable income. In cases where a company is subject to an estimated tax by the tax authority due to the absence of books of accounts, the deemed rental income as calculated at a term deposit interest rate on the lease deposit received by the company will be included in taxable income.
## Royalty income
Royalties are considered to be taxable income when earned. Korean companies paying domestic-source royalties to foreign corporations must withhold tax at an effective rate of 22% (including local income tax). The WHT rate may be reduced by a tax treaty. With effect from 1 January 2020, payments to foreign licensors for the use of patents registered outside Korea will be treated as Korean-source royalty income for the use of ‘other similar properties or rights’ included in the definition of royalties under a tax treaty determining income source based on the country of usage if the manufacturing method, technology, information, etc. contained in the patents registered outside Korea is actually used in manufacturing and production activities within Korea and, accordingly, shall be subject to WHT in Korea.
## Gains and losses on foreign currency translation
Companies are allowed to recognise unrealised gains and losses on foreign currency translation of their monetary assets and liabilities in a foreign currency based on announced basic foreign exchange rate as of a year end. This recognition is also allowed with respect to currency forward transactions and swaps to hedge foreign exchange risks of such assets and liabilities. In this regard, a taxpayer can choose whether to recognise unrealised gains and losses or not for tax purposes. Once elected, the same method must be consistently used.
## Income from virtual assets
Tax reform for 2021 has introduced a new taxation on the income derived by a Korean resident from the transfer (sale or exchange) or lease of virtual assets (e.g. bitcoins). The term ‘virtual assets’ refers to a digital representation of value (including all concerned rights) that can be traded or transferred as defined in the Act on Reporting and Using Specified Financial Transaction Information. The income derived by a Korean resident from the transfer or lease of virtual assets would be classified as ‘other income’ subject to the 20% income tax rate based on the amount computed at: [proceeds received for the transfer or lease of virtual asset minus (acquisition cost of the asset plus ancillary expenses for acquisition such as transaction fee and related taxes)].
In addition, the income derived by Korean non-residents or foreign corporations from the transfer or lease of virtual assets (including the withdrawal of the assets stored or managed by a virtual asset service provider) would be classified as ‘Korean source other income’ subject to Korean WHT under domestic tax laws. The new taxation would be effective for the income arising from the transfer or lease on or after 1 January 2027. In light of this, virtual asset service providers are obligated to furnish transaction particulars, including a summary of transfers and leases of virtual assets conducted on or after 1 January 2023, within two months from the end of the quarter when the transactions occur.
## Foreign income
Resident corporations are taxed on their worldwide income, including both domestic-source income and foreign-source income. A Korean company is taxed on its foreign-source income as earned at normal CIT rates. To avoid double taxation, taxes imposed by foreign governments on the foreign-source income recognised by a resident company are allowed as a credit against CIT or as deductible expenses in computing the taxable income.
Generally, income of foreign subsidiaries incorporated outside Korea is not included in the taxable income of a resident company until the declaration of dividends from the foreign subsidiaries. Therefore, the Korean tax impact may be delayed through deferring the declaration of dividends unless the CFC rule under the Law for Coordination of International Tax Affairs (LCITA) is applied.
The CFC rule provides that the undistributed earnings of a resident company’s foreign subsidiary located in a low-tax jurisdiction (where the effective tax rate on the average of income before tax for the past three years is 16.8% or less [the level of 70% of the top marginal CIT rate of 24% at present from the tax year beginning on or after 1 January 2023]) are taxed as deemed dividends to the resident company that has direct and indirect interest of 10% or more in such subsidiary. The CFC rule does not apply in cases where a foreign subsidiary has fixed facilities (e.g. office, factory) in a low-tax jurisdiction for the conduct of business, it manages or controls the business by itself, and the business is mainly performed in the jurisdiction. Even in this case, however, where passive income (e.g. income from investment in securities or lending loans) is more than 50% of gross income, the CFC rule shall be applicable. Furthermore, in cases where the passive income is between 50% and 5% of the foreign subsidiary’s gross income, the CFC rule will apply in a limited manner (i.e. a CFC’s undistributed earnings will be included in taxable income of the CFC’s domestic related parties in proportion of such passive income to its gross income). However, dividends will be excluded in calculating the amount of passive income if they are derived from shares issued by the company that is 10% or more owned by a CFC.
If dividends from a qualifying subsidiary are included in taxable income of a resident company, the foreign tax paid by a qualifying subsidiary on the subsidiary's taxable income is eligible for a foreign tax credit in the hands of the resident company regardless of whether there are tax treaties with the relevant foreign countries. For this purpose, a qualifying subsidiary refers to the company in which a resident corporation owns 10% or more of its shares for the period of six consecutive months or more prior to a dividend record date. Unused foreign tax credits can be carried forward for ten years.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
Resident corporations are taxed at normal CIT rates on their worldwide income, whereas non-resident corporations with a permanent establishment (PE) in Korea are taxed at normal CIT rates only to the extent of their Korean-source income. Non-resident corporations without a PE in Korea are generally taxed through a withholding tax (WHT) on each separate item of Korean-source income (_see the section_).
The following tax table summarises the CIT rates applicable for the fiscal year starting on or after 1 January 2023:
Tax base (KRW* million) | CIT rates**  
---|---  
Over (column 1) | Less than | Tax on column 1 (KRW)* | Marginal tax rate (%)  
0 | 200 | 0 | 9  
200 | 20,000 | 18 | 19  
20,000 | 300,000 | 3,780 | 21  
300,000 | 62,580 | 24  
* Korean won
** Excluding the local income tax.
## Additional tax on corporate income
To facilitate the use of corporate retained earnings to fund facility investment and payroll increases, 20% additional tax shall be applied for excess corporate earnings reserve of a company (excluding SMEs, etc.) by 31 December 2025. Companies should elect one of the following methods in computing excess corporate earnings reserve subject to the additional tax:
  * ([adjusted taxable income for the year x 70%] - the total amount of facility investment, wage increases, and expenditures for mutual growth of large corporations and SMEs) x 20%, or
  * ([adjusted taxable income for the year x 15%] - the total amount of wage increases and mutual growth expenditures) x 20%.


The rule for 20% additional tax was scheduled to sunset at the end of December 2022, although a company having untaxed excess corporate earnings reserve carried over from prior years from 2021 and 2022 shall be subject to additional tax in a current year according to the former rule if qualifying expenditures, such as facility investment, salary increase, etc., in a current year is less than the prior year’s excess corporate earnings reserve. The sunset date has been extended by an additional three years until 31 December 2025. In extending the sunset, the application of the additional tax has been refined to only include those within a conglomerate group that are subject to restrictions on cross-shareholdings as specified in the Anti-Monopoly and Fair Trade Act.
## Special Tax for Rural Development
When a corporate taxpayer claims certain tax credits or exemptions under the Special Tax Treatment Control Law (STTCL), a 20% agriculture and fishery surtax is levied on the reduced CIT liability. The application period has been extended for ten years to 30 June 2034.
## Minimum tax
Corporate taxpayers (except SMEs) are liable for the minimum tax, which is defined as the greater of 10% (if the tax base is KRW 10 billion or less, 12% on the tax base exceeding KRW 10 billion but not more than KRW 100 billion, 17% on the tax base exceeding KRW 100 billion) of the taxable income before certain tax deductions and credits pursuant to the STTCL or the actual CIT liability after certain deductions and credits under the STTCL.
For SMEs, the minimum tax is the greater of 7% of taxable income before certain tax deductions and credits or actual CIT liability after the deductions and credits. For the companies that are disqualified from SMEs due to specific reasons, the applicable rates are 7% during the first four years after ceasing to qualify, 8% for the next three years, and 9% for the subsequent two years.
## New rules for global minimum tax
Korea has introduced new rules for global minimum tax (‘GloBE Rules‘ or ’Rules‘) at the end of December 2022. The Rules include an ‘Income Inclusion Rule’ (IIR) and ‘Supplementary Rule for Income Inclusion’ (referred to as the UTPR). Based on the current tax law, the IIR is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2024 while the UTPR will be effective for fiscal years starting on or after 1 January 2025. The Rules apply to all constituent entities of a qualified multinational enterprise (MNE) group with annual consolidated revenues of 750 million euros (EUR) or more in at least two of the four fiscal years immediately preceding the tested fiscal year. The Rules shall not apply to entities that are excluded entities, which refer to a government entity, an international organisation, a non-profit organisation, a pension fund, an investment fund that is an ultimate parent entity, and a real estate investment vehicle that is an ultimate parent entity. In addition, the rules shall not apply to an entity that is directly or indirectly owned by an excluded entity.
The effective tax rate is calculated by dividing the adjusted covered taxes incurred by the net global anti-base erosion (GloBE) income for all of the MNEs’ constituent entities that are located in the same jurisdiction (i.e. jurisdictional blending). If the effective tax rate is lower than 15% in a given jurisdiction, an additional top-up tax for the jurisdiction for the fiscal year is calculated in accordance with the prescribed formula and paid by other constituent entities within the group under the relevant law. Filing a tax return and payment shall be due 15 months from the end date of the tested fiscal year. However, for the first year, the due date extends to 18 months from the end date of the tested fiscal year.
## Local income tax
The local income tax is a separate income tax that has its own tax base, tax exemption and credits, and tax rates. The local income tax rates for corporations are 0.9% on the first KRW 200 million, 1.9% for the tax base between KRW 200 million and KRW 20 billion, 2.1% for the tax base between KRW 20 billion and KRW 300 billion, and 2.4% for the excess.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is levied at a rate of 10% on the supply of goods and services, except zero-rated VAT on certain supply of goods and services (e.g. goods for exportation, certain eligible services rendered to non-residents or foreign corporations earning foreign currency, international transportation service by ships and aircraft) and exemption on certain goods and services (e.g. basic life necessities and services, such as unprocessed foodstuffs and agricultural products; medical and health services; finance and insurance services; duty-exempt goods). The zero-rated VAT only applies to the supply of certain services that are provided to a non-resident or a foreign corporation without having a PE in Korea on a reciprocal basis. They include professional services (e.g. legal, accounting, tax, advisory, market survey, management consulting), business support services (e.g. human resources outsourcing, office support, employment placement agency), and investment advisory services.
Electronic VAT invoicing by the supplier of goods or services is a compulsory requirement. If a taxpayer fails to issue the electronic VAT invoice or report electronically to tax authorities, the relevant penalties shall be imposed.
If a foreign company or a non-resident without a PE in Korea or without regard to a PE in Korea provides certain electronic services to a consumer (excluding the person having Korean VAT registration) in Korea via an information and communication network (as defined under relevant Korean act), it shall comply with the requirements of a simplified VAT registration and VAT return filing, together with VAT payment for the provision of the electronic services. With effect from 1 January 2024, a penalty of 1% of the supply price of electronic services for the period up to the date preceding the simplified registration date will be levied for non-compliance with the simplified registration requirement. The electronic services of a foreign company or non-resident includes games, audio/video files, electronic documents, etc. that are supplied in an electronic format through an information and communication network, as well as cloud computing, advertising placement services, and intermediary services that include mediating activities of renting, using, consuming, supplying, or purchasing goods or services in Korea. If the foreign electronic services are supplied to Korean consumers through third parties, such as electronic marketplaces or intermediaries who transmit payment from the purchaser to the seller, the third party must register and account for the VAT. With effect from 1 July 2022, a foreign company or non-resident engaging in electronic services through the simplified VAT registration is required to comply with documentation of keeping transaction details for five years from the due date for VAT returns for the taxable period to which the transaction belongs.
## Customs duties
Customs duties are generally assessed at 8% on imported goods, although the rate can be partly or wholly reduced by an applicable free trade act. Generally, 'importation’ refers to the delivery of foreign goods into Korea (e.g. delivery of foreign goods into Korea from a bonded area to a non-bonded area) to be consumed or to be used in Korea.
## Property tax
An annual property tax, as a local tax, ranging from 0.07% to 5% is charged on the statutory value of land, buildings, houses, vessels, and aircraft. Five times the property tax rate is applied to factories that are newly constructed or expanded in a designated metropolitan area for the first five years.
## Comprehensive real estate holding tax
A comprehensive real estate holding tax, as a national tax, ranging from 0.5% to 5% (depending on the type and number of assets) is charged on a certain excessive aggregated statutory value of certain land and residential houses. It is levied annually on corporations and individuals owning the assets held as of 1 June of each year.
## Securities transaction tax
Securities transaction tax at the rate of 0.35% for unlisted Korean shares or interest is imposed on the transfer of shares or interest. The flexible tax rates prescribed by the Presidential Decree are 0.18% and 0.15% (including special tax for rural development) for listed shares traded on the Korea Stock Exchange in 2024 and 2025, respectively, and 0.18% and 0.15% for shares traded on the Korean Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (KOSDAQ) for the respective year. The tax rate remains unchanged at 0.1% for shares traded on the Korea New Exchange (KONEX).
## Acquisition tax
Acquisition tax is charged on the acquisition price of real estate, motor vehicles, construction equipment, golf membership, boats, etc. The acquisition tax rate varies depending on the type of assets subject to the tax, ranging from 1% to 7%. A weighted rate is charged on acquisitions in a designated metropolitan area or on acquisition of luxury items, such as villas, golf courses, and yachts. A 12% acquisition tax rate shall be applicable to the acquisition of a residential house by a corporation.
## Registration tax
In principle, registration tax is included in the acquisition tax. However, in some cases, a separate registration tax ranging from 0.2% to 5% is charged upon the act of registering the creation, alteration, or lapse of property rights or other titles and incorporation with the concerned authorities. Registration tax upon the registration of title or right and incorporation for corporations located in a designated metropolitan area may be subject to three times the normal registration tax rate of 0.4%.
## Stamp tax
Stamp tax is levied on a person who prepares a document certifying establishment, transfer, or change of rights to property in Korea. The stamp tax ranges from KRW 50 to KRW 350,000, depending on the type of taxable document. The electronic stamp system has been implemented to make it mandatory to use stamps bought online rather than paper stamps bought in banks or post offices.
## Gift tax
Gift tax is imposed on a person who acquires any property or value increase by gift. If CIT or individual income tax is imposed on the gifted property, however, the gift tax shall not be imposed. Gift tax ranges from 10% on not more than KRW 100 million in tax base to the top marginal tax rate of 50% of the excess over KRW 3 billion in tax base.
## Inheritance tax
Inheritance tax is imposed upon a person who acquires property through inheritance or bequest. However, an inheritor that is a non-profit company shall be exempt from the inheritance tax. Inheritance tax rates are the same as those for gift tax.
## Payroll taxes
Employers are required to withhold income taxes on salaries paid to employees on a monthly basis, finalise their employees' tax liability for a calendar year, and file the final payroll tax settlement receipt with the tax authorities no later than the tenth day of March of the following year.
## Social security contributions
There are four types of social security contributions in Korea, namely national pension, national health insurance, employment insurance, and worker’s accident compensation insurance. For the first three types of social security taxes (i.e. national pension, national health insurance, and employment insurance), employees and employers jointly bear certain percentages of salaries. Meanwhile, the worker's accident compensation insurance is borne by employers only, which varies by industry types (_see Social security contributions in the section of the Individual tax summary for more information_).
