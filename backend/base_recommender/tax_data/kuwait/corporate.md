Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
## Taxable period
Tax is imposed on profits arising in a taxable period, which is defined as the accounting period of the taxpayer and further assumed to be one calendar year. The first taxable period can, however, be a minimum of six months and a maximum of 18 months. The DIT may also agree to a written request from the taxpayer to change the year-end to a date other than 31 December.
## Tax returns
The taxpayer must submit a tax return, based on the taxpayer’s books of account, within three months and 15 days from the end of the taxable period. Taxpayers can, in certain cases, request an extension of up to 60 days to file the tax return. If such an extension is granted, no tax payment is necessary until the tax declaration is filed, and payment must then be in one lump sum.
The taxpayer must maintain certain accounting records in Kuwait, which are subject to inspection by the tax department’s officials after submission of the tax declaration. Accounting records can be in English and may be in a computerised system used to prepare financial statements if the system includes the required records and the tax department is previously informed.
The tax return should be supported by the following:
  * Audited balance sheet and profit-and-loss account for the period. 
  * Detailed list of fixed assets (e.g. additions, disposals). 
  * List of inventory (e.g. quantities and values). 
  * List of subcontractors and the latest payments to them. 
  * Copies of current contracts and a statement of income and expenditure for each. 
  * Trial balance, forming the basis of the accounts. 
  * Last payment certificate from the client. 
  * Insurance companies must attach to the Public Budget and the tax declaration a detailed statement with the reinsured documents and the related terms and conditions. 


As a general rule, an assessment is finalised only after inspection of the client’s records by the tax department. As indicated above, proper documentation must be maintained to support expenditures and to avoid disallowances at the time of tax inspection. If support is considered inadequate, the assessment is apt to be made on the basis of deemed profitability. This is computed as a percentage of turnover and is fixed arbitrarily, depending on the nature of the taxpayer’s business.
## Payment of tax
Tax is payable in four equal instalments on the 15th day of the fourth, sixth, ninth, and 12th months following the end of the tax period. If an extension is granted by the DIT, all of the tax is payable upon the expiration date of the extension. Failure to file or pay the tax on time attracts a penalty of 1% of the tax liability for every 30 days of delay or part thereof.
## Objection process
If a company disagrees with an assessment issued by the DIT, the company should submit an objection within 60 days from the date of the assessment. The DIT is required to resolve the objection within 90 days of the filing of the objection, after which a revised tax assessment is issued by the DIT. Upon issuance of a revised tax assessment, any additional tax is payable within 30 days. If the DIT issues no response within 90 days of filing the objection, this implies that the taxpayer’s objection has been rejected.
## Appeals process
In case the objection is rejected or the taxpayer is still not satisfied with the revised tax assessment, the company may contest the matter further with the Tax Appeals Committee (TAC) by submitting a letter of appeal within 30 days from the date of the objection response or 30 days from the expiry of the 90 days following submission of an objection if no response is provided by the DIT.
The matter is then resolved through appeal hearings, and a final revised assessment is issued based on the decision of the TAC. Tax payable per the revised assessment must then be settled within 30 days from the date of issuance of the revised assessment. Failure to do so results in a delay penalty of 1% of the amount of the tax due per the final assessment for each period of 30 days or part thereof of the delay.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations period is five years. Moreover, under Article No. 441 of the Kuwait Civil Law, any claims for taxes due to Kuwait or applications for tax refunds may not be made after the lapse of five years from the date on which the taxpayer is notified that tax or a refund is due.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The DIT has implemented an active approach to ensure the compliance of local companies with the tax retention mechanism in order to ensure that foreign entities earning income from Kuwait are subject to tax on such income. The DIT’s attention is often directed to local companies having franchise operations and agreements with foreign franchisors in Kuwait. In some cases, the DIT has asked the Kuwaiti companies to settle the 5% retention where the franchisors have failed to comply with the tax law requirements.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
A company is resident in Kuwait for CIT purposes if it earns income from Kuwait, directly or indirectly. Given that CIT in Kuwait does not apply to Kuwaiti entities, only foreign entities earning income from Kuwait would be subject to tax. In addition, any foreign corporate body that is a shareholder in a Kuwaiti limited liability company would be subject to tax to the extent of the foreign ownership (_see the section_). For the purpose of the CIT law, GCC entities wholly owned by GCC residents are treated in the same manner as Kuwaiti business entities.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
A place of business or the presence of company employees/representatives in Kuwait, even if for short-term visits, can trigger a PE in Kuwait. If the company is proven to have a PE in Kuwait, the Kuwait Tax Authority can subject to tax either the profit attributable to the PE or the full value of the contract, including the value of work performed outside Kuwait. The interpretation and application of the tax law by the Kuwait Tax Authority is usually inconsistent with international standards, and is subject to the widest possible interpretation in order to tax all income from Kuwait.


# Kuwait
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
For expenses to be deductible, they must be incurred in the generation of income in Kuwait. Such expenses must be supported by adequate documentary evidence.
## Depreciation
Depreciation is taken on a straight-line basis at specified rates. However, within 90 days prior to submission of the tax declaration, the taxpayer may request that the tax department calculate the depreciation using a different method than the straight-line method. The tax department shall accept this request if it is based on a reasonable basis in accordance with the tax accounting principles and rules.
The principal depreciation rates are specified in the law, as follows:
Type of fixed asset | Depreciation rate (%)  
---|---  
Buildings | 4  
Pre-fabricated buildings, furniture, and office equipment | 15  
Electronics and electrical equipment | 15  
Transportation and freight vehicles (trucks) | 15  
Tools and equipment | 20  
Cars and buses | 20  
Drilling equipment | 25  
Software | 25  
Computer equipment and accessories | 33.3  
## Goodwill
In accordance with Executive Rule No. 30, amortisation of incorporated body goodwill is not allowed as a tax deductible expense.
## Start-up expenses
Expenses incurred prior to signing of the contract are not allowed as tax deductible costs.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are deductible if they are related to operations in Kuwait and are paid to a local bank.
## Bad debt
Bad debt is deductible if it is related to operations in Kuwait and a final decision by the court is available.
## Charitable contributions
Grants, donations, and subsidies paid to licensed Kuwaiti public or private agencies are deductible.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are not tax deductible.
## Taxes
Taxes and fees, except income tax, are deductible in Kuwait.
## Subcontract costs
A subcontractor is any third party, provider, or beneficiary that in any way executes a portion of the contract or any phase thereof.
As per Executive Rule No. 28, subcontract costs are deductible if the following conditions are met:
  * The work performed by the subcontractor is related to the main contract. 
  * The cost of the subcontractor’s work does not exceed the revenue for such work. 
  * The necessary documents (e.g. the contract, invoices, settlement documents) are available. 
  * In the event that the incorporated body implementing the contract sells or assigns it to the subcontractor or any other party, official written approval from the contracting body is provided. 
  * In the event that the subcontractor sells or assigns the contract to another subcontractor, official written approval from the contracting body and the incorporated body implementing the contract is provided. 


During inspection, the tax department shall disallow the amounts paid to subcontractors if the incorporated body does not notify the tax department of the subcontractors or does not withhold 5% of the contract value signed with the subcontractor as income tax retention.
## Net operating losses
As per the amended tax law, losses may be carried forward for a maximum of three years, provided that the following situations do not arise in the fiscal period following the period in which the loss was recorded:
  * The tax declaration does not include any revenue from the business activities of the taxpayer in Kuwait. 
  * Change in the legal structure of the taxpayer. 
  * Merger of the taxpayer with another entity. 
  * Liquidation or ceasing of the activities of the taxpayer in Kuwait. 


Please note that losses cannot be carried back under the Kuwait tax law.
## Head office expenses/payments to foreign affiliates
The deduction of head office expenses (the overhead or the indirect expenses) is limited to 1.5% of the company's Kuwait revenue after deducting the subcontractors’ shares (if any).
The direct costs allocated by the head office (e.g. supply of goods, design and consultancy costs) are regulated as follows.
For costs of supply from outside Kuwait:
Supply from | Maximum allowable costs as a percentage of revenue  
---|---  
Head office | 85%  
Affiliated companies | 90%  
Third parties | 95%  
For design costs incurred outside Kuwait:
Work conducted by | Maximum allowable costs as a percentage of revenue  
---|---  
Head office | 75%  
Affiliated companies | 80%  
Third parties | 85%  
For consultancy costs incurred outside Kuwait:
Work conducted by | Maximum allowable costs as a percentage of revenue  
---|---  
Head office | 70%  
Affiliated companies | 75%  
Third parties | 80%  
In case there is no separate revenue for consultancy, design, or supply work, although the nature of the contract requires the existence of such work, the following formula shall be applied:
Consultancy, design, or supply revenue = (consultancy, design, or supply costs / total direct costs) x contract revenue

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
If a foreign company conducts more than one business activity in Kuwait, one tax declaration aggregating the income from all activities is required to be submitted in Kuwait. In addition, in case two affiliates are involved in similar lines of business or work on the same project, their taxable results may be aggregated for the assessment of tax by the Department of Inspection and Tax Claims (DIT), a department of the Kuwait Tax Authority.
## Transfer pricing
There is no Transfer Pricing Law in Kuwait. However, Executive Rule No. 49 to the Kuwait Tax Law states that inter-company transactions should be comparable to transactions among companies that are not legally or financially associated. It also states that the Kuwait Tax Authority is entitled to inspect such transactions to ensure that they are made on an arm’s-length basis and not made for obtaining illegal tax privileges.
## Thin capitalisation
Executive Rule No. 38 deals with the tax treatment of interest and letters of credit. Through this rule, the DIT will accept the interest paid by a company, provided it is fully supported, paid to a financial institution, and related to the Kuwait operations. However, the tax law provides the DIT with the right to determine the proper tax treatment on a case-by-case basis (if required).
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no CFC rules in Kuwait.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
## Leasing and Investment Companies Law No. 12 of 1998
Leasing and Investment Companies Law No. 12 of 1998 allows the formation of investment and leasing companies having their principal place of business in Kuwait, with Kuwaiti or foreign shareholders. The law grants a five-year tax holiday to non-Kuwaiti founders and shareholders of such companies, beginning on the date of establishment of the companies.
## Foreign Direct Investment Law No. 116 of 2013 (FDI Law)
The FDI Law provides foreign companies with several incentives, including:
  * Expedited process by introducing a one-stop-shop authority, the Kuwait Direct Investment Promotion Authority (KDIPA), that is responsible for evaluating and granting the licence and approval for foreign companies operating in Kuwait (compared to the old committee and Council of Ministers). 
  * Added flexibility of allowing foreign companies the possibility of establishing and operating through a 100% foreign-owned ‘branch’ or ‘representative office’ in Kuwait. 
  * Allowable tax credit for a certain number of years. 
  * Total or partial exemption from customs duties on imports. 
  * Recruitment of required foreign labour. 


The incentives granted to foreign investors in Kuwait under the FDI Law are applicable to activities in certain economic sectors and subject to the fulfilment of certain requirements including:
  * The transfer of advanced technology to Kuwait. 
  * Stimulation of the local market through engagement of local suppliers for operational purchases. 
  * Creation of job opportunities for Kuwaiti nationals. 


## Kuwait Free Trade Zone (KFTZ)
Businesses set up in the KFTZ for carrying on specified operations are exempt from taxes on operations conducted in the zone. Foreign entities can own 100% of such businesses. Currently, the government of Kuwait has stopped issuing KFTZ licences.
## Circular No. 50 of 2002
As per Circular No. 50 of 2002 issued by the DIT regarding treatment of tax-exempted companies under the tax law, other special laws, and/or tax treaties, exempted companies shall comply with submitting a tax declaration, the inspection process, and the assessment procedures like other companies in order to be eligible for exemption.
## Build, operate, and transfer (BOT)
Kuwait has begun to use the BOT method in respect of some large infrastructure projects. Tax and tariff concessions may be built into a BOT contract.
## Foreign tax credit
Foreign taxes paid in a country with which Kuwait has a treaty for avoidance of double taxation may be eligible for credit, up to the maximum of the Kuwaiti tax that would have been payable on such income.


# Kuwait
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
Kuwaiti tax law does not impose withholding tax (WHT). However, all public bodies and private entities are required to retain 5% from the contract, agreement, or transaction value or from each payment made to any incorporated body until presentation of a tax clearance certificate, by the recipient of such payment from the Ministry of Finance (MoF), confirming that the respective company has settled all of its tax liabilities in Kuwait. The final payment should not be less than 5% of the total contract value.
## Tax treaties
Kuwait has entered into tax treaties with several countries for the avoidance of double taxation. Treaties with several other countries are at various stages of negotiation or ratification.
The interpretation of tax treaties by the Kuwait Tax Authority is not always consistent or in line with the interpretation generally considered appropriate by the taxpayers and usually does not follow the OECD’s guidance or the international standards for the interpretation of tax treaties. As a result, disputes on the interpretation of various clauses in tax treaties between taxpayers and the DIT are common. Disputes with the DIT regarding tax treaties normally arise with respect to the following topics:
  * Existence of a PE.
  * Income attributable to a PE.
  * Tax deductibility of costs incurred outside Kuwait.


The domestic tax law in Kuwait does not provide for WHTs. The WHT rates listed in the table are for illustrative purposes only.

## United States (US) Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
The state of Kuwait has signed an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the United States, dated 29 April 2015, in light of FATCA. In this regard, Ministerial Order Number 48 of 2015 (MO No. 48) was issued on 3 September 2015, setting a compliance framework for the financial institutions operating in Kuwait.
Financial institutions (FIs) operating in Kuwait have a series of compliance requirements to adhere to within the deadlines provided by MO No. 48. FIs were primarily required to register with the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS), appoint the Responsible Officer, and implement the compliance requirements by 31 December 2015.
FIs in Kuwait are expected to report on an annual basis on or before 30 September of each year; the report is to include the Specified US Persons identified for each period ending 31 December (i.e. nine months from the year-end). It has been the practice of the MoF to request the reports by 30 August to ensure all financial institutions are reporting prior to the deadline specified by the IRS.
## The Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
Kuwait committed to the CRS on 19 August 2016 by signing the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA), with a plan to commence the first reporting period in 2018.
On 12 July 2017, MO No. 36 of 2017 was published in the Official Gazette, which confirmed Kuwait’s commitment to implement the CRS. On 20 August 2017, MO No. 46 of 2017 was issued, whereby specific deadlines for reporting, due diligence, and update of on-boarding procedures were published. Moreover, as specified by the MO, the FIs are required to hire an auditor to provide an opinion on the process and reporting undertaken by the FIs to meet the requirements of the CRS. As per MO No. 36 of 2017, the first report by FIs was expected on or before 31 May 2018. However, it was postponed to 31 August 2018 and again to 1 November 2018. The cut-off date for pre-existing accounts is 31 March 2017 and for new customer accounts on or after 1 April 2017. That said, as of November 2018, the MCAA is yet to be approved by the Kuwaiti Parliament.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
Income tax is imposed on the profit of a business in Kuwait as calculated by the normal commercial criteria, using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), including the accrual basis. Note that provisions, as opposed to accruals, are not deductible for tax purposes. In addition, for contract accounting, revenue is recognised by applying the percentage of completion method.
Article 2 of the Executive Bylaws to the Kuwait Tax Law provides that income earned from the following activities in Kuwait shall be considered subject to tax in Kuwait:
  * Any activities or business carried out either entirely or partially in Kuwait, whether the contract has been signed inside or outside Kuwait, as well as any income resulting from the supply or sale of goods, or from providing services. 
  * The amounts collected from the sale, rent, or granting of a franchise to utilise any trademark, design, patent, copyright, or other moral rights, or those related to intellectual property (IP) rights for the use of rights to publish literary, arts, or scientific works of any form. 
  * Commission earned or resulting from agreements of representation or commercial mediation, whether such commission is in cash or in kind. 
  * Having a permanent office in Kuwait where the sale and purchase contracts are signed and/or where business activities are performed. 
  * Profits resulting from the following: 
    * Any industrial or commercial activity in Kuwait. 
    * Disposal of assets, either through the sale of the asset, part of the asset, the transfer of the asset’s ownership to others, or any other form of disposal, including the disposal of shares in a company whose assets mainly consist of immovable capital existing in Kuwait. 
    * Granting loans in Kuwait. 
    * Purchase and sale of property, goods, or related rights in Kuwait, whether such rights are related to monetary assets or moral rights, such as mortgage and franchise rights. 
    * Lease of property used in Kuwait. 
    * Providing services, including profits from management, technical, and consultancy services. 
    * Carrying out trading activities in the KSE, whether directly or through portfolios or investment funds. 


## Inventory valuation
Inventory is normally valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value, on a first in first out (FIFO) or average basis.
## Capital gains
Capital gains on the sale of assets and shares by foreign shareholders are treated as normal business profits and are subject to tax at a 15% rate. The tax law provides for a tax exemption for profits generated from dealing in securities on the KSE, whether directly or through investment portfolios.
## Dividend income
Dividends declared by companies listed on the KSE after 10 November 2015 are exempt from tax in Kuwait.
## Interest income
In principle, tax is levied on the foreign company's share of the profits (whether or not distributed by the Kuwaiti company) plus any amounts receivable for any other income in Kuwait (e.g. interest, royalties, technical services, management fees). However, the Kuwait tax law will still subject the interest received from a Kuwaiti source to tax in Kuwait, whether this interest is the only source of income for the foreign entity in Kuwait or the foreign entity has more sources of income in Kuwait other than the interest income.
## Royalty income
Royalty income earned from “the sale, lease, grant of franchise to use or utilise any trademark, design, patent, intellectual property, or copyright in Kuwait” is taxable in Kuwait. Kuwait tax law imposes a deemed profit of 98.5% on royalties earned from Kuwait (1.5% being an allowance for head office overhead), on which the prevailing flat corporate tax rate of 15% is applied.
## Foreign currency exchange rates and related profits and losses
The tax treatment for realised and unrealised losses and gains related to foreign currency transactions are as follows:
  * Unrealised foreign exchange gains are required to be reported in the tax declaration. However, unrealised gains may be excluded from taxable income for calculating the tax due for the fiscal year. 
  * Realised foreign exchange gains are taxable in Kuwait and are therefore added to calculate taxable profits. 
  * Unrealised losses are not considered as tax deductible costs and are therefore excluded for calculating taxable profits. 
  * Realised losses may be claimed as tax deductible costs, provided such losses are supported by adequate supporting information and documents. 


## Exempt income
The following sources of income are exempt from tax in Kuwait:
  * Profit from the sale of goods to a buyer in Kuwait, where the supplier is not involved in any operations in Kuwait. 
  * Profits of a corporate body generated from dealing in or disposing of securities listed on the KSE, whether such activities are carried out directly or through investment portfolios or funds. 


## Foreign income
The Kuwait tax law does not clearly provide for the tax treatment of foreign income. Such income is currently treated on a case-by-case basis.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
Kuwait does not impose corporate income tax (CIT) on companies wholly owned by the nationals of Kuwait or other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries (Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates). However, GCC companies with foreign ownership are subject to taxation to the extent of the foreign ownership. CIT is imposed only on the profits and capital gains of foreign 'corporate bodies' conducting business or trade in Kuwait, directly or through an agent.
Income earned from activities in Kuwait shall be considered subject to tax in Kuwait on the basis that it is Kuwait-sourced income. In cases where a contract involves the performance of work both inside and outside Kuwait, the entire revenue from the contract must be reported for tax in Kuwait, including the work carried out outside Kuwait. _Please refer to the section for more information on income that is subject to tax in Kuwait_.
The current CIT rate in Kuwait is a flat rate of 15%.
Foreign companies carrying on trade or business in the offshore area of the partitioned neutral zone under the control and administration of Saudi Arabia are only subject to tax in Kuwait on 50% of their taxable profit under the law.
_Please see the section for the description of the 5% tax retention requirement_.
## Zakat
Zakat is imposed on all publicly traded and closed Kuwaiti shareholding companies at a rate of 1% of the companies’ net profits.
## Contribution to the Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Sciences (KFAS)
All Kuwaiti shareholding companies are required to pay 1% of their net profits as per their financial statements, after transfer to the statutory reserve and the offset of losses carried forward, to the KFAS, which supports scientific progress.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
The GCC states (including Kuwait) executed the GCC VAT framework agreement in February 2017. The signing of the treaty paves the way for the introduction of VAT with effect from 1 January 2018 in the GCC. However, the GCC countries could implement VAT in either 2018 or 2019 as per the terms of the treaty. In Kuwait, the GCC framework agreement is currently under discussion in the Parliament while the draft Law is under preparation by the government.
## Customs tariffs
The GCC states have approved a unified customs tariff of 5% on cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) invoice price, subject to certain exceptions. A higher tariff is imposed on imports of tobacco and its derivatives, among other products.
## Excise taxes
There are no excise taxes in Kuwait.
## Property taxes
There are no property taxes in Kuwait.
## Transfer taxes
There are no transfer taxes (e.g. stamp duty, real estate) in Kuwait.
## Payroll taxes
There are no payroll taxes applicable in Kuwait, other than those for social security contributions (_see below_).
## Social security contributions
For Kuwaiti employees, contributions are payable monthly by both the employer and employee under the Social Security Law. The employer’s contribution is 11.5% and the employee’s is 8% of monthly salary, up to a ceiling of 2,750 Kuwaiti dinars (KWD) per month. Benefits provided include pensions on retirement and allowances for disability, sickness, and death.
In addition to the above contributions, the employee must contribute 2.5% of their monthly salary, up to a ceiling of KWD 1,500 per month, under the Social Security Law.
There are no social security obligations for expatriate workers. However, for foreign employees, it is generally necessary to make terminal indemnity payments calculated at 15 days’ pay-per-year for the first three years of service and 2/3 month’s pay-per-year thereafter.
## National Labour Support Tax (NLST)
The purpose of the NLST law is to encourage the national labour force to work in the private sector by closing the gap in salaries and benefits between public and private sectors.
As per the law, Kuwaiti companies listed in the Kuwait Stock Exchange (KSE) are required to pay an employment tax of 2.5% of the company’s net annual profits.
