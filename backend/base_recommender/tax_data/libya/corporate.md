## Taxable period
The tax year is generally a calendar year, although assessments can be made on the basis of a company's own year-end, provided permission is granted in advance from the Tax Department and the company then adheres consistently to the same date.
## Tax returns
All corporate entities must make an annual filing within four months of its year-end or within one month of its audit report, whichever is earlier.
## Payment of tax
CIT is payable on a quarterly basis (10 March, 10 June, 10 September, and 10 December) normally commencing the first quarter date after an assessment has been issued.
### Late payment penalties
A late payment penalty is assessed on the tax due at the rate of 1% to a maximum of 12%. In addition, the remaining quarterly payments are due immediately for failing to make an instalment on time.
The law also imposes the following penalties:
  * A fine of not less than three times the amount of unpaid tax due shall be applied to any person who fails to pay tax by the due date.
  * Without prejudice to any harsher penalty, a fine of not less than four times the amount of tax due and unpaid will be applied to any person who, with intent to evade all or part of the tax, commits any of the following acts or abets, agrees, or aids a person who commits such an act: 
    * The making of false statements in declarations submitted under this law.
    * The preparation of false accounts, books and records, reports, or budgets.
    * The use of fraudulent means to conceal or attempt to conceal taxable amounts due under this law.


## Tax audit process
Tax audits typically occur every three or four years.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations for CIT purposes is 15 years.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The tax authorities’ focus during audits continues to be on confirming revenue, ensuring major services providers contracts are tax registered, and seeking additional undeclared salaries and benefits.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 01 December 2024
Corporate residence is not specifically dealt with under the tax laws of Libya. The tax authorities will seek to assess any income derived from services provided in Libya.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Double tax treaties (DTTs) that have been signed introduce the concept of PE. However, general law requires that any foreign entity seeking to provide services in Libya should obtain a business licence, which necessitates it registering as a legal entity. Historically, unregistered foreign entities have provided services in Libya, but this is not in line with the law.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 01 December 2024
Taxable income is determined after deducting all expenditure and costs incurred in the realisation of the gross income (_for more details on the deemed profit basis of assessment on branches of foreign companies, see the section_).
For any entity (not a foreign branch) seeking to be assessed on an add-back basis, it should ensure, in accordance with Stamp Duty Law, that the majority of its costs can be supported by tax-registered documents (i.e. declared payrolls and registered contracts and invoices).
## Depreciation
Depreciation should be calculated in accordance with the Executive Regulations of the law.
Assets | Depreciation rate (%)

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 01 December 2024
Tax rates on branch profits are the same as on corporate profits. However, the Income Tax Law allows the Tax Department to assess income tax on branches of foreign companies as a percentage of turnover via the 'deemed profit' basis of assessment. Tax is therefore payable even where tax losses are declared.
The level of deemed profit applied to turnover varies according to the branch's type of business activity. This ranges from 10% to 15% for civil works and contracting (turnkey projects), 15% to 25% for oil service, and between 25% and 40% in the case of design/consulting engineers. A deemed profit of between 5% and 7% is also assessed on supply. The deemed profit percentage applied to any year will be higher than the profit percentage declared in the annual tax return since the deemed profit basis is applied during the course of a tax audit and is effectively a revenue generating exercise for the tax authorities. Historically, tax audits have not resulted in credits or reimbursements.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 01 December 2024
## Foreign tax credit
Under general tax law, no provision exists for allowing the deduction of foreign tax credits.
## CIT exemption
Exemptions to CIT exist, most notably, under the Investment Law. General projects registered under the Investment Law are permitted a five-year CIT holiday with a possibility to extend for a further three years.
Exemptions also exist for strategic infrastructure projects. Such exemptions must be awarded by the legislative body, either by ratifying the relevant contract, which includes a tax exemption clause, or by the issuance of a separate law.
## Customs and stamp duties exemption
The Investment Law also provides exemptions for customs duties and stamp duty. The exemptions that exist are bestowed on subcontractors to the relevant projects.
The Petroleum Law provides exemption to customs duties on oilfield-specific equipment and materials, which is also provided to oil service companies.


# Libya
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 01 December 2024
Libyan law has no withholding taxes (WHTs). Generally, for unregistered foreign entities seeking to register a contract with the tax authorities, CIT will be assessed (and must be settled) on a deemed profit basis at the time of registration. It may be possible to negotiate a WHT in preference to the aforementioned general procedure for a significant contract where there is greater uncertainty as to the estimated contract value.

## Statutory Books
Business entities operating in Libya are required by Libyan Law to maintain a General Ledger and a General Journal (i.e. the Statutory Books).
Before use, these must be stamped as registered with the Revenue Authorities and the Commercial Court. It should be noted that a Ledger or Journal will not be registered if it already contains accounting entries (i.e. one cannot register existing books of account).
Similarly, transactions pre-dating the date the books are registered will be disallowed. In theory, transactions should be entered daily, but in practice, most companies write up their statutory records on the basis of monthly transactions summaries.
The Tax Inspector will always request production of the Statutory Books at the commencement of a tax audit. If these are not available, a perfunctory audit of the English (or other language) books of account will be made, and it is likely that there will be a punitive increase in taxable income as a consequence.
The Commercial Code allows approved computer-based ledgers to be used instead of the traditional manual ledgers.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 01 December 2024
No specific rules apply on income determination for the following categories:
  * Interest income. 
  * Partnership income. 
  * Rent/royalties income. 
  * Foreign income. 


The Income Tax Law allows entities to account on an accrual basis or on a cash basis.
## Inventory valuation
The Commercial Code allows inventory to be valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
## Capital gains
Any chargeable gains on the sale of capital assets are taxed as ordinary income. For entities assessed on a deemed profit basis, capital gains should be added to the deemed taxable income.
## Dividend income
Historically, dividend income has not been subject to any additional taxes.
### Inter-company dividends
Libyan taxation laws do not contain any special provisions regarding inter-company dividends.
### Stock dividends
Stock dividends are not specifically dealt with in Libyan taxation laws. The current practice is for dividend distributions not to be taxed.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
There is no VAT in Libya.
## Customs duties
Customs duties were abolished in 2005, except for tobacco and tobacco products.
A service fee of 5% on the value on most imports also exists. There are various exemptions to this service fee, specifically under Investment Law and within the oil sector.
Other dues and taxes on importation are estimated at 0.5%. Initially, a temporary import licence is issued for six months that can be extended to a maximum of three years. A guarantee or a deposit can be provided by the importer to the Customs Department.
## Excise taxes
Libya has no excise taxes.
## Property taxes
Libya has no specific property taxes.
## Transfer taxes
Libya has no transfer taxes.
## Stamp duty
Stamp Duty Law levies a schedule of duties and rates on various documents and transactions. The most relevant to corporate entities is Schedule 28, which prescribes the rate of duties on contracts for the provision of services or supply. The duty on main contracts is 1% and on subcontracts is 0.1%. Note that there is a duty of 0.5% on all payments to the Tax Department as well.
## Payroll taxes
An employer is responsible for collecting taxes and contributions for the state. When an entity is audited by the tax authorities, the assessment is effectively on the employer for failing in its statutory obligation to collect those taxes and contributions. Note that individuals are not required to file annual statements of income.
## Social security contributions (INAS)
Social security contributions are payable by all persons working in Libya, including expatriates.
Social security contributions are computed on gross income, and current rates are as follows:
Gross income | Foreign branch (%) | Libyan entity (%)  
---|---|---  
Employee’s contribution | 5.125 | 5.125  
Employer’s contribution | 15.375 | 14.350  
Contribution from public treasury | - | 1.025  
Total | 20.50 | 20.50  
Social security is withheld by the employer and payable monthly, within ten days after the month end. For social security purposes, a late payment fine of 5% _per annum_ is assessed on the amount due.
