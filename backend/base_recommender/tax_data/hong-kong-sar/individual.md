## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
## Foreign tax relief
As a relief from double taxation, unilateral income exemption is available for employment income derived from services rendered outside Hong Kong SAR and where tax similar to the nature of Hong Kong salaries tax has been charged and paid on that income in the territory in which the services are rendered. This is applicable up to the year of assessment 2017/18.
Starting from the year of assessment 2018/19, the income exemption claim is only available where foreign tax has been paid in a non-CDTA jurisdiction for services rendered in that jurisdiction.
Technically, this income exemption applies to both Hong Kong and non-Hong Kong employments. However, such exemption is practically not applicable to taxpayers with a non-Hong Kong employment as only income of services rendered in Hong Kong SAR is taxable in cases of non-Hong Kong employment.
A foreign tax credit is available to Hong Kong tax residents in respect of income derived from and taxable in a jurisdiction that has entered into a CDTA with Hong Kong SAR and the same income is subject to tax in Hong Kong SAR. Salaries taxpayers are required to take all reasonable steps to minimise the foreign tax payable before making a claim for tax credit in Hong Kong SAR.

Note
  1. The treaty is pending ratification.
  2. The treaty is effective from the year of assessment 2025/26 in Hong Kong SAR.
  3. The treaty is effective from the year of assessment 2024/25 in Hong Kong SAR.


Hong Kong SAR has not entered into any social security agreements with any jurisdictions as there is no social security tax in Hong Kong SAR.
## Estate and gift tax conventions
Hong Kong SAR has not entered into any estate and gift tax conventions because estate duty was abolished in 2006 and it does not have a gift tax.
## Tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs)
Currently, Hong Kong SAR has entered into seven TIEAs with different jurisdictions as shown in the following table.
Denmark | Norway  
---|---  
Faroes | Sweden  
Greenland | United States  
Iceland  
All of the above TIEAs are ratified and effective.
In addition to the signing of the Hong Kong SAR-United States TIEA in March 2014, Hong Kong SAR signed a Model 2 intergovernmental agreement (IGA) with the United States in November 2014 to facilitate compliance with the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) by financial institutions in Hong Kong SAR.
## Automatic exchange of information (AEOI) / Common Reporting Standard (CRS) regime
Hong Kong SAR has put in place a legislative framework to implement the AEOI/CRS regime. Reportable financial institutions are required to identify the reportable financial accounts held by (i) tax residents of reportable jurisdictions or (ii) passive non-financial entities whose controlling persons are tax residents of reportable jurisdictions in accordance with the specified due diligence procedures, collect the required information of those reportable accounts, and furnish such information to the HKIRD. Such information will then be exchanged on an annual basis.
There are 126 reportable jurisdictions effective from 1 January 2020. However, Hong Kong SAR will only conduct AEOI with a reportable jurisdiction when an agreement is in place with that reportable jurisdiction to provide the basis for exchange.
As of December 2024, Hong Kong SAR has activated exchange relationships for CRS purposes with over 80 jurisdictions based on either a bilateral or multilateral competent authority agreement for CRS.

These measures have been cancelled through the enactment of the Stamp Duty (Amendment) Ordinance 2024, above.




# Hong Kong SAR
## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Hong Kong SAR does not impose income tax based on an individual’s total income. Instead, the three main types of income derived by individuals are taxed under different income taxes. That is, business or trading profits are taxed under profits tax, income from employment, office, or pension is taxed under salaries tax, and rental income from immovable property is taxed under property tax. The residence status of an individual is not a determinative factor in examining one's liability to salaries tax except in a tax treaty context.
A resident individual can elect for ‘personal assessment’, which is an assessment on the total income of the individual (_see the section for more information_).
## Territorial basis of taxation
A person’s residence, domicile or citizenship is not relevant in determining liability to Hong Kong salaries tax under the domestic law. The term ‘resident’ is defined in each of the comprehensive double tax agreements (CDTAs) signed by Hong Kong SAR and is used in applying a CDTA.
Hong Kong SAR adopts a territorial basis of taxation. All individuals, whether a resident or non-resident of Hong Kong SAR, are subject to Hong Kong salaries tax on (i) Hong Kong-sourced employment income, (ii) income from an office held in Hong Kong SAR, and (iii) income from a Hong Kong pension.
## Employment income
A person has Hong Kong-sourced employment income if the employment is a Hong Kong employment or in case the employment is a non-Hong Kong employment, the employment services are rendered by the person in Hong Kong SAR.
The Hong Kong Inland Revenue Department (HKIRD) will generally accept that an employment is a non-Hong Kong employment if all of the following three conditions are met:
  * The contract of employment was negotiated and entered into, and it is enforceable outside Hong Kong SAR.
  * The employer is a resident outside Hong Kong SAR.
  * The employee’s remuneration is paid outside Hong Kong SAR.


If any of the above conditions is not met, the employment will likely be considered by the HKIRD as Hong Kong employment.
For a Hong Kong employment, employment income is not taxable if all of the employment services for a year of assessment are rendered outside Hong Kong SAR. In determining whether all the services are rendered outside Hong Kong SAR for a given year of assessment, no account is taken of services rendered in Hong Kong SAR during visits not exceeding 60 days in the basis period for the year of assessment (the so-called ‘60-day rule’).
For a non-Hong Kong employment, only income attributed to services rendered in Hong Kong SAR is subject to Hong Kong salaries tax (the so-called ‘time apportionment basis’). Similar to Hong Kong employment, the 60-day rule will apply in considering whether there are any services rendered in Hong Kong SAR in a given year of assessment under a non-Hong Kong employment (i.e. services rendered in Hong Kong SAR during visits not exceeding 60 days in the basis period for the year of assessment will be ignored).
Where the employment income of an individual is subject to tax both in Hong Kong SAR and an overseas jurisdiction that does not have a CDTA with Hong Kong SAR, a unilateral income exemption may be available under the domestic tax law to provide relief from double taxation (_see the section for more information_).
There are special rules for taxing employment income derived by seafarers and aircrew.
Carried interest received by or accrued to a qualifying employee on or after 1 April 2020 from an employment with a qualifying entity that provides investment management services to a certified investment fund in Hong Kong SAR can be wholly excluded from employment income for salaries tax purposes, subject to specified conditions.
## Income from an office
The source of income from an office (e.g. directors’ fees) is determined by the location at which the company paying the fees is centrally managed and controlled. The ‘60-day rule’ and ‘time apportionment basis’ discussed above do not apply to income from an office.
## Pensions
Pensions are, in practice, subject to Hong Kong salaries tax if the funds out of which the payment is made are managed and controlled in Hong Kong SAR, and the pensions (other than a government pension) are related to services rendered in Hong Kong SAR. Similar to income from an office, the ‘60-day rule’ and ‘time-apportionment basis’ discussed above do not apply to income from a pension.
## Personal income tax (salaries tax) rates
In general, a person’s income from employment, less allowable deductions and personal allowances, is chargeable to Hong Kong salaries tax at progressive rates ranging from 2% to 17% as follows:
For 2024/25:
Net taxable income (HKD) | Tax on column 1 (HKD) | Percentage on excess (%)  
---|---|---  
Over (column 1) | Not over  
0 | 50,000 | - | 2  
50,000 | 100,000 | 1,000 | 6  
100,000 | 150,000 | 4,000 | 10  
150,000 | 200,000 | 9,000 | 14  
200,000 | 16,000 | 17  
The maximum tax for 2024/25, however, will be limited to tax at the two-tiered standard rates (15% on the first HKD 5 million of net income and 16% on the remainder) on the net assessable income after any allowable deductions (see the _section_) but without the deduction of personal allowances.
In rare cases where the total amount of allowable deductions exceeds the assessable income of an individual taxpayer in any year of assessment, the excess can be carried forward indefinitely to set off against the taxpayer’s assessable income in subsequent years of assessment.
## Local income taxes
Hong Kong SAR does not impose any local, state, or provincial income taxes.


# Hong Kong SAR
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
## Taxable period
An assessment year (or tax year) begins on 1 April of a year and ends on 31 March of the following year.
## Basis of assessment
The basis of assessment is the total assessable income accrued to a person in a given year of assessment with appropriate adjustments for allowable deductions and personal allowances.
## Personal assessment
An individual who is a Hong Kong resident may elect for personal assessment whereby income chargeable to salaries tax, profits tax and property tax is aggregated in a single assessment. Personal assessment enables an individual to offset a business loss against income subject to salaries tax or property tax and to claim deduction of loan interest on rental properties which is not available under property tax. Losses brought forward from previous tax years under personal assessment may be used to offset against income in current year or subsequent years. Allowable deductions and appropriate personal allowances are granted under personal assessment and the tax is calculated on the balance in the same manner as for salaries tax. The maximum tax payable is, however, limited to tax at the standard tax rate on the person's total assessable income less allowable deductions, but without a deduction for personal allowances.
A married person may elect for personal assessment on one's own rather than jointly with one's spouse as far as one is an individual who (i) is of or above the age of 18 years or is under that age if both parents are deceased and (ii) is either ordinarily resident in Hong Kong SAR or a temporary resident of Hong Kong SAR.
However, if a married couple has elected for joint assessment for salaries tax purposes, then an election for personal assessment must be made jointly by both individuals of the married couple.
## Joint assessment for married couples
Although the two individuals of a married couple who both earn taxable income are normally taxed separately, they may elect to be taxed jointly (i.e. election for joint assessment) where it is beneficial to them.
Under joint assessment, the total income of both spouses will be aggregated under one assessment, with adjustments for allowable deductions and appropriate personal allowances.
## Tax returns
Individual tax returns are issued on the first working day of May each year. The filing deadline is usually within a month from the date of issue. However, individuals who are represented by a tax representative are normally granted an extension of an additional month for filing their returns. Further extensions for return filing may be possible upon application and will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
In more complicated cases (e.g. those involving time apportionment claim), a tax return is usually filed together with a tax computation showing how the net chargeable income is computed. In general, no supporting documents (e.g. donation receipts) are required to be submitted together with a tax return. However, the HKIRD may request such supporting documents subsequent to the filing of the return.
A notice of assessment will be issued after the tax return has been processed by the HKIRD under the ‘assess first, audit later’ approach. Taxpayers may be subject to post-assessment investigation of the HKIRD at a later date.
## Payment of tax
Tax is usually payable in two instalments. The dates of payment of tax, which generally fall in January and April of the year following the year in which the tax return is issued, are determined by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and specified in an assessment notice. A system of provisional tax payments applies whereby estimated tax payments are made during the current year. The provisional salaries tax payable is normally estimated based on the previous year’s net chargeable income. The provisional salaries tax already paid is credited against the final salaries tax assessed for a year of assessment, which is determined after filing of the return.
## Withholding requirements
An employer is not obliged to withhold salaries tax from the remuneration paid to an employee except in cases where an employee is about to leave Hong Kong SAR for more than one month other than on a normal business trip. In such cases, the employer may be required to withhold payments from the departing employee.
As dividends and interest derived by individuals are not subject to Hong Kong income tax, there is no withholding requirement on such income derived by an individual.
Withholding tax is applicable to royalties received by non-resident individuals for the use of the relevant IP in Hong Kong SAR or for the use outside Hong Kong SAR and the royalties paid can be claimed as deductible under profits tax by the payer.
## Audit cycle
There is no specific tax audit cycle in Hong Kong SAR. Tax investigation targets are selected based on specific facts and circumstances of individual cases and certain criteria (e.g. income level) determined by the HKIRD.
## Statute of limitations
An additional assessment may be made by a HKIRD tax assessor if a taxpayer chargeable to tax has not been assessed to tax or has been assessed at less than the proper amount. The assessment must be made within the relevant year of assessment or within six years after the end of that year of assessment. The time limit for making additional assessments is extended when a taxpayer either has not been assessed, or is under-assessed, due to fraud or wilful evasion. In that case an additional assessment may be made up to ten years after the end of the relevant assessment year.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Salaries tax issues that are often subject to close scrutiny of the tax authority include: time apportionment claim, income exemption claim, taxability of termination payments, taxation of employee share benefits, and taxation of carried interest.


# Hong Kong SAR
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Outgoings and expenses other than those of a domestic, private or capital nature are allowable under salaries tax insofar as they are incurred wholly, exclusively, and necessarily in the production of income subject to salaries tax. In practice, very few expenses can meet the above restrictive requirements.
## Employment expenses
Some business travel expenses (excluding private travel expenses such as home to place of work) and entertainment expenses may qualify for deduction under salaries tax subject to the restrictive requirements above. Depreciation allowances may be allowed on capital expenditure incurred on plant and machinery, the use of which is essential to the production of assessable income.
## Concessionary deductions
A few concessionary deductions are specifically provided for under the Inland Revenue Ordinance.
### Qualifying premiums paid under the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme (VHIS)
Qualifying premiums paid under the Hong Kong SAR government’s VHIS are allowed for deduction starting from the year of assessment 2019/20. The maximum amount to be deducted in respect of qualifying premiums paid for each insured person for each tax year is HKD 8,000, with no cap on the number of insured persons for whom the taxpayer is eligible for claiming the concessionary deductions in a given year of assessment.
### Charitable donations
Charitable donations made in cash to approved charitable institutions are allowable if the aggregated amount for a year of assessment is not less than HKD 100. The deduction for charitable donations is restricted to 35% of the assessable income after allowable deductions of the year of assessment.
### Elderly residential care expenses
Elderly residential care expenses paid to a residential care home in respect of a parent or grandparent of a taxpayer or spouse are deductible up to a maximum of HKD 100,000 for each tax year for each parent or grandparent.
### Self-education expenses
A deduction is allowed for self-education expenses paid for employment-related courses. The maximum amount of deduction allowed for each tax year is HKD 100,000.
### Mandatory contributions to an MPF scheme and contributions to other retirement schemes
Mandatory contributions to an MPF scheme and contributions to other recognised occupational retirement schemes are deductible up to a maximum of HKD 18,000 for each tax year.
### **Voluntary contributions to an MPF scheme and qualifying annuity premiums**
Effective from the year of assessment 2019/20, a deduction is allowed for (i) employee’s MPF voluntary contributions made to a designated MPF account and (ii) qualifying annuity premiums paid for a qualifying deferred annuity policy (essentially those policies certified by the Insurance Authority).
The maximum total tax deduction allowed for (i) and (ii) above is HKD 60,000 for each tax year.
If an employee is entitled to tax deduction for both qualifying annuity premiums and MPF voluntary contributions for a year of assessment, deductions will firstly be allowed for MPF voluntary contributions and then for qualifying annuity premiums.
### Home loan interest expenses
Home loan interest paid can be deducted by a person if the property is owned by that person and is occupied by that person as their place of residence during the year of assessment. The place or residence must be situated in Hong Kong SAR in order to qualify for the deduction. The maximum deduction for each tax year is HKD 100,000 (increased to HKD 120,000 for taxpayers residing with a child born on or after 25 October 2023 starting from the year of assessment 2024/25) for 20 years of assessment.
### Domestic rents
Domestic rents paid by a person as a tenant under a qualifying tenancy of domestic premises are allowed for deduction up to a maximum amount of HKD 100,000 (increased to HKD 120,000 for taxpayers residing with a child born on or after 25 October 2023 starting from the year of assessment 2024/25) for each tax year starting from the year of assessment 2022/23.
## Standard deductions
There is no blanket or standard deduction although a few concessionary deductions are available (_see Concessionary deductions above for more information_).
## Personal allowances
Under salaries tax and personal assessment (if elected), allowances are granted to each taxpayer provided that the applicable conditions for the allowances are satisfied. The amounts allowed for the year of assessment 2024/25 are shown below.
Personal allowances | 2024/25 (HKD)  
---|---  
Basic allowance (for single persons) (1) | 132,000  
Married person’s allowance (for married couples) (1) | 264,000  
Child allowances (2):  
1st to 9th child (each):  
Year of birth | 260,000  
Other years | 130,000  
Dependent parent or grandparent allowance (each):  
Aged 60 or above:  
Not residing with taxpayer throughout the tax year | 50,000  
Residing with taxpayer throughout the tax year | 100,000  
Aged 55 to 59:  
Not residing with taxpayer throughout the tax year | 25,000  
Residing with taxpayer throughout the tax year | 50,000  
Dependent brother or sister allowance (for whom no child allowance is claimed) | 37,500  
Single parent allowance (for single parent with sole or predominant care of a child) | 132,000  
Disabled dependant allowance (in addition to any allowances already granted for the disabled person) | 75,000  
Personal disability allowance (in addition to any allowances already granted for the disabled person) | 75,000  
Notes
  1. If both spouses of a married couple have income chargeable to salaries tax and no joint assessment or joint personal assessment is elected, they are taxed as two single persons and each will be entitled to the basic allowance. The married allowance is given only if one spouse has no income liable to salaries tax and has not elected for personal assessment, or where joint assessment or joint personal assessment is elected by the couple.
  2. Child allowances are only available to one of the spouses of a married couple. The couple must state which spouse will claim the child allowance.


## Business deductions
Business expenses incurred for producing assessable profits are allowable under profits tax (_see Profits tax in the section for more information_).
## Losses
Business losses may be used to offset against assessable business profits from the same trade under profits tax. If an individual elects for personal assessment (_see the section for more information_), business losses can be used to offset property rental income, employment income, or business profits from other trades. Capital losses are not allowable under either salaries tax or profits tax.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are not deductible as they do not meet the conditions of being incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the production of income subject to salaries tax.


# Hong Kong SAR
## Individual - Other issues
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
## Treatment of business entities
An individual who does not set up a separate legal entity can conduct business in Hong Kong SAR through the following principal forms:
  * Partnership.
  * Sole proprietorship.


The above forms are subject to Hong Kong profits tax in their own names in respect of any profits arising in or derived from Hong Kong SAR from a trade, profession, or business carried on in Hong Kong SAR. The individual can, however, elect for personal assessment whereby income chargeable to salaries tax, profits tax, and property tax is aggregated in a single assessment (_see the section for more information_).
## Visa and work permit
Foreigners are generally required to obtain a work permit before taking employment in Hong Kong SAR.
Visa applications may be submitted to the nearest Chinese diplomatic and consular mission at the individual’s place of residence, or applications may be sent directly to the Hong Kong Immigration Department, or through the sponsor in Hong Kong SAR. The application must be supported by certain specified documents (e.g. resume, letter of contract of employment, letter from employer).
The Hong Kong Immigration Department will contact the individual and/or the sponsor for verification upon receiving the application.
## Tax equalisation or reimbursement plans
A tax reimbursement programme is usually provided by employers to expatriate employees to alleviate any tax increases which may be incurred as a result of an overseas assignment. A tax reimbursement programme may either be a ‘tax protection’ or ‘tax equalisation’ plan.
A tax protection plan makes provision for the employee’s total tax liability not to exceed the amount they would have paid in their home country had the employee not been posted overseas. If the employee’s actual tax liabilities exceed the hypothetical home country tax, the employer reimburses the difference to the employee. If the actual tax liabilities are less than the hypothetical home country tax, the employee keeps the difference.
In contrast, a tax equalisation plan aims to maintain the employee’s tax burden as if they had remained in the home country. If the employee’s actual taxes are greater than they would have incurred in the home country, the employer reimburses the excess, and if the actual taxes are less, the employee is required to pay the difference to the employer.
The hypothetical home country tax must be calculated under either plan. The hypothetical tax is generally computed on the base salary and other remuneration as if the employee had remained in the home country.

## Individual - Sample personal income tax calculation
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Below is a sample salaries tax computation for year of assessment 2024/25 for illustrative purposes.
Assumptions:
  * The individual is a married person with two children both below age 18.
  * The individual’s spouse is not working and the two children are maintained by the individual.
  * The total assessable income of the individual consists of salaries of HKD 650,000 and year-end bonus of HKD 50,000.
  * The individual made contributions of HKD 18,000 to an MPF scheme during the year.
  * The individual made qualified charitable donations of HKD 3,000 during the year.

Salaries tax computation | HKD | HKD  
---|---|---  
Salaries | 650,000  
Bonus | 50,000  
Total assessable income | 700,000  
**Less: Concessionary deductions**  
Charitable donations | (3,000)  
Retirement scheme contributions | _(18,000)_ | _(21,000)_  
Net income | 679,000  
**Less: Allowances**  
Married person’s allowance | (264,000)  
Child allowances (HKD 130,000 x 2) | _(260,000)_ | _(524,000)_  
Net chargeable income | 155,000  
**Tax at progressive rates:**  
First HKD 50,000 @ 2% | 1,000  
Next HKD 50,000 @ 6% | 3,000  
Next HKD 50,000 @ 10% | 5,000  
Remainder HKD 5,000 @ 14% | 700  
**Tax payable (1)** | **9,700**  
Note
  1. The tax amount calculated based on the standard rate (i.e. HKD 679,000 @15% = HKD 101,850) is higher than that computed at progressive rates so the standard rate would not apply. Tax reduction for the year of assessment 2024/25 (if any) has not yet been announced.




# Hong Kong SAR
## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
## Employment income
Taxable employment income includes any wages, salaries, leave pay, fees, commissions, bonuses, gratuities, perquisites, and allowances, with certain specific exemptions. Set out below are the tax treatments of some common items.
### Benefits in kind
If the employer has sole and primary liability for payment of the benefit, and no other person including the employee acts as a surety in respect of the liability, the employee will generally not be taxed on such benefit, except in three situations:
  * if the benefit is capable of being converted into money by the employee, or
  * if the employer pays any amount in connection with the education of a child of an employee, or
  * if the employer pays any amount in connection with the holiday journey of an employee.


In the first situation above, the taxable benefit is the second-hand value of the benefit obtained and in the second and third situations the taxable benefit is the cost to the employer of providing the benefit.
### Housing benefits
Housing that is provided or subsidised by an employer or its associated corporation is taxable. However, instead of taxing the amount of rents paid by the employer, the taxable amount is the rental value of the housing quarters in excess of the rents actually paid by the employee for the quarter (if any). The rental value of housing quarters provided by an employer is computed as a percentage of the employee’s assessable income less any allowable outgoings and expenses and depreciation allowances on capital expenditure incurred on machinery or plant, as follows:
Type of accommodation | Rate (%)  
---|---  
Hotel, hostel, or boarding house, with one bedroom | 4  
Hotel, hostel, or boarding house, with not more than two bedrooms | 8  
Other accommodation | 10  
Where an employer refunds all or part of the rents paid by an employee, the treatment will be similar to cases in which the employer provides accommodation to the employee rent-free or at a reduced rent.
A cash allowance for housing is fully taxable where the employer has no control over how it is spent by the employee.
### Retirement benefits
Any sums received by way of commutation of pension under a recognised occupational retirement scheme upon death, incapacity, retirement, terminal illness, or termination of service are exempt, with certain exceptions where there is a termination of service of less than ten years with an employer. Any sums received by way of commutation of pension under the Pensions Ordinance are also exempt.
Any sums received by an employee in connection to the employer's mandatory contributions to an MPF scheme are exempt from salaries tax. Sums related to the employer's voluntary contributions received from an MPF scheme upon death, incapacity, retirement, terminal illness, or termination of service of the employee are also exempt, with certain exceptions where there is a termination of service of less than ten years with an employer. Sums related to the employer's voluntary contributions received at times other than those mentioned above are taxable.
Sums related to employer's contributions received from a retirement scheme that is not a recognised occupational retirement scheme or an MPF scheme are subject to Hong Kong salaries tax.
### Termination payments
Compensation for termination of employment that does not represent a payment for past, present, or future services is not taxable in general. Such payment should be distinguished from termination gratuities that relate to services previously rendered by the employee, which are therefore taxable. Taxable termination payments may be spread backward over the final three years of employment for Hong Kong salaries tax purposes.
Long service or severance payments made in accordance with the Employment Ordinance are not subject to Hong Kong salaries tax.
Payment in lieu of notice is taxable.
## Equity compensation
Gains from any employee share options are taxable when the options are exercised, assigned or released. There are specific provisions governing the taxation of employee stock options. Other employee share-based benefits (such as share awards) are also subject to Hong Kong salaries tax.
## Business income
Business income is taxed under profits tax (_see Profits tax in the section for more information_).
## Capital gains
All capital gains derived by an individual are not subject to tax in Hong Kong SAR (_see Profits tax in the section for more information_).
## Dividend income
Dividends derived by an individual are not subject to tax in Hong Kong SAR.
## Interest income

## Payroll taxes
### Contribution to mandatory provident fund (MPF) scheme
Hong Kong SAR’s MPF system came into operation on 1 December 2000. The MPF scheme is designed to provide a formal, compulsory system of retirement protection by way of a privately managed contribution scheme. An employee is required to contribute 5% of their monthly income, and the employer must make a monthly contribution matching this amount. The maximum level of income for contribution purposes is HKD 30,000 per month. Accordingly, the maximum mandatory contribution for each of the employee and employer is HKD 1,500 per month. The employee’s mandatory contributions will be withheld from the monthly income by the employer.
An employee whose income is less than HKD 7,100 per month is not required to make mandatory contributions. However, the employer of such employee is required to contribute an amount that is equal to 5% of the employee’s monthly income.
Exemption from joining the MPF scheme is available for some very limited categories of employees, including people from overseas who enter Hong Kong SAR for employment for not more than 13 months or who are covered by an overseas retirement scheme.
An employee or an employer may make voluntary contributions in addition to the mandatory contributions required.
## Profits tax
Business profits with a Hong Kong source derived by individuals are taxable under profits tax irrespective of whether they are residents. While there is no capital gains tax in Hong Kong SAR, onshore gains from disposal of assets may be considered as trading gains which are taxable under profits tax. Hong Kong sourced royalties received by resident individuals are taxable as business profits under profits tax. Withholding tax is applicable to royalties received by non-resident individuals if the use of the relevant intellectual property (IP) is in Hong Kong SAR or the use is outside Hong Kong SAR and the royalties paid can be claimed as deductible under profits tax by the payer.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT) / Goods and services tax / Sales tax
Value-added, goods and services, and sales taxes do not apply in Hong Kong SAR.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Hong Kong SAR.
## Estate and gift taxes
Hong Kong SAR does not have an estate duty or a gift tax.
## Property tax
Property tax is charged to the owner of any land or buildings (except government and consular properties) in Hong Kong SAR at the standard rate of 15% on the net assessable value of such land or buildings. Net assessable value of a property is the consideration payable to the owner for the right to use the land or buildings less irrecoverable rent, rates paid by the owner, and a 20% notional allowance. Property occupied by the owner for self-use is not subject to property tax as no rent is receivable with respect to that property.
## Government rates and rent
Rates are an indirect tax levied on properties in Hong Kong SAR. Rates are charged at 5% of the rateable value which is the estimated annual rental value of a property at the designated valuation reference date of 1 October. For domestic tenements, rates are charged on the rateable value at progressive rates of 5% (for the first HKD 550,000), 8% (for the next HKD 250,000), and 12% (for the remainder).
Privately owned land in Hong Kong SAR is normally held by way of a government lease under which rent is payable to the Hong Kong SAR government in return for the right to hold and occupy the land for the term (i.e. the duration) specified in the lease document. Currently, government rent is calculated at 3% of the rateable value of the property and is adjusted in step with any subsequent changes in the rateable value.
## Treatment of foreign owned real estate
Offshore rental income or gain from disposal of foreign real estate owned by a Hong Kong resident individual is generally not subject to Hong Kong tax.
## Customs duties
Hong Kong SAR does not impose customs duties on imported goods. Excise tax is levied on limited categories of dutiable commodities (i.e. tobacco, liquor, methyl alcohol, and hydrocarbons) regardless of whether they are imported or locally manufactured. As far as individuals are concerned, the duties are usually included in the sale prices of such commodities by the retailers.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is charged on transfer of Hong Kong stock by way of sale and purchase at 0.2% of the consideration (or the market value if it is higher) per transaction. Hong Kong stock is defined as stock the transfer of which must be registered in Hong Kong SAR.
Effective from 11 am on 28 February 2024, ad valorem stamp duty on transfer of properties is charged at progressive rates ranging from HKD 100 (for property consideration of up to HKD 3 million) to 4.25% (for property consideration exceeding HKD 20 million).
The stamp duty payable is computed by applying the relevant rate to the consideration or market value of the property (whichever is higher). Marginal relief is available for transfer where the consideration is marginally above the lower bound of each rate band.
For lease of immovable property in Hong Kong SAR, stamp duty is calculated at a specified rate of the annual rental that varies with the term of the lease. Currently, the applicable rate ranges from 0.25% (for lease period of not more than one year) to 1% (for lease period of more than three years).
## Special stamp duty (SSD)
There is an SSD on resale of residential property in Hong Kong SAR within 24 months from the date of acquisition. Effective from 11 am on 28 February 2024, the rate of SSD payable is reduced to 0%.
## Buyer’s stamp duty (BSD)
A BSD is payable on acquisition of Hong Kong residential properties by any person other than a Hong Kong permanent resident. Effective from 11 am on 28 February 2024, the rate of BSD payable is reduced to 0%.
## Transfer tax / Turnover tax / Registration tax
There is no transfer/turnover tax in Hong Kong SAR.
### Motor vehicle first registration tax (FRT)
All motor vehicles to be used on roads in Hong Kong SAR, whether brand new or used, are subject to the FRT. In general, the taxable value is calculated on the basis of the published retail price or provisional taxable value assessed by the Customs and Excise Department. The applicable tax rate depends on the class of the motor vehicle. To encourage the use of environment-friendly commercial vehicles with lower emissions, concession of the FRT is offered to first registered owners of environment-friendly commercial vehicles meeting the qualifying standards of the tax incentive scheme.
## Environmental taxes
### Plastic shopping bag (PSB) charging scheme
Except for plastics bags used for food hygiene reasons, all plastic bags (including flat-top bags) used for retail sales are subject to PSB charges. Retailers are required to charge at least HKD 1 for each PSB provided to consumers. The proceeds from the PSB charges are retained by the retailers.
### Municipal solid waste (MSW) charging
The Hong Kong SAR government announced on 27 May 2024 that it will defer the implementation of MSW charging until further notice.
