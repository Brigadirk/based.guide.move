  * The Inland Revenue (Amendment) (Tax Concessions and Two-tiered Standard Rates) Ordinance 2024 was gazetted on 31 May 2024 to give effect to the 100% reduction of profits tax for the year of assessment 2023/24, subject to a cap of HKD 3,000.
  * The Stamp Duty (Amendment) Ordinance 2024 was gazetted on 19 April 2024 to give effect to the demand-side management measures for residential properties, which include (i) replacing the existing flat rate of _ad valorem_ stamp duty payable on certain instruments dealing with residential properties with new rates that are the same as those for non-residential properties and (ii) lowering the rate of special stamp duty payable on certain instruments dealing with residential properties and the rate of buyer’s stamp duty payable on certain instruments to 0%.
  * The Inland Revenue (Amendment) (Aircraft Leasing Tax Concessions) Ordinance 2024 was gazetted on 1 March 2024 to enhance the existing aircraft leasing preferential tax regime and make related amendments, which took retrospective effect from the year of assessment 2023/24.
  * The Stamp Duty (Amendment) (Residential Properties) Ordinance 2024 was gazetted on 9 February 2024 to give effect to the demand-side management measures for residential properties, which include (i) shortening the applicable period of the special stamp duty from 36 months to 24 months and (ii) reducing the respective rates of the buyer’s stamp duty and new residential stamp duty from 15% to 7.5%. These measures have been cancelled through the enactment of the Stamp Duty (Amendment) Ordinance 2024, above.
  * The Inland Revenue (Amendment) (Tax Deductions for Spectrum Utilization Fees) Ordinance 2024 was gazetted on 19 January 2024 to provide for tax deductions for spectrum utilisation fees (SUFs) which applies to SUFs derived in auctions conducted on or after 19 January 2024.

## Corporate - Tax administration

## Taxable period
A year of assessment (or tax year) begins on 1 April of a year and ends on 31 March of the following year. The period that is used to compute the taxable profits for a year of assessment is called the basis period, which is normally the financial year ending in the year of assessment.
## Tax returns
Tax returns are issued on the first working day of April each year. Effective from the year of assessment 2018/19, there are different supplementary forms for profits tax filing purposes, and taxpayers are required to file the supplementary forms that are applicable to them together with the tax return issued.
The filing deadline is usually within a month from the date of issue of the tax return. However, corporations whose financial year ends between 1 December and 31 March and who are represented by a tax representative are normally granted an extension for filing their returns. The exact filing due date depends on the accounting year-end date of the taxpayer.
The basis of assessment is the accounting profits of the financial year ending within the year of assessment, with appropriate adjustments for tax purposes. A tax return is usually filed together with a tax computation showing the tax adjustments to the accounting profits in arriving at the taxable profits or allowable tax losses for a given year of assessment.
Corporate taxpayers are also required to attach their audited accounts as supporting documents when filing a profits tax return. A branch of a foreign corporation doing business in Hong Kong SAR is required to file a profits tax return annually, and the HKIRD may require audited accounts, if any, of the foreign corporation to support the Hong Kong branch’s profits tax return.
A notice of assessment or statement of loss will be issued after the tax return has been processed by the HKIRD, under the ‘assess first, audit later’ approach. Taxpayers may be subject to post-assessment investigation or field audit based on risk areas or under the computerised random selection procedures of the HKIRD at a later date.
## Payment of tax
Tax is usually payable in two instalments. The dates of payment of tax, which generally fall between November of the year in which the return is issued and April of the following year, are determined by the CIR and specified in an assessment notice. A system of provisional tax payments applies whereby estimated tax payments are made during the current year. The provisional profits tax payable is normally estimated based on the previous year’s assessable profits. The provisional profits tax already paid is credited against the final profits tax assessed for a year of assessment, which is determined after filing of the return.
Taking a company with an accounting year end date of 31 December as an example, the final tax payment for the company for a given tax year is usually due in November of the year in which the return is issued, whereas the provisional tax payments (to be paid in two instalments) are usually due in November of the same year and January of the following year.
## Tax audit process
There is no specific tax audit cycle in Hong Kong SAR. Tax audit targets are selected with reference to certain criteria determined by the HKIRD.
## Statute of limitations
An additional assessment may be made by an HKIRD tax assessor if a taxpayer chargeable to tax has not been assessed to tax or has been assessed at less than the proper amount. The assessment must be made within the relevant year of assessment or within six years after the end of that year of assessment. The time limit for making additional assessments is extended when a taxpayer either has not been assessed, or is under-assessed, due to fraud or wilful evasion. In that case, an additional assessment may be made up to ten years after the end of the relevant assessment year.
A statement of loss is not an assessment, and the above six-year time limit does not apply to issue or revision of a statement of loss. A tax loss year remains technically open until the sixth year after the first year in which the taxpayer has an assessable profit after utilising all the tax losses brought forward.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Profits tax issues that are often subject to close scrutiny of the tax authority include offshore claim of profits, capital claims of income, transactions with associated persons, and deductibility of expenses (e.g. interest expenses, share-based payments, intra-group management/service fees).
## General anti-avoidance rules (GAARs)
The IRO includes a GAAR (i.e. section 61A) allowing the HKIRD to disregard a transaction or counteract the tax benefit conferred by a transaction if the sole or dominant purpose of entering into such a transaction is to obtain a tax benefit. Whether the sole or dominant purpose of entering into a transaction is for obtaining a tax benefit will be assessed according to a set of factors stipulated in section 61A. Another GAAR in the IRO is section 61, which empowers the HKIRD to disregard a transaction that reduces or would reduce the amount of tax payable by any person if that transaction is considered artificial or fictitious. Although both GAARs could be used, in practice, section 61A is more often invoked by the HKIRD in tackling tax avoidance schemes.


# Hong Kong SAR
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
For Hong Kong profits tax purposes, corporate residency is not relevant in determining the taxability of an entity except in a tax treaty context. Under the domestic tax law of Hong Kong SAR, the decisive factors for taxability are (i) whether a corporation is carrying on a trade, profession, or business in Hong Kong SAR, (ii) whether profits are derived from such trade, profession, or business, and (iii) whether profits are arising in or derived from Hong Kong SAR.
However, where it is necessary to determine the corporate residence, such as for the purpose of a comprehensive double taxation agreement/arrangement (CDTA), companies incorporated in Hong Kong SAR and companies that are normally managed or controlled / centrally managed and controlled (with a few exceptions and depending on the provisions of the relevant CDTA) in Hong Kong SAR are generally considered as a Hong Kong tax resident.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The decisive factors for determining chargeability to Hong Kong profits tax are whether a person carries on a trade, profession, or business in Hong Kong SAR and whether Hong Kong-sourced profits are derived from such trade, profession, or business. Whether a trade, profession, or business is carried on in Hong Kong SAR is a question of fact. A non-resident person, including a foreign corporation, having a PE in Hong Kong SAR will be deemed as carrying on a trade, profession, or business in Hong Kong SAR. The profits attributable to the PE will be subject to Hong Kong profits tax if such profits are arising in or derived from Hong Kong SAR.
A definition of PE has been incorporated into the IRO as part of the transfer pricing (TP) regulatory regime. For a CDTA territory resident person, the definition of PE follows that in the PE article of the CDTA that Hong Kong SAR has with that territory. For a non-CDTA territory resident person, the definition of PE is specified in the IRO and largely follows that in the PE article of the 2017 OECD Model Tax Convention.
Effective from the year of assessment 2019/20, for a non-Hong Kong resident having a PE in Hong Kong SAR, the TP rules on attribution of profits to a PE in Hong Kong SAR (i.e. TP Rule 2) apply to determine the amount of profits attributed to the PE in Hong Kong SAR (_see the section for more details on profits attribution to a PE and the section for more details on the TP rules_).


# Hong Kong SAR
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Expenses that are incurred for producing profits chargeable to tax and that are not capital in nature are generally tax deductible. In addition, special tax relief is available for certain capital expenditure. There are special rules for deduction of certain expenses (e.g. interest expenses).
Accounting treatments are usually followed in determining the assessable profits, except when there is an explicit rule in the IRO. Accrued expenses recognised in the profit and loss account in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are usually deductible if they are incurred for producing profits chargeable/subject to Hong Kong profits tax and are not capital in nature.
Expense items for which a tax adjustment is necessary in determining the amount of taxable profits from the accounting profits include: tax depreciation allowance vs. accounting depreciation, expenses that are capital in nature, general provisions that are non-deductible, and non-deductible interest expenses on borrowings used to finance non-income producing assets.
Set out below are the Hong Kong profits tax treatments of some common expense items.
## Tax depreciation of fixed assets
Tax depreciation allowances / deductions are available for capital expenditure incurred on the construction of buildings or structures and in the provision of machinery and plant for trade or business purposes, as follows:
  * Industrial buildings and structures: An initial allowance of 20%, in addition to an annual allowance of 4%, of the cost of construction or cost of purchase from a developer is granted for an industrial building or structure occupied for the purpose of a qualifying trade. Provision is made for balancing allowance or charge in the year of assessment in which the building is disposed of to adjust the written-down value of the building to the disposal price. Balancing charges are restricted to the total of initial and annual allowances previously given.
  * Commercial buildings and structures: An annual allowance of 4% of the capital expenditure incurred on the construction is applicable. A balancing allowance or charge applies upon disposal. Balancing charges are restricted to the total annual allowances previously given.
  * Plant and machinery: An initial allowance of 60% of the capital expenditure on plant and machinery is given for the year of assessment during the basis period in which the expenditure is incurred. An annual allowance is also given for depreciation at three prescribed rates on the reducing value of each of the three depreciation rate ‘pools’. The three prescribed rates are 10%, 20%, and 30%, and the reducing value of each of the three depreciation rate pools is original cost less initial and annual allowances and sales proceeds. Provision is made for balancing charges when plant and machinery within one of the three depreciation rate pools is sold or disposed of and the reducing value of that pool is less than the sale price, which is capped at the original amount incurred in the pool. In addition, balancing allowances or charges may be applicable upon cessation of business. Otherwise, sales proceeds are deducted in calculating the reducing value on which the annual allowance is calculated.


Book depreciation is adjusted for tax purposes in accordance with the above depreciation allowances granted under the IRO.
## Goodwill
Cost of acquisition of goodwill / amortisation of goodwill is not deductible as it is capital in nature.
## Organisational and start-up expenses
In general, company formation/start-up expenses that are incurred before the commencement of a trade, profession, or business and that are for the establishment of the overall income producing structure are capital in nature and not tax deductible.
## Research and development (R&D)
An R&D tax deduction regime was introduced in Hong Kong SAR that applies to qualifying expenditure incurred or qualifying payment made on or after 1 April 2018. Under the new R&D tax deduction regime, there are two types of qualifying R&D expenditure, namely Type A expenditure and Type B expenditure. Subject to certain conditions, Type A expenditure (R&D expenditure other than Type B expenditure) will be granted a 100% normal deduction. Type B expenditure will be entitled to a 300% deduction for the first HKD 2 million of the expenditure and a 200% deduction for the remaining amount, without any limit on the amount eligible for the 200% deduction.
## Interest expenses
There is no thin capitalisation rule in Hong Kong SAR. However, except in some specified circumstances (e.g. interest expenses paid to an overseas associated corporation by a corporation carrying on an intra-group financing business in Hong Kong SAR where certain conditions are met), interest expenses paid to an overseas recipient other than a financial institution (whether a related or unrelated party) are generally not deductible if the overseas recipient is not subject to Hong Kong profits tax on the interest income. In addition, deduction of interest expense is subject to stringent and complicated rules that are designed to guard against loan arrangements with an intention to avoid Hong Kong profits tax.
## Bad debts
In general, a bad or doubtful debt incurred in any trade, profession, or business, proved to the satisfaction of the Hong Kong Inland Revenue Department (HKIRD) to have become bad during the basis period for a year of assessment, is deductible. The deduction is limited to debts that were included as a trading receipt in ascertaining the taxpayer’s assessable profits or debts in respect of money lent in the ordinary course of a money-lending business in Hong Kong SAR.
If a taxpayer has elected to adopt the fair value basis to account for its financial instruments for profits tax filing purposes, a special deduction rule instead of the above general rule applies. Under the special rule, an impairment loss recognised in respect of a financial instrument that represents a trading debt or a debt in respect of money lent in the ordinary course of a money lending business in Hong Kong SAR is deductible only if it is credit-impaired.
If any bad debt, doubtful debt, or impairment loss that has previously been allowed as a deduction is ultimately recovered, it will be treated as taxable profits of the basis period in which it is recovered.
## Charitable donations
A deduction is allowed for cash donations to approved charities made in the basis period for a year of assessment if the aggregate of such donations is not less than HKD 100. The deduction is limited to 35% of the assessable profits of the year of assessment.
## Pension expenses
A deduction is allowed for regular/ordinary contributions to a mandatory provident fund scheme or recognised occupational retirement scheme made by an employer in respect of an employee to the extent that the contributions do not exceed 15% of the employee's total emoluments for the period to which the contributions relate.
Special payments, other than the ordinary contributions to a mandatory provident fund scheme or recognised occupational retirement scheme, are capital in nature but can be deducted evenly over a five-year period under a specific provision of the IRO.
There are also specific rules for deduction of provisions for contributions to a mandatory provident fund scheme or recognised occupational retirement scheme.
## Payments for directors
Director fees or other remunerations paid by a corporation to its directors are generally deductible under the normal deduction rule. Nevertheless, no deduction is allowed on salaries or other remunerations paid to a sole proprietor or the proprietor’s spouse, or any partners or partners’ spouses of a partnership business.
## Contingent liabilities
Generally speaking, general provisions for expenses are not deductible, whereas specific provisions are deductible if the HKIRD is satisfied that the amount has been incurred (i.e. the taxpayer has a legal/contractual obligation to pay such amount in the future) and that the provision represents a reasonably accurate estimate of the future liability.
## Special deductions
There are special deduction rules for expenditures incurred:
  * for refurbishment of a building or structure, other than a domestic building or structure
  * on environmental protection installation and machinery
  * on environment-friendly vehicles
  * on machinery or plant used specifically and directly for any manufacturing process, computer hardware (other than that which is an integral part of machinery or plant), computer software, and computer systems (collectively known as prescribed fixed assets)
  * for registering trademarks, designs, or patents used in the production of taxable profits
  * on the purchase of patent/know-how rights and specified IP rights (i.e. copyrights, registered trademarks, registered designs, protected layout-design [topography] rights in respect of integrated circuits, protected plant variety rights, or performer’s economic rights), provided certain specified conditions are met
  * on spectrum utilisation fees, and
  * on reinstatement costs for leased premises.


## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are generally not deductible, as the HKIRD does not consider them to be expenses incurred for producing profits chargeable/subject to tax.
## Taxes
Taxes paid on corporate profits are generally not deductible for the purpose of calculating the assessable profits. The HKIRD may consider a foreign tax that is not calculated by reference to profits as deductible under the general deduction provision.
Where foreign taxes were charged on (i) interest income or gains from the sale of a certificate of deposit, bill of exchange, or regulatory capital security that are deemed to be subject to profits tax in Hong Kong SAR or (ii) a certain percentage of gross income without deduction for outgoings and expenses (e.g. WHTs on royalties and service fees), and the same income is also subject to profits tax in Hong Kong SAR, a deduction is allowed for foreign taxes of substantially the same nature of Hong Kong profits tax paid in respect of the same income in the following situations:
  * For Hong Kong residents, deduction is allowed for the foreign taxes that are not paid in a jurisdiction having a CDTA with Hong Kong SAR, provided that the taxpayer had taken all reasonable steps to minimise the foreign tax paid. In the case where such foreign taxes are paid in a CDTA jurisdiction, a Hong Kong resident can only claim a tax credit for the foreign taxes paid on the relevant income.
  * For non-Hong Kong residents, deduction is allowed for the foreign taxes paid in another jurisdiction, provided that the taxpayer had taken all foreign tax minimisation steps (i) in the jurisdiction where the income is received or receivable (i.e. source jurisdiction) and (ii) in the residence jurisdiction of that person, including any double tax relief available. If relief of the amount of foreign taxes paid in the source jurisdiction is available in the residence jurisdiction of the non-resident person after taking all the foreign tax minimisation steps, the deduction in Hong Kong SAR will be limited to the portion of foreign taxes that are not entitled to relief in the residence jurisdiction.


## Net operating and capital losses
Net operating losses incurred in an accounting year can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future profits of the business. A corporation carrying on more than one business may have losses in one business offset profits of the others, with any balance being carried forward. However, offshore losses sustained from the sale of assets (where the proceeds are received in Hong Kong SAR, and where the gain would have been taxable had a gain been derived from the transaction) may only be set off against the taxpayer’s assessable profits derived in the current or subsequent years of assessment from specified foreign-sourced income that is chargeable to profits tax under the refined FSIE regime. Net operating losses cannot be carried backward.
Capital losses are not tax deductible.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Royalties and service fees paid/payable by a Hong Kong corporation to foreign affiliates are deductible, provided they are incurred in the production of profits chargeable/subject to tax. There is no special restriction on the deductibility of these payments.
In general, interest payable by a Hong Kong corporation to a foreign affiliate is not deductible if the recipient is not chargeable/subject to Hong Kong profits tax on the interest income received (except where either the payer or the recipient is a financial institution as defined in the tax law). Interest expenses on money borrowed from a non-Hong Kong associated corporation by a corporation in the ordinary course of its intra-group financing business carried on in Hong Kong SAR are deductible, provided that certain specified conditions are met.


# Hong Kong SAR
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Hong Kong SAR does not have a consolidated or group taxation regime.
## Transfer pricing (TP)
Legislation to implement a TP regulatory regime and TP documentation requirements was enacted in July 2018. The key TP measures and the respective effective dates are as follows:
### The TP regulatory regime
There are two sets of TP rules. Under TP Rule 1, the HKIRD can impose TP adjustments on domestic or cross-border related-party transactions that are not entered into on an arm’s-length basis and that result in a potential Hong Kong tax advantage, with exemptions for certain specified domestic transactions. Under TP Rule 2, the Authorised OECD Approach (i.e. the separate enterprises principle) will be adopted for profit attribution to a PE of a non-Hong Kong resident in Hong Kong SAR (_see the section for more information_).
TP Rule 1 applies to years of assessment beginning on or after 1 April 2018, whereas TP Rule 2 applies to years of assessment beginning on or after 1 April 2019. There is a grandfathering provision under which transactions entered into or effected before 13 July 2018 (i.e. the enactment date of the new TP law) will not be subject to the above TP rules. The HKIRD published Departmental Interpretation and Practice Notes (DIPNs) 59 and 60 in July 2019 to provide further guidance on the interpretation and application of TP Rule 1 and Rule 2, respectively.
In general, the HKIRD will apply the TP rules in the way that is consistent with the OECD’s Transfer Pricing Guidelines and the commentary on the business profits article and associated enterprises article of the OECD Model Tax Convention.
### The TP documentation requirement
There is a mandatory 'three-tiered' TP documentation requirement consisting of Master File, Local File, and Country-by-Country (CbC) report.
For Master File and Local File, there are certain exemption thresholds based on the business size and the volume of different types of related-party transactions such that a Hong Kong enterprise is not required to prepare the Master File and the Local File if either the business size thresholds or all the volume-based, related-party transactions thresholds are not exceeded. Master File and Local File are required for accounting periods beginning from 1 April 2018 and have to be prepared within nine months after the accounting period end to which the files relate.
For CbC reports, please see the description of the CbC reporting regime below.
The HKIRD published DIPN 58 in July 2019 to provide further guidance on the three-tiered TP documentation requirements, while DIPN 46 on TP guidelines, which was issued back in 2009, serves as a reference in situations where the new TP Rules 1 and 2 are not applicable.
### Country-by-country (CbC) reporting regime
Key features of the CbC reporting regime in Hong Kong SAR are summarised as follows:
  * The Hong Kong ultimate parent entity of a multinational enterprise group with annual consolidated group revenues of HKD 6.8 billion (i.e. about 750 million euros [EUR]) or above (i.e. a reportable group) will be required to file a CbC report in Hong Kong SAR.
  * A Hong Kong entity of a reportable group that is not the group’s ultimate parent entity will also be required to file a CbC report in Hong Kong SAR if the ultimate parent entity is not required to file a CbC report in its own jurisdiction of tax residence or if Hong Kong SAR is not able to obtain the CbC report from that jurisdiction.
  * The CbC report filing requirement will apply retrospectively to accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
  * Generally speaking, the deadline for filing a CbC report is within 12 months after the end of the accounting period to which the report relates. Where surrogate parent filing applies and a later deadline for filing CbC reports is prescribed in the laws or regulations of the jurisdiction of tax residence of the surrogate parent entity, the later deadline will be taken as the filing deadline in relation to the CbC report concerned.


### The advance pricing arrangement (APA) regime
A statutory APA programme has been introduced since the year of assessment 2018/19. The objectives of the APA programme are to help taxpayers obtain tax certainty on their complex or significant TP arrangements and reduce the risk of double taxation arising from related-party transactions. Any Hong Kong resident enterprise or a non-resident enterprise with a PE in Hong Kong SAR, chargeable to Hong Kong profits tax and having related-party transactions, may apply for an APA, provided that certain conditions (including the threshold for an APA application) are met. Under the statutory APA regime, enterprises can apply for a unilateral, bilateral, or multilateral APA.
Prior to the year of assessment 2018/19, the HKIRD accepted an APA application as part of the advance ruling application. DIPN 48 issued by the HKIRD provides guidance on APAs, such as the timeframe and threshold for an APA application, the various stages involved in the APA process, the interaction between an APA and audit, and possible rollback of the TP methodology agreed under an APA to prior years. The appendices to the DIPN include various sample documents for use in an APA application. DIPN 48 was revised in 2020 to reflect certain updates as a result of the introduction of the statutory APA regime in Hong Kong SAR.
## Thin capitalisation
Hong Kong SAR does not have thin capitalisation rules. _For restrictions on deduction of interest expenses, see Interest expenses in the section_.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Hong Kong SAR does not have a CFC regime.


# Hong Kong SAR
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
The two-tiered tax rates regime that is applicable to corporations is also applicable to branches of foreign corporations in Hong Kong SAR.
Effective from the year of assessment 2019/20, the Authorised OECD Approach (i.e. the separate enterprises principle) (TP Rule 2) needs to be adopted for attributing income or loss to a PE of a non-Hong Kong resident person (e.g. a branch) in Hong Kong SAR. TP Rule 2 requires the attribution of profits of a non-Hong Kong resident person to its PE in Hong Kong SAR as if the PE were a distinct and separate enterprise, taking into account the functions performed, assets used, and risks assumed by the non-Hong Kong resident person through the PE. After the attribution of profits to the PE, the broad guiding principle (i.e. what has been done to earn the profits in question and where the operations have been performed) would be applied to determine whether the profits are arising in or derived from Hong Kong SAR, hence subject to Hong Kong profits tax.


# Hong Kong SAR
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
## Foreign tax credits
Foreign tax credits are available if foreign taxes are payable/paid by a Hong Kong tax resident on income derived from a jurisdiction that has entered into a CDTA with Hong Kong SAR and the same income is subject to tax in Hong Kong SAR. Taxpayers are required to take all reasonable steps to minimise the foreign tax payable before making a claim for tax credit in Hong Kong SAR. _See the section for a list of jurisdictions that have entered into a CDTA with Hong Kong SAR_.
For foreign taxes payable/paid by a Hong Kong tax resident on specified foreign-sourced income deemed taxable under the refined FSIE regime, foreign tax credits are available irrespective of whether or not the foreign taxes are paid in a jurisdiction that has entered into a CDTA with Hong Kong SAR. Taxpayers are also required to take all reasonable steps to minimise the foreign tax payable before making a claim for tax credit in Hong Kong SAR.
## Foreign investment incentives
Hong Kong SAR does not have any specific incentives for foreign investment, except that offshore funds may be exempt from profits tax under certain circumstances.
## Other tax incentives
_Please refer to the section for other tax incentives that can be enjoyed by both foreign and Hong Kong companies_.


# Hong Kong SAR
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
There is no withholding tax (WHT) on dividends and interest. Royalties received by non-residents (_see Royalties in the section_) are subject to a WHT (_see the applicable WHT rates for corporations below_).
Resident consignees are required to furnish quarterly returns to the HKIRD showing the gross proceeds from sales on behalf of their non-resident consignors and to pay to the CIR a sum equal to 0.5% of such proceeds. The HKIRD normally accepts this as satisfying the Hong Kong tax obligations of the non-resident.
Hong Kong SAR has so far entered into 51 treaties with different jurisdictions. The following table shows the applicable WHT rates for payments made from Hong Kong payers to non-treaty and treaty jurisdiction corporate recipients. The rates shown in the table are the lower of the domestic and treaty rates. For WHT rates on payments received by Hong Kong recipients from treaty jurisdiction payers, please refer to the summaries of the respective treaty jurisdictions. All of the following treaties have been ratified and are effective unless indicated otherwise in the notes below.

Notes
  1. Hong Kong SAR does not impose WHT on dividends and interest currently. However, the treaties provide for a maximum WHT rate on dividends and interest should Hong Kong SAR impose such WHT in the future. Some of the treaties also provide for a reduced WHT rate on dividends and interest if conditions specified in the treaties are met.
  2. With the introduction of two-tiered profits tax rates, there are two possible sets of domestic WHT rates on royalties paid to non-resident corporations:
    1. If the two-tiered tax rates apply, the WHT rates are 2.475% for the first HKD 6.67 million of gross royalty income (i.e. the deemed profit rate of 30% times the tax rate of 8.25% for the first HKD 2 million of assessable profits) and 4.95% for the remaining amount of gross royalty income (i.e. the deemed profit rate of 30% times the tax rate of 16.5% for the remaining amount of assessable profits).
    2. If the two-tiered tax rates do not apply, the WHT rate for the whole amount of gross royalty income is 4.95%.The 2.475% and 4.95% rates are determined by applying the relevant two-tiered tax rates, which are 8.25% and 16.5%, respectively, on the deemed assessable profits of the royalties. In the normal situation, the deemed assessable profits are 30% of the royalties received by or accrued to a non-resident corporation. Hence, the effective WHT rate on the royalties ranges from 2.475% (when the deemed assessable profits are HKD 2 million or less and the two-tiered tax rates are applicable) to 4.95% (in relation to the deemed assessable profits in excess of HKD 2 million when the two-tiered tax rates are applicable or when the two-tiered tax rates are not applicable).In the situation where a person carrying on a trade or business in Hong Kong SAR has, at any time, wholly or partly owned the IP in respect of which the royalties are paid and the non-resident corporation is an associate of the Hong Kong payer, the deemed assessable profits are 100% of the royalties received by or accrued to a non-resident corporation. Hence, the applicable WHT rates are 8.25% for the first HKD 2 million of assessable profits and 16.5% for the remaining amount if the two-tiered tax rates are applicable.
  3. The domestic WHT rate on the gross royalty income ranges from 2.475% (when the assessable profits are HKD 2 million or less and the two-tiered tax rates are applicable) to 4.95% (in relation to the assessable profits in excess of HKD 2 million when the two-tiered tax rates are applicable or when the two-tiered tax rates are not applicable), capped at 3% according to the treaty.
  4. For payments for the use of, or the right to use, aircraft, the effective WHT rate ranges from 2.475% on the gross payments (when the assessable profits are HKD 2 million or less and the two-tiered tax rates are applicable) to 3% (in relation to the assessable profits in excess of HKD 2 million when the two-tiered tax rates are applicable or when the two-tiered tax rates are not applicable). For other cases, the effective WHT rate on the gross royalty income ranges from 2.475% (when the assessable profits are HKD 2 million or less and the two-tiered tax rates are applicable) to 4.95% (in relation to the assessable profits in excess of HKD 2 million when the two-tiered tax rates are applicable or when the two-tiered tax rates are not applicable).
  5. Since a rate specified in the treaty is higher than the domestic WHT rates, the effective WHT rate on the gross royalty income ranges from 2.475% (when the assessable profits are HKD 2 million or less and the two-tiered tax rates are applicable) to 4.95% (in relation to the assessable profits in excess of HKD 2 million when the two-tiered tax rates are applicable or when the two-tiered tax rates are not applicable).
  6. The domestic WHT rate on the gross royalty income ranges from 2.475% (when the assessable profits are HKD 2 million or less and the two-tiered tax rates are applicable) to 4.95% (in relation to the assessable profits in excess of HKD 2 million when the two-tiered tax rates are applicable or when the two-tiered tax rates are not applicable), capped at 4% according to the treaty.
  7. The 0% rate applies to payments for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment or for information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific experience. For other cases, the WHT rate on the gross royalty income ranges from 2.475% (when the assessable profits are HKD 2 million or less and the two-tiered tax rates are applicable) to 4.95% (in relation to the assessable profits in excess of HKD 2 million when the two-tiered tax rates are applicable or when the two-tiered tax rates are not applicable), capped at 3% according to the treaty.
  8. The treaty is pending ratification.
  9. The treaty is effective from the year of assessment 2025/26 in Hong Kong SAR.
  10. The treaty is effective from the year of assessment 2024/25 in Hong Kong SAR.




# Hong Kong SAR
## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
## Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)
Hong Kong SAR has enacted domestic tax legislation to implement the following minimum standards under the BEPS Action Plan: (i) introducing a TP regulatory regime and a mandatory three-tiered TP documentation requirement in Hong Kong SAR, (ii) implementing a statutory APA regime in Hong Kong SAR, and (iii) removing the ring-fencing features in certain concessionary tax regimes in Hong Kong SAR.
## Multilateral Instrument (MLI)
Hong Kong SAR, as represented by Chinese mainland, was one of the signatories to the MLI. In implementing the MLI, Hong Kong SAR has taken a pragmatic approach by (i) opting in the provisions of the MLI that represent the BEPS minimum standards (e.g. the principal purpose test for preventing treaty abuse and the requirement for allowing a minimum three-year period for a person to present its case for Mutual Agreement Procedure) and (ii) opting out most of the other provisions that are not mandatory, for instance, those provisions addressing hybrid mismatches and artificial avoidance of PE. The provisions of the MLI will have effect in Hong Kong SAR with respect to a covered tax treaty on 1 April 2023 (for taxes withheld at source) or 1 April 2024 (for other taxes) at the earliest, the exact dates of which are subject to the completion of the legislative and other relevant procedures of the MLI by Hong Kong SAR's tax treaty partners.
## Automatic exchange of financial account information (AEOI) / Common Reporting Standard (CRS) regime
Under the AEOI/CRS regime in Hong Kong SAR, reportable financial institutions are required to identify the reportable financial accounts held by (i) tax residents of reportable jurisdictions or (ii) passive non-financial entities whose controlling persons are tax residents of reportable jurisdictions in accordance with the specified due diligence procedures, collect the required information of those reportable accounts, and furnish such information to the HKIRD. Such information will be exchanged on an annual basis. Hong Kong SAR will only conduct AEOI with a reportable jurisdiction when an arrangement is in place with the reportable jurisdiction concerned to provide the basis for exchange.
There are 126 reportable jurisdictions effective from 1 January 2020. As of December 2024, Hong Kong SAR has activated exchange relationships for CRS purposes with over 80 jurisdictions based on either a bilateral or multilateral competent authority agreement for CRS.
## Tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs)
Currently, Hong Kong SAR has entered into seven TIEAs with different jurisdictions as shown in the following table:
Denmark | Norway  
---|---  
Faroes | Sweden  
Greenland | United States  
Iceland  
All of the above TIEAs are ratified and effective.
In addition to the signing of the Hong Kong SAR-United States TIEA, Hong Kong SAR signed a Model 2 intergovernmental agreement (IGA) with the United States in November 2014 to facilitate compliance with the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) by financial institutions in Hong Kong SAR.
## Foreign investment restrictions
In general, Hong Kong SAR does not impose restriction to foreign investors to make investments in Hong Kong SAR, and wholly foreign owned companies are allowed. The only exception is the restriction on foreign ownership of Hong Kong SAR’s licensed television/sound broadcasters, of which the collective foreign ownership ceiling is 49% of the voting power. In addition, an approval from the Communications Authority must be obtained for holding, acquisition, or exercise of voting control by a foreign investor of more than 5% of a licensee.
## Exchange controls
Hong Kong SAR does not have any foreign exchange control. There is no restriction on entry or repatriation of capital or remittance of profits from investments. Funds can be freely remitted to persons outside Hong Kong SAR by various means (e.g. dividends, interest, royalties, service fees, branch profits).
## Choice of business entity
The principal forms through which a business can be conducted in Hong Kong SAR are as follows:
  * Company incorporated in Hong Kong SAR (either private or public via listing on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong SAR).
  * Branch of a foreign company.
  * Representative or liaison office of a foreign company.
  * Joint venture (can be set up either as a company or partnership).
  * Partnership.
  * Sole proprietorship.


Of the above, privately incorporated companies and branches of foreign companies are most commonly used by foreign investors, as limited liability is usually desirable.
## Intellectual property (IP) regulations
The Intellectual Property Department is responsible for monitoring the IP regime and ensuring the protection and enforcement of IP rights in Hong Kong SAR. The Department is also responsible for investigating complaints against infringements and has extensive powers of search and seizure. Registration (where applicable) and protection of patents, copyrights, trademarks, designs, plant varieties, and the layout design of integrated circuits are each governed by a separate ordinance.
## Merger and acquisition (M&A) activities
There are no specific restrictions on M&A activities in Hong Kong SAR. The following tax considerations are relevant in the M&A context:
  * Dividends or other forms of distribution of profits (e.g. distribution of branch profits to the head office) are generally not taxable. However, offshore dividends may be deemed to be sourced from and taxable in Hong Kong SAR under the refined FSIE regime.
  * Capital gains arising from an M&A transaction are not taxable in the hands of the transferor (unless deemed taxable under the refined FSIE regime), whereas amortisation of goodwill in the transferee’s accounts is not tax deductible due to its capital nature.
  * Gains derived from the transfer of revenue items in an asset deal will be subject to profits tax.
  * For a share deal, stamp duty is payable on the transfer of Hong Kong shares at 0.2%, unless an exemption applies; for an asset deal, stamp duty is payable on conveyance of immovable property in Hong Kong SAR at various rates up to 4.25% (_see Stamp duty in the section_).
  * There is no special tax concession/incentive relating to M&A transactions.
  * Tax losses in the acquired company can generally be carried forward indefinitely to set off against future assessable profits. However, there are specific anti-avoidance provisions in the IRO that prevent the transfer of shares of a company with accumulated tax losses to owners of a profitable company for the sole or dominant purpose of utilising the tax losses (i.e. offsetting the tax losses against the profits generated from other trade, profession, or business of the transferee).
  * For court-free amalgamations that took effect before 11 June 2021, the HKIRD handled such cases based on the interim guidance published on its website. In addition to the utilisation of tax losses, the guidance also covers issues such as the profits tax treatment of fixed assets and trading stock transferred, and the profits tax return filing positions of the amalgamating and the amalgamated companies in the year of amalgamation, etc.
  * For a qualifying amalgamation that takes effect on or after 11 June 2021, the amalgamated company may make an irrevocable written election within one month after the date of the amalgamation to apply the special tax treatments (unless a further period for election is allowed). Except for the utilisation of tax losses and the treatments for trading stock succeeded from an amalgamating company, the special tax treatments generally follow the interim guidance published on the HKIRD’s website.




# Hong Kong SAR
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
## Inventory valuation
Inventory may be stated at the lower of cost or market value. Last in first out (LIFO) may not be used for tax purposes. First in first out (FIFO) must be consistently applied.
The prevailing accounting standards provide three ways to account for financial instruments, namely at amortised cost, at fair value through other comprehensive income, and at fair value through profit or loss, which for profits tax purposes is regarded as the ‘fair value basis’. Following the court decision in the _Nice Cheer_ case, the increases (unrealised gains) in the market values of trading securities are not taxable while the decreases (unrealised losses) may be deductible if they represent a provision for diminution in value that is material and likely to be permanent. For years of assessment for which the basis period begins on or after 1 January 2018, taxpayers may make a generally irrevocable election to adopt the above-mentioned fair value basis to account for their financial instruments for tax purposes, subject to certain conditions and with certain exceptions. Whether the amounts recognised in the profit and loss account or other comprehensive income are taxable or deductible will continue to be subject to the source rules and the nature (i.e. capital vs revenue) of the amounts.
There are special tax provisions for valuation upon cessation of a business under which inventory is valued at market value, unless it is sold to a person carrying on business in Hong Kong SAR, who may deduct a corresponding amount as the cost of the inventory in computing the assessable profits.
There are also special tax provisions for valuation when (i) there is a change of intention for holding something as trading stock to capital asset or vice versa, or (ii) trading stock of a trade has been acquired or disposed of otherwise than in the course of the trade. In such circumstances, valuation based on the market value will apply.
## Capital gains
Gains from realisation of capital assets or receipts that are capital in nature are generally not taxed. However, offshore disposal gains derived from the sale of assets may be deemed to be sourced from Hong Kong SAR and regarded as not arising from the sale of capital assets even if they so arise and are taxable in Hong Kong SAR under the refined FSIE regime (_see Foreign income below_).
As a means to provide upfront certainty to taxpayers, the IRO was amended to implement the Enhancement Scheme under which onshore equity disposal gains that satisfy all the prescribed conditions, including, inter alia, that the investor entity has held at least 15% of the equity interests in the investee entity throughout a continuous period of 24 months immediately prior to the date of disposal of such interests, will be regarded as capital in nature and not chargeable to profits tax. Nonetheless, the Enhancement Scheme does not apply to (i) gains derived by an insurance company and (ii) gains on equity interests that are regarded as trading stock or non-listed equity interests in certain property-related entities.
The Enhancement Scheme applies to eligible onshore disposal gains that are in relation to any disposal occurring on or after 1 January 2024 and that accrues in or after the year of assessment 2023/24.
## Dividend income
Dividends from local companies chargeable to tax are exempt, whereas dividends from overseas companies are generally offshore in nature and not subject to Hong Kong profits tax. However, offshore dividend income may be deemed to be sourced from and taxable in Hong Kong SAR under the refined FSIE regime (_see Foreign income below_).
## Interest income
Hong Kong sourced interest income received by or accrued to a corporation carrying on a trade or business in Hong Kong SAR is subject to profits tax. Exemption is provided to interest income derived from any deposit placed in Hong Kong SAR with a financial institution, unless the deposit secures a borrowing where the interest expense is deductible. This exemption, however, does not apply to interest accruing to a financial institution. Offshore interest income may be deemed to be sourced from and taxable in Hong Kong SAR under the refined FSIE regime (_see Foreign income below_).
Interest accruing to a bank or financial institution will be deemed to be sourced and taxable in Hong Kong SAR if the interest arises through or from the carrying on of business in Hong Kong SAR by the bank or financial institution.
Interest income arising through or from the carrying on of an intra-group financing business in Hong Kong SAR by a corporation (other than a financial institution) will be deemed to be sourced from and taxable in Hong Kong SAR.
## Royalties
Offshore royalty income may be deemed to be sourced from and taxable in Hong Kong SAR under the refined FSIE regime (_see Foreign income below_).
Royalties received by or accrued to a non-resident for the use of or right to use in Hong Kong SAR or outside Hong Kong SAR (if the royalties are deductible in ascertaining the assessable profits of a person for Hong Kong profits tax purposes) a trademark, patent, design, copyright material, layout-design of an integrated circuit, performer’s right, plant variety right, secret process or formula, or other property of a similar nature, or for the exhibition or use in Hong Kong SAR of cinematograph or television film or tape, any sound recording, or any advertising material connected with such film, tape, or recording, are deemed to be taxable in Hong Kong SAR. A total of 30% of the sum received or accrued is deemed to constitute profits subject to tax in normal situations. Where such royalties are received by or accrued to an associate, however, 100% of the sum is deemed to constitute profits under certain circumstances.
In addition, royalties for the use of or right to use outside Hong Kong SAR any IP or know-how generated from any research and development (R&D) activity in respect of which a tax deduction for R&D expenditure is allowable in ascertaining the assessable profits of the recipient of the royalties are deemed to be taxable in Hong Kong SAR.
## Partnership income
Partnership business is taxed as a single entity, although each partner can use its share of losses incurred by a partnership to offset against the assessable profits of its other business. In general, there is no special registration requirement other than business registration for a partnership. The assessable profits of a partnership are basically determined in the same way as those of a corporation, with certain special rules (e.g. salaries or other remunerations paid to a partner or a partner’s spouse are not deductible).
## Unrealised exchange gains/losses
Unrealised exchange gains/losses arising from financial instruments that are revenue in nature and with a Hong Kong source are taxable/deductible if they are recognised in the profit and loss account in accordance with a specified financial reporting standard (which means the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standard [HKFRS] 9, the International Financial Reporting Standard 9 [Financial Instruments], or equivalent) and an election has been made by the taxpayer to adopt a fair value basis for profits tax filing purposes.
For other cases, taxpayers may exclude any unrealised foreign exchange gains/losses in the tax computation and bring them back for assessment/deduction when they become realised in subsequent years, provided that such realisation basis is adopted consistently for profits tax filing purposes.
The nature and source of exchange gains/losses are determined by the nature and source of the underlying transactions. Exchange gains/losses arising from ordinary business transactions (e.g. trade receivables or payables) are taxable/deductible whereas exchange gains/losses arising from capital transactions (e.g. sale of capital assets) are non-taxable/non-deductible.
## Foreign income
Hong Kong resident corporations are not taxed on their worldwide income. Foreign-sourced income is generally not taxed. However, under the refined FSIE regime, effective from 1 January 2023, four types of offshore income, namely (i) interest, (ii) dividends, (iii) equity interest disposal gains, and (iv) IP income (collectively, ‘specified foreign-sourced income’), are deemed to be sourced from Hong Kong SAR and chargeable to profits tax if the income is received in Hong Kong SAR by an MNE entity carrying on a trade, profession, or business in Hong Kong SAR (irrespective of its revenue or asset size) and the recipient entity fails to meet a relevant exception from the deeming provision. With effect from 1 January 2024, the scope of ‘specified foreign-sourced income’ is expanded to include disposal gains on other types of assets (in addition to equity interests). The exceptions from the deeming provisions are:
  * For interest and non-IP disposal gains: Economic substance requirement.
  * For dividends and equity interest disposal gains: Economic substance requirement or participation requirement.
  * For IP income and IP disposal gains: Nexus requirement.
  * For disposal gains (both IP disposal gains and non-IP disposal gains): Effective from 1 January 2024, an intra-group transfer relief is available to defer any tax that may be chargeable on any type of disposal gain if the asset concerned is transferred between associated entities.


There is no controlled foreign company (CFC) legislation.


# Hong Kong SAR
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Hong Kong SAR adopts a territorial basis of taxation. Profits tax is payable by every person (defined to include corporation, partnership, and sole proprietorship) carrying on a trade, profession, or business in Hong Kong SAR on profits arising in or derived from Hong Kong SAR from that trade, profession, or business. In general, the tax residence of a person is irrelevant, and there is no distinction between residents and non-residents when it comes to liability to profits tax, except in a tax treaty context. Non-residents carrying on a trade, profession, or business in Hong Kong SAR are chargeable to tax on profits arising in or derived from Hong Kong SAR unless they are from jurisdictions with which Hong Kong SAR has a tax treaty and are protected by the treaty.
Gains and receipts that are capital in nature are generally not subject to tax. Dividends from local companies chargeable to tax are exempt, whereas dividends from overseas companies are generally offshore in nature and not subject to tax in Hong Kong SAR. However, offshore disposal gains derived from the sale of assets and offshore dividends may be deemed taxable under the refined foreign-sourced income exemption (FSIE) regime, _as elaborated below_. The tax treatments of public and private companies are the same.
Certain income that would not otherwise be subject to Hong Kong profits tax is deemed to arise in or be derived from Hong Kong SAR from a trade, profession, or business carried on in Hong Kong SAR and thus becomes taxable in Hong Kong SAR. This includes royalties received by a non-resident for the use of or right to use a patent, design, trademark, copyright material, layout-design of an integrated circuit, performer’s right, plant variety right, secret process or formula, or other property of a similar nature in Hong Kong SAR, or for the use of or right to use such intellectual property (IP) outside Hong Kong SAR, but the royalties paid can be claimed as a deduction by a person for Hong Kong profits tax purposes.
Effective from 1 January 2023, under the refined FSIE regime, four types of offshore income, namely (i) interest, (ii) dividends, (iii) disposal gains from the sale of equity interests (equity interest disposal gains), and (iv) IP income (collectively, ‘specified foreign-sourced income’), are deemed to be sourced from Hong Kong SAR and chargeable to profits tax if the income is received in Hong Kong SAR by a multinational enterprise (MNE) entity carrying on a trade, profession, or business in Hong Kong SAR (irrespective of its revenue or asset size) and the recipient entity fails to meet a relevant exception from the deeming provision. With effect from 1 January 2024, the scope of ‘specified foreign-sourced income’ is expanded to include disposal gains on other types of assets (in addition to equity interests). The exceptions from the deeming provision are:
  * For interest and non-IP disposal gains: Economic substance requirement.
  * For dividends and equity interest disposal gains: Economic substance requirement or participation requirement.
  * For IP income and IP disposal gains: Nexus requirement.
  * For disposal gains (both IP disposal gains and non-IP disposal gains): Effective from 1 January 2024, an intra-group transfer relief is available to defer any tax that may be chargeable on any type of disposal gain if the asset concerned is transferred between associated entities.


Effective from the year of assessment 2018/19, there is a two-tiered profits tax rates regime in Hong Kong SAR. The following table shows the applicable tax rates for corporations and unincorporated businesses:
Rates of tax | **Where the two-tiered rates apply** * (%) | **Where the two-tiered rates do not apply** (%)  
---|---|---  
Corporations:  
First HKD 2 million | 8.25 | 16.50  
On the remainder | 16.50  
Unincorporated businesses:  
First HKD 2 million | 7.50 | 15.00  
On the remainder | 15.00  
* As an anti-avoidance measure, a ‘group of connected entities’ can only nominate one entity within the group to enjoy the two-tiered tax rates for a given year of assessment.
There are special rules for determining the tax liabilities of certain industries, such as shipping, air services, and financial services. There is also a special tax framework for Islamic bonds (i.e. _sukuk_) that provides for the same tax treatments for _sukuk_ vis-à-vis their conventional counterparts.
Incomes from certain qualifying debt instruments (QDIs) issued before 1 April 2018 are either tax exempt or subject to a concessionary tax rate (i.e. 50% of the regular profits tax rate) depending on the date of issue and maturity period of the QDIs. Incomes from QDIs issued on or after 1 April 2018 are tax exempt regardless of the maturity period, subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions. However, there is a specific anti-avoidance provision under which the concessionary tax rate / tax exemption does not apply to incomes derived from QDIs by a person who is an associate of the issuer of the QDIs.
Publicly offered funds that are regulated by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong SAR and other similar _bona fide_ widely held investment schemes that comply with the requirements of a supervisory authority within an acceptable regulatory regime are exempt from Hong Kong profits tax. Effective from 1 April 2019, both onshore and offshore privately offered funds are exempt from Hong Kong profits tax on profits derived from certain specified transactions provided that the specified transactions are carried out or arranged by ‘specified persons’ (i.e. SFC licensed fund managers) or the funds are a ‘qualified investment fund’ as defined. There are also specific anti-avoidance provisions in the Inland Revenue Ordinance (IRO) deeming certain resident persons to be subject to profits tax on their share of the non-resident person’s tax-exempt profits.
Profits derived from the business of reinsurance of onshore and offshore risks and qualifying onshore and offshore captive insurance business are subject to profits tax at a concessionary tax rate of 8.25% (i.e. 50% of the regular profits tax rate). Profits derived from (i) general reinsurance business of direct insurers, (ii) certain types of general insurance business of direct insurers, and (iii) certain types of insurance brokerage business of licensed insurance brokers are also subject to profits tax at a concessionary tax rate of 8.25% (i.e. 50% of regular profits tax rate) effective from 19 March 2021.
Qualifying profits derived by a qualifying corporate treasury centre are subject to profits tax at a concessionary tax rate of 8.25% (i.e. 50% of the regular profits tax rate) under specified conditions.
Qualifying profits derived from qualifying aircraft leasing activities and qualifying aircraft leasing management activities carried out in Hong Kong SAR are subject to profits tax at a concessionary tax rate of 8.25% (i.e. 50% of the regular profits tax rate) under specified conditions.
Effective from 1 April 2019, qualifying profits derived from qualifying ship leasing activities carried out in Hong Kong SAR are subject to profits tax at concessionary tax rate of 0% whereas qualifying profits derived from qualifying ship leasing management activities carried out in Hong Kong SAR are subject to profits tax at concessionary tax rate of 0% (for activities carried out for associated corporations) or 8.25% (for activities carried out for non-associated corporations), subject to specified conditions.
Effective from 1 April 2022, qualifying profits derived from qualifying shipping-related activities, namely ship agency, ship management, or ship broking activities, carried out in Hong Kong SAR are eligible for tax exemption or a concessionary profits tax rate of 0% or 8.25%, subject to specified conditions.
Carried interest received by or accrued to a qualifying recipient on or after 1 April 2020 from the provision of investment management services in Hong Kong SAR for a certified investment fund may be eligible for a concessionary profits tax rate of 0%, subject to specified conditions.
Effective from the year of assessment 2023/24, qualifying income from certain IP is eligible for a concessionary tax rate of 5% under the patent box regime. The ‘nexus approach’ endorsed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action 5 Report will apply to determine the extent of eligible IP income that can qualify for the preferential tax treatment.
For an eligible family-owned investment holding vehicle (FIHV) managed by an eligible single-family office (ESF Office) in Hong Kong SAR, its assessable profits earned from qualifying transactions and incidental transactions (the latter being subject to a 5% threshold) on or after 1 April 2022 are subject to profits tax at a concessionary tax rate of 0% under specified conditions.
The concessionary tax treatments under the following special tax regimes will be available only if the taxpayer has substantial activities in Hong Kong SAR in terms of the number of qualified employees and amount of operating expenditure, which must be adequate in the opinion of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (CIR) and, in any event, not lower than the minimum thresholds as set out further below:
  * Corporate treasury centres.
  * Reinsurance business.
  * Captive insurance business.
  * Certain types of general insurance business.
  * Certain types of insurance brokerage business.
  * Aircraft lessors and aircraft leasing managers.
  * Ship lessors and ship leasing managers.
  * Shipping operations.
  * Certain shipping-related activities.
  * Carried interest for provisions of qualified investment management services.
  * FIHVs.


For the concessionary tax regimes on ship leasing and certain shipping-related activities, the minimum threshold requirements during the basis period for a year of assessment are as follows:
Average number of full-time qualified employees in Hong Kong SAR | Total amount of operating expenditure incurred in Hong Kong SAR  
---|---  
Qualifying ship leasing activity | Not less than 2 | Not less than HKD 7,800,000  
Qualifying ship leasing management activity | Not less than 1 | Not less than HKD 1,000,000  
Qualifying shipping-related activity | Not less than 1 | Not less than HKD 1,000,000  
For the concessionary tax regimes on aircraft leasing, the minimum threshold requirements during the basis period for a year of assessment are as follows:
Average number of full-time qualified employees in Hong Kong SAR | Total amount of operating expenditure incurred in Hong Kong SAR  
---|---  
Qualifying aircraft leasing activity | Not less than 1 | Not less than HKD 2,000,000  
Qualifying aircraft leasing management activity | Not less than 2 | Not less than HKD 1,000,000  
For the insurance business concessionary tax regimes, the minimum threshold requirements during the basis period for a year of assessment are as follows:
