# Uruguay
## Overview
Last reviewed - 02 September 2024
The Republic of Uruguay is located in South America, between Brazil and Argentina, with a coast on the Atlantic Ocean. It is divided into 19 departments, with Montevideo as the capital and chief port. Spanish is the official language of Uruguay, and the currency is the Uruguayan peso (UYU).
Uruguay has existed as an independent republic since 18 July 1830, when its first Constitution was approved. Since then, it has taken advantage of its natural harbour to become an important commercial centre.
Uruguay has experienced continued gross domestic product (GDP) growth during the last 20 years, which enabled reaching investment grade in 2012 and achieving the largest GDP _per capita_ in the region. However, from 2016 to 2019, the economy entered into a period of languished growth that was further exacerbated by the pandemic, resulting in a 6.1% GDP reduction in 2020. During 2020 and 2021, Uruguay was praised by the international community for its handling of the pandemic, with a rapid assessment and display of vaccines for all the population.
Private companies from different countries have decided to invest and seize the opportunity to establish shared service centre operations, services in the software industry, agribusiness, etc. The government, fully aware of the fundamental role of investment in the economy to support the continued growth that can nourish a still unsatisfied breadth of social needs, is permanently seeking to improve conditions for investors and willing to support projects that boost employment, research and development (R&D), and innovation, and specially reinvigorates infrastructure for the medium and long term.
PwC Uruguay currently has offices located in Montevideo city (downtown), Zonamerica Free Zone, as well as in Punta del Este, with over 400 professionals trained in audit, accounting, tax, economics, information technology, human resources, and operational management. This places PwC as one of the most developed professional services organisations in Uruguay.
