## Luxembourg investment tax credits regime to accelerate sustainability transformation 
The law of 22 December 2023 revamped the investment tax credits available under article 152bis of the Luxembourg Income Tax Law, to support Luxembourg companies in their digital and ecological/energetic transformation. The most significant change to the rules, in addition to the increase of applicable rates, consists of an inclusion of certain operating expenses connected with the digital/ecological transformation on which an 18% tax credit may apply. This change is expected to provide a strong incentive for companies to accelerate their digital and ecological/energetic transition.
## Guidance in the implementation of Pillar Two minimum taxation rules in Luxembourg
Pillar Two legislation was enacted in Luxembourg on 22 December 2023.
The Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) and the Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (QDMTT) are effective for fiscal years starting on or after 31 December 2023, whereas the Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR) would become effective for fiscal years starting on or after 31 December 2024.
The text of the law strictly adheres to the text of the European Union (EU) Pillar Two Directive, with some additions introduced to reflect parts of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Administrative Guidance released in February 2023 and July 2023.
Further amendments may be expected in the future to reflect parts of the OECD Administrative Guidance that has so far not been included in the law and the additional OECD Administrative Guidance that was released on 19 December 2023.
On 19 December 2024, the Pillar Two Law was amended with the aim to reflect additional parts of the OECD Administrative Guidance of February 2023 and July 2023, as well as the OECD Administrative Guidance released on 19 December 2023.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
## Taxable period
The taxable period for Luxembourg fully taxable resident entities follows the financial year (i.e. accounting year) of the company.
Companies generally use the calendar year for accounting purposes but may apply a different accounting year. The taxable period would, in such cases, correspond to this different accounting year. The tax year is the year in which the accounting year ends.
## Tax returns
As per the Budget Law 2023, CIT and municipal business tax returns of a given year should, as of tax year 2022, be filed by 31 December of the following year. For NWT, the return of a given year should be filed at the latest on 31 December of that year since the return is based on the balance sheet as at 1 January of the tax year. Tax returns for companies liable to CIT have to be mandatorily filed electronically.
Tax assessments are issued after the end of the tax year and normally can be finalised within five years, although the delay may extend to ten years if the declaration is found to be incomplete or inexact, with or without the intention of fraud. Once issued, the tax assessment notice is, in principle, final (unless new facts come to light).
Tax assessments are issued by the tax authorities immediately upon receipt of the tax return, based on the taxable profit reported by the company. The tax authorities may then reassess or request more information on the return within the period of five years that follows the receipt of the tax return.
Luxembourg companies are free to choose the currency in which they wish to prepare their commercial accounts to the extent that it is freely tradable currency. Luxembourg companies that expect to conduct most of their business in a currency other than euros will therefore generally opt to use that 'foreign' functional currency to draw up their financial statements. In particular, this will save such companies from having to recognise, for accounting purposes, foreign exchange gains and losses that do not reflect the economic reality of their business.
Nevertheless, as a general rule, Luxembourg taxpayers in such a situation have until now been required to file their tax returns in euros, basing these returns on euro-denominated tax balance sheets. Luxembourg taxpayers are allowed, upon request, to determine their taxable basis solely in a 'foreign' functional currency, and then only having to convert the final basis figure into euros. This has averted the need to establish a euro-denominated tax balance sheet simply for tax filing purposes.
Circular L.G.-A n°60, issued by the Luxembourg tax authorities on 21 June 2016, formalises this well-established practice and provides a clear framework.
## Payment of tax
Quarterly tax advances must be paid. These payments are fixed by the tax administration on the basis of the tax assessed for the preceding year or on the basis of the estimate for the first year. This estimate is given by the company pursuant to the request of the Luxembourg tax authorities.
Final payment of CIT must be paid by the end of the month that follows the month of reception by the company of its tax assessment.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Further to the introduction of a comprehensive legal framework in this respect, Luxembourg tax authorities focus increasingly on transfer pricing matters, and the methods used to determine the arm’s-length remuneration of Luxembourg-based companies are being closely assessed by the Luxembourg tax authorities.
## General anti-abuse rule (GAAR)
The Law implementing ATAD 1 into Luxembourg domestic tax law and applicable as of tax years starting on or after 1 January 2019 contains a provision affecting GAAR. Indeed, under the Law, Luxembourg is to adapt and modernise its existing GAAR. 'Abuse of law' criteria and general practice have been developed progressively over recent years by authors and judges.
Under the text of the Law, there is an abuse of law if the legal route, having been used for the main purpose or one of the main purposes of circumventing or reducing tax contrary to the object or purpose of law, is not genuine having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances.
The legal route, which may comprise more than one step or part, shall be regarded as non-genuine to the extent that it was not used for valid commercial reasons that reflect economic reality.
The text, while adapted to reflect the content of article 6 of ATAD 1, is designed to preserve legal certainty derived from existing case law on the subject.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
Based on domestic law, a company is considered to be resident in Luxembourg if either its registered office or place of central administration is located in Luxembourg. The registered office is designated as such in the company’s articles of incorporation.
The place of central administration is generally understood to mean the place where the company is managed and controlled. While this term is not legally defined, the location of the company’s major establishment is determined by facts and circumstances, including the following:
  * The place where meetings of the board of directors are held.
  * The place where shareholders meetings are held.
  * The place where the company’s officers make their decisions.
  * The place where the company’s books and records are kept.
  * The place where other, similar factors evidencing management and control occur.


## Permanent establishment (PE)
The provisions on PEs included in the tax treaties concluded by Luxembourg generally follow the wording of the OECD model.
Under Luxembourg domestic tax law, a similar PE concept exists but is defined in a broader way and is to be understood as every fixed piece of equipment or place that serves for the operation of an established business.
The existing provision defining the notion of PE in Luxembourg domestic law (Section 16 of the Luxembourg adaptation law) was amended by the law transposing the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 1 (ATAD 1) into Luxembourg domestic law and is applicable as of tax years starting on or from 1 January 2019 _._
This amendment is designed to resolve conflicts of interpretation on the existence of a PE resulting from the interaction between the provisions of domestic law and the provisions of the relevant double taxation treaty (DTT).
This provision provides that the definition of a PE is to be construed solely on the basis of the criteria mentioned by the DTT.
Under this paragraph, the Luxembourg tax authorities may request from the taxpayer a confirmation from the other contracting state, through any relevant document, that it effectively recognises the existence of a PE in its territory. In certain situations, the confirmation is to be given upfront and must be attached to the annual tax return.


# Luxembourg
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
## Depreciation
Depreciation rates must be consistent with economic reality. The depreciation must be calculated on the total acquisition cost, bearing in mind the normal life of the asset and the estimated residual value. As generally provided by the Luxembourg tax law, the accounting depreciation should be followed for tax purposes.
Depreciation normally is calculated using the straight-line method. However, the declining-balance method is permitted for fixed assets, other than buildings and intangible assets. The depreciation rate may not, however, exceed three times the rate applicable according to the straight-line method, or 30% (four times the applicable rate in the case of assets used exclusively for scientific and technical research, or 40%).
It is permissible to change from the declining-balance method to the straight-line method, but the opposite is not allowed.
In the event of a sale of a depreciated asset, the net book value at the moment of the disposal must be compared with the sales price of that asset. If this comparison indicates a profit, corresponding income tax may be due unless the sales price is reinvested in eligible assets. Capital losses are deductible.
Under certain conditions, fixed assets with a value of less than EUR 870 or an economic life that is not in excess of one year can be expensed fully in the year of acquisition. Special accelerated depreciation on 80% of the cost of fixed assets is available for assets that protect the national environment, save energy in Luxembourg, or permit the development of workplaces for handicapped workers, under certain conditions.
### Deferred depreciation
The rules governing depreciation of fixed assets for tax purposes have been amended as of 2017 in order to offer the possibility for taxpayers to defer deductions related to depreciation for any given tax year. For this purpose, a specific request needs to be made when filing the tax return for the year concerned.
The deduction can be deferred until, at the latest, the end of the depreciation life of the asset (i.e. any depreciation amounts deferred from previous years have to be deducted at the latest for the last year for which depreciation is allowed).
The application of this measure could potentially result in a timing difference that would increase the CIT and municipal business tax to be paid by a taxpayer for any given year. However, this might allow the taxpayer to reduce its NWT base, assuming certain conditions apply and that the taxpayer decides to book a special NWT reserve to reduce its NWT liability for the year concerned. This measure might also allow taxpayers to use investment and other tax credits during a tax year, whereas the company might otherwise have been unable to do this because it was in a tax loss position.
## Goodwill
Goodwill is generally amortised over its useful life. In cases where its lifespan cannot be reliably estimated, goodwill cannot be amortised for a period longer than ten years. The Luxembourg tax treatment will follow the applicable accounting treatment.
## Start-up expenses
Formation expenses can either be directly charged to the profit and loss account of the year in which they are incurred or depreciated on a straight-line basis over a five-year maximum period. The accounting treatment is followed for Luxembourg tax purposes.
## Interest payments
Interest payments are, in principle, deductible to the extent they comply with the arm’s-length principle (see _Transfer pricing in the section_).
Non-deductibility of the interest payments may arise in case they depend on the profits realised by the company or are derived from loans structured in the form of bonds or similar securities. Also, the deductibility will be limited in cases where the company is considered as being thinly capitalised (_see Thin capitalisation in the section_).
### Interest limitation rules
The law implementing ATAD 1 into Luxembourg domestic law (the 'Law') and applicable as of tax years starting on or after 1 January 2019 introduces interest limitation rules.
The interest limitation applies to 'exceeding' borrowing costs. These are defined as the tax-deductible borrowing costs that are in excess of the taxable interest revenues and other economically equivalent taxable income of the taxpayer.
The exceeding borrowing costs of a taxpayer are deductible in a tax period only up to the higher of (i) 30% of the taxpayer’s net revenues before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) or (ii) EUR 3 million.
Note that the Law provides for the following specific exceptions: (i) grandfathering of loans concluded before 17 June 2016 and (ii) long-term infrastructure projects.
Exceeding borrowing costs not deductible in a tax period may be carried forward without time limitation. Interest capacity that cannot be used in a given tax period may be carried forward for five years.
On 8 January 2021, the Luxembourg tax authorities issued an administrative circular (the 'ILR Circular') providing some guidance on their interpretation of the ILR. More specifically, the ILR Circular sets out the Luxembourg tax authorities' interpretation and intended practical application of Article 168bis LITL as regards the concepts of borrowing costs, exceeding borrowing costs (EBC), the fiscal EBITDA, and provides some guidance on the carry forward of EBC, and the unused interest capacity, the grandfathering rule, and the specific exemption applicable to long-term infrastructure projects. An amended ILR Circular was issued on 25 March 2022, which provides further elements on the computation of EBITDA in case of impairments / reversal of impairment, grandfathering and end of LIBOR phasing out, and on the interactions between ILR and recapture rules. 
## Hybrid mismatches
ATAD 1 anti-hybrid provisions were introduced for calendar year 2019, covering only intra-EU hybrid instruments and hybrid entity mismatches. The hybrid mismatches measures of ATAD 2, covering a wider range of intra-EU mismatches, but also mismatches with third countries, have been voted in December 2019. The Luxembourg Law generally follows the text of ATAD 2 rather closely, adapting it mainly to integrate with the structure and terminology used in the LITL. Luxembourg ATAD 2 Law applies to tax years starting as of 1 January 2020, with the additional 'reverse-hybrid' measures applying from the 2022 tax year (i.e. to tax years closing in 2022). 
A ‘hybrid mismatch’ is defined as arising when differences in the legal characterisation of a financial instrument or entity in an arrangement structured between the taxpayer and a party in another member state, or when the commercial or financial relations between a taxpayer and a party in another member state, give rise to the following consequences:
  * A deduction of the same expenses or losses occurs both in Luxembourg and in another member state where the expenses or losses originated (‘double deduction’).
  * There is a payment that is deductible in Luxembourg in which the payment has its source without a corresponding inclusion of the corresponding income in the total net revenues in the other member state (‘deduction without inclusion’).


The elimination of the tax advantage arising from a hybrid mismatch, as defined above, is to be effected as follows:
  * To the extent that a hybrid mismatch results in a double deduction, the deduction shall be given only in the member state where such payment has its source.
  * To the extent that a hybrid mismatch results in a deduction without inclusion, the member state of the payer shall deny the deduction of such payment.


### Post 2021 reverse-hybrid mismatches
With effect as of the 2022 tax year, Luxembourg transparent partnerships have become liable to CIT in relation to net income to the extent that such income is not otherwise taxed under the Luxembourg domestic tax law or the laws of any other jurisdiction, provided one or more associated non-resident entities (i) holding in aggregate a direct or indirect interest in 50% or more of the voting rights, capital interests, or rights to a share of profit in the Luxembourg partnership (ii) consider the Luxembourg partnership to be a taxable person.
The 2023 Budget Law provided clarifications on the reverse-hybrid rules covered under Article 168 LITL as follows:
  * To be considered as a reverse-hybrid entity, the non-taxation of the entity’s net income has to result from the actual qualification of the entity itself (i.e. transparent vs. opaque) at the level of its investors. Hence, the non-taxation of the net income of a partnership attributable to investors benefiting e.g. from a subjective exemption in their countries of residence should not be captured by the reverse-hybrid rules since the non-taxation is not the result of the partnership being regarded as opaque by the investors.
  * In line with the prevailing interpretation among practitioners, once the conditions set out under Article 168 LITL are met, only the portion of the net income of a reverse-hybrid entity that is attributable to an associated enterprise seeing the entity as opaque should become taxable. The portion of the net income attributable to a non-associated enterprise seeing the entity as opaque should thus not become taxable.


On 9 June 2023, the Luxembourg Tax Authorities (the LTA) issued an administrative circular providing some additional guidance on their interpretation of the reverse hybrid.
## Bad debt
Provisions for bad debts are generally tax deductible.
## Charitable contributions
Gifts for scientific, charitable, or public purposes to institutions of general interest are deductible, subject to a maximum of 20% of the net income or up to an amount of EUR 1 million (the minimum being EUR 120), with a possibility to spread the deduction over two years in case of excess.
## Shareholdings
Expenses connected to the business activity of a taxpayer are, in principle, tax deductible. However, expenses linked to a shareholding qualifying for the participation exemption, including write-downs in the value of the shareholding booked as a consequence of a dividend distribution, are not deductible, up to the amount of the exempt dividend.
In the event of disposal of a shareholding financed by debt, recapture rules may apply. Basically, the effect of this rule is that the proceeds will become taxable up to the amount of the aggregate expenses and write-downs in relation to the participation deducted during the year of disposal and the previous years.
## Severance payouts or 'golden handshakes'
Severance payouts or ‘golden handshakes’ are deductible for CIT and municipal business tax purposes, up to EUR 300,000.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties suffered by the taxpayer are not considered as operating expenses and are therefore not tax deductible.
## Taxes
Several taxes are deductible in determining income subject to CIT, including the registration duties and real estate tax. Also, certain taxes are credited against the computed amount of income tax owed, including taxes withheld from Luxembourg dividend income received, tax withheld abroad from dividend and interest income received by a Luxembourg corporation (subject to limitations), and investment tax credits (_see the section_). Foreign taxes are also deductible as expenses if not otherwise credited.
The main non-deductible taxes are CIT, municipal business tax, and NWT, as well as interest and penalties for late payment of said taxes.
## Net operating losses
Losses generated as of 1 January 2017 will only be able to be carried forward for a maximum period of 17 years. Losses that arose before 1 January 2017 are not affected by this limitation. Losses cannot be carried back.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Royalties, management service fees, and interest charges paid to foreign affiliates by a Luxembourg company are deductible items, provided they are equal to what the company would pay an unrelated entity for comparable services (application of the arm’s-length principle).
### Payments to EU black-listed entities
Interest or royalties due to related parties as of 1 March 2021 are not tax deductible if their recipients are corporate entities established in countries that are 'black-listed' as being 'non-cooperative' for tax purposes.
The application of this legislation is limited in the following ways:
  * Only interest and royalties expenses paid or due to 'associated enterprises', as defined for the purposes of applying Luxembourg’s transfer pricing regime, are in scope.
  * The measure only applies if the recipient is a corporate entity that would be regarded as 'opaque' under Luxembourg tax law.
  * The measure does not apply to operations that can prove that they can satisfy the 'valid commercial reasons that reflect economic reality' requirement. These are not defined in the specific context and will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. 


The definitions of interest and royalties for the purposes of this measure are in line with those used in the relevant articles of the OECD Model Tax Convention and with those used in most of Luxembourg’s DTTs. 
The new provision applies as of 1 March 2021 for jurisdictions that are listed in the most recent version of the 'Annex 1' list published in the Official Journal of the EU. The list is by no means a static one. Please note the following: 
  * If a jurisdiction is added to the list and is still on the latest list to have been published in the Official Journal before the next subsequent 1 January, then the provision applies to expenditure accruing as due, but only as of that following 1 January.
  * If a jurisdiction is removed from the list, then the provision ceases to apply to expenditure accruing as due as of the date of publication of the version of the list confirming that the jurisdiction concerned has been removed.
  * It should also be noted that, since the 2018 tax year, Luxembourg companies have already been required to indicate in their tax returns whether they have undertaken any transaction with any related party located in any of the EU 'Annex I' jurisdictions. This existing requirement is not affected by the new provision.


On 31 May 2022, the Luxembourg tax authorities issued a circular in relation to the law dated 10 February 2021 introducing the above provision. The circular includes limited information but does indicate that a ruling request may be filed in order to secure the application of the 'escape rule' (i.e. non-application of the non-deduction rule if the taxpayer can provide that the arrangement giving rise to the expense satisfies the 'valid commercial reasons that reflect economic reality' test). 


# Luxembourg
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
Luxembourg permits tax unity. Generally, the conditions to qualify for tax unity include that:
  * each company that is part of the tax unity is a fully taxable company that is resident in Luxembourg (the top entity may be a Luxembourg PE of a fully taxable non-resident company)
  * at least 95% of each subsidiary’s capital is directly or indirectly held by the head of the fiscal unity
  * each company’s fiscal year starts and ends on the same date, and
  * tax unity is requested jointly by the top company and each subsidiary that becomes a member of the group.


Tax unity lasts for a five-year period (minimum), and the taxable income/loss of the tax unity is computed as the sum of the taxable income/loss of each integrated entity. Tax losses incurred before the consolidation period may be offset only against tax profits of the company that incurred the loss. Tax losses that are sustained by a group member during the consolidation period are offset against the tax profits of the other group members. Tax losses arising during the consolidation period, if not used during the consolidation, remain attributed to the parent company.
The tax unity regime in Luxembourg has been extended since 1 January 2016 in accordance with a case law from the European Court of Justice in particular to allow horizontal integration. Qualifying companies that are held by a common parent company established in any EEA country, the latter being subject to a tax comparable to Luxembourg’s CIT in its country of residence, may now form a tax unity. In addition, a possibility to switch from an existing vertical tax unity to a horizontal one without triggering the retroactive cancellation of the existing tax unity is provided for, upon certain conditions. This possibility, introduced by the 2021 Budget law, follows the ECJ case-law C-749/18 judgement of 14 May 2020, and is limited to requests submitted before the end of the 2022 tax year.
A tax unity also may include a Luxembourg PE of a company established in any country that is subject to a tax comparable to Luxembourg’s CIT. The PE would be considered as the ‘integrated’ entity.
## Transfer pricing
### Arm’s-length principle
The Luxembourg transfer pricing regime is based on Article 56 of the LITL, which broadly replicates Article 9 of the OECD Model Tax Convention. Luxembourg transfer pricing legislation applies to all types of inter-company transactions, cross-border as well as domestic.
In summary, transactions between related parties (cross-border as well as domestic) have to be governed by the arm’s-length principle endorsed by the OECD. In essence, this means when the two enterprises are, within their commercial or financial relations, subject to conditions made or imposed that differ from those that would be made between independent enterprises, the profits of these enterprises are to be determined under conditions prevailing between independent enterprises.
Article 56bis of the LITL brings explicitly into the law some of the key principles set out in the revised version of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, following Action 8-10 Final Report of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan. It contains a GAAR measure that may disregard a transaction that has been made without any valid commercial rationality.
### Luxembourg Transfer Pricing Guidelines
For Luxembourg entities engaged in intra-group financing transactions, specific guidelines are provided for in Circular LITL No. 56/1 - 56bis/1 (“TP Circular”). According to the TP Circular, the OECD arm’s-length principle should be applied to determine the compensation of such entities. 
Luxembourg entities in the scope of the TP Circular have to comply with certain substance and equity at risk requirements. Absence of meeting such requirements may result in an exchange of information. 
A written clearance (i.e. uni-, bi-, or multi-lateral advance pricing agreement [APA]) with the Luxembourg tax authorities on the set of criteria for the determination of the transfer pricing for the financial on-lending transactions can be requested, provided that the Luxembourg company meets certain substance and equity at risk requirements.
### Documentation
Section 3 of Paragraph 171 of the General Tax Law provides that, upon request of the Luxembourg tax authorities, taxpayers have to be able to support data included in their tax returns in respect to transactions between related parties. The absence of proper transfer pricing documentation may result in the reversal of the burden of proof towards the taxpayer. The draft bill n°8186 released on 28 March 2023 and proposing several changes to the Luxembourg law governing procedures in relation to direct taxes introduces, among others, the requirement of the preparation of a master file and local file based on a certain threshold.
To enhance transparency, taxpayers need to disclose whether during the year concerned they have been engaged in transactions with related parties and whether they engaged in transactions with related parties located in non-cooperative jurisdictions according to the EU list.
### Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
Under the Luxembourg CbC legislation, a Luxembourg tax resident entity that is the ultimate parent entity of a multinational enterprise (MNE) group with consolidated group revenue of EUR 750 million or more in the preceding fiscal year and that prepares consolidated financial statements (or would be required to do so if its equity interests were traded on a public security exchange) is required to file a CbC report with the Luxembourg tax authorities. Other Luxembourg companies that are members of MNE groups may also have obligations to file CbC reports in Luxembourg under the so-called ‘surrogate parent entity’ regime or the ‘secondary’ mechanism. The filing is due 12 months after the last day of each fiscal year of an MNE group.
A Luxembourg resident entity affected by this legislation needs to notify the Luxembourg tax authorities of whether it is going to file a CbC report as the ultimate parent, under the secondary mechanism, or as a surrogate filer. Alternatively, if a Luxembourg entity is a constituent entity (this being defined as a Luxembourg tax resident entity forming part of an MNE group in scope of CbC reporting), each such entity must notify the Luxembourg tax authorities of which other entity in the MNE group is filing the CbC report and its residency. This notification is due by the last day of the fiscal year of the MNE group.
The Luxembourg tax authorities will exchange annually on an automatic basis the CbC report received from any Luxembourg reporting entity in an MNE group with all the authorities of other jurisdictions where that MNE group has activities. However, a CbC report can only be exchanged in cases where both tax authorities have agreed to automatic exchange, any mechanism for this is effective, and their respective jurisdictions have in place legislation that requires the filing of CbC reports with respect to that fiscal year to which the CbC report relates.
Luxembourg tax authorities may impose a penalty of up to EUR 250,000 in case of no filing, late filing, or incorrect filing of either the CbC report or notification(s).
### Public CbC reporting
On 15 August 2023, the Law implementing the EU directive regarding the Disclosure of Income Tax Information by Certain Undertakings and Branches (2021/2101) (the Public CbC Reporting Directive) has been signed. The Public CbC reporting will take effect in Luxembourg for accounting periods beginning on or after 22 June 2024.
In scope of the Public CbC reporting are MNEs based in the European Union and non-EU-based MNEs doing business in the European Union through a branch or subsidiary with a consolidated annual revenue of at least EUR 750 million for two consecutive years. MNEs falling in scope will be required to publicly disclose, among others, information on the amount of income, profit before tax, corporate tax payable, and WHT on a per-country basis.
The report must be publicly disclosed in one of the EU official languages and deposited each year on (i) the website of the Ultimate Parent Entity (UPE) or the standalone undertaking, or (ii) in the register of Commerce and Companies (registre de commerce et des sociéétés), if available free of charge for a five-year period.
In line with the possibility offered by the Public CbC Reporting Directive, Luxembourg has opted to allow companies to temporarily (up to five years) omit specific data from the declaration in cases where this would be particularly detrimental to the company's commercial position. The second exemptions are EU banks already disclosing information within the scope of the CRD IV.
### Burden of proof, statute of limitation, and penalties
In terms of the burden of proof, taxpayers are required to provide the Luxembourg tax authorities with the documentation to demonstrate the application of the arm’s-length principle. In the absence of such documentation, the burden of proof can be reversed towards the taxpayer.
The statute of limitations is generally five years from the end of the year in which the tax liability arises. This period may be extended if a deferred payment is granted. In case of tax evasion or fraud, as well as in case of incomplete tax returns, the statute of limitations can be extended up to ten years.
There are no specific penalties in relation to transfer pricing in Luxembourg, but the penalty regime under the CIT will be applicable.
### Advance pricing agreement (APA)
Taxpayers can file unilateral and bi- or multi-lateral APAs with the Luxembourg tax authorities. An administrative fee in the amount of EUR 10,000 is due to the Luxembourg tax authorities for the filing of the APAs under Paragraph 29a of the above-mentioned General Tax Law of 22 May 1931. The above-referred draft bill proposing several changes to the Luxembourg law governing procedures in relation to direct taxes also introduces an application fee between EUR 10,000 and EUR 20,000.
## Thin capitalisation
An appropriate equity level should be respected by Luxembourg taxpayers, taking in consideration actual facts and circumstances. Transfer pricing documentation supporting the debt-to-equity ratio of a taxpayer (debt capacity analysis) may be requested by the Luxembourg tax authorities. Should an appropriate equity level not be complied with by the taxpayer, the resulting surplus of interest can be re-qualified by the tax authorities as a deemed distribution of profits that would be non-deductible and potentially subject to a 15% WHT.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Since 1 January 2019, Luxembourg tax law provides for CFC rules.
Luxembourg opted for option B under ATAD, thus targeting non-distributed income of CFCs arising from non-genuine arrangements that have been put in place for the essential purpose of obtaining a tax advantage.
The following two cumulative conditions have to be fulfilled for an entity or PE to be considered as a CFC.
  * Control test: An entity is a controlled entity if the taxpayer by itself or together with its associated enterprises holds a direct or indirect participation of more than 50% of the voting rights or capital, or is entitled to receive more than 50% of the profits of that entity. With respect to a PE, the control test is by definition met.
  * Effective tax rate (ETR) test: There will be a CFC if the actual CIT paid by the entity or PE on its profits is lower than 50% percent of the CIT charge that would have been payable in Luxembourg under Luxembourg domestic tax rules had the entity or PE been resident or established in Luxembourg.


When an entity or PE meets the control test and the ETR test, the taxpayer should include in its taxable basis the non-distributed income of the entity or PE to the extent arising from non-genuine arrangements that have been put in place for the essential purpose of obtaining a tax advantage.
The following CFCs are excluded from the scope of the application of these new rules:
  * Those with accounting profits of no more than EUR 750,000.
  * Those for which the accounting profits amount to no more than 10% of their operating costs for the period.


A Luxembourg taxpayer having a CFC with income arising from a non-genuine arrangement will have to include in its taxable base the non-distributed income of the CFC but within the limit of amounts generated through assets and risks that are linked to significant people functions carried out by the taxpayer.
On 4 March 2020, the Luxembourg tax authorities issued an administrative circular that has been updated on 17 June 2022, providing guidance on their interpretation of article 164ter of the LITL relating to CFC taxation.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
## Foreign tax credit
_See Foreign income in the section for a description of the foreign tax credit regime_.
## Inbound and capital investment incentives
Luxembourg tax law provides for various incentives, with specific requirements, in the areas of risk capital, audio-visual activities, environmental protection, research and development (R&D), professional training, and recruitment of unemployed persons.
The most commonly used incentives are the investment tax credits, _which are further described below_.
## Intellectual property (IP) regime
The law enacting the new IP regime (article 50ter of the LITL) was approved by the Luxembourg Parliament on 22 March 2018. The new IP measures entered into force as of 1 January 2018.
Under this regime, eligible net income from qualifying IP assets benefits from an 80% exemption from income taxes. Consequently, a corporate taxpayer based in Luxembourg City with eligible net income will be taxed on such income at an overall (i.e. corporate income taxes plus municipal business tax) effective tax rate of 4.774% as from tax year 2025 (previously 4.988%). IP assets qualifying for the new regime also benefit from a full exemption from Luxembourg’s NWT.
The levels of these exemptions are consistent with those given under the previous regime (article 50 _bis_ of the LITL repealed effective on 1 July 2016 for CIT and municipal business tax purposes and 1 January 2017 for NWT purposes). However, the scope of the new regime, and the way in which income that is to benefit from the exemption is to be computed, are both markedly different. The ‘nexus approach’ focuses on establishing a direct connection between expenditures, the IP assets, and the income that can benefit from the beneficial regime.
In applying the new regime, each IP asset must be looked at separately, and income and expenditure linked to each asset thus needs to be identified. The only exception to this approach is when a closely linked family of products or services are involved, and it would be so complex as to make it impossible to adopt an asset-by-asset approach.
Two main groups of IP assets are eligible to benefit from the new regime:
  * Inventions protected under patents, utility models, and other IP rights that are functionally equivalent to patents. More specifically, these comprise supplementary protection certificates for patents on pharmaceutical or phyto-pharmaceutical products, extensions to supplementary protection certificates to paediatric medicines, plant variety certificates, and orphan drug designations.
  * Software protected by copyright under national or international norms.


Market-related IP, such as a trademark, is not eligible.
## R&D incentives
Luxembourg entities involved in innovative and R&D activities can benefit from financial support in addition to the specific IP tax regime and general tax incentives.
Innovation loans may be granted by the _Société Nationale de Crédit et d’Investissement_ and may carry a fixed interest rate lower than the market rate. Financial support may also be granted in the form of cash grants or interest subsidies.
R&D projects or programmes receive financial support up to a maximum eligibility (percentage of costs eligible for the incentives) depending on the size of the beneficiary (private research companies or organisations) as follows:
  * Large (25% to 100% depending on the investment).
  * Mid-size (35% to 100%).
  * Small (45% to 100%).


These incentives are available for:
  * experimental development
  * experimental development and cooperation
  * industrial research
  * industrial research and cooperation, or
  * fundamental research.


Innovation in process and organisation and investment in innovation pools can benefit from financial support of between 15% and 35% (50% for public research companies).
Promotion and development of innovation pools can benefit from financial support of up to 50% for private organisations or 75% for public research companies.
Research regarding technical feasibility can benefit from financial support of up to 40% or 50% if prior to experimental development and up to 65% or 75% if prior to experimental research.
## Tax credit for investments
Luxembourg offers different investment tax credits, under the following conditions:
  * Investment is by an enterprise seeking commercial profit.
  * Investment is managed by an establishment situated in Luxembourg with the intention of remaining permanently.
  * Investments have to be physically used in the territory of Luxembourg or of a country that is a member of the European Economic Area.
  * Durability criteria (exclusion of building sites).
  * Requires application by the taxpayer (form 800, filed as an appendix to the income tax return).


### Tax credit for additional investment (TCAI)
The new Luxembourg investment tax credits regime to accelerate sustainability transformation introduced by the law dated 19 December 2023 fully repeals the tax credit for additional investment with effect as from the 2024 tax year (i.e. for financial years closing on or after 1 January 2024).
### Tax credit for investments and operating expenses connected with digital and ecological transformation ('DET tax credit')
The Law introduces an 18% tax credit that applies to certain investments and operating expenses connected with digital and ecological transformation, provided they comply with at least one of the objectives on the digital transformation or on the ecological/energetic transformation as listed in the Law.
For investments in tangible depreciable assets, the DET tax credit is limited to 6% considering that these assets are expected to benefit from the 12% tax credit for global investment (further described below), hence reaching the expected 18% tax credit overall. 
Income derived from investment and expenses related to the acquisition or development of software/patents would not be eligible to the patent box regime provided by article 50ter of the LITL to the extent the company benefits from a DET tax credit on these investments and expenses.
Also, excluded from the DET tax credit, are:
  * assets that are depreciable over a period of less than three years
  * automotive vehicles, and
  * investments and operating expenses to bring the company into compliance with obligations arising from environmental protection legislation and other legal and regulatory provisions applicable to the establishment and operation of industrial and commercial companies.


The benefit of the DET tax credit requires obtaining:
  * an eligible certificate issued by the Minister of Economy attesting the eligibility of the investment and operating expenses in relation to a project of digital/ecological transformation as defined under the new article 152bis LITL, and
  * an annual certificate issued by the Minister of Economy proving the reality of the project and investment and operating expenses. Such certificate should be attached to the corporate tax return filed with the Luxembourg tax authorities every year. Following the request of the State Council, the Law now explicitly provides that this certificate is binding to the tax authorities.


### Tax credit for overall investment (TCOI)
The tax credit for overall investment is based on the acquisition price or production costs of new qualifying assets (basically tangible depreciable assets) acquired during a given accounting period. The Law increased the rate to 12% and repealed the EUR 150,000 threshold as from the 2024 tax year.
The TCOI applies to:
  * investments in depreciable tangible assets other than buildings, livestock, and mineral and fossil deposits
  * investments in sanitary and central heating installations incorporated into hotel buildings (under certain conditions)
  * investments in certain buildings qualifying as social investment
  * investments in fixed assets qualifying for special depreciation, and
  * acquisitions of software, insofar as they have not been acquired from a related company (to the extent not otherwise qualifying under the DET tax credit already).


For investments in fixed assets qualifying for special depreciation, the Law increased the applicable rate to 14%.
The Law caps the TCOI related to the acquisition of software at 10% of the CIT due for the fiscal year during which the financial year closed and where the acquisition of the software was made. Similar as for the DET tax credit, income derived from the software would be out of scope of the patent box regime foreseen under article 50ter of the LITL.
The above measure only relates to the acquisition of software and does not include software created by the taxpayer itself. The revenues from such software can instead potentially benefit from partial tax exemption under Luxembourg’s IP regime (_see_ _Intellectual property (IP) regime_ _above_).
The total of the DET tax credit and TCOI are creditable on the CIT due for the fiscal years during which the investment or operating costs are realised and can be carried forward (except for the TCOI on software) during ten subsequent fiscal years if it would not be fully used.
In addition, in order to offer a further incentive for sustainable mobility, some specific types of cars are eligible assets to the TCOI up to the first EUR 50,000 threshold of the acquisition price per car. To be eligible, the vehicles must be passenger cars, 'zero emissions', running exclusively on electricity or hydrogen cells, classified as M1, having a passenger compartment designed exclusively for the carriage of passengers and having not more than nine seats (including the driver's seat), and first registered after 31 December 2017.
## Other incentives by entity
### Investment funds
Investment funds resident in Luxembourg generally are exempt from CIT, municipal business tax, and WHT on dividends. These investment funds are subject to the subscription tax and to the general registration duty regime.
### Private wealth management company (Société de gestion du Patrimoine Familial or SPF)
The SPF has been tailored to enter into the private sphere of individuals for the purpose of wealth management. Its corporate objective is restricted to the acquisition, holding, management, and disposal of financial assets, to the exclusion of any commercial activity. As a general rule, an SPF is exempt from Luxembourg taxation on income and NWT in Luxembourg. A yearly subscription tax of 0.25% is due on the basis of paid-up capital, share premium, and excessive debts with a minimum amount of EUR 1,000. Subscription tax, however, is capped at EUR 125,000. No WHT applies on dividends distributed by an SPF. Non-resident investors are not taxed in Luxembourg on dividends paid by an SPF or on capital gains realised on shares in an SPF.
### Securitisation companies (SCs)
An SC is a company that carries out securitisation activities or participates in securitisation transactions. SCs are subject to normal corporate taxation based on their net accounting profit (i.e. gross accounting profits minus expenses). However, the commitment to remunerate the holders of securities (both capital and debt) issued by the SC qualifies as interest on debt even if paid as return on equity. SCs are not subject to NWT in Luxembourg.
### Venture capital vehicle (Société d’Investissement en Capital à Risques or SICAR)
The SICAR is an entity mainly used for private equity investments. Incorporated under a corporate form, the SICAR is subject to income tax at the normal rate with the benefit of an exemption on income and gains (e.g. dividends, capital gains, liquidation proceeds, interest) from transferable securities qualifying as investments in risk capital, as well as income arising from investments in liquid assets pending their investment in risk capital for a maximum of 12 months. In addition, it can benefit from the European directives and DTTs. SICARs are exempt from NWT. Under the form of a limited partnership, the SICAR is treated as a tax transparent entity, and investors are taxed according to the rules of their country of residence. SICARs treated as tax transparent entities do not benefit from the European directives and DTTs. The SICAR mainly targets qualified or informed investors (i.e. ‘professional’ investors).
### Financial services companies
Banks, securities depositaries, insurance and reinsurance companies, as well as other financial service companies, may benefit from specific regulations when establishing their taxable basis for CIT (e.g. provision for the neutralisation of unrealised exchange gains, general banking risk provision, provision for guarantee of deposits, mathematical reserves, and/or catastrophe reserves).
### Shipping companies
Luxembourg-resident shipping companies are not subject to municipal business tax and can benefit from investment tax credits and accelerated depreciation (even for used assets).
### Farming businesses
Farming businesses may deduct 30% of the amount of any new investment of up to a total of EUR 250,000 made in the business. Investment above this amount is eligible for a deduction of 20% of the difference between the investment amount and the aforementioned EUR 250,000 limit.

Notes
These notes are not extensive. The full text of the DTT should be checked for a comprehensive view on the conditions of application of reduced rates.
  1. Under Luxembourg domestic law, no WHT is levied on dividends paid by a Luxembourg qualifying subsidiary to an entity that is: 
    1. a collective entity falling within the scope of the Parent Subsidiary Directive
    2. a Luxembourg resident joint-stock company, which is fully taxable and does not take one of the forms listed in the LITL
    3. a PE of a collective entity falling under the previous categories
    4. a collective entity that is resident in a country with which Luxembourg has concluded a DTT and is fully liable to a tax corresponding to the Luxembourg CIT, or a domestic PE of such an entity
    5. a Swiss resident joint-stock company that is subject to Swiss CIT without benefiting from any exemption
    6. a joint-stock company or a cooperative company that is resident in an EEA member state (other than an EU member state) and is fully liable to a tax corresponding to the Luxembourg CIT, or
    7. a PE of a joint-stock company or of a cooperative company that is resident in an EEA member state (other than an EU member state), and
    8. at the date on which the income is made available, the beneficiary has been holding or undertakes to hold, directly, for an uninterrupted period of at least 12 months, a participation of at least 10%, or with an acquisition price of at least EUR 1.2 million in the share capital of the income debtor.
Qualifying shareholders under (b) to (g) above need to be fully taxable collective entities subject in their country of residence to a tax similar to that imposed by Luxembourg. As a general rule, this requirement is met if the foreign tax is compulsorily levied at an effective rate of at least 8% (as from tax year 2025, previously 8.5%), on a basis similar to the Luxembourg one.
Provisions effective from 1 January 2016, amending the participation exemption regime, transpose effectively verbatim into Luxembourg law the 'anti-hybrid instrument' and 'common minimum anti-avoidance rule' (EU PSD GAAR) measures amending the EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive (PSD), adopted in July 2014 and January 2015, respectively.
EU PSD GAAR: The withholding tax exemption no longer applies to dividends distributed by a Luxembourg resident joint-stock company to a joint stock company resident in another member state or a permanent establishment located in another member state of a joint stock company resident in another member state (which would otherwise qualify for the participation exemption) if the dividend is distributed as part of an arrangement or a series of arrangements that, having been put into place for the main purpose or one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the PSD, are not genuine having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances.
An arrangement may comprise more than one step or part. For the purposes of the GAAR, an arrangement or a series of arrangements shall be regarded as not genuine to the extent that they are not put into place for valid commercial reasons that reflect economic reality. It is therefore increasingly important to continually monitor the substance and activities of entities in a structure.
  2. Interest paid to non-residents generally is not subject to WHT in Luxembourg. However, interest that represents a right to profit participation on a bond may be assimilated to a dividend and subject to WHT. Further analysis should be made to determine the applicable reduced rate on the basis of the treaty (i.e. pursuant to dividend or interest clause).
  3. Royalties paid to non-residents are not subject to WHT in Luxembourg, whether the companies are associated or not.
  4. A WHT of 20% is withheld on defined interest income paid by a Luxembourg paying agent to resident individuals. Interest indirectly cashed through investment funds are out of the scope of this WHT.
  5. DTTs have been signed with Albania, Argentina, Cape Verde, Colombia, Ghana, Kuwait, Montenegro and Oman, but these DTTs are not yet in force. DTT with Kyrgyzstan has not been signed yet. 
  6. The 0% rate applies if the beneficial owner has held, directly and without interruption, for at least 12 months, at least 10% of the capital of the company paying the dividends or a participation with an acquisition cost of at least EUR 1,200,000 in the company paying the dividends.

The 0% rate applies if the conditions of the Luxembourg participation exemption regime are met or if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) that directly holds at least 10% of the capital of the company paying the dividends for an uninterrupted period of at least 12 months prior to the decision to distribute the dividends. The 15% rate applies in all other cases.
  12. The 0% rate applies if the conditions of the Luxembourg participation exemption regime are met. The 10% rate applies if the recipient is a company (with the exception of general partnerships, limited partnerships, and cooperative societies) whose direct participation, held since the beginning of its financial year, in the capital of the company (with the exception of general partnerships, limited partnerships, and cooperative societies) paying the dividends is at least 25% or has an acquisition price of at least 250 million francs.

The 15% rate applies in all other cases.
  27.

The 15% rate applies in all other cases. An amending protocol signed by Luxembourg and Germany on 6 July 2023, which applies as of 1 January 2024, amends certain provisions of the German/Luxembourg DTT as well as the previous protocol. A specific provision has been added to cover the tax treatment applicable to dividends paid (i) by a German REIT, (ii) by a Luxembourg real estate company that is considered for tax purposes as being similar to a German REIT, or (iii) dividends paid to a UCI that should be subject to a maximum WHT of 15% (mostly relevant from a German tax perspective, as UCIs in Luxembourg are not subject to WHT).

## Implementation of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
FATCA is a set of information reporting rules designed to prevent and detect tax evasion by United States (US) persons. It reflects and promotes a global trend towards greater tax transparency and increased worldwide efforts to combat tax fraud in many sectors of the financial world. It also builds the basis for other international developments in this respect, such as the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) initiated by the OECD.
Even though FATCA originated in the United States, it also affects non-US entities.
Luxembourg signed an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) Model 1 with the United States on 28 March 2014 under the terms of which FATCA is applied in Luxembourg. The IGA was ratified on 24 July 2015 by the Luxembourg Parliament and enacted into Luxembourg law on the same date (FATCA Law).
Based on the FATCA Law, Luxembourg financial institutions (i.e. depositary and custodial institutions, certain insurance companies, and investment entities that do not benefit from an exemption) have to comply with some due diligence and registration duties. In addition, they have to report under FATCA to the Luxembourg tax authorities by 30 June each year (with respect to financial accounts existing in the previous year) even though they do not have any US reportable accounts (in this case, a nil report is required). The Luxembourg tax authorities will then automatically exchange this information with the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by 30 September.
Apart from Luxembourg banks, insurance companies, funds, or other entities that fall within the definition of investment entities (certain holding companies within private equity or real estate structures, securitisation vehicles, etc.) might be subject to full FATCA obligations despite the fact that they have neither US investments nor US investors. If the entity being an in-scope financial institution does not comply with its FATCA obligations as implemented under Luxembourg law, it risks being subject to local penalties (up to EUR 250,000 and 0.5% of the amount incorrectly reported in case of audit findings) in addition to a 30% WHT in certain limited cases. Under a law voted on 16 June 2020 that clarifies compliance obligations, reporting financial institutions must have written policies and procedures, adequate systems, and appropriate controls (even on service providers to whom relevant tasks are outsourced). As of 2021, failure to submit a required FATCA report will be subject to a lump-sum penalty of EUR 10,000 (in addition to the penalties mentioned above).
It is worth noting that the FATCA Law (same as the IGA Annex II) provides some deemed-compliant categories (e.g. Collective Investment Vehicle, Sponsored Investment Entity, Luxembourg Investment Advisors and Investment Managers) under which Luxembourg financial institutions, should they qualify for one of these categories, would be subject to lighter FATCA obligations as non-reporting foreign financial institutions. Given the obligations under the law mentioned above, it is recommended to document why the entity applies its non-reporting status and how it monitors the conditions that go with this status.
In order to comply with their FATCA obligations, financial institutions need to know the FATCA status of their account holders, investors, policy holders, etc. Therefore, even entities that do not qualify as financial institutions should analyse their FATCA status, as they need to certify it to their financial counterparts.
## Implementation of the Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
On 21 July 2014, the OECD released the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters, including the Commentary on the CRS. The CRS seeks to establish the automatic exchange of tax information as the new global standard. The automatic exchange of information involves the systematic and periodic transmission of extensive taxpayer information from the country in which a taxpayer's financial accounts are located to that taxpayer’s country of residence.
Similar to the provisions of FATCA and the various IGAs between the US government and partner governments around the world, the CRS imposes obligations on financial institutions, including some holdings companies, across the financial services market to review and collect information in an effort to identify an account holder’s country of residence and then, in turn, to provide certain specified account information to that home country’s tax administration.
The CRS has been incorporated in the amended Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC 2) officially adopted by the European Council on 9 December 2014. On 24 December 2015, the Luxembourg CRS Law of 18 December 2015 was published, enacting the CRS into Luxembourg law with an entry into force as of 1 January 2016. Therefore, Luxembourg financial institutions had, as of this date, to on-board new clients/investors according to specific procedures.
Based on the result of those on-boarding and due diligence procedures, the Luxembourg financial institutions have to file CRS reports to the Luxembourg tax authorities by 30 June each year (with respect to financial accounts maintained in the previous year). The Luxembourg tax authorities will then automatically exchange this information with the relevant other jurisdictions by 30 September. Under a law voted on 16 June 2020, nil reports are mandatory as of 2021 (i.e. reporting for the year 2020). The penalties for missing or incorrect reporting, as well as non-compliance, are similar to those mentioned for FATCA above. As for FATCA, reporting financial institutions need to have written policies and procedures, adequate systems, and appropriate controls in place.
The CRS report will have to comply with the specific format defined by the Luxembourg tax authorities’ Circular ECHA 4. The jurisdictions for which data must be exchanged are listed in a Grand-Ducal Decree, which is updated generally once a year.
## FATCA and CRS common data protection treatment
According to the Luxembourg FATCA and CRS Law, as well as Luxembourg data protection rules, each individual concerned (including controlling persons of certain entities) shall be informed on the processing of one’s personal data before a Luxembourg financial institution processes the data for FATCA and CRS purposes. Furthermore, prior to the reporting, each individual concerned must be informed about the jurisdiction with which the data is exchanged.
Each individual subject to the FATCA and CRS reporting (including controlling persons of certain entities) has the right to access and rectify one’s personal data but is also required to respond to the financial institution’s request for relevant information.
The Luxembourg law introducing DAC 7 into national law also amends the CRS Law with regard to data protection requirements. This law establishes a new obligation to notify on an annual basis individual clients and investors (as well as controlling persons) on the personal information shared in the CRS reports, prior to their filing.
## Implementation of DAC 6 in the Luxembourg law 
On 21 March 2020, the Luxembourg Parliament voted to approve the Bill (n°7465) implementing the Directive (EU) 2018/822 on mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation in relation to reportable cross-border arrangements (commonly referred to as 'DAC 6'). The law dated 25 March 2020 follows the text of DAC 6 rather closely and is applicable since 1 July 2021. The Luxembourg tax authorities have issued guidelines in the form of an FAQ updated from time to time.
DAC 6 makes it mandatory for intermediaries (or taxpayers if there is no intermediary or intermediaries subject to professional secrecy as defined by EU member states' domestic laws) to report some cross-border transactions and arrangements to the domestic tax authorities and will trigger the subsequent automatic exchange of information to tax authorities of all EU member states through access to a central directory.
During the Luxembourg legislative process, amendments were made to the initial provisions in relation to professional secrecy at the request of the State Council. As a result of these amendments, the benefit of professional secrecy, initially limited to lawyers, has been extended to auditors and qualified accountants. In most cases, the reporting obligation to the Luxembourg tax authorities will therefore be shifted to other intermediaries or to the taxpayer.
Based on the ECJ decision dated 8 December 2022, our view is that intermediaries benefiting from this legal privilege have an obligation to notify any other intermediary not protected by professional secrecy and who are their clients, or if not the case, the relevant taxpayer(s), of their reporting obligations within a period of ten days following the earliest of the above-mentioned events.
The Luxembourg law introducing DAC 7 into national law also amends the law dated 25 March 2020 with regard to data protection requirements. This law establishes a new obligation to notify individuals concerned on the personal information shared in the DAC 6 reports, prior to their filing.
## Implementation of DAC 7 in the Luxembourg law
On 3 May 2023, the Luxembourg Parliament voted in favour of the bill of law n°8029, to implement DAC 7 into the Luxembourg legal system (the ’DAC 7 Law‘), with more than five months of delay. In addition, the Luxembourg tax authorities have issued guidelines in the form of an FAQ updated from time to time.
The DAC 7 Law, taking effect as of 1 January 2023, introduces obligations on reporting platform operators (as defined by the DAC 7 Law) to collect information on their users being sellers and provide it to the Luxembourg tax authorities on an annual basis. The activities in scope of DAC 7 are the rental of immovable property, personal services, the sale of goods, and the rental of any mode of transport carried out through platforms. It also introduces new (standardised) automatic exchange of information between the EU tax authorities, regarding the taxable events and income generated through these platforms.
## EU state aid
On 8 November 2022, the CJEU published its final decision on two appeals (C-885/19 P, and C-898/19P) regarding the formal state aid investigation by the EC dating back to October 2015 in relation to an Advance Pricing Agreement of Fiat Finance & Trade Ltd (FFT). The CJEU annulled the EC’s decision setting aside the finding that FFT had received state aid. The CJEU concluded that the GC’s decision was vitiated by an error of law. Essentially, the CJEU confirmed that when performing a state aid analysis in tax cases, the determination of the reference system, which is a key element of that analysis, should be based on the domestic tax legislation of the member state concerned, recognising that, at the current stage of development of EU law, there is no general harmonisation of tax measures across the European Union, and, accordingly, member states have the power to define the rules of ‘normal’ taxation of an integrated company (albeit such power must be exercised in a manner consistent with the provisions of EU law).
On 5 December 2023, the Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) rendered its judgment in joined cases C-451/21 P and C-454/21 P regarding the action brought by Engie group companies and Luxembourg against the judgments of the General Court of the European Union (GC) of 12 May 2021 (T-516/18 and T-525/18) that previously confirmed the existence of State Aid under article 107 TFEU. The CJEU ruled that the European Commission (EC) erred in its State Aid analysis of the tax rulings granted to Engie group.
On 14 December 2023, the CJEU rendered its judgments in the case C-475/21 P regarding the action brought by Amazon group companies and Luxembourg against the judgment of the GC of 12 May 20221. The CJEU ruled that Luxembourg did not grant any State Aid to Amazon. In essence, the CJEU upheld the GC judgment despite errors in the GC’s reasoning. This was because the EC’s decision had to be annulled in any event because of the incorrect determination of the reference system, rather than for the reasons given by the GC.
On 28 November 2024, following those judgments by the CJEU, the EC closed the two in-depth State aid investigations into transfer pricing tax rulings granted by Luxembourg to Fiat and Amazon concluding that the tax rulings did not grant the companies selective advantages.
Additional information is available on the website of the PwC EU Direct Tax Group ().
## Multilateral instrument (MLI)
The MLI formally entered into force for Luxembourg on 1 August 2019.
The dates on which the provisions of the MLI that apply to Luxembourg’s DTT network then actually come into effect are variable, as these also depend on the timing of ratification process for the MLI by each relevant treaty co-signatory. However, insofar as the new 'Principal Purposes Test' in the MLI potentially limits the treaty benefits of reduced or zero rates of WHTs, for many of Luxembourg’s treaties these MLI measures took effect on 1 January 2020.
Conversely, Luxembourg’s treaties with countries that have yet to sign the MLI, such as the United States (US), cannot be affected by any MLI modifications, unless and until the country concerned has both subsequently signed the MLI and gone through its ratification and deposit processes.

In general, the first in first out (FIFO), the last in first out (LIFO), and the weighted-average costs methods of inventory valuation are acceptable for income tax purposes, provided the method is in accordance with the facts.
## Dividend income
Dividends received by a Luxembourg resident company (or by a domestic PE of a non-resident company in certain cases) should, in principle, be subject to CIT.
### Participation exemption regime
Dividends received may be tax exempt in Luxembourg, according to the so-called ‘participation exemption’ regime, if the conditions described below are satisfied:
  * The distributing company is: 
    * a collective entity falling within the scope of the EU Council ‘Parent Subsidiary Directive’ (Gibraltar companies are not to be considered as entitled to benefit from this exemption as of 1 January 2021)
    * a Luxembourg resident joint-stock company, which is fully taxable and does not take one of the forms listed in the Luxembourg Income Tax Law (LITL), or
    * a non-resident joint-stock company that is fully liable (in its state of residence) to a tax corresponding to the Luxembourg CIT. As a general rule, it is required that the foreign tax is compulsorily levied at a rate of at least 8 % as from tax year 2025 (this rate used to be 8.5% for tax years up to and including tax year 2024), on a basis similar to the Luxembourg one.
  * The beneficiary company is: 
    * a Luxembourg resident collective entity, which is fully taxable and takes one of the forms listed in the LITL
    * a Luxembourg resident joint-stock company, which is fully taxable and does not take one of the forms listed in the LITL
    * a domestic PE of a collective entity falling within the scope of the Parent Subsidiary Directive
    * a domestic PE of a joint-stock company that is resident in a country with which Luxembourg has concluded a DTT, or
    * a domestic PE of a joint-stock company or of a cooperative company, which is a resident of a European Economic Area (EEA) member state (other than an EU member state).
  * At the date on which the income is made available, the beneficiary has been holding or undertakes to hold, directly (or through a tax transparent entity, _see Transparent entities below_), for an uninterrupted period of at least 12 months, a participation in the share capital of the subsidiary either representing at least 10% of its share capital or with an acquisition price of at least EUR 1.2 million.


Consistent with the general principle under the LITL that denies the deductibility of expenses connected to exempt income, any expenses incurred during the year in which a dividend is received, and which have a direct economic connection to the exempt participation, may only be deducted insofar as they exceed the exempt dividend for the year in question, subject to interest limitation rules.
As from tax year 2025, taxpayers are allowed to opt out of the benefit of the exemption to the extent that dividend income is exempt solely based on the acquisition price representing at least EUR 1,200,000. This opt out mechanism would have to be exercised on a yearly basis and for each shareholding relying on the above acquisition price threshold to benefit from the exemption.
### General anti-avoidance regime (GAAR)
The Luxembourg participation exemption regime has been amended in order to introduce anti ‘hybrid instruments’ and GAAR rules derived from the amended EU Parent/Subsidiary Directive. These provisions apply to income distributed or received after 31 December 2015.
The GAAR rule precludes Directive-based benefits whenever there are any arrangements that, having been put into place with the main purpose of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the Directive, are ‘not genuine’. A ‘not genuine’ determination should be based on all relevant facts and circumstances. For the GAAR rule, an arrangement should be considered ‘not genuine’ insofar as it was not structured for ‘valid commercial reasons that reflect economic reality’.
The Luxembourg tax authorities have not provided any substantive guidance or interpretation of these EU-driven measures.
Dividends received from a corporate entity in another EU member state that normally would qualify for the participation exemption of Article 166 LITL will be denied this exemption if the GAAR rule applies. However, if the corporate entity paying the dividend also is fully subject to a tax similar to the Luxembourg CIT, the participation exemption will remain available, since this alternative provision granting the exemption is not subject to the new anti-avoidance rule.
The exemption of Article 166 LITL will not be available if the income flow creates a corresponding tax-deductible expense (i.e. a hybrid mismatch) when the source is a corporate entity in another EU member state.
These measures do not affect capital gains or NWT components for Luxembourg corporate entities.
## Capital gains
Capital gains (and losses) generally are taxed as ordinary income (and losses are generally tax deductible). It is possible to defer the taxation of gains on certain fixed assets where the proceeds are used to acquire replacement items. Under certain conditions, capital gains and hidden reserves may be deferred or exempted and remain untaxed in a merger or another form of reorganisation of resident companies or other EU companies.
In general, capital gains on the disposal of qualifying shareholdings held by entities eligible to the participation exemption regime are tax exempt, provided that (i) the shareholding constitutes at least 10% of total ownership in the share capital or has an acquisition price of at least EUR 6 million and (ii) the disposing company has held or intends to hold a qualifying shareholding for at least 12 months.
Starting from tax year 2025, taxpayers are allowed to opt out of the benefit of the above exemption with respect to capital gains that are exempt solely based on the acquisition price representing at least EUR 6 million. This opt-out mechanism would have to be exercised on both a yearly basis and for each shareholding relying on the above acquisition price threshold to benefit from the exemption.
A recapture system exists wherein the capital gain realised will become taxable up to the amount of the aggregate expenses and write-downs in relation to the participation deducted during the year of realisation of the exempt capital gain and in previous years.
The purpose of the system is to avoid a taxation vacuum, which would be the result if the deductibility of expenses and write-downs connected to the participation was allowed, while the income arising from the participation is tax exempt. This system should, in principle, remain tax neutral, as the company should have available carry-forward losses for an equivalent amount resulting from the aforementioned deductions (unless previously used to offset other taxable income).
### Taxation of non-resident corporate investors on gains upon disposal of shares
In case a non-resident corporate investor derives income from the disposal of an important participation (i.e. representing at least 10% of the share capital) in a Luxembourg company within six months of its acquisition, said capital gain will be subject to CIT in Luxembourg unless a tax treaty provides otherwise.
Non-resident investors are not subject to the aforementioned capital gains tax upon disposal of shares in a Luxembourg _Société d'Investissement à Capital Variable_ (SICAV), _Société d’Investissement en Capital à Risque_ (SICAR), and _Société de gestion de Patrimoine Familial_ (SPF).
## Interest income
Under Luxembourg accounting and tax principles, interest income is recognised on an accrual basis and is fully subject to CIT and municipal business tax.
## Royalty income
As a matter of principle, royalty income and expenses derived from intellectual property (IP) assets are subject to the standard tax regime (i.e. CIT and municipal business tax) and rates. _For additional details, see Intellectual property (IP) regime in the section_.
## Transparent entities
From a Luxembourg tax perspective, save for the application of reverse hybrid rules ( see ), a transparent entity is seen as having no legal personality distinct from that of its partners (those transparent entities are commonly referred to as ‘partnerships’) for CIT and NWT purposes, although it may be regarded as a separate legal entity from a civil/corporate law point of view. Provided that the partnership carries out a commercial activity, it may be liable to municipal business tax on its own.
## Foreign income
A Luxembourg tax resident company is liable for CIT on its worldwide income. Foreign-source income is therefore taxable in Luxembourg, unless a DTT provides for an exemption.
Dividends from foreign subsidiaries are taxed when received, except when exempt as mentioned above under the participation exemption regime or by application of the relevant DTT (under certain conditions, the exemption method applies in many DTTs of Luxembourg). Profits of a foreign branch that are not exempt by means of a DTT may benefit from a foreign tax credit. Any foreign taxes paid in excess of the tax credit are deductible as expenses. Luxembourg is using the exemption method in most of its DTTs.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
Luxembourg taxes its corporate residents on their worldwide income and non-residents only on Luxembourg-source income.
Until tax year 2024 (included), businesses with taxable income lower than EUR 175,000 are subject to corporate income tax (CIT) at a rate of 15%. Businesses with taxable income between EUR 175,000 and EUR 200,001 are subject to CIT computed as follows: EUR 26,250 plus 31% of the tax base above EUR 175,000. The CIT rate is 17% for companies with taxable income in excess of EUR 200,000 leading to an overall tax rate of 24.94% in Luxembourg City (taking into account the solidarity surtax of 7% on the CIT rate and including the applicable 6.75% municipal business tax rate).
As from tax year 2025, business with taxable income lower than EUR 175,000 are subject to corporate income tax (CIT) at a rate of 14 %. Businesses with taxable income between EUR 175,000 and EUR 200,001 are subject to CIT computed as follows: EUR 24,500 plus 30 % of the tax base above EUR 175,000. The CIT rate is 16 % for companies with taxable income in excess of EUR 200,000 leading to an overall tax rate of 23,87 % in Luxembourg City (taking into account the solidarity surtax of 7 % on the CIT rate and including the applicable 6.75 % municipal business tax rate).
The CIT does not apply to tax-transparent entities (e.g. general or limited partnerships or European Economic Interest Groupings) unless they are subject to the reverse-hybrid rules.
Although there used to be a minimum CIT for Luxembourg resident companies, no such minimum CIT is applicable as of 2016. It has been replaced by a minimum net wealth tax (_see Net wealth tax [NWT] in the section_).
## Solidarity surtax
A 7% solidarity surtax is imposed on the CIT amount.
As from tax year 2025, taking into account the solidarity surtax, the aggregate CIT rate is 17.12% for companies with taxable income in excess of EUR 200,000.
## Municipal business tax on income
Municipal business tax is levied by the communes and varies from municipality to municipality. The municipal business tax for Luxembourg City is 6.75%.
As from tax year 2025, the effective combined CIT rate (i.e. CIT, solidarity surtax, and municipal business tax) for Luxembourg City is 23.87%.


# Luxembourg
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
Supplies of goods and services, which are deemed to take place in Luxembourg, are subject to VAT at the standard rate of 17% (lowest standard VAT rate in the European Union) or, on certain transactions, at 14% (e.g. certain wines, advertising pamphlets, management and safekeeping of securities), 8% (e.g. supply of gas or electricity), or 3% (e.g. food [except most alcohol beverages]; pharmaceutical products; books [including e-books since the Circular n°793 released by the Luxembourg VAT authorities of 17 May 2019]; radio and television broadcasting services [except adult entertainment]; shoes, accessories, and clothes designed for children under the age of 14). 
Banking, financial, insurance, and reinsurance transactions are generally exempt activities. The VAT paid on costs that have a direct and immediate link with these transactions cannot be recovered except when related to services performed for persons established outside the European Union. Other VAT-exempt transactions, such as exports and related transports, allow the supplier to recover input VAT on related costs.
Luxembourg resident taxable persons are, in principle, required to be registered for VAT. However, taxable persons carrying on exclusively VAT-exempt activities and who do not have any right to recover input VAT are not required to register for VAT unless they are liable to self-assess VAT on good/services required from abroad. If so, they may be subject to simplified VAT compliance obligations.
Taxpayers whose activities are subject to VAT are entitled to offset against their VAT payable the amount of such tax charged to them by their suppliers or self-accounted by them on import or acquisitions of goods or services from abroad.
### VAT returns and compliance
VAT returns must, in principle, be filed on a monthly basis (as well as a recapitulative annual return). Derogations may be obtained to file quarterly or only annual VAT returns, subject to certain conditions (level of turnover or incoming transactions subject to VAT and level of purchases of goods and services on which Luxembourg VAT must be self-accounted for).
An obligation to provide a Standard Audit File for Tax (SAF-T), containing reliable accounting data, has been implemented by the VAT authorities. In Luxembourg, the SAF-T equivalent is referred to as FAIA (_Fichier d’Audit Informatisé de l’Administration de l’Enregistrement, des Domaines et de la TVA_). This specific .xml file is used by taxable persons to make information available to Luxembourg VAT authorities during a VAT audit. Only specific taxable persons (subject to the Luxembourg Standard Chart of Accounts) having a certain minimum number of transactions (+/- 500) and registered under a 'normal filing regime' with a turnover exceeding EUR 112,000 are currently concerned. On the other hand, some entities (i.e. banks and insurance companies) are not yet subject to these SAF-T obligations, although they may be required to provide all VAT-relevant data to the authorities in a structured electronic file.
Penalties and late interest may be imposed by the VAT authorities in case of infringements to the VAT legislation. Furthermore, aggravated tax fraud (_fraude fiscale aggravée_) and tax swindle (_escroquerie fiscale_) can be punished with imprisonment.
### Luxembourg VAT particularities
  * A VAT grouping regime has been implemented in the Luxembourg VAT legislation in the summer 2018. Such regime allows any company established in Luxembourg (and Luxembourg fixed establishments of foreign companies) having financial, economic, and organisational links to be seen as a single VAT person. This regime is optional. Transactions between group members are disregarded for VAT purposes, and only the VAT returns of the group must be submitted (no individual VAT returns for the members) by the group representative.
  * Article 80 of the EU VAT Directive has also been implemented in the Luxembourg VAT legislation in the summer 2018. This provision aims at avoiding VAT loss for member states in specific situations where the sale or purchase price of a supply has been overestimated or underestimated between related parties. This provision allows member states to disregard the consideration agreed between related parties, to retain the open market value of that supply.
  * Managing directors, managers of companies (established and/or VAT registered in Luxembourg), as well as ‘de jure’ and ‘de facto’ managers in charge of the daily management of such companies, can be held jointly and personally liable in the event of breach of VAT compliance obligations and/or non-payment of the VAT due by the taxpayer they manage.


## Customs duties/import tariffs
Based on a European Regulation, goods entering within the territory of the European Union may be subject to customs duties/import tariffs. Applicable rates are based on the nature and on the quantity of the products.
## Excise duties
In addition to VAT, some products are subject to specific excise duties. In Luxembourg, these products are electricity, mineral oils, manufactured tobacco, and alcohol.
Excise duties are not based on the sale price of the products but on the quantity. Excise duty becomes chargeable at the time, and in the EU member state, of release for consumption. Release for consumption occurs in any of the following instances:
  * The departure of excise goods from a duty suspension arrangement.
  * The holding of excise goods outside a duty suspension arrangement where excise duty has not been levied, pursuant to the applicable provisions of Community law and national legislation.
  * The production of excise goods outside a duty suspension arrangement.
  * The importation of excise goods, including irregular importation, unless the excise goods are placed, immediately upon importation, under a duty suspension arrangement.


## Stamp taxes
There is no stamp duty in Luxembourg.
## Environment taxes
There are no environment taxes applicable to Luxembourg entities. 
## Net wealth tax (NWT)
### NWT regime
Both Luxembourg resident companies and Luxembourg branches of non-resident companies are subject to NWT on their net wealth as at 1 January, based on prescribed valuation methods. The following scale of rates applies for NWT:
  * On a taxable base of up to EUR 500 million: 0.5%.
  * On the taxable base exceeding EUR 500 million: NWT of EUR 2.5 million, plus 0.05% on the component of the NWT base above EUR 500 million. No cap is set.


In general, assets are to be taken into account at market value (except for real estate, which is subject to a special regime). Shareholdings qualifying for the participation exemption generally are exempt from NWT (_see Dividend income in the section_).
### Minimum NWT
A minimum NWT charge applies for all corporate entities having their statutory seat or central administration in Luxembourg.
Until tax year 2024 (included), entities with aggregated fixed financial assets, transferable securities, inter-company receivables, and cash in excess of both 90% of their total gross assets and EUR 350,000 are subject to a minimum NWT charge of EUR 4,815.
All other corporations with a statutory seat or central administration in Luxembourg (including securitisation vehicles, _Société d'Investissement en Capital à Risque_ [SICARs], _Société d’Epargne-Pension à Capital Variable_ [SEPCAVs], and _Association d’Epargne-Pension_ [ASSEPs]) will be subject to a minimum NWT charge ranging from EUR 535 to EUR 32,100, depending on company’s total gross assets, as follows:
Total gross assets (EUR) | Minimum NWT charge (EUR)  
---|---  
Up to 350,000 | 535  
350,001 to 2,000,000 | 1,605  
2,000,001 to 10,000,000 | 5,350  
10,000,001 to 15,000,000 | 10,700  
15,000,001 to 20,000,000 | 16,050  
20,000,001 to 30,000,000 | 21,400  
30,000,001 and above | 32,100  
On 10 November 2023, the Luxembourg constitutional court ruled that the Luxembourg minimum NWT regime is partly unconstitutional as it leads to a discriminatory situation amongst certain taxpayers in a similar situation. The decision of the constitutional court only has an impact on taxpayers whose total balance sheet is comprised between EUR 350,000 and EUR 2,000,000 and who have aggregated fixed financial assets, transferable securities, inter-company receivables, and cash in excess of 90% of their total balance sheet.
As from tax year 2025, the minimum NWT amounts to:
  * EUR 535 for a balance sheet total up to and including EUR 350,000.
  * EUR 1,605 for a balance sheet total exceeding EUR 350,000 up to and including EUR 2 million.
  * EUR 4,815 for a balance sheet total exceeding EUR 2 million.


The legislation makes it clear that the balance sheet to be used for these purposes is the closing balance sheet for the tax year concerned that is in conformity with all CIT provisions. Consequently, all figures to be used are those as shown in the commercial balance sheet, subject only to any specific revaluations necessary to apply CIT provisions.
In particular, shareholdings that qualify for the participation exemption and Luxembourg-situs real estate must both be included in gross assets for these purposes. Conversely, foreign-situs real estate and other assets, such as those of a foreign branch, the income from which is excluded from the Luxembourg tax base under the provisions of a DTT, are not to be included in gross assets.
### Automatic reduction of the minimum NWT 
The above minimum NWT of year N is reduced automatically by the amount of CIT due in year N-1, after tax credits. If the CIT due in year N-1 is higher than the minimum NWT, no minimum NWT is due (as full reduction of the minimum NWT). If the CIT due in year N-1 is lower than the minimum NWT and cannot fully offset the minimum NWT, this reduced minimum NWT may not be further reduced through the creation of a NWT reserve. 
### NWT reduction through an NWT reserve 
The NWT of a given year may be also reduced through the creation of a special reserve. 
The NWT reduction for year N (e.g. 2024) has to be requested in the corporate tax returns of year N-1 (e.g. 2023). The NWT special reserve of year N should be kept during the five-year period following the NWT reduction request (i.e. years N, N+1, N+2, N+3, and N+4). After the five-year period (i.e. as from year N+5), the NWT reserve of year N is released and can be either distributed to the shareholders or used to constitute a new NWT reserve.
The CIT due in a given year N-1 (e.g. 2023) represents the limit for the NWT reduction for the following year N (e.g. 2024). The CIT to be taken into consideration for the limit of NWT reduction is the amount due, including the employment fund contribution, before any tax credits. As a second limit, the NWT reduction is limited by the minimum NWT. This NWT reserve may have the effect to reduce the NWT due down to zero unless the specific case referred to above where this is a residual minimum NWT. 
## Subscription tax
Investment funds are subject to subscription tax (at various rates) on their total net assets valued at the last day of each quarter. Institutional funds and monetary funds are subject to an annual rate of 0.01% and the other funds to an annual rate of 0.05%. Funds of institutional funds and monetary institutional funds are exempt from subscription tax.
However, a graduated rate reduction applies as of 1 January 2021 for fund vehicles covered by the law of 17 December 2010 relating to the undertakings for collective investments (Part I and Part II of the 2010 Undertakings for Collective Investment [UCI] regime) that invest in 'sustainable' investments, tabulated as follows:
Percentage of net assets of the fund or compartment invested in 'sustainable' assets | Subscription tax rate (annualised) applicable to element of net assets that are 'sustainable' (%)   
---|---  
Over 5% | 0.04  
Over 20% | 0.03  
Over 35% | 0.02  
Over 50% | 0.01  
'Sustainable' assets are those as defined in Art. 3 EU Regulation 2020/852. Investment level percentages will need to be formally certified by an auditor and transmitted to the indirect tax authorities (i.e. Administration de l’Enregistrement, des Domaines et de la TVA) together with the subscription tax returns.
Exemptions from subscription tax are available for exchange traded funds ("ETF") and their compartments, and an extension of exemption is available for funds dedicated to multi-employer pension vehicles or to several employers providing pension benefits to their employees. An exemption has also been introduced for listed Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities ("UCITS ETF") as from 2025.
Where a foreign UCI is managed by a Luxembourg-based management company (or where the foreign UCI’s place of effective management is located in Luxembourg), the UCI will not be deemed to be domiciled in Luxembourg and therefore not be subject to subscription tax in Luxembourg.
## General registration taxes
A fixed registration duty of EUR 75 is levied on certain transactions involving Luxembourg legal entities (i.e. incorporation, amendment to the articles of association, and transfer of seat to Luxembourg).
### Real estate transactions
The sale or transfer of immovable property located in Luxembourg is subject to a proportional registration duty (inclusive of the transcription tax) of 7% (plus a city surtax of 3% if the building is located in Luxembourg City).
Contributions of immovable property located in Luxembourg in exchange for securities are subject to a proportional registration duty (inclusive of the transcription tax) of 3.2% (plus a city surtax of 0.3% if the building is located in Luxembourg City).
Contributions of immovable property located in Luxembourg in exchange for other than by shares are subject to a proportional registration duty (inclusive of the transcription tax) of 7% (plus a city surtax of 3% if the building is located in Luxembourg City).
The contribution of immovable property in the context of restructuring transactions are not subject to proportional registration duty if some conditions are met.
Rental agreements are not subject to any registration obligation, with the exception of long-term leasing agreements. Parties still have the possibility to register lease agreements voluntarily, notably to determine the date of an agreement for civil law purpose, or make them enforceable against third parties. If the rental agreement is voluntarily registered, registration duty at 0.6% would remain due, unless a valid VAT option has been duly approved by the Luxembourg VAT authorities. In that case, only the fixed registration duty of EUR 75 will apply.
## Commune (municipalities) real estate tax
Communes (municipalities) levy an annual real estate tax, the basis of which is the unitary value of real estate, which represents its estimated value in 1941. The basic rate varies from 0.7% to 1% of the unitary value, according to the category of property, and is multiplied by a coefficient, which varies with communes and different types of property. For commercial property, the coefficient in Luxembourg City is 750%, which should be applied to 1% of the unitary value. The real estate tax is deductible for CIT purposes.
Note that Bill 8082, released by the Luxembourg government in October 2022, proposes a long-awaited revamp of the Luxembourg property tax. The draft Bill provides that property tax will remain a communal tax, the rate of which can be set by each commune within a range of 9% to 11%. However, in an opinion issued on 13 June 2024, the Council of State raised a series of formal objections to the draft bill which would need further amendments.
## Real estate levy for Luxembourg funds owning Luxembourg real estate directly 
The 2021 Budget Law introduced a new tax, termed a real estate levy (_prélèvement immobilier_), which applies only in the restricted circumstances of a Luxembourg investment fund vehicle that:
  * is regulated under the 2007 specialised investment fund (SIF) regime, or the 2016 reserved alternative investment fund (RAIF) regime, or Part II of the 2010 UCI regime
  * has its own legal persona, unless it has adopted the legal form of a _société en commandite_ simple (SCS), the combined effect of which is to place the FCP, SCSp, and SCS legal forms all outside the scope of this new levy (this is appropriate because investors in fund vehicles having these legal forms are for tax purposes to be treated as having direct ownership of any underlying real estate owned directly in the name of the fund vehicle, and thus be immediately taxable on the income and gains derived from such real estate, and so not having to be brought within the scope of any anti-avoidance measures)
  * owns directly (or indirectly through one or more entities that are regarded as tax transparent under Luxembourg principles) real estate assets, and
  * where such assets are located in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.


Luxembourg real estate owned by any Luxembourg tax-opaque corporate (i.e. fully taxable) entity, which is in turn owned by the fund vehicle concerned (i.e. whilst there is indirect ownership), falls entirely outside the scope of this provision.
Fund vehicles that are within scope will incur the real estate levy by derogation from the more general provisions that exempt the income of the various types of regulated fund vehicles noted above. The real estate levy is to apply on or after 1 January 2021 and is charged at a rate of 20% on :
  * the gross (but VAT-exclusive) amount of rental income deriving (directly or through tax transparent entities) from Luxembourg real estate assets, and
  * the net amount of gains on disposal deriving from such assets (directly or through tax transparent entities, either on disposal of the real asset by a transparent entity or disposal of the interest in the tax transparent entity owning the Luxembourg real estate)


On 20 January 2022, the Luxembourg tax authorities issued an administrative circular providing guidance on application of the new real estate levy introduced by the 2021 Budget Law, _inter alia_ clarifying related new filing obligations imposed on the Luxembourg investment vehicles in scope. The circular does not contain any major new clarifications but specifies the related filing obligations that Luxembourg vehicles might be subject to.
Real estate levy due on income or gains arising or realised in a calendar year must be reported to the tax authorities no later than 31 May of the following calendar year, and the levy due must be paid no later than 10 June of the following calendar year. A real estate levy return (ACD - _Prélèvement immobilier: Déclaration pour le prélèvement immobilier_) must be filed via MyGuichet.lu and must be accompanied by an auditor’s certificate confirming that the amount being subject to the levy is computed in accordance with the provisions of the legislation. The return shall include the following information: 
  * Amount of income generated by the Luxembourg-based real estate subject to real estate levy.
  * Breakdown of the income per real estate asset.
  * Amount of the real estate levy.


The real estate levy return can be filed by a representative of the Luxembourg investment vehicle.
## Payroll taxes
Payroll taxes have to be withheld by the employer. The top payroll tax withholding rate is 42%. A solidarity tax of a maximum of 9% of tax must also be applied.
## Social security contributions
Compulsory social security contributions for employees are listed below:
  * For sickness: 2.80% of gross periodic remuneration, which is limited to a monthly ceiling of EUR 12,854.64 (annual ceiling estimated at EUR 154,255.68 as of 1 January 2024).
  * For pension: 8% of gross remuneration, which is limited to a monthly ceiling of EUR 12,854.64 (annual ceiling estimated at EUR 154,255.68 as of 1 January 2024).


The social security contributions have to be withheld by the employer from the employee's gross salary.
Certain multilateral and bilateral social security agreements protect the interests of temporarily resident employees.
Employees (residents and non-residents) paying Luxembourg social security contributions are subject to the so-called dependency contribution on their gross professional income, reduced by EUR 642.73 per month (i.e. annual relief estimated at EUR 7,712.76 as of 1 January 2024). Net portfolio income and taxable capital gains of Luxembourg resident taxpayers are also subject to the dependency contribution, except for interest within the scope of the 20% withholding tax (WHT) in full discharge of income tax. The dependency contribution rate amounts to 1.4% (flat rate).
