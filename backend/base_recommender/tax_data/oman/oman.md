# Oman
## Overview
Last reviewed - 01 January 2025
Oman, an Arab country located on the southeast coast of the Arabian Peninsula, is bordered by the United Arab Emirates to the northwest, Saudi Arabia to the west, and Yemen to the southwest. Oman is divided into five regions and four governorates, with Muscat as the capital. The official language of Oman is Arabic, and the currency is the Omani Rial (OMR).
Oman has a middle-income economy that is heavily dependent on dwindling oil resources. As a result of declining reserves, Oman actively pursues a development plan that focuses on diversification, industrialisation, and privatisation, with the objective of reducing the oil sector's contribution to gross domestic product (GDP).
In 2016, the Tanfeedh initiative was enacted with the focus of enhancing economic diversification within the Sultanate and sustaining participation between the public and private sectors. The key components of the government's diversification strategy under the Tanfeedh initiatives are manufacturing, tourism, transport, logistics, mining, and fisheries.
With 100% foreign ownership now available to foreign investors in multiple sectors, Oman has also been attracting a large amount of foreign investment. The government has outlined initiatives to modernise the local economy and privatise state utilities. A significant increase in government spending and foreign direct investment has led to the development of the following sectors:
  * Oil and gas: Oil and gas activities continue to dominate the economic performance of Oman.
  * Construction and infrastructure: As a result of large-scale public and private investment in infrastructure and industrial development, tourism, and commercial property projects, output in the construction sector has significantly grown. The government also intends to attract high-technology investors to free zones being developed in Duqm, Muscat, Sohar, and Salalah, as well as other developed free zones.
  * Real estate and tourism: As with other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, Oman has seen a number of significant developments in the real estate and tourism sector, including the establishment of several integrated tourism complexes (ITC projects) and an increase in the number of tourism-related projects (e.g. golf courses and hotels).
