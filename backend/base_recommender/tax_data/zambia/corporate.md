## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
Following the 2024 Budget announcements, below are some of the amendments to the tax legislations in Zambia with effect from 1 January 2024:
## Corporate income tax (CIT)
Certain legislative amendments are designed to stimulate economic growth, foster rural development, and streamline tax compliance mechanisms. The key changes and their implications for stakeholders are as follows:
  * The government has introduced significant tax concessions to invigorate the cotton value chain. These incentives include:


    * A 0% tax rate for cotton seed producers during their initial five years of operation, fostering early-stage growth and sustainability.
    * A similar 0% income tax on profits derived from the spinning and weaving of cotton for the first ten years of operation, incentivising investment in these critical value chain segments.


  * Developers operating within Multi-Facility Economic Zones (MFEZs) will benefit from enhanced capital allowances, with the introduction of accelerated depreciation at a full 100% on new implements, plant, and machinery, thereby reducing taxable income and encouraging modernisation.
  * The definition of ’rural enterprise‘ has been expanded, now encompassing all enterprises situated in rural areas of Zambia, with the exception of those engaged in mining or mineral processing. This broadened definition aims to: 


    * encourage diverse economic activities in rural areas and
    * provide a more inclusive framework for rural development incentives.


  * In a move towards fiscal modernisation, the government has:


    * replaced the term ‘electronic fiscal devices’ (EFDs) with ‘electronic invoicing system’ (EIS), reflecting the transition to more advanced, paperless invoicing solutions, and
    * exempted certain entities from the mandatory use of EIS, recognising the impracticality in specific scenarios.


  * The amendments have streamlined taxpayer obligations by:


    * eliminating the requirement to notify the Commissioner-General within 30 days of first income receipt and
    * introducing a mandate for taxpayers to obtain a TaxPayer Identification Number (TPIN) and register for relevant taxes within 30 days of earning taxable income.


  * The definition of an ‘approved pension fund’ has been refined to specify that approval for pension funds will be administered by the Pensions and Insurance Authority (PIA) rather than the Commissioner-General, delineating regulatory responsibilities.


  * A new requirement has been instituted for large and specialised taxpayers to support their tax returns with audited financial statements, enhancing transparency and accountability.
  * The amendments have also introduced:


    * An increase in tax relief for the initial five years for businesses in rural areas, excluding the mining sector, to promote rural enterprise development.
    * Specific penalties for incorrect declarations in artisanal mining, scaled by the severity of the infraction, with rates set at 1.5% for negligence, 3% for wilful default, and 4.5% for fraud, thereby reinforcing compliance.


These legislative changes represent a concerted effort to support key economic sectors while ensuring tax compliance and governance. Stakeholders are encouraged to familiarise themselves with these amendments to fully leverage the benefits and comply with the new requirements.
## Withholding tax (WHT)
### Introduction of WHT on deemed interest from government securities
The recent legislative amendment has introduced the imposition of a WHT at a rate of 15% on the income derived from discount on government securities, with the exception of treasury bills. This tax pertains to the deemed interest that accrues from such financial instruments. The deemed interest is essentially the difference between the purchase price and the face value of the security, which is realised by the holder at maturity.
The introduction of a 15% WHT on deemed interest from government securities, other than treasury bills, marks a significant shift in the taxation of income from these instruments. Investors and stakeholders must take cognisance of this change and its implications on investment yields and tax obligations. Proactive measures, including a review of investment strategies and compliance frameworks, are essential to navigate this change in the fiscal environment effectively.
## Value-added tax (VAT)
### Introduction of electronic invoicing system (EIS)
The modernisation of VAT administration is set to advance with the introduction of an EIS. This initiative is poised to streamline the process of issuing and managing invoices, thereby improving compliance and efficiency. The system is designed to facilitate real-time tracking of transactions and ensure the accuracy of tax records.
There is an amendment to remove the mention of ‘electronic fiscal devices’ from both the VAT and Insurance Premium Levy Acts. This change reflects the transition towards more sophisticated digital solutions and the phasing out of outdated technologies.
### Legislative amendments to support digital taxation
To align with technological advancements, Section 2 of the VAT Act has been amended to incorporate definitions that will underpin the taxation framework for both local and international electronic services. The inclusion of these definitions is critical to establishing a clear legal basis for the taxation of digital transactions and the operation of the EIS.
### Special provisions for mining companies
There is an amendment to Section 42 of the VAT Act, which permits mining companies to maintain their financial records in United States dollars (USD). This provision, however, is contingent upon the stipulation that a minimum of 75% of the company's mining revenue is generated from external markets in the form of foreign exchange. This amendment acknowledges the global nature of the mining industry and the need for a fiscal framework that accommodates international transactions.
### Invoicing system compliance for input tax claims
The VAT Act is amended to include a reference to an approved invoicing system as a prerequisite for claiming input tax. This measure is intended to ensure that only those taxpayers who comply with the mandated EIS can benefit from input tax deductions. It serves as an incentive for taxpayers to adopt the new system and reinforces the government's commitment to modernising tax administration.
These amendments represent a significant step towards enhancing the VAT framework to better suit the evolving digital economy and international business practices. The adoption of an EIS, coupled with the necessary legislative updates, will position the tax system to be more effective, transparent, and adaptable to future innovations.
## Customs and excise duties
The government has implemented a series of strategic amendments to customs and excise duties aimed at fostering sustainable development. These amendments are as follows:
### Electric vehicles and accessories
A suspension of customs duty is now in effect for electric motor vehicles intended for the transportation of individuals, including electric buses and trucks. Additionally, this suspension extends to accessories pertinent to electric vehicles, such as charging systems, reflecting a commitment to environmental sustainability and the promotion of clean energy solutions.
### Educational support through technology
Recognising the pivotal role of technology in education, the government has suspended excise duty on Internet services provided to higher education institutions. This exemption applies to institutions that are either government-owned or owned by local authorities and are financed through public funds, thereby supporting the advancement of digital learning platforms and resources.
### Excise duty rate reductions
In a move to recalibrate the taxation of alcohol products, the excise duty rate on ethyl alcohol and other spirits, which have an alcoholic strength of less than 80%, has been reduced from 125% to 60%. This reduction is anticipated to have various economic implications, including potential shifts in consumer behaviour and market dynamics.
### Introduction of new levies and duty increases
A new levy has been introduced on person-to-person mobile money transfers. This measure is part of a broader strategy to modernise the fiscal framework and capture value from the burgeoning digital economy.
There has been an increase in customs duty on all imported electrical panels, including distribution boxes, from 15% to 25%. This adjustment specifically targets boards, panels, and other bases utilised for electric control or the distribution of electricity.
The excise duty rates on a range of processed and unprocessed tobacco products have been increased from 361 to 400 Zambian kwacha (ZMW) per mille. This increment aligns with public health objectives and reflects the government's approach to discouraging the consumption of tobacco products through fiscal policy.
### Legislative updates
Amendments to the provisions of the Customs and Excise Duty Act now incorporate a chargeable offence for the unauthorised use of the customs seal. This update underscores the importance of compliance with customs regulations and the protection of revenue through the enforcement of proper seal usage.
These fiscal policy changes are designed to balance economic growth with social responsibility, reflecting a nuanced approach to taxation and regulatory adjustments. Stakeholders are advised to review these changes comprehensively to understand their implications and ensure compliance with the updated legal framework.
## Transfer pricing
A requirement is introduced for taxpayers to obtain authorisation from the Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) prior to employing transfer pricing methods not explicitly prescribed by the Commissioner-General. This measure ensures adherence to standardised practices and enhances compliance oversight.
The definitions of key terms, including ‘surrogate parent entity’, ‘reporting entity’, and ‘reporting fiscal year’, have been refined. These changes are designed to harmonise domestic regulations with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Transfer Pricing Guidelines, thereby promoting international consistency and reducing the risk of tax disputes.

## Taxable period
CIT is determined by reference to a charge year, being the period of 12 months ending on 31 December.
## Tax returns and payment of tax
The CIT rules require taxpayers to submit provisional tax returns in the first quarter of each charge year. Where there is a change in forecast, a revised return may be submitted at the end of either the second, third, or fourth quarters of the charge year. Provisional tax payments are required to be made quarterly. The provisional tax liabilities must be based on the estimated taxable income for the current charge year.
The quarterly returns for the 2024 tax charge year are due as follows:
  * 1st quarter return due 31 March 2024 (or 5 March 2024 if submitted manually).
  * 2nd quarter return due on 30 June 2024.
  * 3rd quarter return due on 30 September 2024.
  * 4th quarter return due on 31 December 2024.


By concession, the ZRA allows a 10-day grace period for the payment of taxes. Accordingly, each quarterly payment can be made on the 10th day of the month following the end of each quarter.
The final tax return needs to be submitted by 21 June following the end of the tax year. This must be accompanied by any balance of tax that remains unpaid. For example, the final tax return for the 2023 tax charge year is due for submission by 21 June 2024.
In the case of a manually filed tax return, the tax return needs to be submitted by 5 June following the end of the tax year. For example, the final tax return for the 2023 tax charge year, if submitted manually, is due for submission by 5 June 2024.
## Tax audit process
The Commissioner-General of the ZRA has wide powers to require any person to attend to be examined at a time and place specified by notice, where it is determined that person is able to impart information necessary for the purposes of the Income Tax Act.
Furthermore, the Income Tax Act empowers the Commissioner General of the ZRA to access any type of information required for tax purposes held by legal practitioners, accountants, and financial institutions.
## Statute of limitations
The Income Tax Act provides that an assessment shall not be made for a charge year after six years from the end of that charge year. In cases of fraud or wilful default, the assessment period may be extended to periods exceeding six years. With respect to transfer pricing, the assessment period covers up to ten years.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The ZRA is devoting a significant amount of time to transfer pricing audits, and there is expected to be an increasing scrutiny.
In addition to the above, the ZRA has placed significant emphasis on enforcement of tax laws and audits across all tax types. This includes desktop audits and detailed on site audits, as well as taxpayer account reconciliations.
## General Anti-Avoidance Rules (GAAR)
GAAR applies to transactions that understate taxable income or overstate non-deductible expenses in Zambia.


# Zambia
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
In Zambia, a corporate entity is considered a resident for tax purposes if it meets any of the following criteria:
  * The entity is incorporated or established under Zambian law.
  * The entity's effective management is situated in Zambia during a charge year.


Entities meeting these conditions are subject to Zambian tax regulations for the relevant charge year.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
In Zambia, the concept of PE is pivotal for non-resident entities to understand their tax obligations. A non-resident may be deemed to have a Zambian PE if it operates through a fixed place of business within the country or engages a dependent agent authorised to conclude contracts on its behalf.
The domestic definition aligns closely with the OECD Model Tax Convention, detailing both inclusive and exclusive activities for a fixed place of business. Notably, the provision of services, including consultancy, by a non-resident enterprise via employees or personnel for more than 90 days within a 12-month period triggers PE status.
It is crucial to consider applicable double tax treaties (DTTs), as they may change the PE definition and take precedence over domestic law.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
Deductible expenses must be non-capital in nature and incurred wholly and exclusively for business purposes. Specific provisions, such as for bad debts, are deductible subject to the Commissioner - General's approval.
## Depreciation and amortisation 
While accounting depreciation and amortisation are not deductible, a 'capital allowance' is available for qualifying capital assets used in business operations.
Zambia has a system of capital allowances that provides for wear and tear deductions in ascertaining business income. These are calculated at annual rates on qualifying capital expenditure, which currently apply as follows:
Category of qualifying expenditure | Rate of allowance (calculated on a straight-line basis)  
---|---  
Industrial buildings | Investment allowance of 10% *  
Initial allowance of 10% *  
Annual wear and tear allowance of 5% *  
Other commercial buildings | Annual wear and tear allowance of 2%  
Implements, machinery, and plant - farming and agro-processing | Annual wear and tear allowance of 100%  
Implements, machinery, and plant - for persons operating in priority sector and a developer in a special economic zone | Annual wear and tear allowance of 100%  
Implements, machinery, and plant - manufacturing, tourism, generation of electricity, and leasing | Annual wear and tear allowance of 50%  
Implements, machinery and plant - other | Annual wear and tear allowance of 25%  
Commercial vehicles | Annual wear and tear allowance of 25%  
Non-commercial vehicles | Annual wear and tear allowance of 20%  
Patents, designs, trademarks, and copyrights | Premium allowance on straight-line basis over the life of period for which the right is granted  
Mining expenditure (only available for assets brought into use) | Mining deductions of 20%  
Farm improvements | Farm improvement allowance of 100%  
* For industrial buildings, the investment allowance and the initial allowance can both be claimed in the year in which the building is put into use, together with the wear and tear allowance for that year.
Goodwill is non-deductible due to its capital nature.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses are deductible if incurred within 18 months prior to business commencement and would have been deductible post-commencement.
## Interest expenses
  * Deductibility of interest is capped at 30% of tax earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA), with exceptions for turnover tax system businesses and those under the Banking and Financial Services Act.
  * Unrelieved interest can be carried forward for five years, or ten years for electricity generation and mining entities, subject to conditions.
  * Deductibility of interest is contingent on the loan being for business purposes and compliance with the arm's-length principle.


## Bad debt
  * Specific bad debts are deductible upon meeting certain criteria.
  * Provisions for general bad debts are not deductible unless actual loss occurs.
  * Banks and financial institutions face limitations on deductions for bad debt provisions.


## Charitable contributions
Deductible payments to approved public benefit organisations are capped at 15% of assessable income.
## Pension expenses
  * Contributions to approved funds are deductible, with special rules for lump sum and arrears payments.
  * Payments to non-approved funds are non-deductible.
  * Pensions approved under the Pension Scheme Regulations Act are tax-exempt from 1 January 2023.


## Payments to directors
Payments to directors are deductible if incurred wholly for business purposes, barring domestic or personal expenses.
## Research and development (R&D) expenses
  * Revenue expenditure on business-related experiments or research is deductible.
  * Contributions to certain societies or institutions for industrial research or scientific work connected with the business are deductible.
  * Capital expenditure on research is non-deductible but may qualify for capital allowances.


## Bribes, kickbacks, and illegal payments
Bribes, kickbacks, and illegal payments are non-deductible.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties, including those under the Income Tax Act, are non-deductible unless incurred wholly for business purposes.
## Taxes
Zambian CIT is not deductible. Other tax liabilities suffered may be deductible, provided they are revenue expenses and wholly and exclusively incurred for the purposes of the business (or other source of income). _See the_ _section regarding credits for non-Zambian tax suffered on non-Zambian source income._
## Other significant items
### Allowable deductions
  * Costs for establishing and administering approved share option schemes.
  * Technical education expenses.
  * SDL payments.
  * A ZMW 2,000 fixed deduction for employing individuals with disabilities.
  * Profits from local cassava, mango, and pineapple cultivation.


### Non-allowable deductions
  * Recoverable losses or expenses from insurance or indemnity.
  * Expenditure on entertainment, hospitality, or gifts.
  * Provisions for contingent employee costs not paid within the charge year.
  * Benefits in kind, such as car use and accommodation, are taxable on the employer. If accommodation is provided at below-market rates without a housing allowance, 30% of the employee's total taxable emoluments is disallowed in the employer's tax computation. However, if an independent valuation of the accommodation is obtained, the disallowed amount is the rental valuation figure. For employer-leased housing provided to employees, the rental value is taxed under PAYE. If multiple employees occupy the housing, the benefit is taxed on the employer by disallowing the rental expense.


## Net operating losses
  * Losses can be carried forward for five years, or ten years for mining and certain power generation operations.
  * Loss carryforward for mining operations is capped at 50% of taxable income.
  * Losses cannot be carried back or set against income from different sources.


## Payments to foreign affiliates
  * Loans to effective shareholders may trigger tax liabilities under General Anti-Avoidance Rules (GAAR).
  * Transfer pricing rules require arm's-length transaction terms between associated persons.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
There are no consolidated CIT returns for groups.
Losses in one group company cannot offset profits in another.
## Transfer pricing
Transactions must be at arm's-length. Non-compliance can lead to income adjustments and avoidance penalties.
Companies must maintain transfer pricing documentation for ten years.
Non-compliance penalties can reach ZMW 24 million.
## International compliance
From 2021, multinationals with revenues over ZMW 4,795 million must submit Country-by-Country (CbC) Reports within 12 months post-financial year.
Zambia joined the OECD Global Forum to combat tax evasion and enhance financial transparency, committing to EOIR and AEOI standards.
## Thin capitalisation
Interest deductibility is limited to 30% of tax EBITDA, excluding turnover tax system businesses and those under the Banking and Financial Services Act.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Zambia does not have a CFC regime.


# Zambia
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
Zambia's tax system determines branch profits based on the branch's functions, assets, and risks within the country. To ascertain the profits attributable to a branch, a transfer pricing benchmarking study is often necessary. This study compares the branch's profit margins with those of independent entities to establish a benchmark for CIT purposes.
## Financial reporting and taxable income calculation
Both Zambian resident companies and branches must adhere to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) when preparing their financial statements. Taxable profits are calculated by adjusting the accounting profit according to the rules that govern the determination of taxable income for resident companies.
## CIT rates
The standard CIT rate is set at 30%. However, businesses operating in specific sectors may be subject to alternative CIT rates, _which are detailed in the section_.
## WHT on branch profits
Branches of foreign companies face a 20% WHT on repatriated profits. It is important to note that branches may not benefit from double taxation relief under tax treaties when repatriating profits.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
Payments of the following items of Zambian-source income may be subject to WHT. The relevant rates under domestic legislation are as follows:
Category of payment | Rate on payment to Zambian resident (%) | Rate on payment to non-Zambian resident (%)  
---|---|---  
Dividends | 15 (1) | 20 (1)

Royalties | 15 | 20  
Commodity royalty | 15 | N/A  
Reinsurance | 0 | 20  
Commissions | 15 | 20  
Non-resident construction and haulage contractors | N/A | 20  
Public entertainment fees to entertainers/sports persons | N/A | 20  
Notes
  1. 0% if paid by a mining company. 
  2. Interest payable to local banks and financial institutions licensed under the Banking and Financial Services Act, 2017 is exempt from WHT. In addition, interest paid by a bank or an institution registered under the Banking and Financial Services Act, 2017 in respect of interest earning accounts held by individuals is exempt from WHT.
  3. 0% if paid by a company listed on the Lusaka Securities Exchange to individual shareholders. 


Zambia's WHT obligations are triggered by the earliest of the payment date, the accrual date, or when income becomes due or is held for a person's order. In the context of rental income, the Commissioner-General may designate tenants as WHT agents, requiring them to withhold tax on rental payments for leased properties.
WHT payments must be remitted within 14 days after the month in which the payment or accrual occurred. Additionally, Zambia has DTTs with various territories, offering reduced WHT rates on dividends, interest, and royalties to non-residents.
Zambia has DTTs in force with the following territories:
Recipient | WHT (%)

Notes
  1. The non-resident recipient must own at least 25% of the share capital of the capital of the Zambian company.
  2. The rate of 5% shall apply where the beneficial owner is a company that directly holds at least 10% of the capital of the company paying the dividends, or if the beneficial owner is a pension fund.
  3. The 1950 France - Zambia DTT is accepted to apply.
  4. The 1953 Rhodesia & Nyasaland - South Africa DTT is expected to apply. These old treaties do not follow the OECD model, and, accordingly, their application to particular circumstances must be confirmed.
  5. The rate of 8% shall apply in the case of payment of royalties in respect of any copyright of scientific work, patent, trademark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific experience.
  6. This rate applies where the dividends are paid out of income (including gains) derived directly or indirectly from immovable property within the meaning of Article 6 of the treaty.
  7. The rate of 5% shall apply where the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) that directly holds at least 10% of the capital of the company paying the dividends or if the beneficial owner is a pension fund.


In all cases, advance clearance must be obtained to obtain the treaty benefit and take advantage of any reduced rate of WHT or tax exemption.
It may be possible to obtain confirmation that management and consultancy fees can be paid without deduction of WHT by reference to the provisions of the relevant treaty. For treaties following the OECD model, the article concerning ‘Business Profits’ is generally taken to be relevant.

## Advance income tax
Advance income tax may apply at 15% on the value of commercial imports where the importer is non-compliant with its tax obligations. This can be credited against the importer’s CIT liability on submission of the annual tax return.
## Exchange controls
The exchange monitoring regulations and foreign currency regulations in Zambia were repealed in March 2014.
However, the government, through the Bank of Zambia (BoZ), recently developed an Electronic Export Proceeds Tracking Framework. This is intended to facilitate real-time monitoring and reporting between the regulatory authorities.
The BoZ further issued the (Export Proceeds Tracking Framework) Directives in 2023 as subsidiary legislation to govern the implementation of the framework. The Directives became effective on 1 January 2024.
The framework highlights that all exporters are required to complete and submit the customs export declaration Form CE 20 to the ZRA with a unique identification number called the Unique Consignment Reference (UCR). 
In addition to the above, all exporters will be required to open and maintain accounts with commercial banks or financial institutions domiciled in Zambia. This entails that all the earnings derived from the export of goods and/or services would be required to be reflected in the said bank account within 90 days of the export.
Commercial banks and financial institutions that receive the export proceeds are required to notify the BoZ by way of submitting returns of all money and remittances received to the BoZ. The returns submitted should provide the Taxpayer Identification Numbers, details of receipts and utilisation of funds, and correct use of UCRs.
Once the above procedures have been completed, the BoZ will be responsible for the following:
  * Reconciliation of the UCRs (as recorded by ZRA by using the ASYCUDA system) and the eBoP returns submitted by commercial banks and financial institutions.
  * Follow up unreconciled UCRs.
  * Preparation of International Investment Position. 
  * Stakeholder sensitisation.


## Choice of business entity
A non-Zambian resident company can establish a business in Zambia, either as a branch of a foreign company or a subsidiary (i.e. a Zambian registered limited liability company).
## Adoption of IFRS
Zambia has adopted a three-tier financial reporting framework as guided by the governing accounting body, the Zambia Institute of Chartered Accountants (ZiCA). The reporting and auditing requirements for the three tiers under the framework are as follows:
  * Publicly accountable entities: These include listed companies, public interest entities, and government-owned enterprises, must use full IFRS, and must be audited.
  * Economically significant companies: These include companies that are not in the first tier and have annual turnover equal to or exceeding ZMW 20 million, have a choice of using the IFRS for SMEs or full IFRS, and they must be audited.
  * Micro and small enterprise: These refer to those businesses with annual turnover below ZMW 20 Entities under this category are free to use the Zambian Financial Reporting Standard for Micro and Small Entities, and an audit is not required.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
Zambia's CIT framework mandates separate taxation for distinct income sources, prohibiting loss offset across different income streams.
## Business income
Taxable business profits from Zambian operations are aligned with the charge year, which typically spans from 1 January to 31 December. Companies may request an alternative accounting period from the ZRA.
## Inventory valuation 
For CIT calculations, IFRS guide inventory valuation.
## Capital gains
Zambia does not operate a specific capital gains tax; however, PTT applies to the realised value of transferred property.
## Dividend income
Dividends from foreign entities to Zambian companies attract CIT and are taxed separately. Tax treaties may offer relief, and unilateral measures can prevent double taxation. Dividends received from Zambian entities are considered final after WHT. For onward distributions, a tax credit equivalent to the WHT may be available to prevent double taxation.
## Interest income
All interest income, regardless of origin, is subject to CIT. For Zambian-sourced interest, the recipient company's taxable amount includes WHT, which is creditable against the company's CIT liability. Notably, green bonds listed on the Lusaka Stock Exchange enjoy a 0% tax rate from 1 January 2023, provided they mature after at least three years.
## Rental income
Effective from 1 January 2022, rental income is subject to a turnover tax with varying rates based on the gross rental income brackets.
## Royalty income
CIT applies to Zambian-source royalty income, which encompasses a broad range of property usage rights. The recipient company's taxable amount includes WHT, creditable against its CIT liability. From 1 January 2023, software rental is considered a royalty for tax purposes.
## Partnership income
Partnership income is taxed at the individual partner level, reflecting the transparent nature of partnerships under Zambian tax law.
## Unrealised foreign exchange gains/losses 
Unrealised gains/losses are not taxable/deductible for tax purposes. Taxable foreign exchange gains and deductible losses of a revenue are contingent on realisation, with certain capital nature exceptions.
## Other income sources
Income from hedging and investment activities is also taxed under separate source taxation rules.
## Foreign income 
Zambian residents are taxed on foreign-sourced dividend and interest income, as well as income from international transportation services.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
Zambia's tax system is predominantly source-based, with income generated from Zambian sources being liable for income tax. For Zambian tax residents, the tax scope extends to global interest and dividend income, aligning with a worldwide taxation principle.
Non-resident entities operating through a permanent establishment (PE) in Zambia are subject to corporate income tax (CIT) on the income attributable to their Zambian PE. In the absence of a PE, non-resident income from Zambian sources may incur WHT, typically withheld at the source (_see the_ _section_ _)_.
The standard CIT rate is 30% on taxable corporate income. However, as of 1 January 2023, the telecommunications sector's dual tax rate system has been streamlined to a uniform rate of 35%, replacing the previous structure of 30% on income up to ZMW 250,000 and 40% on income exceeding this threshold.
For small businesses unable to maintain detailed records for tax assessment, a base tax of ZMW 365 per annum is levied, which is common among market traders. Specific income sources may be taxed at varying CIT rates.
The following sources of income are subject to different CIT rates:
Source of income | CIT rate (%)  
---|---  
Electronic communications networks or service licences  | 35  
Farming | 10  
Profits from public private partnership projects by special purpose vehicles (SPVs) for the first five years | 15  
Agro-processing | 10  
Income earned by a producer of cotton seed or from ginning of cotton | 0 (2024 to 2028)  
Income earned from spinning of cotton and weaving of thread | 0 (2024 to 2034)

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
Zambia's VAT system operates at a standard rate of 16% on most goods and services. Notably, goods and services exported from Zambia are typically zero-rated, with the exception of services physically performed in Zambia, which are taxed at the standard rate regardless of the customer's residency.
Imported standard-rated goods are also subject to the 16% VAT upon entry into Zambia. For services supplied to Zambian customers by non-resident providers, where the services have not been taxed in the originating country, Zambian VAT applies. In such cases, the Zambian customer must account for the output VAT through a reverse-charge mechanism but is initially unable to reclaim the input VAT.
To facilitate input VAT recovery for Zambian customers receiving services from abroad, the foreign supplier may appoint a local tax agent. This agent is responsible for managing output VAT and issuing Zambian tax invoices, enabling the customer to claim input VAT credits.
## Customs duties
In Zambia, imported goods attract customs duties, which are levied to regulate the flow of goods into the country. The customs duty rates vary depending on the classification of the goods under the Harmonized System codes.
## Excise taxes
The Zambian tax regime imposes excise taxes on specific goods and services. These include, but are not limited to, alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, and mobile communication services. The excise duty rates are predetermined and applied to these goods and services to discourage excessive consumption and generate revenue for the government.
It is important for businesses and individuals engaging in the importation of goods or dealing in excisable products and services to be aware of these tax obligations to ensure compliance with Zambian tax laws. Exercisable goods and services are subject to excise duty at the following rates:
Item | 2024 rate | 2023 rate  
---|---|---  
Non-alcoholic drinks | ZMW 0.60 per litre | ZMW 0.30 per litre  
Alcoholic drinks:  
Less than 80% by volume | 60% | 60%  
80% or higher by volume | 60% + 20% surtax | 60% + 20% surtax  
Ethyl alcohol and other spirits, denatures of alcoholic strength of less than 80% | 60% | 125%  
Unmanufactured tobacco | 145% or ZMW 400 per kg | 145% or ZMW 361 per kg  
Cigarettes | ZMW 400 per mille | ZMW 361 per mille  
Electronic cigarettes and similar personal electric vaporising devices | 145% | -  
Telephone airtime* | 17.5% | 17.5%  
Portland cement | ZMW 40 per tonne | ZMW 40 per tonne  
Plastic carrier bags | 30% | 30%  
Plastic articles (including floor covering of plastics, tiles, walls, or ceilings) | 15% | -  
* Airtime includes minutes of voice calls, short message services (sms), multi-media services (mms), Internet bandwidth, and other similar services that a subscriber consumes on a mobile cellular telephone or other electronic communication device.
## Property Transfer Tax (PTT)
Zambia imposes PTT on certain property transactions. The PTT is levied on the following:
  * The transfer of Zambian land.
  * Intellectual property (IP) rights.
  * Mining rights and interests therein.
  * Mineral processing licences and other mining-related licences.
  * Share transfers in Zambian-incorporated companies.


Notably, PTT also applies to indirect share transfers. This occurs when a non-resident company, holding a minimum of 10% in a Zambian company, undergoes a share transfer.
### PTT rates
Effective from 1 January 2023, the following PTT rates apply:
Description | Rate (%)  
---|---  
Land (including buildings) | 5  
Shares (including an interest in a mining right)* | 5  
Mining right for a mining licence | 10  
Mineral processing licence | 10  
Mining right for an exploration licence | 5  
IP | 5  
**_*_** In Zambia, non-resident companies disposing of at least a 10% interest in a Zambian company are subject to PTT at a rate of 5%. The tax base is the higher of three calculated values:
  * The ratio of the Zambian company's value to the transferring company's value, multiplied by the transferred shares' market
  * The same ratio applied to the consideration received for the shares.
  * The ratio applied to the nominal value of the transferred shares.


Typically, the seller is responsible for PTT payment. However, in cases where the seller is unavailable, a provisional tax return may be filed by another individual under specific circumstances, such as:
  * The seller has passed away.


  * The seller is outside Zambia and cannot be reached.


  * Despite diligent efforts, the seller's whereabouts remain unknown.


This substitute filing is permissible only with a court order or if the individual has been designated as a proxy by the court's registrar authorised to submit the provisional return.
## Stamp taxes
There is no stamp tax in Zambia. However, effective 1 January 2023, the Patents and Companies Registration Agency (PACRA) has reduced the fees levied on the increase in authorised share capital of a company incorporated in Zambia to 1.5% (previously 2.5%) of the nominal value of the share capital. 
The minimum prescribed fees at initial registration of a company will vary according to the specific type of company being incorporated. The following are the minimum prescribed fees:
Company type | Prescribed registration fees (nominal capital) (ZMW)  
---|---  
Private company | 20,000  
Public company | 2,000,000  
Bureau de change | 100,000  
Financial institution | 1,000,000  
Local bank | 138,666,667  
Foreign bank | 693,333,200  
Insurance broker | 133,334  
Insurance company | 2,000,000  
Reinsurance company | 10,000,000  
Company limited by guarantee | 1,267  
However, the total fee shall not exceed ZMW 3,333,333. For a company limited by guarantee, the guaranteed amount shall not be less than ZMW 20,000.
## Turnover taxes
Entities with annual turnovers not exceeding ZMW 800,000 are subject to a 4% turnover tax. This tax is exclusive of income tax. Turnover, for this purpose, does not include interest, dividends, royalties, consultancy services income, or income from standard mining operations. However, as of 1 January 2023, artisanal or small-scale mining activities under the threshold are taxed at the same rate.
### Gig economy and rental income 
Individuals in the gig economy earning up to ZMW 12,000 annually are exempt from turnover tax. Those with incomes between ZMW 12,000 and ZMW 800,000 are taxed at 4%. 
Similarly, rental income earners below ZMW 12,000 annually are exempt, while those with rental incomes within the ZMW 12,000 to ZMW 800,000 range are taxed at a 4% rate. Rental incomes above ZMW 800,000 are subject to a 12.5% tax rate.
Rental income earners must file monthly rental income tax returns by the 14th day of the following month. All taxpayers receiving rental income must register for rental income tax and comply with the same monthly payment deadline for submitted returns.
## Payroll taxes 
Employers in Zambia must deduct income tax from employee emoluments under the Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) system, which applies progressive personal income tax (PIT) rates.
### Skills Development Levy (SDL) 
A mandatory monthly levy of 0.5% is imposed on employers, calculated on the gross emoluments of their employees.
## Social security contributions 
Both employers and employees contribute to the National Pension Scheme Authority (NAPSA). The combined contribution rate is 10% of an employee's earnings, capped at ZMW 2,981.60 monthly (ZMW 1,490.80 each).
## National Health Insurance contributions
The National Health Insurance Scheme mandates a 1% contribution from both employers and employees, based on the employee's basic salary, totalling a 2% contribution.
## Provincial/local taxes other than income taxes
Employers may be subject to additional levies by local councils, such as the Lusaka City Council.
