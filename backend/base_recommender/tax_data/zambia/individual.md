Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
## Foreign tax relief
Foreign tax suffered on income of an individual may be eligible for foreign tax relief either under a double tax treaty (DTT) with Zambia or as unilateral relief available under domestic law. The credit is restricted to the lower of the amount of foreign tax actually suffered and the Zambian income tax that would have applied on the foreign income as a percentage of total income.
## Tax treaties
Zambia has in-force DTTs with the following countries:
Botswana | Ireland (6) | South Africa (1)

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
Recent significant developments in the taxation of individuals in Zambia are as follows:
  * Both employers and employees are required to make contributions to the National Pension Scheme Authority (NAPSA). The contribution rate is 5% of the employeeâ€™s total earnings (a total 10% contribution from both the employer and employee), subject to a limit as prescribed by the authority. The maximum contribution limit for 2024 is 1,490.80 Zambian kwacha (ZMW) per employee per month (i.e. a total of ZMW 2,981.60 from both the employer and employee per month).

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
Under the Income Tax Act, Zambia has a source-based system for the taxation of income. Income deemed to be from a Zambian source is generally subject to Zambian income tax. Zambian residents are also subject to income tax on interest and dividends from a source outside Zambia.
## Personal income tax rates
The rates of income tax applicable to an individual for the 2024 charge year are as follows:
Annual taxable income (ZMW) | Rate of income tax (%)  
---|---  
Up to 61,200 | 0  
61,201 to 85,200 | 20  
85,201 to 110,400 | 30  
Over 110,400 | 37  
In principle, the same rates apply to both Zambian and non-Zambian residents. In practice, the only mechanism for income of non-Zambian residents to be subject to income tax at these rates would be on Zambian-source emoluments from an employment or office under Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE). Other Zambian-source income of non-Zambian residents could be subject to withholding tax (WHT).

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
## Taxable period
Income tax is determined by reference to a charge year, being the period of 12 months ending on 31 December.
## Tax returns and payment of tax
Individual taxpayers who earn income that exceeds ZMW 57,600 _per annum_ other than that from employment and subject to PAYE are required to submit a provisional tax return and make advance payments during the charge year on account of their estimated tax liability.
The quarterly returns for the 2024 tax charge year are due as follows:
  * 1st quarter return due 31 March 2024 (or 5 March 2024 if submitted manually and 90 days after registration if registered after the due dates, 31 March and 5 March).
  * 2nd quarter return due on 30 June 2024.
  * 3rd quarter return due on 30 September 2024.
  * 4th quarter return due on 31 December 2024.


The personal income tax return needs to be submitted by 21 June following the end of the tax year. For example, the personal income tax return for the 2023 tax charge year must be submitted by 21 June 2024. 
The same deadline applies for paying the balance of income tax that remains outstanding.
Effective 1 January 2023, the due date for the payment of a provisional return submitted by a person who registers after 31 March of any charge year shall be within 90 days from the date of registration.
## Tax audit process
The Commissioner-General of the ZRA has wide powers to require any person to attend to be questioned at the time of place specified by notice, where it is determined that person is able to impart information necessary for the purposes of the Income Tax Act.
Furthermore, following the release of the 2014 Budget, the Income Tax Act has been amended to empower the Commissioner-General of the ZRA to access any type of information required for tax purposes held by legal practitioners, accountants, and financial institutions.
## Statute of limitations
Save for fraud or wilful default, no assessment can be made for any charge year after six years from the end of the charge year.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
## Employment expenses
An expense is deductible against taxable emoluments if it is incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of that source of income and is not capital in nature. This test is difficult to satisfy in practice where an expense is incurred by an employee. Capital allowances may be available in limited circumstances.
## Personal deductions
### Alimony
Alimony payments are not deductible.
### Charitable contributions
A payment to a public benefit organisation that is approved by the Zambian government or owned by the Zambian government is deductible. The maximum amount deductible is 15% of taxable income.
### Mortgage interest expenses
Mortgage interest is not deductible.
### Taxes paid
Zambian taxes paid are not deductible against employment income. _See the_ _section for a description of the treatment of foreign taxes_.
## Standard deductions
There is no standard deduction.
## Personal allowances
There are no personal allowances. However, as set out in the rate table, the first ZMW 61,200 of taxable income (excluding taxable lump sum payments from approved pension funds, gratuities, and compensation for loss of office) is subject to income tax at 0%.
## Business deductions
Business expenses are generally deductible, provided that they are not capital and they are incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the business.
## Losses
Trading losses can be carried forward for set-off against profits of the same source. Normally, losses are available to carry forward for a period of five years after the charge year in which the loss was incurred. In the case of a person carrying on a mining operation or hydro, solar, wind, and thermal power generation, the loss carryforward period is ten years.
There is no ability to carry back losses.
Losses from one source cannot be set against income from another source.

## Individual - Other issues
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
## Treatment of flow-through business entities
Where a business is carried on in partnership, the income to which each partner is entitled in a period is ascertained under the Zambian income tax rules, and each partner is assessed and charged accordingly. A partnership is therefore broadly transparent for Zambian income tax purposes.
## Exchange controls
Regulations requiring the monitoring of cross border and foreign currency transactions were abolished in March 2014. 
Regulations that required local transactions to be negotiated and based in the local currency, kwacha, were also abolished.
However, the government, through the Bank of Zambia (BoZ), recently developed an Electronic Export Proceeds Tracking Framework. This is intended to facilitate real-time monitoring and reporting between the regulatory authorities.
The BoZ further issued the (Export Proceeds Tracking Framework) Directives in 2023 as subsidiary legislation to govern the implementation of the framework. The Directives became effective on 1 January 2024.
The framework highlights that all exporters are required to complete and submit the customs export declaration Form CE 20 to the ZRA with a unique identification number called the Unique Consignment Reference (UCR). 
In addition to the above, all exporters will be required to open and maintain accounts with commercial banks or financial institutions domiciled in Zambia. This entails that all the earnings derived from the export of goods and/or services would be required to be reflected in the said bank account within 90 days of the export.
Commercial banks and financial institutions that receive the export proceeds are required to notify the BoZ by way of submitting returns of all money and remittances received to the BoZ. The returns submitted should provide the Taxpayer Identification Numbers, details of receipts and utilisation of funds, and correct use of UCRs.
Once the above procedures have been completed, the BoZ will be responsible for the following:
  * Reconciliation of the UCRs (as recorded by ZRA by using the ASYCUDA system) and the eBoP returns submitted by commercial banks and financial institutions.
  * Follow up unreconciled UCRs.
  * Preparation of International Investment Position. 
  * Stakeholder sensitisation.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
## Employment income
Income derived from employment within Zambia is subject to taxation. This encompasses all forms of remuneration linked to services performed or roles held in the country, regardless of the payment's location or the payer's residence. Employers must withhold and remit taxes on these emoluments through the Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) system.
### Scope of emoluments
The term 'emoluments' is broadly defined to include, but is not limited to, salaries, wages, overtime pay, commissions, bonuses, and pensions. It also covers any benefits or allowances that can be converted into cash or its equivalent.
### Taxation of employee benefits
Benefits that can be monetised are considered part of the employee's taxable income and fall under the PAYE framework. Conversely, non-cash benefits, such as the provision of vehicles or housing by the employer, are taxed at the employer's level.
### Skills Development Levy (SDL)
Employers are also obligated to contribute to the national skills development by paying a levy amounting to 0.5% of the total emoluments paid to employees each month.
## Equity compensation
The allotment or acquisition of shares under a share option scheme that is approved by the Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) is exempt from income tax.
Specific rules for other share option schemes apply from 1 January 2014.
## Business income
Business income is generally calculated on the same basis for individuals as companies (_see the for more information_).
Business income is generally determined in line with applicable accounting standards (excluding receipts of a capital nature). Expenses wholly and exclusively incurred for the purposes of the business are generally deductible, provided they are of a revenue nature rather than capital in nature.
Capital expenditure is disallowed, but capital allowances are available on qualifying capital items.
## Capital gains
Zambia does not have a capital gains tax, and, except where provided otherwise in the Income Tax Act, capital gains are not subject to tax.
## Dividend income
Zambian resident individuals are taxed on dividend income from both Zambian and non-Zambian sources.
In the case of dividend income received from a Zambian resident company, the WHT deducted on the payment of the dividend should represent the â€˜final taxâ€™, and the Zambian resident individual receiving the dividend should not be subject to additional income tax.
## Interest income
Zambian resident individuals are generally taxed on interest income from both Zambian and non-Zambian sources.
From 1 January 2022, interest earned by individuals on interest earning accounts held at banks and institutions registered under the Banking and Financial Services Act, 2017 is exempt from tax.
From 1 January 2023, interest earned by individuals on interest earning on green bonds listed on the Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE) with maturity of at least three years is exempt.
In the case of other Zambian-source interest income, the WHT deducted on the payment of interest should represent the â€˜final taxâ€™, and the Zambian resident individual receiving the interest is not subject to additional income tax.
## Rental income
From 1 January 2022, rental income is taxed by way of turnover tax at the rate of 0% for gross rental income below ZMW 12,000, 4% for gross rental income between ZMW 12,000 and ZMW 800,000, and 12.5% for gross rental income above ZMW 800,000 _per annum_. The tax is payable by the landlord.
## Exempt income
As noted above, capital gains and non-Zambian source income (with the exception of dividends and interest) are outside the scope of income tax.
Exempt categories of income include:
  * Lump sum payments withdrawn from an approved fund at retirement age, death, or permanent incapacity.
  * Approved payments for injury or sickness.
  * A scholarship, bursary, or maintenance for education.
  * Alimony, maintenance, or matrimonial allowance.
  * A pension received from an approved fund.
  * A dividend declared from farming income for the first five years the distributing company commences farming.
  * Ex-gratia payments to a spouse, child, or dependant on the death of an employee.
  * Lump sum payments paid to an employee on loss of office on medical grounds.
  * A dividend declared by a company listed on the Lusaka Securities Exchange to an individual.
  * Dividends declared by a company engaged in the assembly of motor vehicles, motorcycles, and bicycles for five years from the declaration of the first dividend.
  * Certain payments to government employees, members of the armed forces, etc.
  * Pension benefit as defined by the Constitution.

The PTT liability is generally payable by the vendor. However, where the vendor/transferor is not available, a person, other than the transferor of the property, shall file a provisional tax return on behalf of the transferor where that person has been allowed to do so by a court order or has been appointed as a proxy for the registrar of court who has been authorised to render the provisional return. This will only apply under the following conditions:
