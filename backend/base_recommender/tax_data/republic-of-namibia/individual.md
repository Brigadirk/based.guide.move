## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
## Foreign tax relief
As a result of the source rules and the exempt status of dividends, few items subject to foreign tax are liable to Namibian taxation. There is no general unilateral provision for relief from double taxation, although a specific provision prevents double taxation of royalties.
## Tax treaties
In the event that Namibia has entered into a double taxation agreement (DTA) with the country where the foreign resident resides, such individual will be taxable in Namibia, unless all the requirements of the specific DTA are met.
Namibia has entered into DTAs with the following countries:
Botswana | Malaysia | South Africa  
---|---|---  
France | Mauritius | Sweden  
Germany | Romania | United Kingdom  
India | Russian Federation

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
Namibia has a source-based tax system, which means that income from a source within Namibia or deemed to be within Namibia will be subject to tax in Namibia, unless a specific exemption is available.
## Calculation of taxable income
Gross income | The total amount, in cash or otherwise, received by or accrued to any person from a source within, or deemed to be within, Namibia, excluding receipts of a capital nature. The Income Tax Act makes provisions for specific inclusions in gross income and amounts deemed to be from a Namibian source.  
---|---  
Less: Exemptions | The Income Tax Act provides for certain amounts to be specifically exempt from income tax.  
Equals: Income  
Less: Deductions | The Income Tax Act provides for certain expenditures and losses actually incurred to generate income to be deducted, provided that these expenses are not personal domestic expenses or of a capital nature.  
The Income Tax Act specifically provides for certain expenditures to be deductible and allows a deduction for capital allowances (e.g. building or vehicle).  
Only expenses incurred to generate ‘income’ may be deducted. Expenses incurred to generate income exempt from tax are not deductible. Apportionment should be considered when expenses are incurred to generate both taxable income and exempt income.  
Equals: Taxable income | Taxable income is taxed at the individual tax rates as set out under the personal income tax rates section below.  
## Personal income tax rates
The tax rates for the fiscal year 1 March 2024 through 28 February 2025 are as follows:
Taxable income (NAD) |  Tax on column 1 (NAD) |  Tax on excess (%)  
---|---|---  
Over (column 1) | Not over  
0 | 100,000 | 0 | 0  
100,000 | 150,000 | 0 | 18  
150,000 | 350,000 | 9,000 | 25  
350,000 | 550,000 | 59,000 | 28  
550,000 | 850,000 | 115,000 | 30  
850,000 | 1,550,000 | 205,000 | 32  
1,550,000 | 429,000 | 37  
## Withholding taxes
Withholding taxes (WHTs) are applicable where dividends and royalties (or similar payments) are declared/distributed to non-Namibian residents or where Namibian residents make use of certain services rendered by non-residents.
The gross amount of interest received by any person (other than a Namibian company) from a registered banking institution or unit trust scheme registered in Namibia is subject to WHT of 10%. WHT on interest of 10% applies on all interest paid by a Namibian resident to a non-resident.
### Dividends
Dividends declared by a Namibian company to a non-resident person will be subject to non-resident shareholders tax (NRST), a WHT.
NRST is payable at the standard rate of 10% where a company holds more than 25% shares in the Namibian company. In all other cases, NRST payable is 20%. The rate of NRST may be reduced if a DTA is in place with Namibia.
NRST is payable within 20 days following the month in which the dividends were declared.
‘Dividends’ means “any amount distributed by a company … to its shareholders…”.
The Namibian company paying the dividend is responsible to withhold the NRST.
### Interest
A WHT of 10%, calculated on the gross amount of interest, is payable on interest accruing to any person, other than a Namibian company, from a registered banking institution or unit trust scheme in Namibia. The tax withheld is a final tax, and the financial institution is responsible to withhold the tax. It is the obligation of the financial institution to withhold the tax and pay such tax over to the revenue authorities.
A WHT of 10% will also be payable on the gross amount of any interest paid by any person to a non-resident. The WHT is due 20 days following the month in which the interest was paid. Interest is deemed to be paid on the earlier of actual payment or when the interest is due and payable.
Interest paid by the state to any person and interest paid by any bank of Namibia to a foreign bank are exempt from WHT on interest.
### Royalties or similar payments
WHT is levied at 10% on any royalty paid to a person other than a person ordinarily resident in Namibia or a domestic company (i.e. a non-resident), including a right to use industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment. Consequently, the tax base is now extended to include rentals for the hire of scientific, industrial, or commercial equipment from non-resident persons.
WHT on royalties is due 20 days after the end of the month during which the said liability is incurred or the said payment is made.
The Namibian company paying the royalty is responsible to withhold the tax.
### Services
WHT of 10% on services applies to any Namibian resident paying a management, consultancy, or entertainment fee to a non-resident.
A resident includes (amongst others):
  * a company doing business in Namibia (irrespective of whether registered in Namibia or not) and includes a branch of such company, or
  * a partnership, board, trust that is formed or established or incorporated under the laws of Namibia or which is doing business in Namibia, and includes a branch of such partnership, board, or trust.


A non-resident means a person/company that is not a resident.
Management and consulting fees are specifically defined as “any amount payable for administrative, managerial, technical, or consultative services or any similar services, whether such services are of a professional nature or not”.
The legislation imposes the obligation on the Namibian resident to withhold a 10% tax on such fees paid to the non-resident. It is important to note that the legislation also specifically includes any directors fees paid to a foreign director; however, please note that the WHT applicable on director's fees payable to non-residents is 25% (effective 21 June 2016).
### Treaty relief
In certain cases, tax treaties can provide a reduced rate (_see the section in the Corporate tax summary for the treaty rates_). It should be noted that the tax treaties contain certain requirements that should be met before the reduced rate may be applied.
In certain cases, tax relief in respect of interest, dividends, royalties, and services are only applicable where the beneficial owner of such income is a company. Careful considerations should therefore be given to the requirements for application of treaty relief in the case of individuals. The definitions of dividends, royalties, interest, and services in the various treaties should also be considered.
There is no treaty relief in respect of director's fees payable to non-residents.

Pension fund | Provident fund | Retirement annuity fund  
---|---|---  
Withdrawal | Any amount not transferred to similar fund is taxed at the greater of 18% or the average tax rate. | Any amount not transferred to similar fund is taxed at the greater of 18% or the average tax rate. | No withdrawal benefits before the age of 55 years.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year of assessments for natural persons runs from 1 March to 28 February.
## Tax returns
Namibia has a system of self-assessment, which must include a computation of the taxpayer's taxable income and tax payable, and the payment of tax due on the income so computed.
Husbands and wives submit separate tax returns and are taxed separately.
The income tax return for salaried individuals is due on 30 June and for farmers and business individuals on 30 September.
## Payment of tax
### Employee’s tax
Pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) tax is withheld from an employee's salary by the employer and must be remitted to the revenue authorities by the 20th day of the month following the payroll deductions. Any individual who earns taxable income in excess of NAD 5,000 that is not subject to PAYE (e.g. interest or profit from trade) is required to register as a provisional taxpayer.
### Provisional tax
The first provisional payment for provisional taxpayers is due on/before 30 August (at least 40% of tax payable at year-end is payable with the submission of the first provisional tax return).
The second provisional payment is due on/before 28 February (the first and second provisional payments should amount to at least 80% of tax payable at year-end).
### Top-up payment
The final provisional payment is due on 30 June for salaried individuals and 30 September for business and farming individuals.
### Withholding tax (WHT)
WHT on dividends is due within 20 days following the month in which the dividend was declared.
WHT on royalties is due 20 days after the end of the month during which the said liability is incurred or the said payment is made.
WHT on services is payable to the Receiver of Revenue within 20 days after the end of the month during which the amount was deducted or withheld. It is advised for WHT on services that even if relief is available under a DTA, a nil form should still be submitted when payment is made to non-residents. The amount of DTA relief claimed should be disclosed on the form submitted.
### Penalties and interest
The penalties and interest due for late submissions and payments can be summarised as follows:
Tax area | Reason | Penalty* | Interest*  
---|---|---|---  
1st provisional tax | Late submission | NAD 100 per day penalty for outstanding provisional tax returns | None  
Late payment | 10% per month* | 20% _per annum_  
Under-estimation | 100% of the underestimated amount | None  
2nd provisional tax | Late submission | NAD 100 per day penalty for outstanding provisional tax returns | None  
Late payment | 10 per month* | 20% _per annum_  
Under-estimation | 100% of the underestimated amount | None  
Income tax return | Late submission | NAD 300 may be levied | None  
Late payment | 10% one-off | 20% _per annum_ **  
Omission/incorrect statement | Up to 200% | None  
WHT | Late submission | None | None  
Late payment | 10% | 20%  
* Penalties are levied at 10% per month. Interest is levied at 20% _per_ annum. Both penalties and interest are limited to the amount of taxes outstanding/underpaid.
** Applicable when the return was submitted on time but when the payment was late.
Namibia has a tax amnesty program until the end of October 2026 whereby the penalties and interests are waived fully to the extent that the outstanding taxes are paid before the end of October 2026.
## Anti-avoidance
Note that the Income Tax Act, Act 24 of 1981, contains an anti-avoidance section, Section 95, which enables the Receiver of Revenue to disregard the implications of a transaction or scheme if it can be proven that:
  * such transaction or scheme had been entered into to avoid or postpone the payment of any duty or levy imposed by the Act
  * such transaction or scheme was entered into or carried out by means or in a manner that would not normally be employed in the entering into or carrying out of a transaction, operation, or scheme of the nature of the transaction, operation, or scheme in question, or has created rights or obligations that would not normally be created between persons dealing at arm's length under a transaction, operation, or scheme of nature of the transaction, operation, or scheme in question, and
  * such transaction or scheme was entered into or carried out solely or mainly for the purposes of the avoidance or the postponement of liability for the payment of any tax duty or levy.


The NamRA can impose Section 95 on any transaction or scheme; however, the onus will be on the NamRA to prove that any/all of the requirements noted above are applicable to the transaction or scheme.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
## Employment expenses
There are no standard deductions for employees for business expenses. Travel, entertainment, and motor vehicle expenses are potentially deductible, but the onus is on the employee to prove they were incurred in the production of taxable income. Where allowances are provided by the employer, this onus is more readily discharged, but the deduction cannot normally exceed the allowance.
An employee may deduct contributions of up to NAD 150,000 _per annum_ to an approved pension, retirement annuity, provident, and educational policy fund registered in Namibia.
## Personal deductions
Personal and domestic expenses (e.g. mortgage interest) are not deductible.
## Losses
Namibian tax legislation does not provide for the carrying back of tax losses.
### Ring fencing of losses from certain trades
Ring fencing entails that a taxpayer may not offset losses from certain trades against income from other trades.
Ring fencing is applicable on the following types of loss-making trades:
  * Trades incurring losses for at least three of five years from 1 March 2011 onwards, or
  * Trades involving: 
    * Sporting activities.
    * Dealing in collectibles.
    * Rental of residential accommodation (unless 80% is used by non-relatives for at least half of the year of assessment).
    * Rental of vehicles, aircraft, and boats (unless 80% is used by non-relatives for at least half of the year of assessment).
    * Animal showing.
    * Farming or animal breading, unless carried on a full-time basis.
    * Carrying on of creative arts.
    * Gambling or betting.


The ring fencing will only apply to natural persons with taxable income in excess of NAD 200,000 per year (disregarding any losses).
Ring fencing can be avoided where a taxpayer can prove that the trade:
  * constitutes a business with a prospect of being profitable, and
  * generated taxable profits for at least five years out of ten years from 1 March 2011 (provided that further requirements are met, we propose further consultations with our tax experts).

## Dividend income
Dividends are exempt from tax (except when paid to non-resident persons, _see Withholding taxes in the section_).
## Interest income
The originating cause of the interest and the place where the underlying activities are performed will determine the source of interest.

However, the following exemptions apply in the case of natural persons:
  * Interest received from stock or securities (including treasury bills) issued by the government.

  * Relocation expenses paid directly by the employer are not taxed as fringe benefits in the employee's hands.
  * Reimbursement of actual business expenses paid on behalf of the employer is not taxable.
  * Where an approved scheme by the Namibian Revenue Agency (NamRA) is established for the provision of employee housing, the taxable fringe benefit arising from provision of accommodation, housing allowances, or mortgage interest subsidies is reduced by a maximum of one-third. Proof of housing expenses should be retained by the employer to verify the tax benefit provided to the employee.
  * Employer contributions to approved Namibian retirement funds and medical aid schemes (private health insurance) are not taxable in the hands of employees.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
The Namibian tax system is based on source and not on residency. Income derived or deemed to be derived from sources within Namibia is subject to tax.
The source is determined as the place where income originates or is earned, not the place of payment. If goods are sold pursuant to a contract entered into within Namibia, the source of income is deemed to arise in Namibia, regardless of the place of delivery or transfer of title.
Certain types of income arising outside Namibia may, in the hands of a Namibian tax resident, be deemed to arise in Namibia and be taxed as such. Examples are interest and certain copyright royalties arising outside Namibia.
Otherwise, residence, domicile, and citizenship are not normally relevant, and there are no special concessions for non-residents unless a tax treaty applies (_see the section_).

Under the Employees Compensation Act, employers are required to contribute to a fund that provides cash benefits for industrial injury, disability, and death. Contribution rates vary according to inherent occupational risk, from less than 1% in most low-risk commercial/administrative occupations to 8% for high-risk sectors (drilling, tunnelling, and rock-blasting). Employees whose annual remuneration exceeds NAD 81,300 are normally excluded from coverage.
