## Income tax amendments
The following income tax amendments were gazetted on 16 September 2024 and are effective for all companies with financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2024:
  * The corporate income tax (CIT) is reduced to 31%. There is a further reduction in the CIT rate for companies whose financial years will commence on or after 1 January 2025 to 30%.
  * Youth internship allowance: Section 17E was inserted into the Income Tax Act providing for a youth internship allowances that employers can claim in addition to their actual cost deductions, provided there is a registered internship agreement. The following should be noted: 
    * The allowance is calculated based on a formula. The formula as published in the Gazette has an error, and applying the formula as currently gazetted amounts to (unintended) significant allowances being claimable. We understand the Ministry of Finance is in the process of revising the formula, but no formal communication has been received in this regard.
    * From communication with the Ministry of Finance, we understand that the formula should be read and applied as follows: (A/B) * C - C Whereas: ‘A’ represents 50% ‘B’ represents the CIT rate (31%), and ‘C’ represents the costs incurred _per annum_ or 50,000 Namibian dollars (NAD), whichever is the lesser.
    * The allowance is claimable for up to 36 months and should be claimed pro rata in the instance where the registered internship agreement is less than 12 months.
  * Section 21 now limits the carry forward of assessed tax losses, both in terms of the amount to be carried forward and the period for which the assessed loss can be carried forward, as follows: 
    * Amount to be carried forward: The set off against taxable income of the balance of assessed loss incurred by the taxpayer in any previous year that has been carried forward from the preceding year of assessment is now limited to NAD 1 million or 80% of taxable income, whichever is the greater, before taking into account the provisions of Section 21 or Section 36 of the Income Tax Act. This means that if the taxpayer has taxable income of less than NAD 1 million, the full prior year tax loss can be carried forward and can be used to set off against the current year’s taxable income.
    * Number of years: Assessed losses will not be allowed to be carried forward for a period exceeding five years in respect of any taxpayer, or ten years in respect of entities in the mining, petroleum, or green hydrogen industries. It is important to note that temporary discontinuance in the carrying on of your trade will not affect the five/ten years limit. The balance of assessed loss accumulated before 1 January 2024 can be carried forward for five/ten years.
  * Short-term and long-term insurance entities are no longer exempt from non-resident shareholders tax (NRST).
  * The term ’connected person‘ is now defined as “any person…has control over another person, or where both persons are under control of the same person…”. The definition includes an extensive list of when persons will be regarded as being ‘connected’ for purposes of Section 95A and also provides for instances when a person will be regarded as having ‘control over another person’.
  * The 3:1 debt-to-equity ratio requirement in determining thin capitalisation is replaced with a fixed limitation on interest deductions to the extent that the net interest expense exceeds 30% of the connected person’s tax earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) and the net interest expense exceeds NAD 3 million (i.e. if the net interest expense does not exceed NAD 3 million, this limitation will not apply. 
    * The terms ‘interest’, ‘net interest expense’, ‘tax amortisation’, ‘tax depreciation’, and ‘tax EBITDA’ for purposes of the limit on the interest deduction are defined.
    * Interest deductions not allowed for the current year are allowed to be carried forward for five years in respect of any taxpayer and ten years for entities involved in mining, petroleum, or green hydrogen industries.
    * The section applies to the Petroleum Taxation Act; however, banking institutions and registered insurers/re-insurers are exempt.


## Value-added tax (VAT) amendments
Some major changes were introduced by the VAT Amendment Act, 2024, published 16 September 2024. These amendments take effect on the first day of the second month following the publication of the Amendment Act, 2024 (i.e. on 1 November 2024):
  * The compulsory VAT registration threshold is increased from NAD 500,000 to NAD 1 million.
  * The total minimum consideration amount, as per Section 21, when a VAT-registered supplier shall not be required to provide a tax invoice for the provision of a taxable supply, increased to NAD 1,000.
  * The time of supply rule in relation to import VAT on services changed to 20 days after the date of import of the services.
  * The interest rate levied on: 
    * overdue tax payments changed from 20% to the prime lending rate announced by the Bank Namibia, and
    * VAT refunds due to the taxpayer changed from 11% to the repo rated as announced by the Bank Namibia.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year for companies and close corporations is aligned with the financial year.
## Tax returns
The income tax return is due within seven months after the financial year-end of the company and can be extended to five months after the seventh month due date, provided that no other prior year income tax returns are outstanding.
## Payment of tax
The first provisional payment for income tax is due within six months from the commencement of the company's financial year (at least 40% of tax payable at year-end is paid on first submission). The second provisional payment is due on/before the last day of the respective tax year (at least 80% of tax payable at year-end is paid on second submission). The final provisional payment is due within seven months after the financial year-end of the company.
WHT on dividends are due within 20 days after declaration of the dividend.
WHT on royalties or similar payments are due within 20 days after the end of the month during which the liability for payment of the royalty was incurred.
WHT on services is payable to the NamRA within 20 days after the end of the month during which the amount was deducted or withheld.
WHT on interest is due within 20 days after the end of the month during which the interest was paid. Interest is deemed to be paid on the earlier of actual payment or when the interest becomes due and payable.
It is advised that if relief is available under the DTA, a nil form should still be submitted when payment is made to non-residents. The amount of DTA relief claimed should be disclosed on the form submitted.
No cheques are accepted as a means of payment at the NamRA.
### Penalties and interest
The penalties and interest due for late submissions and payments can be summarised as follows:
Tax area | Reason | Penalty | Interest (_per annum_)  
---|---|---|---  
1st provisional tax | Late submission | NAD 100 per day penalty for outstanding provisional tax returns | None  
Late payment | 10% per month * | 20%*  
Under-estimation | Up to 100% of underpaid amount | None  
2nd provisional tax | Late submission | NAD 100 per day penalty for outstanding provisional tax returns | None  
Late payment | 10% per month * | 20%  
Under-estimation | Up to 100% of underpaid amount | None  
Income tax return | Late submission | 10% one-off penalty if taxes were paid late | None  
Late payment | Where tax return is submitted late, then 10% once-off penalty | 20%  
Omission/incorrect statement | Up to 200% | 20%  
WHT | Late payment | 10% per month * | 20%  
Late submission | None | None  
* Both penalties and interest are limited to the amount of taxes outstanding.
* Namibia has a tax amnesty program ending 31 October 2026, whereby the penalties and interest are fully waived if the outstanding taxes are settled before the end of October 2026. 
## Anti-avoidance
Note that the Income Tax Act, Act 24 of 1981, contains an anti-avoidance section, Section 95, which enables the Receiver of Revenue to disregard the implications of a transaction or scheme if it can be proven that:
  * such transaction or scheme had been entered into to avoid or postpone the payment of any duty or levy imposed by the Act
  * such transaction or scheme was entered into or carried out by means or in a manner that would not normally be employed in the entering into or carrying out of a transaction, operation, or scheme of the nature of the transaction, operation, or scheme in question, or has created rights or obligations that would not normally be created between persons dealing at arm's length under a transaction, operation, or scheme of the nature of the transaction, operation, or scheme in question, and
  * such transaction or scheme was entered into or carried out solely or mainly for the purposes of the avoidance or the postponement of liability for the payment of any tax duty or levy.


The Namibian Revenue Agency can impose Section 95 on any transaction or scheme; however, the onus will be on the Revenue Agency to prove that any/all of the requirements noted above are applicable to the transaction or scheme.
## Tax audit process
The tax audit process is a discretionary process instituted by the NamRA. The NamRA will inspect the validity of invoices and whether such expenses are deductible for tax purposes.
Generally, income tax audits are initiated on amounts being refunded to taxpayers, with the focus being on high-value refunds.
Subsequent to an audit, a letter will be sent to the taxpayer indicating changes made to the return of income.
In the event that the taxpayer agrees with the outcome, an assessment is issued. Where the taxpayer is not satisfied with the outcome, an objection may be lodged within 90 days.
## Statute of limitations
There is no statute of limitation in respect of claiming a refund for excess income tax paid. Debts to the state prescribe after 30 years.
## Topics of focus for tax authority
Topics of focus for the tax authority include import VAT, general compliance, transfer pricing, payment of subsistence and travel allowances to employees, and employee taxes.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
The Namibian tax system is based on source and not on residency. Income derived or deemed to be derived from sources within Namibia are subject to tax.
The source is determined as the place where income originates or is earned, not the place of payment. If goods are sold pursuant to a contract entered into within Namibia, the source of income is deemed to arise in Namibia, regardless of the place of delivery or transfer of title.
Certain types of income arising outside Namibia may, in the hands of a domestic company, be deemed to arise in Namibia and be taxed as such. Examples are interest and certain copyright royalties arising outside Namibia.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The term ‘permanent establishment’ is not defined or recognised in the Income Tax Act, but it is included in all DTAs concluded with Namibia.
A PE includes a fixed place of business. The establishment of a local entity or branch will usually create a PE, although the provisions of the related tax treaty should be considered.
Except for the PE concept embodied in the tax treaties and WHT on service provisions, corporate residence is of little tax significance since transactions are taxed on a source basis.
_For the list of DTAs, please see the section._

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
## Capital allowances
The cost (including finance charges) of vehicles, machinery, equipment, and other articles used by the taxpayer to generate income is deductible in three equal annual allowances claimable from the date the costs were incurred and not only when the asset was taken into use. No apportionment is allowed where an asset is held for less than 12 months.
Buildings used by the taxpayer to generate income qualify for an initial allowance of 20% of erection costs in the year they are first brought into use. Thereafter, an annual allowance of 4% is deductible for the 20 following years. Additions to existing buildings (not alterations, improvements, or repairs) qualify for the same 20% and 4% deductions. Note that the allowance is calculated on the cost of erection and not the cost of acquisition. The allowance is also only calculated for a period of 21 years from the date of erection.
Registered manufacturers can claim 20% of the erection costs of the building in the year it is first brought into use, and 8% for ten years thereafter (_see Manufacturing in the section_).
Mining exploration expenditure incurred before commencement of mining production is deductible in full in the first year that income is generated from the mine. Initial development and subsequent developmental expenditures are written off in three equal annual allowances.
Capital allowances may also be deducted with respect to patents, trademarks, leasehold improvements, etc.
A recovery or recapture of allowances previously claimed should be included in the gross income of a taxpayer in the event that the allowance is recovered or recaptured by way of disposal, withdrawal from trade for non-trade purposes, or removal from Namibia. The recapture is calculated at the market value of the asset.
## Goodwill
The amortisation of goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes and should be excluded from calculating taxable income.
## Start-up expenses
### Mining
The Income Tax Act allows exploration and initial development expenditure to be deducted in full during the year in which the mine commences with production. All exploration expenses incurred before the commencement of mining is therefore deferred until such time that the mine commences production.
### All other industries
The general deduction formula determines that only expenses incurred in the production of income that are not of a capital nature may be claimed for tax purposes. The Income Tax Act defines income as ‘income in any year or period of assessment’.
## Interest expenses
A deduction is allowed in respect of financing expenditure incurred in respect of any financing agreement for the acquisition of fixed assets utilised in ordinary trade activities.
The general deduction formula determines that only expenses incurred in the production of taxable income that are not of a capital nature may be claimed for tax purposes. Therefore, where the interest can be argued to be incurred in the production of income, the interest expense will be deductible.
Thin capitalisation legislation may be applied to interest paid to connected persons (_see Thin capitalisation / limitation on interest deductions_ _in the section_).
## Bad debt
The Income Tax Act allows a specific deduction for bad debts, provided that the amount written off was previously included in the taxpayer's income.
Furthermore, the Income Tax Act prohibits the following deduction from taxable income:
“any loss or expense, the deduction of which would otherwise be allowable, to the extent to which it is recoverable under any contract of insurance, guarantee, security, or indemnity”.
Accordingly, where the bad debts are recoverable under insurance, the amounts are not deductible for tax purposes.
## Charitable contributions/donations
A specific deduction for donations is allowed, provided that it is made to a registered welfare organisation or an approved educational institution. It is a further requirement that a certificate should be issued by the welfare organisation/educational institution in respect of the donation and submitted with the entity’s tax return in order for it to qualify as a deduction. However, this deduction may not create or increase a tax loss.
## Fines and penalties
In terms of practise applied by Inland Revenue, tax penalties and fines are not deductible for tax purposes.
## Taxes
Taxes levied on income are not allowed as a deduction.
## Net operating losses
The set off against taxable income of the balance of assessed loss incurred by the taxpayer in any previous year that has been carried forward from the preceding year of assessment is now limited to NAD 1 million or 80% of taxable income, whichever is the greater, before taking into account the provisions of Section 21 or Section 36 of the Income Tax Act.
Assessed losses will not be allowed to be carried forward for a period exceeding five years in respect of any taxpayer, or ten years in respect of entities in the mining, petroleum, or green hydrogen industries. It is important to note that temporary discontinuance in the carrying on of your trade will not affect the five/ten years limit.
The balance of assessed loss accumulated before 1 January 2024 can be carried forward for five/ten years.
These amendments are effective for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2024.
Assessed losses are also reduced in the event of a compromise agreement with creditors.
Namibian tax legislation does not provide for the carrying back of tax losses.

# Namibia, Republic of
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
No taxation of combined operations is allowed in Namibia where operations are conducted in a group.
## Transfer pricing
The Minister of Finance confirmed that enforcing transfer pricing laws are high on their agenda and that they are working with, amongst others, the Finish Revenue Authority and the African Tax Administration Forum.
Namibian transfer pricing legislation is aimed at enforcing the arm’s-length principle in cross-border transactions carried out between connected persons. It is based on guidance set out by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Transfer Pricing Guidelines for multinational enterprises and tax administrations.
The objective of the transfer pricing legislation is to provide taxpayers with guidelines regarding the procedures to be followed in the determination of arm's-length prices, taking into account the Namibian business environment. It also sets out the Minister of Finance's views on documentation and other practical issues that are relevant in setting and reviewing transfer pricing in international agreements.
The transfer pricing legislation is essentially aimed at ensuring that cross-border transactions between companies operating in a multinational group are fairly priced and that profits are not stripped out of Namibia and taxed in lower tax jurisdictions. The legislation achieves this by giving the Minister of Finance (who essentially delegates to the Directorate of Inland Revenue) the power to adjust any non-market related prices charged or paid by Namibian entities in cross-border transactions with related parties to arm's-length prices and to tax the Namibian entity as if the transactions had been carried out at market-related prices.
In terms of the normal penalty provisions of the Income Tax Act, the Directorate of Inland Revenue may levy penalties of up to 200% on any amount of underpaid tax. Consequently, the Inland Revenue may invoke such provisions in the event that a taxpayer’s taxable income is understated as a result of prices that were charged in affected transactions, which were not carried out at arm’s length. Further, interest will be charged on the unpaid amounts at 20% _per annum_.
## Thin capitalisation / limitation on interest deductions
Previously, a deduction of any excess interest expenses paid to a non-resident related party and any realised foreign exchange losses were disallowed if the debt-to-fixed capital ratio from the foreign shareholders (and related parties) exceeded a ratio of three-to-one. 
Applicable to all entities with financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2024, the 3:1 debt-to-equity ratio requirements in determining thin capitalisation are replaced with a fixed limitation on interest deductions to the extent that the net interest exceeds 30% of the connected person’s tax EBITDA and the net interest expense exceeds NAD 3 million. (i.e. if the net interest expense does not exceed NAD million, this section will not apply).
Interest deductions not allowed for the current year are allowed to be carried forward for five years in respect of any taxpayer and ten years for entities involved in mining, petroleum, or green hydrogen industries. 
The term ’connected person‘ is now defined as “any person…has control over another person, or where both persons are under control of the same person…”. The definition includes an extensive list of when persons will be regarded as being ‘connected’ for purposes of Section 95A and also provides for instances when a person will be regarded as having ’control over another person‘. 
The section applies to the Petroleum Taxation Act; however, banking institutions and registered insurers/re-insurers are exempt.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
CFC rules are not applicable in Namibia.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
Branch income that is received or accrued from a source within, or deemed to be within, Namibia is taxable in Namibia based on the normal corporate tax rules.
A branch is regarded as an extension of its foreign head office. A branch may, therefore, not deduct fees paid to its foreign head office (unless a tax treaty provides for such a deduction), as it is argued that a branch cannot transact with itself. Reimbursement of actual expenses may, however, be deducted, subject to the normal deduction rules.
Transfer pricing rules apply to transactions between a branch and cross-border related parties.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
## Foreign tax credit
A tax credit may be claimed in Namibia for foreign taxes paid on dividends, royalties, and similar income, limited to the amount of tax payable in Namibia. Proof of the taxes paid in the foreign jurisdiction should be provided to Inland Revenue in order to claim the tax credit.
The claiming of foreign tax credits only applies to countries with which Namibia has a DTA.
## Manufacturing
The following is a high-level comparison of the different tax treatments for normal companies and registered manufacturing companies. This description does not consider the specific conditions that should be met in order for these incentives to be utilised. 
Certain existing preferential treatments granted in respect of registered manufacturers are in the process of being phased out. This will apply to all taxpayers (not only registered manufacturers) that export manufactured goods and who were previously allowed to claim an export sale allowance.
The special tax incentives granted to registered manufacturers in terms of Section 17A (remuneration and training allowance), 17B (export marketing allowance), and 17D (land-based transportation allowance) prior to 31 December 2021 will continue to apply up to the end of five years. Taxpayers who benefit from the export allowance in terms of Section 17C will have a grace period of five years before their incentive lapses. 
It also includes the insertion of Section 101A ’Repeal of certain provisions of Export Processing Zone Act, 1995’, the phasing out of tax exemptions pertaining to certain traders. 
Note that only the building allowance and preferential tax rate (_as set out below_) may create or increase a tax loss.
### Building allowance
A building allowance is deductible with respect to buildings used for purposes of trade.
For normal companies, the allowance is calculated as 20% of the cost of erection in the year in which the building enters service and 4% during the 20 years that follow.
For registered manufacturing companies, the allowance is calculated as 20% of the cost of erection in the year in which the building enters service and 8% during the ten years that follow.
### Employee cost allowances
For normal companies, expenditures for remuneration and training of employees are deductible for tax purposes.
For registered manufacturing companies, an additional allowance of 25% of remuneration and training of employees that are directly engaged in the manufacturing process are deductible. However, this allowance may not create or increase a tax loss. Deductions sought for training should be approved by the government.
### Export expenditure allowance
For normal companies, export expenditures incurred are deductible for tax purposes.
For registered manufacturing companies, an additional allowance of 25% of costs incurred in an export country, in order to export Namibian manufactured goods to such country, may be deducted. However, this allowance may not create or increase a tax loss.
### Export allowance
Any taxpayer (not required to be a registered manufacturer) that derives income from the export of goods manufactured in Namibia, excluding meat or fish, may deduct an export allowance equal to 80% of the taxable income derived from the export of manufactured goods.
Gross profit derived from the export of manufactured goods as a percentage of total gross profit should be used to determine the percentage of taxable income that is used to calculate the export allowance. However, this allowance may not create or increase a tax loss.
### Transport allowance
For normal companies, land-based transport costs (i.e. transport by road or rail) are deductible for tax purposes.
For registered manufacturing companies, an additional allowance of 25% of land-based transport cost in respect of material and components used in the manufacturing process or equipment imported for direct use in the manufacturing process may be deducted. However, this allowance may not create or increase a tax loss.
### Preferential tax rate
The normal tax rate for companies other than mining companies or registered manufacturers is 31% (for all entities having a financial year starting on or after 1 January 2024).
The tax rate for a registered manufacturer for taxable income with respect to the manufacturing activity for which they are registered is 18%. Generally, this preferential rate is applicable for a period of ten years from registration as a manufacturer; however, note the phasing out of all preferential treatments for registered manufacturers discussed above. 
## Export Processing Zones (EPZs)
In order to become an EPZ company, a particular entity must register with the EPZ governing body and obtain approval from the NamRA.
An EPZ company qualifies for the following benefits:
  * The company is exempt from corporate tax.
  * No VAT is payable on the sale of goods or services rendered in the zone.
  * No VAT is payable on goods imported or manufactured in the zone.
  * No customs or excise duty is payable on goods imported into the zone.
  * No stamp duty or transfer duty is payable in relation to the transfer of movable or immovable property in the zone.
  * A 75% refund of expenditures incurred in training Namibian citizens.
  * Some of the provisions in the Labour Relations Act do not apply in the zone.


Enterprises must comply with the following requirements in order to qualify for EPZ status:
  * Goods must be exported to countries other than countries in the SACU.
  * Industrial employment must be created or increased.
  * Namibia's export earnings must be increased as a result of manufactured goods exported.


EPZ companies may not be involved in retail business operations.
On 19 February 2020, the Minister of Finance tabled the Income Tax Amendment Bill 2020 in Parliament. The Bill includes an insertion of Section 101A 'Repeal of certain provisions of Export Processing Zone Act, 1995', which includes the phasing out of tax exemptions pertaining to certain traders. With the enactment of this bill, EPZ entities would be liable for income tax, stamp duties on goods and services required for EPZ activities, as well as transfer duties in respect of the acquisition of any immovable property situated in an EPZ. The enforcement of Section 101A in the Income Tax Act (no. 24 of 1981) will be determined and come into effect on a date to be determined by the Minister, by notice in the Government Gazette.


# Namibia, Republic of
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
WHTs are applicable where certain payments are made to non-Namibian residents.
## Dividends
Dividends declared by a Namibian company to a non-resident holding company are subject to NRST, a WHT. NRST is payable at the standard rate of 10% if at least 25% of shares are held in the Namibian company and the shareholder is a company. In all other cases, the NRST payable is 20%. DTA relief may be available.
NRST is payable within 20 days following the month that the dividends were declared.
## Interest
A WHT of 10%, calculated on the gross amount of interest, is payable on interest accruing to any person, other than a Namibian company, from a registered Namibian banking institution or unit trust scheme. The tax withheld is a final tax, and the financial institution is responsible to withhold the tax.
Namibian companies, however, are taxed on interest at the corporate tax rate.
It is the obligation of the financial institution to withhold the tax and pay such tax to the revenue authorities.
WHT of 10% is payable on the interest accruing or paid to a non-resident. The WHT is payable within 20 days after the interest payment was made. Interest is deemed to be paid on the earlier of the date on which the interest is paid or becomes due and payable.
Treaty relief may be available.
## Royalties or similar payments
WHT on royalties are payable when a Namibian company pays a royalty to a non-resident. WHT is levied at a fixed rate of 10% and is payable within 20 days after the end of the month during which the liability for payment is incurred.
A royalty includes payment for the use or right to use any patent or design, trademark, copyright, model, pattern, plan, formula, or process, or any other property or right of a similar nature. A royalty also includes the imparting of any scientific, technical, industrial, or commercial knowledge or information for use in Namibia. The nature of fees payable should therefore be carefully considered in order to determine whether the relevant amount represents a royalty. It also include payments made for the use or right to use industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment (i.e. rentals).
Treaty relief may be available.
## Services
Any Namibian resident paying a management or consultancy fee to a non-resident must withhold tax at 10%.
Management and consulting fees are specifically defined as: "any amount payable for administrative, managerial, technical, or consultative services or any similar services, whether such services are of a professional nature or not".
A branch is specifically included in the definition of a resident.
The rate is subject to DTA relief, where applicable.
Fees paid to non-resident directors and foreign entertainers are subject to WHT of 25%. No treaty relief is available.
## Summary of WHT payable
The WHT rates and treaty relief for Namibian DTAs can be summarised as follows. Note that the tax treaties contain certain requirements that should be met before the reduced tax rate may be applied.
The definitions of dividends, interest, and royalties in the various treaties should also be considered.
Recipient | WHT (%)  
---|---  
Dividends | Interest | Royalties | Management, administrative, technical, and consulting fees | Directors fees  
Non-treaty | 10/20 (1) | 10 (2) | 10 | 10 | 25  
Treaty:  
Botswana | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 (7) | 25

Sweden | 5/15 (3) | 10 | 5 | 10 (7) | 25  
United Kingdom | 5/10/15 (6) | 10 | 5 | 0 | 25  
Notes
  1. Lower rate applies where at least 25% of shares are held in the Namibian company. Higher rate applies otherwise.
  2. Namibian companies are taxed at the corporate tax rate on interest received.
  3. Lower rate applies where at least 10% of shares are held in the Namibian company. Higher rate applies otherwise.
  4. Rate depends on shareholding.
  5. Lower rate applies where at least 25% of shares are held in the Namibian company and recipient directly invested at least 100,000 United States dollars (USD) in the equity capital of the company paying the dividend. Higher rate applies otherwise.
  6. 5% where at least 50% of shares are held in the Namibian company. 10% where at least 25% of shares are held in the Namibian company. 15% otherwise.
  7. Local rates are lower than the 15% rate per the treaty.


## Mining royalties
The Minerals (Prospecting and Mining) Act levies a royalty on minerals won or mined by a licence holder in Namibia, based on the table below:
Group of minerals | Market value of minerals levied as a royalty (%)  
---|---  
Rough diamonds | 10  
Rough emeralds, rubies, and sapphires | 10  
Unprocessed dimension stone | 5  
Gold, copper, zinc, and other base metals | 3  
Semi-precious stones | 2  
Nuclear fuel minerals | 3  
Industrial minerals | 2  
Non-nuclear fuel minerals | 2  
Oil and gas | 5

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
## Inventory valuation
Inventory is valued at cost for tax purposes in Namibia.
The last in first out (LIFO) basis of valuation is only accepted if:
  * written consent was obtained from the Minister of Finance before such taxpayer renders one's income tax return for the first year of assessment for which the LIFO basis was adopted by the taxpayer, and 
  * various conditions are met by the taxpayer as determined by the Minister of Finance. 


## Capital gains
Other than profits on the sale of mining and petroleum licences/rights, and the transfer of any share/interest (whether directly or indirectly) in a company owning a mineral/petroleum licence or right, capital gains are not taxed in Namibia.
### Mining and Petroleum licences/rights
The sale, donation, expropriation, cession, grant, or any other alienation or transfer of ownership of any share or member's interest in a company that holds a mineral or petroleum licence/right, whether directly or indirectly, is included in the definition of gross income. The definition also specifically includes a sale of shares in a company for a licence or right to mine minerals or oil and gas in Namibia.
## Dividend income
Dividends received are exempt from tax. Non-resident shareholders tax (NRST) should be withheld on dividends declared to non-resident shareholders. _For more information on NRST, see the section._
## Interest income
Namibian companies are taxed on interest received from a Namibian source. Persons other than Namibian companies are subject to a final WHT on interest from banks and unit trusts. Interest paid to non-residents is subject to WHT on interest. _For more information, see the section._
## Partnership income
The relevant partners of a partnership are regarded as the responsible taxpayers and not the partnership itself.
In practice, the assessment of a partnership is treated like that of a private business. The partnership is first treated as a business entity on its own in terms of income and expenditure. The profit or loss at the end of the year is then allocated to the individual partners. If they derived a profit from the partnership, it is added to their other non-partnership income; or if the partnership made a loss, the partners have the right to deduct it from their non-partnership income.
## Rental income
Companies are taxed on rental income received from a Namibian source.
## Royalty income
Companies are taxed on royalty income received from a Namibian source.
## Foreign income
Corporate tax in Namibia is determined on the source basis; consequently, only income from a Namibian source or deemed Namibian source is subject to corporate tax.

Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
Namibia has a source-based tax system, which means that income from a source within Namibia or deemed to be within Namibia will be subject to tax in Namibia, unless a specific exemption is available.
Income earned by foreign companies from a source within or deemed to be within Namibia will be subject to tax in Namibia. In such cases, the foreign entity must determine whether it is obligated to register a local entity or branch. A foreign company is required to register a local company (local subsidiary) or an external company (branch) if it has established a place of business in Namibia.
In the event that Namibia has entered into a double tax agreement (DTA) with the country where the foreign company resides, such entity will only be taxable in Namibia if it has established a permanent establishment (PE) in Namibia. If a PE exists, only the portion of income attributable to the PE will be subject to tax in Namibia.
Non-residents who do not have a place of business in Namibia may, however, be subject to withholding taxes (WHTs). _See the section for more information._
## Calculation of taxable income
Gross income | The total amount, in cash or otherwise, received by or accrued to any person from a source within, or deemed to be within, Namibia, excluding receipts of a capital nature (provisions for specific inclusions in gross income and amounts deemed to be from a Namibian source exist).  
---|---  
Less: Exemptions | The Income Tax Act provides for certain amounts to be specifically exempt from tax.  
Equals: Income  
Less: Deductions  | Expenditures and losses actually incurred to generate income may be deducted, provided that these expenses are not of a capital nature.  
The Income Tax Act specifically provides for certain expenditures to be deductible and allows a deduction for capital allowances.  
Only expenses incurred to generate ‘income’ may be deducted. Expenses incurred to generate income exempt from tax are not deductible. Apportionment should be considered when expenses are incurred to generate both income and exempt income.  
Equals: Taxable income | Taxable income is taxed at the corporate tax rate _as set out under the Tax rates section below_.  
## Tax rates
The corporate tax rates are summarised below:
Entity | 2024/25 tax rate (%)  
---|---  
Domestic companies and close corporations (excluding entities mentioned below) (_30% rate effective for companies whose financial years will commence on or after 1 January 2025_) | 32 / 31  
Branches of foreign companies (_30% rate effective for companies whose financial years will commence on or after 1 January 2025_) | 32 / 31  
Registered manufacturers (only applicable for the first ten years of registration) | 18  
Diamond mining companies and companies that render services to such companies in connection with diamond mining | 55  
Mining companies (other than diamond mining companies) and companies that render services to such companies in connection with mining | 37.5  
Long-term insurers (the rate is applied to gross investment income) | 12.8  
Petroleum income tax rate | 35  
## Local income taxes

## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is a transaction tax, and the implications will vary for different transactions. Some transactions are taxed at a rate of 15% or 0% while other transactions are exempt from VAT. Input tax deductions may be claimed, subject to certain provisions.
VAT is levied on every taxable supply by a registered person. A taxable supply means any supply of goods or services in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. A taxable activity means any activity that is carried on continuously or regularly in Namibia that involves the supply of goods or services for consideration.
VAT is payable on all imports for home consumption in Namibia, subject to certain exemptions (e.g. in terms of a technical assistance agreement, donations to the state, goods of which the local supply is zero-rated).
Import VAT is payable on the greater of the free on board (FOB) value plus 10% or the market value. The payment may be deferred in terms of an import VAT account registered with the Namibia Revenue Agency (NamRA) to the 20th day of the month following the month of importation. Penalties of 10% per month or part of a month and 20% interest on outstanding import VAT, according to the Customs Asycuda reports on import VAT account numbers, are levied by the NamRA.
A company/branch is required to register for VAT if it supplies goods or services on a regular basis for consideration and if its taxable supplies (standard rated and zero-rated supplies) exceed NAD 1 million in any 12-month period.
The Value-added Tax Act, 2000 (as amended) also makes provision for voluntary VAT registration, provided that taxable supplies exceed or will exceed NAD 200,000 in any 12-month period and the applicant is in good tax standing, has a fixed place of business, and will keep acceptable accounting records.
A registered VAT vendor is entitled to deduct input tax credits paid in the course of taxable supplies made to such person, provided that a tax invoice is available to support the input tax deduction. It is also important to take note of deemed input tax deductions and prohibited input deductions. Import VAT paid may be deducted only as input tax if the import was in furtherance of a taxable activity and the required documentation (e.g. stamped customs entries) is held by the importer.
VAT returns are due within 25 days following the month to which the VAT relates.
The NamRa system automatically selects VAT periods for audits. An audit will focus on deposits made into bank statements and whether VAT was charged as required. It will also focus on whether tax invoices meet the criteria as set out in the VAT Act.
Shareholders of companies and members of close corporations may be held liable jointly or severally for VAT debts of the company or close corporation.
## Customs and excise duties
Namibia is a member of the Southern African Customs Union (SACU), and customs duties are not levied on intra-SACU trade (i.e. between Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland).
Customs duties are payable according to the Common Customs Tariff of SACU on imports from outside SACU. Preferential duty rates apply on imports from Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries, MERCOSUR countries, EFTA states, and in terms of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, while goods may be imported free of customs duties from Zimbabwe in terms of the Namibia-Zimbabwe Free Trade Agreement.
Excise duties are levied on local production of excisable products (e.g. cigarettes, liquor, fuel) and are included on most excisable products imported from another SACU country in terms of the duty at source procedures. Identical excise duty rates are applied throughout the SACU. Importation of excisable products from outside the SACU is subject to customs duties and specific customs duties.
Current specific excise/customs duty rates for the above-mentioned products are as follows:
  * Cigarettes: NAD 10.40/10 cigarettes.
  * Beer: NAD 2.17/340 ml.
  * Spirits (whisky, rum, brandy, gin, vodka, etc.): NAD 82.96/750 ml.
  * Petrol: 3.909 cents/litre.
  * Diesel and biodiesel: 3.817 cents/litre.
  * Illuminating kerosene (paraffin - unmarked): 3.817 cents/litre.
  * Illuminating kerosene (paraffin - marked): Nil.


_Ad valorem_ excise/customs duties are levied on certain products (e.g. motor vehicles, perfumes) in addition to the normal customs duties.
_Ad valorem_ excise/customs duty rates are as follows for the above-mentioned goods:
  * Motor vehicles: ([0.00003 x A] - 0.75)%, with a maximum of 25%, where 'A' is the recommended retail price, exclusive of VAT.
  * Perfumes: 7%.


Customs fuel levies are payable on petrol, diesel, and illuminating kerosene. The current customs fuel levies are as follows:
  * Petrol: NAD 1.20/litre.
  * Diesel: NAD 1.20/litre.
  * Illuminating kerosene (paraffin): Nil.


Road user charges (RUCs) payable to the Namibian Road Fund Administration (RFA) may be claimed back for certain non-road operations (e.g. mining, farming, construction) under certain conditions (e.g. NAD 0.9 of the current RFA RUCs of NAD 1.36 used in mining operations may be claimed back from the RFA).
Surety in the form of a provisional payment, bank, or insurance guarantee is required by Customs on most temporary imports to cover import VAT and customs duties (if applicable).
It is possible to import goods that are subject to customs duties into registered Customs' bonded warehouses, where goods are kept for later use. In this case, the payment of duties may be deferred until the goods are taken out of the bonded warehouse for home consumption or acquitted if the goods are subsequently exported.
Namibia has introduced the AsycudaWorld customs clearing system, which is a web-based, Java-enabled system utilised at points of entry. All land border posts, airports, and harbours are linked to the AsycudaWorld system.
## Environmental levies
Namibia introduced environmental levies on the following products imported or manufactured locally:
  * Carbon dioxide emissions from a wide range of vehicles, including trucks.
  * Certain light bulbs.
  * Certain lubricants.
  * Pneumatic tyres.
  * Disposable batteries.
  * Certain plastic bags.


## Property taxes
Property taxes are levied by municipalities based on municipal valuations of properties.
## Transfer duty
Transfer duty is payable at 12% of the acquisition value where property is acquired by non-natural persons (a sliding scale applies to property purchases by natural persons). While it is normally payable by the buyer, the agreement for the sale of the property may determine the person liable to pay these costs.
The Transfer Duty Amendment Act (No. 6 of 2024) was amended in September 2024 to include the following:
  * Transfer duty on the sales of shares/members interest in property/mining right-owning entities.
  * A super tax transfer duty and stamp duty bracket for luxury residential property costing more than NAD 12 million.
  * An updated sliding scale for property transfers by natural persons.


The said amendments are effective from 1 October 2024.
## Stamp duty
Certain transactions may attract stamp duty. The amount of stamp duty payable differs and is based on the nature of every individual transaction.
The basic transactions can be summarised as follows:
Transaction | Stamp duty  
---|---  
Agreements or contracts (other than those where duty is specifically provided for in the Act) | NAD 5  
Lease agreement or lease | The stamp duty will be based on lease payments, together with additional considerations specified in the lease agreement  
Transfer or issue of marketable securities and other share transactions | NAD 2 for every NAD 1,000 or part thereof of the value/consideration, depending on the specific transaction  
Transfer deed relating to immovable property purchased | NAD 12 for every NAD 1,000 or part thereof of the value/consideration, depending on the specific transaction  
Additional stamp duty of NAD 5 for every NAD 1,000 of debt secured is payable on the registration of a bond over immovable property.
The Stamp Duty Amendment Act (No. 7 of 2024) increased the exempt level of stamp duties in terms of schedule 1 (i.e. natural persons) from NAD 600,000 to NAD 1.1 million, effective from 1 October 2024.
## Annual duty
Annual duty is levied in terms of the Companies Act at an amount of NAD 6.5 for every NAD 10,000 (or part thereof) of the issued share capital of a company, with a minimum duty of NAD 120  _per annum_. Issued share capital includes ordinary shares, share premium, and preference shares.
Since a branch does not issue share capital, the issued share capital of the head office will be used to calculate the annual duty payable in Namibia.
## Payroll taxes
Any remuneration paid by an employer to an employee will place an obligation on the employer to withhold employee taxes. The employee taxes are due on the 20th day of the month following the month during which the payment was made. _The tax tables applicable to individuals are provided in the section of Namibia’s Individual tax summary._
Late payment of employee taxes will result in penalties of 10% per month and interest of 20% _per annum_. Both penalties and interest are limited to the amount of tax outstanding.
## Social security contributions
Social security contributions are payable by the employer for employees working in Namibia. Social security is based on a principle of 50/50 contributions from employers and employees. It is calculated at 0.9% of earnings, with a minimum monthly contribution of NAD 2.70 and a maximum monthly contribution of NAD 81 each (i.e. the total maximum monthly contribution of both the employer and the employee will amount to NAD 162).
## Workmen's compensation
Under the Employees Compensation Act, employers are required to contribute to a fund that provides cash benefits for industrial injury, disability, and death. Contribution rates vary according to inherent occupational risk, from less than 1% in most low-risk commercial/administrative occupations to 8% for high-risk sectors (drilling, tunnelling, and rock-blasting). Employees whose annual remuneration exceeds NAD 81,300 are normally excluded from coverage.
