## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 11 June 2024
## Minimum monthly salary
As of 1 January 2024, the minimum monthly salary is increased to 933 Bulgarian lev (BGN) (from BGN 780 for 2023). 
## Tax relief for children 
The increased value (the same as for 2022) for tax reliefs for minor children will apply for 2023. One of the parents will be able to deduct from their annual tax base:
  * BGN 6,000 for one child
  * BGN 12,000 for two children
  * BGN 18,000 for three or more children, and
  * BGN 12,000 for children with disabilities.


The relief for 2023 may be applied through the employer on a monthly basis or through the quarterly/annual tax return(s) of the beneficiary parent.
## Trading in financial assets 
Transactions with virtual currencies are expressly added to the list of taxable transactions with financial assets. Until now, virtual currencies were not expressly included in the list of taxable financial assets; nevertheless, the tax authorities had the view that these should have been taxed (being financial assets). The tax base of all transactions with financial assets is decreased by a fixed amount of 10% (to give some allowance to the investors to cover costs related to the investment operations).
## Changes in the income certificate under Article 45 of the Personal Income Tax Act (PITA) 
Upon request by the employees, the employer shall issue a standard template income certificate for the employment income paid during the respective year, including for certain types of non-taxable income, such as:
  * food vouchers
  * business trip per diem allowance exceeding BGN 1,000
  * other non-taxable compensations expressly listed (mostly applicable to state employees, such as policemen, judges, soldiers and officers in the Bulgarian army, etc.), and
  * certain social expenses provided to the employees for cases such as childbirth or adoption, marriage or death of a member of the family, and others expressly listed in the law.


## Changes in the report submitted by the payer of non-employment income under Article 73 of the PITA 
The amounts reported in the declaration under Article 73(1) of the PITA (for year 2024 and onwards) shall also include:
  * business trip per diems provided to individuals under non-employment relationship exceeding BGN 1,000 per person
  * the income from consumer dividends distributed by agricultural cooperations, and
  * the income from rent of agricultural land exceeding BGN 3,000 per individual (this item should be reported in the declaration for 2023 as well).


## Opportunity for declaring non-taxable income and income taxed with final tax
Bulgarian residents are now able to voluntarily report information for an extended scope of non-taxable income, as well as income taxed with final tax, in the annual personal tax return under Article 50 of the PITA.
## Change in the scope of income that employers should report in the income statements
At the request of the employee, the employer should issue an income statement for non-taxable income from labour relations under Article 24 of the PITA. The income statement should include the total amounts from food vouchers, paid non-taxable benefits, one-time benefits at the expense of social costs, non-taxable monetary and material prizes, etc.
Employers should also report such types of non-taxable income in the declaration under Article 73, Paragraph 6 of the PITA.
The changes apply to income paid in 2022 as well.
## Fast track for granting a Blue Card for high-tech companies relocating employees to Bulgaria
The Blue Card will be a key tool for attracting highly qualified personnel, featuring faster procedures, more flexible and inclusive admission criteria, and broader rights, including facilitated short- and long-term mobility.
The new 'fast track' will affect applications for groups of a minimum of ten employees and is intended to benefit companies aiming to relocate whole offices and their activities and employees from non-European Union (EU) countries to Bulgaria.
In order for Blue Card applications to be considered as priority ones, they need to meet the following conditions:
  * Application for a group of at least ten employees.
  * The company produces products/provides services with high added value to the Bulgarian economy.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 11 June 2024
Individuals are taxed in Bulgaria based on their tax residency status. Bulgarian tax residents are taxed on their worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed in Bulgaria only on their Bulgarian-source income, which has a very broad legal definition. Generally, this is all income derived as a result of economic activities performed in the territory of Bulgaria or as a result of disposal of property in Bulgaria.Any income derived as a result of employment or of rendering services in the territory of Bulgaria is deemed Bulgarian-source income, regardless of from where or by whom it is paid.Rental income or income from disposal of real estate property located in Bulgaria is considered Bulgarian-source income.
## Personal income tax rates
A flat tax rate of 10% applies to all personal income, with some exceptions.


# Bulgaria
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 11 June 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year in Bulgaria is, without exception, the calendar year.
## Tax returns
In general, taxpayers have to submit annual tax returns. Employees who work on the basis of an employment contract with a local employer are not obligated to submit tax returns if they have employment income only, the entire income has been taxed during the year via the employer’s monthly payroll withholding, and at 31 December of the tax year they have only one employer who makes an annual reconciliation of the due tax by 31 January of the following year. In all other cases, individuals, including those who receive income under employment contracts with non-resident employers, are obligated to file an annual tax return.
For tax purposes, spouses are treated as separate taxpayers. No income splitting is allowed. Income is declared in the year in which it is actually received, regardless of the year when it was earned and to which it relates.
The deadline for submission of tax returns is 30 April of the following year. A reduction of 5% of the outstanding income tax is applicable if the annual tax return is filed electronically by 31 March of the following year, the individual has no outstanding public liabilities, and the tax is paid by 31 March of the following year. The discount of 5% is capped at BGN 500.
Individuals are allowed to file a one-off corrective tax return without a penalty by 30 September of the following year. 
The following information also needs to be declared in the annual PIT return of a Bulgarian tax resident:
  * Dividend income from shares in foreign entities received in the tax year, although taxable with a final tax of 5%. 
  * Shares acquired in foreign companies. 
  * Immovable property owned abroad. 
  * The following amounts of granted and received monetary loans: 
    * The outstanding part of monetary loans granted during the tax year if the total amount of the loans exceeds BGN 10,000. 
    * The outstanding part of monetary loans granted during the current and the preceding five tax years if the total amount of the outstanding part exceeds BGN 40,000. 
    * The outstanding part of monetary loans received during the tax year if the total amount of the loans exceeds BGN 10,000, except for the loans received from credit institutions. 
    * The outstanding part of monetary loans received during the current and the preceding five tax years, except for the loans received from credit institutions, if the total amount of the outstanding part exceeds BGN 40,000. 


As of 1 January 2018, Bulgarian tax resident individuals are able to report the following in their annual PIT return:
  * Received non-taxable income; 
  * Inherited property; 
  * Property acquired as a result of restored title by virtue of legislation. 


The reasons for this amendment are optimisation of the processes related to tax inspections and tax audits of individuals concerning the comparison of the property acquired in the course of the year and the reported income. Up to now, there was no possibility to report received non-taxable income, and its assessment was possible only through the performance of a tax inspection or tax audit. 
## Payment of tax
The deadline for payment is 30 April of the following year.
PIT for employees is withheld by the employer from the gross remuneration on a monthly basis. The employer acts as an agent of the revenue authorities and transfers the tax due to the budget. Certain taxpayers who are not employees, such as freelancers, must pay quarterly advance taxes, regardless of whether the payer is a Bulgarian or non-Bulgarian resident entity.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitation is currently five years from 1 January of the year following the year in which the tax was due for payment.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 11 June 2024
## Personal deductions
### Charitable contributions
Donations to certain organisations are deductible up to the defined limits (i.e. the total amount of donations may not exceed 65% of the total annual taxable base of the individual).
### Social security contributions
Mandatory social security contributions in Bulgaria or another EU/EEA country borne by individuals are tax deductible in full (in the presence of supporting documentation).
### Health and life insurance contributions
Voluntary pension and unemployment contributions, as well as certain health insurance and life insurance contributions, are deductible up to certain limits.
### Mortgage interest expenses
Young married couples (including foreign individual tax residents of an EU/EEA member state) may deduct from their annual taxable income the interest on mortgage loans for the first BGN 100,000 of the loan, under certain conditions.
### Children and disabled children
Tax incentives can be utilised both by local and EU/EEA established individuals. The tax incentives for children provide for reduction of the total annual tax base calculated under the PITA of the parent in the following amounts:
  * BGN 6,000 in case of one child.
  * BGN 12,000 in case of two children.
  * BGN 18,000 in case of three and more children.


The conditions for this tax relief require that the child is underage, not placed in a specialised care institution as at 31 December of the fiscal year, and is a resident of an EU/EEA member state as at the same date. This relief can be used by a parent who is not deprived of parental rights, a guardian, a family member or close relative where the child is placed, or a foster parent. Only one parent (or foster parent or close relative) may benefit from this new tax relief. If a double benefit is determined after а review, the amount of the relief has to be returned to the authorities. 
Tax incentives of BGN 12,000 per a disabled child are also introduced and are applicable under certain specific conditions.
A new opportunity is introduced with regards to the tax relief for children. Individuals may use the tax relief for children in advance by reducing the monthly taxable base for July and October with certain amounts by BGN 500 per month per child (BGN 1,000 per month per disabled child) for employment income, as follows:
  * For the month of July, the monthly taxable base may be reduced by the sum of the amounts for the months January to June.
  * For the month of October, the monthly taxable base may be reduced by the sum of the amounts for the months of July to September.
  * For the months of October to December, the tax relief is used in calculating the annual tax base.


## Tax relief for individuals who use non-cash methods for payment of their expenses
The requirements for tax relief for individuals who use non-cash methods for payment of their expenses are that the individual has received taxable income during the tax year, 100% of the taxable income to be received is by bank transfers, at least 80% of the expenses of the individual are to be paid by non-cash methods, and the individual must have no outstanding public liabilities at the date of filing of the annual tax return. The tax relief is 1% from the total tax liability in Bulgaria for the tax year, but capped to BGN 500.
All tax reliefs above may be used only in case the individual has no outstanding public liabilities at the date of filing of the annual tax return.
## Tax relief for improvements and/or repairs made to a real estate property located in Bulgaria
Both local and EU/EEA established individuals can benefit. The tax relief provides for reduction of the total annual tax base calculated under the PITA with the payments made during the year for work done in relation to improvements and/or repair of a real estate up to BGN 2,000.
The tax relief is applicable under certain specific conditions.
## Business deductions
Individuals earning certain types of income can deduct pre-estimated statutory expenses in calculating their taxable income:
  * Freelancers, civil contractors, notary officers, physicians, dentists, or other private practitioners may deduct 25% from their gross income. VAT registration may be required after achieving certain turnover.
  * As of 1 January 2023, the statutory expenses (deductible from the taxable base) for lawyers will be increased from 25% to 40% (i.e. 60% of their gross income will be subject to taxation).
  * Royalties are subject to 40% statutory deductions.
  * Rental income is subject to 10% statutory deductions.
  * Income of agricultural producers (including tobacco producers) is subject to 60% statutory deductions.

## Individual - Other issues
Last reviewed - 11 June 2024
## Visas and work permits
Effective from 1 January 2007, EU nationals are not required to obtain visas or work permits to be allowed to enter or work in the country. EU nationals wishing to work or reside in Bulgaria for more than three months should obtain a certificate of residence. This is a relatively straightforward registration procedure (i.e. the certificate is issued within one working day and may be valid for up to five years if a valid contract/assignment letter/financial means and social security coverage is in place for this term). Non-EU nationals need to obtain a work permit in order to legally work in the country. The procedure is time-consuming, and various documents need to be submitted to the labour authorities. On the basis of the work permit, the expatriate should apply for a long-term visa type D and later for a Bulgarian residence permit, which would allow one to reside and work legally in Bulgaria. No work permits are required for non-EU nationals who are registered with Bulgarian Commercial Register as managers, board members, procurators, or controllers of Bulgarian companies or are registered with the Bulgarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry as heads of representative offices of foreign entities. Such individuals need a visa D and a residence permit only.
### Blue Card Regime
As of 2011, the so-called ‘Blue Card’ was introduced, which gives working/residing rights in Bulgaria (and residence rights in a few EU member states) to non-EU nationals with high qualification and specialisation skills. The main requirements for obtaining a Blue Card in Bulgaria are:
  * Having a diploma proving at least a three-year educational course from a university or another institution of higher education, which is valid and accepted in Bulgaria.
  * The local gross salary should be at least 1.5 times higher than the average salary in Bulgaria, as per the statistical data for the previous 12 months before the conclusion of the job contract.
  * The Bulgarian employer has to motivate its denial to hire Bulgarian/EU/EEA/Switzerland national before the Bulgarian employment authorities.


As of 23 March 2018, new rules have been adopted in relation to the issuance of the EU Blue Card for certain types of highly skilled non-EU professionals:
  * The mandatory 'market test' is abolished for all types of professions.
  * The period of the EU Blue Card has been extended to five years.


As of 2022, a new regime, called 'fast track', has been introduced for high-tech companies relocating employees to Bulgaria. This regime is intended to ease the relocation of big groups as they would be considered priority applications. In order to qualify, the applicants need to meet the following criteria:
  * The application must be submitted for a group of at least ten employees.
  * The company should qualify as an entity that produces products or provides services with high added value to the Bulgarian economy.


Changes to the Law on Health Insurance have also been adopted, through which holders of the EU Blue Card enter the circle of persons subject to compulsory health insurance in Bulgaria.


# Bulgaria
## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 11 June 2024
Individuals must pay personal income tax (PIT) on their gross income less any mandatory social security contributions they make at their own expense. Very few other deductions are possible.
## Employment income
Taxable income from work on the basis of an employment contract includes the following:
  * Salary, wages, or any other remuneration for work performed, including for length of service, higher professional qualifications, unhealthy or specific work conditions, as well as any additional compensation (e.g. cost-of-living adjustments, bonuses, premiums, overtime pay).
  * All fringe benefits and benefits in kind provided by the employer or for the account of the employer.
  * Certain compensations received by the employee on the basis of the Labour Code (in general, for some cases of termination of the employment contract, unutilised paid leave, etc.).
  * Income received by managers, controllers, and members of management and supervisory boards, as well as by shareholders of limited liability and joint-stock companies holding more than 5% of the capital.


Employment income is taxed at a 10% flat tax rate.
## Business income
Business income of individuals registered as sole traders form the taxable base under the provisions of the Corporate Income Tax (CIT) Act (i.e. income minus expenses plus adjustments equals taxable profit). If the turnover exceeds BGN 100,000 in 12 consecutive months, the sole trader is subject to VAT registration. VAT registration may be required regardless of the turnover in certain cases.
Patent activities of sole traders are taxed under the provisions of the Local Taxes and Fees Act.
Sole traders file annual PIT returns. The deadline for reporting and payment of PIT due by sole traders is between 1 March and 30 June.
Sole traders can benefit from a 5% discount, provided that they report and pay their PIT due until 31 March of the following year.
## Capital gains and investment income
Bulgarian tax residents (including expatriates who are considered Bulgarian tax residents) are taxed on capital gains and investment income realised from all sources during their period of residence. Foreign tax residents are taxed only on the capital gains and investment income derived from sources in Bulgaria.
### Capital gains
Capital gains are taxed on an annual basis with a 10% flat tax rate if received by Bulgarian tax residents, and with a 10% final withholding tax (WHT) if received by non-residents. Certain exemptions provided in respect of capital gains are discussed under _Exempt income below_.The taxable base for income from capital gains is determined as follows:
  * The taxable base for income from disposal or exchange of immovable property, including limited property rights, is the positive difference between the sales price and the acquisition price, reduced by 10% statutory deductions.
  * The taxable base for income arising from disposal or exchange of vehicles, works of art, antiques etc. is the positive difference between the sales price and the acquisition price.
  * The taxable base for income arising from sale or exchange of stocks, shares, compensatory instruments, investment bonds and other financial instruments, and from foreign currency transactions is the total amount of capital gains realised during the year reduced by the total amount of the capital losses incurred during the year.


Note that generally the acquisition price is determined as the 'documentarily supported acquisition price' of the property. There are special rules for determining the acquisition price in case there is no documentary evidence thereof.
### Dividend income
Dividends and liquidation proceeds paid by Bulgarian and foreign entities are subject to a 5% final WHT at source. When the dividends/liquidation proceeds are paid by non-resident entities who are not obligated to withhold and remit the Bulgarian taxes, the tax is payable by the recipient themselves on an annual basis. The dividend income paid by non-resident entities should also be reported in the annual tax return. 
### Interest income
Interest income from bank accounts in the European Union / European Economic Area is tax free as of 1 April 2022.
Interest income from bank accounts outside the European Union / European Economic Area is taxable at a tax rate of 10% as of 1 April 2022 instead of a final tax rate of 8% for Bulgarian tax residents and 10% final tax rate for non-Bulgarian tax residents.
### Rental income
Income from rent or other rights of use against consideration (except for rent from agricultural land), as well as income from annuities and leases, is subject to quarterly advance PIT at 10% and a final tax on an annual basis at the flat rate of 10%. Advance tax is not due for the fourth quarter unless the individual confirms in writing before the payer of the income one's willingness to apply an advance tax withholding for the fourth quarter.
For tax purposes, a statutory deduction of 10% of the gross income is provided.
### Royalty income
Royalties are taxed on an annual basis with a 10% flat tax rate if received by Bulgarian tax residents and a 10% final WHT if received by non-residents.
## Other income
The following basic types of income are also subject to PIT (the list, however, is not comprehensive).
  * Income received by freelancers, individuals supplying personal services, and artisans.
  * Income from sale of agricultural products.
  * Monetary and in-kind prizes from various competition events.
  * Compensations for lost profits and defaults of a similar nature.
  * Income from incidental transactions.


Amounts redeemed early from voluntary pension, health, unemployment and/or vocational qualification and life insurance coverage, are subject to 10% final tax.
## Exempt income
Some types of non-taxable income are listed below, subject to specific conditions and requirements set in the law:
  * Capital gains realised by Bulgarian tax residents and residents of EU/EEA member states on disposal of one residential real estate property per year if it was in the possession of the individual for more than three years and up to two other real estate properties if they were in the possession of the individual for more than five years.
  * Capital gains from transactions with securities of public companies on the Bulgarian Stock Exchange or on a regulated securities market in EU/EEA countries.
  * Profits distributed in the form of new company shares or increase of the nominal value of existing shares.
  * Income under voluntary pension schemes received upon retirement.
  * Interest and discounts on bonds.
  * Interest income from bank accounts in the European Union / European Economic Area.
  * Some types of social benefits provided by the employer in kind and taxed at the corporate level.
  * Business trip daily allowances, within certain limits.
  * Certain payments and benefits provided by the employer in accordance with the Bulgarian labour code.


Property received on the grounds of inheritance, donation, or restitution is not considered income taxable under the PITA. However, other taxes and fees may be applicable.
