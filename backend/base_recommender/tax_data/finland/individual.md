## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
## Foreign tax relief
Finnish residents can obtain credit for final income taxes paid abroad against income taxes payable in Finland on the same income. However, other than foreign national (federal) taxes, other taxes cannot be credited in Finland unless they are covered in an appropriate tax treaty. In some tax treaties, the exemption with progression method is used instead of the credit method in eliminating double taxation, either as a main rule or for some income types. Also, foreign advance taxes can be credited, but the credit needs to be finally confirmed when the final amount of foreign taxes is available, and a correction of assessment may be needed. Any unused foreign tax credits can be carried forward for five years.

## Personal income tax rates for resident individuals
Finland taxes residents on their worldwide income. Earned income received by residents is taxed at progressive tax rates for national tax purposes and at a flat tax rate for municipal (and church and social security) tax purposes.
### National tax rates
National tax rates for 2025 applicable to earned income are as follows:
Taxable income (EUR*) | Tax on column 1 (EUR) | Tax on excess (%)  
---|---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 21,200 | 0 | 12.64  
21,200 | 31,500 | 2,680 | 19.00  
31,500 | 52,100 | 4,637 | 30.25  
52,100 | 88,200 | 10,868 | 34.00  
88,200 | 150,000 | 23,142 | 41.75  
150,000 | 49,944 | 44.25  
* euros
Capital (investment) income is taxed at rates of 30% and 34% (the latter percentage is applicable when the annual taxable capital income exceeds EUR 30,000).
### Local income taxes
Municipal tax is levied at flat rates on taxable income determined for municipal taxation. The rate varies between 4.70 % and 10.90 %, depending on the municipality. The average municipal tax rate utilised in specific progressive taxation for non-tax residents is 7.50 %.
### Church tax
Church tax is payable by members of the Evangelic Lutheran, Orthodox, and Finnish German church in Finland at flat rates on the taxable income determined for municipal taxation. Rates vary between 1% and 2.25%, depending on the parish concerned.
### Public broadcasting tax
Public broadcasting tax is levied on taxable income. The rate of public broadcasting tax is 2.5% on annual income exceeding EUR 15,150; however, the maximum amount is EUR 160. Individuals are not liable to pay the tax if their annual income is EUR 15,150 or less, if the individual is under 18 years old, or if the individual lives in the Province of Åland. Åland has its own media fee, which has the same requirements concerning age and income limit, and the amount of the fee is fixed to EUR 127.
### Foreign expert tax regime
The foreign expert tax regime provides a flat tax rate of 32% on Finnish-source salary income for those foreign employees whose work requires special knowledge and who would be otherwise taxed at the normal progressive tax rates applicable to resident individuals. Other conditions are that the cash salary is at least EUR 5,800 in each month during the validity period of the regime. The regime cannot be applied if the person has been resident in Finland within the last five calendar years preceding the commencement of working in Finland or is a Finnish national.
The foreign expert tax regime has been applicable for a maximum of 84 months from the commencement of working in Finland. After that period, the salary is taxed according to the normal rules. The application for the regime must be filed within 90 days from starting to work in Finland. If a person has received a decision for a shorter period than 84 months, they must apply for an extension within 30 days from the date when the applicability period of the original decision ended.
## Personal income tax rates for non-resident individuals
A non-resident individual (e.g. occasionally working in Finland) is taxed on Finnish-source income only. Unless lower rates are provided in a tax treaty, tax rates are 35% on employment income and 30% on dividends, interest (however, interest income is normally not taxable for a non-resident) and royalties. In principle, no itemised deductions are allowed against the aforementioned income. When the 35% tax-at-source tax is collected, EUR 510 per full month is deducted from the taxable amount of income. EUR 17 per day is deducted from the total amount of income accumulated over a period of less than a month. However, the maximum deduction is the amount of income. In order to get a deduction, the deduction must be mentioned in the individual’s withholding tax card. Finnish-source pension income is taxed at the progressive tax rate (if a tax treaty does not prevent Finland to tax the pension).
A non-resident may also request to be taxed on one's income earned in Finland through tax assessment (i.e. progressive taxation) instead of fixed tax at source. The regulation applies to non-residents who live in the European Economic Area (EEA) or in a country with which Finland has concluded an agreement on execution assistance and information exchange in tax matters, or those who hold a residence permit with a researcher status.
The provisions on tax at source on earned income remain to be valid for those non-residents who do not apply for a non-resident tax withholding card or express in any other way their will that taxation shall be carried out through assessment. In general, non-residents subject to tax at source do not have reporting liabilities in Finland as the entity paying the income takes care of the tax-at-source withholding as well as the reporting liabilities in Finland.
In progressive taxation of a non-resident's earned income, the non-resident's worldwide earned income (i.e. salary income, pension income, and social security benefits) is taken into account when calculating the tax on income earned in Finland (exemption with progression). However, the income received abroad, or income received from Finland that is not taxable in Finland in accordance with provisions of an applicable tax treaty, is not taken into account in the progression if the individual lives within the European Economic Area or holds a residence permit with a researcher status and the taxable earned income received from Finland is at least 75% of the individual's total earned income.
Remuneration to artists and sportsmen is subject to 15% tax at source (no deductions available).
Finnish-source income other than mentioned above is subject to income tax at normal tax rates (earned income is taxed at a progressive tax rate and capital income at rates of 30% or 34%) unless a tax treaty provides otherwise. For example, rental income from property located in Finland is subject to assessment and the net rental income is taxed at 30% or 34%.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December. The tax liability of a foreign resident begins from the day that person moves to Finland and ends when that person moves out of Finland. Basically, the same tax rules apply for a full year of residency as for part of a year of residency.
## Tax returns
Spouses file separate returns; joint filing or income splitting is not possible.
In most cases, individuals receive pre-completed tax returns in March of the year following the tax year. The due date is in April; however, if there is no information to be added or corrected, it is not necessary to return the pre-completed tax return to the tax authorities.
Non-resident individuals generally do not file any tax return because the final tax is withheld at source from their Finnish-source income. However, for taxable income not subject to the tax at source withholding (e.g. rental income taxable in Finland), a tax return must be filed in accordance with the normal procedure.
## Payment of tax
Income tax shall be withheld from salaries and most other types of income (e.g. pensions, other remuneration for work than salary, and dividends paid by publicly quoted Finnish companies).
Generally, if individuals receive income not subject to withholding (e.g. salary paid abroad by a foreign entity having no PE in Finland), they are required to make monthly payments of estimated tax if they receive a preliminary tax bill from the tax authorities. Otherwise, they can consider whether to apply for a preliminary tax decision from the tax authorities or just report the income on the tax return and wait for the final tax bill. Interest is payable on residual tax not paid until the end of January following the tax year in question.
Residual tax is assessed by the Tax Administration according to the filed tax return. The due dates vary; however, until the residual tax is assessed, the individual may pay income taxes voluntarily to reduce the interest (6.5% in 2025) assessed on residual tax due. The due dates are visible on the taxpayer’s tax assessment (tax decision). Tax refunds are paid between August and December in the tax assessment year.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
## Employment expenses
Expenses incurred in acquiring or maintaining taxable income are, in principle, deductible items.
The maximum allowance for travel expenses between home and work is EUR 7,000 with a threshold share of EUR 900. Generally, the travel expenses deducted are calculated using the least expensive means of transportation (public transportation: train, bus, metro etc.).
Other deductions for earning income may include expenses for professional literature, own tools, using a home office for obtaining income, and so on, against original receipts. Instead of basing the deduction on receipts, it is also possible to claim a standardised deduction (either EUR 230, EUR 460, or EUR 920, depending on certain requirements) for using a home office for work. Moving, automobile, and entertainment expenses are generally not deductible.
If the employer does not reimburse for increased living expenses due to business trips, a deduction from earned income may be available. The amount of deduction shall be based either on actual expenses or a fixed amount determined annually in the tax authorities’ guidelines. Also, travelling and accommodation expenses due to business trips may be deducted if not reimbursed by the employer.
A standard deduction of EUR 750 from salary income is granted if actual business expenses are below that amount.
## Personal deductions
### Pension premiums
Mandatory pension premiums are fully deductible from earned income for both national and municipal tax purposes.
The deductibility of voluntary pension contributions is limited, and they are deducted from capital income (maximum deduction of EUR 5,000).
Other savings in certain long-term investments (e.g. a long-term savings contract with a bank, investment fund company, or other investment service company) are also entitled to the same deduction as the contributions to voluntary pension insurances.
### Unemployment insurance premiums
Mandatory unemployment insurance premiums are deductible from earned income for both national and municipal tax purposes.
### Interest expenses
Interest paid related to investment loans are deductible from capital income. If the deductions related to capital income exceed the amount of capital income, the end result is a capital income deficit of which 30% can be deducted from income taxes on earned income up to certain limit.
### Household expenses
Household deduction can be availed for certain care and repair work, as well as installation and advising work related to telecommunications technology (e.g. installation work with personal computers, televisions, and other devices), done at the individual’s home, holiday home, or parents’ or grandparents’ home, up to EUR 1,600 per year (EUR 150 threshold share). The deduction can be granted only to cover costs of the actual work (i.e. the deduction is not granted for costs such as equipment, material costs, or travel expenses), and the hired company must be registered for prepayment register. In addition, the deduction cannot be granted if benefits, such as family care support, voucher for social and health care services, or energy subsidy have been received.
The following temporary changes concern the tax year 2025:
The deduction for expenses related to the move from oil heating to more sustainable energy sources will be increased as follows:
  * The maximum deduction is EUR 3,500 (normally EUR 1,600).
  * The deduction is 60% of the work-related expenses specified on a contractor’s invoice and 30% of the wages that the household has paid to a worker.
  * The threshold share is EUR 150 per tax year.
  * The temporary change is in force in 2022-2027.


The deduction concerning other renovating costs remains the same as before (i.e. the maximum deduction is EUR 1,600 [EUR 150 credit threshold], 35% of the work-related expenses paid to a company, and 13% of the wages if household is the employer of the individual performing the work).
### Accommodation costs
Accommodation costs of a second home needed because of two (or more) permanent workplaces can be deducted. Certain conditions must be met. The maximum deduction is EUR 450 per month.
### Donation deduction
Individuals and death estates are allowed to deduct cash donations of a minimum of EUR 850 and a maximum of EUR 500,000 from earned income if the purpose of the donation is development of science or art. The requirement for deduction is that the donation is made to a university with public financing that is located in the European Economic Area or to a related university fund. The purpose of this change is to advance private finance of universities.

## Employment income
Taxable personal income includes, _inter alia_ , wages and salaries in money and in kind, director fees, employee stock option benefits, employer provided housing, pensions and annuities, living and housing allowances, car benefits, and unemployment benefits. Reimbursements for travelling expenses due to business trips (including _per diems_) are tax exempt in accordance with the conditions and limits set forth in the tax authorities' annual decision. The tax authorities also provide annually a decision of the taxable values of fringe benefits. Certain fringe benefits have deemed taxable values (e.g. company car, company provided housing, lunch benefit). Otherwise, fringe benefits are valued at the fair market value. Certain benefits provided to the whole staff are tax exempt if they can be regarded as reasonable and usual (e.g. health care, discounts on products and services produced by the employer, certain non-cash gifts, leisure activities).According to the Income Tax Act, Finland may tax a leased employee's salary income paid for work performed in Finland even though the employee would remain non-resident in Finland (normally Finland cannot tax salary income paid abroad to a non-resident even though the individual would work in Finland, provided that the employee does not work for a foreign employer's permanent establishment [PE] located in Finland). The leased non-resident employee has an obligation to apply for an advance tax by the end of a calendar month following the commencement of working in Finland. Furthermore, the foreign entity that leases the employee or its representative in Finland and the Finnish ordering entity have certain reporting obligations towards the tax authorities. However, the aforementioned rules are applicable only if Finland has concluded with the home country a tax treaty that includes a specific provision regarding the leased employees or Finland has no double tax treaty (DTT) in force with the home country.
## Capital income
### Capital gains
Capital gains are basically fully taxable and included in the taxable capital income subject to 30% tax rate up to taxable capital income of EUR 30,000 and 34% tax rate on the excess.A gain from sale of a home is tax exempt if the house or apartment has been used as the individual’s or their family's permanent home for a continuous period of at least two years during the individual's period of ownership. Capital gains are tax exempt if the total amount of sales prices of all taxable asset transfers during a tax year does not exceed EUR 1,000.
As a basic rule, repayments of capital are treated as dividends (_see below_). However, repayments of capital from non-quoted companies may be subject to capital gains taxation, under certain conditions.
### Dividend income
85% of dividends from publicly quoted shares are taxed as capital income (at 30% tax rate up to taxable capital income of EUR 30,000 and 34% tax rate on the excess). 15% of the aforementioned dividends are tax-exempt.As concern dividends from non-quoted shares, 25% of the dividend corresponding to an annual return of 8% calculated on the mathematical value of the share is regarded as taxable capital income up to a maximum limit of EUR 150,000. Within the aforementioned 8% cap, 85% of the dividend exceeding EUR 150,000 is considered as taxable capital income. With respect to the portion exceeding the 8% calculated on the mathematical value of the share, 75% of the dividend is considered as taxable earned income.The aforementioned rules also apply to foreign dividends (except that the aforementioned 8% is calculated from the market value of the shares if the mathematical value of the shares is not available) if the company distributing the dividends is a company mentioned in article 2 of the Directive 2011/96/EU (as amended 2013/13/EU) on the common system of taxation applicable in case of parent companies and subsidiaries of different member states or the following conditions are met: the company pays at least 10% tax in its country of residence and the country of residence is within the European Economic Area or Finland and the company's country of residence has concluded a DTT that is applicable to the dividends. Otherwise, foreign dividends received by a resident individual are taxed as earned income without any exceptions.
If the distribution of dividends is based on work input or performance of the shareholders, not on their share ownership, the dividends are regarded as salary (or other remuneration for work) for tax purposes and are fully taxed as earned income subject to social security.
As concern dividends received from Finland, an individual residing in an EU/EEA country may claim taxation under the rules applicable to individuals resident in Finland if the individual can show that the Finnish tax at source (30% or a lower percentage provided by a tax treaty) cannot be fully credited in the individual's home country. A certificate from the home country tax authorities is needed.
### Interest income
Interest income is fully taxable at capital income tax rates. Gross interest income received by resident individuals from deposits in Finnish bank accounts and Finnish bonds is subject to final tax at source at a flat rate of 30%.
### Rental income
Net rental income is fully taxable at capital income tax rates.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
Individuals are deemed to be resident in Finland if they have their permanent home or habitual abode in Finland or if they are present in Finland for a continuous period of more than six months. A temporary absence from Finland does break the continuity of the stay for this purpose. Despite a move from Finland, Finnish nationals are considered resident in Finland for three full calendar years after they have left the country, unless they prove they have had no essential connections therewith in the fiscal year in question. Residence may start or break off in the course of a year.

## Social security contributions
Social security contributions are divided between the employer and the employee. The employees' part is withheld from the salary, and the employer remits the amounts to the appropriate instances on the behalf of the employee. The below-mentioned social security contribution rates are confirmed for 2025.
### Employer’s social security payments
The employer’s part of the Employment Pension Insurance contributions may vary from employer to employer. The average percentage is 17.38 %. The Employer's Unemployment Insurance contribution is graded according to the total compensation paid by the employer during a tax year. The contribution rate is 0.20% up to EUR 2,455,500 of total compensation paid and 0.80% on the exceeding compensation amount. The average Statutory Accident Insurance rate is on average 0.54% of the wage total. The average Statutory Group Life premium is 0.06% of the wage sum. The Employer’s Sickness Insurance contribution rate is 1.87%. 
### Employee’s social security payments
Employees’ Pension Insurance contribution is 7.15% for employees of age 17 to 52 years or 63 to 67 years and 8.65% for employees of age 53 to 62 years. Employee’s Sickness Insurance contribution is 1.52%. It consists of two parts: The Medicare contribution of 1.06% and the Daily Allowance contribution of 0.84%. The Daily Allowance premium is not collected if the total amount of salary is less than EUR 16,862. The Employee’s Unemployment Insurance contribution is 0.59%.
If the employee's salary is taxed under the foreign expert tax regime, the Sickness Insurance premium is included in the flat 32% tax rate. These contributions are remitted to the appropriate insurance companies together with employer social insurance contributions. However, employee’s Pension Insurance contributions are payable.
If a certificate of coverage (A1, E101, or similar) is obtained for an assignee posted to Finland, basically no Finnish social security contributions are payable (depending on the applicable social security treaty, some contributions may still remain payable in Finland). For employees taxed under the foreign expert tax regime, the tax rate remains the same flat 32% regardless of the A1 or certificate of coverage even though the Sickness Insurance premium is embedded in the rate.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate is 25.5% (24% until 31 August 2024). A reduced rate of 14% is applied to for example books, medicine, sports and entertainment services, passenger transportation, lodging services, food, animal feed. A reduced VAT rate of 10% is applied to newspapers and magazines. 
A zero rate applies in certain instances (e.g. intra-Community supplies of goods and exports of goods). Additionally, certain services (e.g. financial services, insurance services, and certain educational services) are exempted from VAT.
## Net wealth taxes
There are no net wealth taxes in Finland.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Taxes are imposed on property acquired by inheritance, will, or gift. Inheritance tax is levied to a person who receives immovable or movable property through inheritance or will if the deceased, the inheritor, or the beneficiary was resident in Finland at the time of death. Immovable property located in Finland and shares of a company, the assets of which consist mostly of immovable property, are always subject to inheritance taxation in Finland.
Gift tax is levied to a person who receives immovable or movable property as a donation if the donor or the beneficiary is resident in Finland at the time of donation. Immovable property located in Finland and shares of a company, the assets of which consist mostly of immovable property, are always subject to gift taxation in Finland. The taxable amount of gifts is calculated cumulatively in three-year periods. This means that if gifts received from the same person are EUR 5,000 or more in three years, the receiver will be liable to pay gift tax.
The tax is levied on both resident and non-resident beneficiaries. The taxable value of the inheritance, gift, or bequest is based on the fair market value of the property at the date of death/donation. The tax rate applicable to the inheritance or to the gift depends on the beneficiary's relationship to the deceased or donor. The tables below apply if the inheritor or donor is the spouse (including a cohabiting partner if the partners have a common child or if they have previously been married), father, mother of the deceased, or donor, and to any linear descendant of deceased/donor or spouse (including stepchild/adopted child).
As of January 2024, the period of inheritance tax payment will be extended from two years to ten years. The change applies to inheritance taxes for which the first instalment is due on or after 1 January 2024.

## Property taxes
The municipalities in Finland collect property tax from owners of real estates.Tax on real estate is payable on real estate situated in Finland. The most important exemptions from the tax liability are for forested and agricultural land. The real estate tax is payable by those who own the taxable property at the beginning of the calendar year. Tax is calculated on the taxable value of the real property. In general, the rate may vary between 0.41% and 2.00% of the taxable value. Municipalities will annually decide within allowed limits what percentage is applied in each municipality.
The municipality may impose a separate real estate tax on a vacant plot if the plot is situated in a town plan area and it is not in residential use or under construction. The tax rate on a vacant plot may vary between 2% and 6%.
The general property tax rate for buildings is between 1.30% and 2.00%.
## Transfer tax
Transfer tax is imposed on transfers of real property located in Finland and Finnish securities. The tax is 3% on transfers of real property, 1.5% on transfers of shares in an entity of which the assets are mostly comprised of real property (directly or indirectly), and 1.5% on transfers of other securities. The tax is calculated on the transfer price. The transfer of listed company securities is, in most cases, tax exempt. In addition, no transfer tax is imposed if both the transferor and the transferee are non-residents (except the cases of transferring shares in Finnish real estate companies).
There is no liability to transfer tax if the transfer is due to an inheritance, donation, or a division of property subject to a matrimonial right.
## Excise duties
Alcohol and alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, liquid fuels, electricity, natural gas, and coal are subject to European Union (EU) harmonised excise duties. National excise duties are levied in Finland on waste delivered to landfill sites, lubricating oil, oil imported into or through Finland, soft drinks, beverage containers, peat, and tall oil.
The excise duty on tobacco, cigarettes, and nicotine pouches varies between 34% and 60%.
The excise duty on alcohol products varies between 28.35 cents per centilitre of ethyl alcohol and 771 cents per centilitre of ethyl alcohol. As of 1 January 2025, alcohol tax on wines and spirits increases. Excise duty on alcoholic beverages will increase by 1.3%-1.8% in a year and 4.6% in total in between 2025-2027.
