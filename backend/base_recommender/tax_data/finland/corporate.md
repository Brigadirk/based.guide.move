## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
Significant changes to transfer taxation entered into force in the beginning of 2024. Among other changes, all transfer tax rates were reduced as of 1 January 2024. These new rates were applied retroactively to acquisitions made on or after 12 October 2023. In addition, upon distribution of shares as a dividend in kind, from January 2025 onwards, the distributing company is liable for tax (instead of the shareholders).
Taxpayer can receive an additional deduction of 45% on research and development (R&D) costs based on an increase in the amount of R&D activities. The rule was applicable for the first time in tax year 2024.
The employing corporate taxpayer’s training deduction will no longer be available as of tax year 2025. The deduction may be made from the tax year 2024.
Finland has adopted the Pillar Two minimum taxation rules, including a Qualifying Domestic Top-Up Tax (QDMTT), effective 1 January 2024. The rules, broadly speaking, apply to groups with consolidated revenues of at least EUR 750m.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Taxable period
The fiscal year is generally the calendar year. A company having an accounting period other than the calendar year is taxed for the accounting period or the accounting periods ending during the calendar year.
## Tax returns
A company must file a CIT return within four months from the end of the month during which the accounting period ends. As a general rule, companies must file a CIT return electronically.
For potential tax refunds, taxpayers should submit their account number to the tax authorities electronically.
## Payment of tax
Income taxes are levied as prepayments during the fiscal year. Advance tax payments for companies are collected in two or 12 instalments during the fiscal year. If the total amount to be paid is not more than EUR 2,000, the instalments are due in the third and the ninth month of the accounting period. If the total amount to be paid exceeds EUR 2,000, the instalments are due monthly (due date is the 23rd day of each month).
Taxpayers may apply for amendments to advance taxes levied (increase, decrease, or abolishment) until tax assessment has been completed (within ten months from the end of the fiscal year at the latest). Application for amendments to advance taxes should be filed electronically.
Tax authorities may, without application, levy or increase advance taxes within two months from the end of the fiscal year. Decrease or abolishment of advance tax payments may be levied by the tax authorities (by or without taxpayer’s application) until tax assessment has been completed.
Interest on late payment will be calculated starting from the first day of the second month after the fiscal year has ended until the due date of each for the following payments that are due on that day or after:
  * advance tax payable
  * outstanding tax (i.e. if the final tax exceeds advance taxes paid and thus additional payment will be levied by the tax authorities), and
  * tax payable due to tax amendments.


Public broadcasting tax is included in the advance tax payments.
## Tax audit process
Tax audits are performed at irregular intervals by tax auditors, who are entitled to examine the accounts of a company and to request additional information necessary to the examination. Generally, the taxpayer receives an advance notice of an audit from the tax authorities.
## Statute of limitations
The general time to claim for reassessment of CIT is three years starting from the subsequent year after the fiscal year (i.e. calendar year 2022 will be open for reassessment until the end of 2025).
In addition to the general three-year rule, the Finnish tax authorities may also rectify taxation after the three-year time limit in case certain criteria are met (in such cases, time limit would be extended to four or six years). In case of the taxpayer being accused for a crime, the appeal time is linked to the criminal justice process.
## Appeal process
The primary appeal authority is the Tax Adjustment Board, regardless of the type of tax. The taxpayer may appeal to the Tax Adjustment Board within the general three-year time limit.
After receiving a decision from the Tax Adjustment Board, it can be appealed within 60 days to the Administrative Court.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Current issues of special focus for tax audits are transfer pricing and PEs.
## MyTax
MyTax is a system where taxpayers can, for example, request a prepayment or additional prepayment and file self-assessed tax returns (e.g. VAT or employer's contributions). In MyTax, taxpayers can also file CIT returns and make claims for adjustment.
MyTax and other portals of the Finnish Tax Authorities can be accessed by using Suomi.fi authorisations. More detailed instructions on how to obtain access and authorise third parties in Suomi.fi are provided on the Suomi.fi website.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
As a main rule, a company is deemed to be resident on the basis of incorporation. Consequently, a company is deemed to be resident in Finland if it is incorporated (registered) in Finland. 
Additionally, foreign corporate entities that are not incorporated in Finland may still be deemed to be tax residents in Finland. Entities that have been incorporated in a foreign country may be deemed to be tax residents based on their place of effective management (_see below_).
### Place of effective management
Corporate entities whose place of effective management is located in Finland are also considered to be resident taxpayers in Finland. According to the Finnish Tax Administration, the place of effective management is a place where the corporation’s highest-level decisions concerning the daily management are made.
The Finnish Tax Administration has provided detailed guidance on this matter, and the Income Tax Act defines the concept of effective management. A corporate entity’s place of effective management is considered to be in Finland if its board of directors or other body making top-level decisions on daily management is located in Finland. However, when determining whether a place of management exists in Finland, other circumstances relevant to the company’s organisation and business operations are also taken into account.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
A PE is, in general, formed in line with the OECD Model Convention.


# Finland
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
As with taxable income, the concept of deductible costs is wide and covers, in general, all costs incurred in the pursuance of taxable income. Significant exceptions to this rule include (among others):
  * Income taxes (_see below_), tax late payment interests, and punitive tax increases.
  * Fines and other punitive payments.
  * 50% of entertainment costs.
  * Capital losses and liquidation losses if capital gains from the sale of shares of a target company would qualify for the participation exemption (_see Capital gains in the section_).
  * Losses from the disposal of a company’s own shares.
  * Merger losses.
  * Non-deductible interest expenses (_see Thin capitalisation in the section_).


As the accrual method is applied to the calculation of taxable income, expenses are usually deductible in the year they are realised (i.e. the year the obligation to pay has arisen).
## Depreciation, amortisation, and depletion
As a general rule, the maximum annual rates of depreciation calculated on the remaining acquisition cost for tax purposes (declining-balance method) are 25% for machinery and equipment and from 4% to 20% for buildings and other constructions, depending on the type and estimated life of the asset. However, in tax years 2020-2025 accelerated tax depreciation is available on new machinery and equipment.
The remaining acquisition cost for tax purposes is defined as cost less accumulated tax depreciation and, in the case of machinery and equipment, proceeds on disposal of the assets. The straight-line method is applied to certain intangible assets and capitalised expenditures and to assets with long economic use, such as dams. Tax depreciation is limited to the cumulative charges made in the books.
Costs related to qualifying intangible property are usually amortisable over a period of ten years or a shorter period if the economic life is proven to be less than ten years.
The capital cost of mines, sandpits, quarries, and peat bogs is written off in proportion to the quantities extracted. Short-lived items (the economic life of which is three years or less) may be written off immediately.
Additionally, in 2021, a law was adopted that provides accelerated depreciation on low-value assets and the remaining low book value of machinery and equipment from tax year 2021 onwards (_see below_).
Land is not a depreciable asset.
### Accelerated depreciation for tax years 2020-2025
The law on accelerated depreciation on machinery and equipment entered into force on 1 January 2020. The law originally concerned tax years 2020-2023, but its applicability has been extended later to tax years 2024-2025.
Under the new legislation, a taxable person engaged in agriculture or a business may annually deduct up to 50% (instead of 25%) of the tax carrying value of newly acquired machinery or equipment in tax years 2020-2025.
The accelerated depreciation represents a temporary difference and must be recorded in the depreciation difference calculation in the statutory financial statements.
In order to have accelerated depreciation on investments in machinery and equipment, the following conditions must be met:
  * The machinery or equipment is new (i.e. it has not been purchased second-hand).
  * The machinery or equipment was taken into use on or after 1 January 2020.
  * The machinery or equipment is used by the taxable person for the purposes of that person's business or agricultural activity.
  * The machinery or equipment belongs to the movable fixed assets of the company or to the fixed assets of agriculture.
  * Accelerated depreciation in taxation requires that a corresponding depreciation has been recorded as an expense in the statutory financial statements.


### Accelerated depreciation on low-value assets and the remaining low book value of machinery and equipment from tax year 2021 onwards
According to the law, companies can use accelerated depreciation on low-value assets and on the remaining book value of machinery and equipment from tax year 2021 onwards.
The threshold of a low-value asset has also been raised to EUR 1,200:
  * If the purchase price of the asset is EUR 1,200 or less, it can be expensed directly during the fiscal year that it was acquired.
  * If the remaining book value of an asset (machinery and equipment) purchased in previous years is EUR 1,200 or less in the beginning of the fiscal year, the remaining book value can be expensed in full during the fiscal year in question.


Consequently, the limit for the total deduction for low-value assets per fiscal year was raised accordingly to EUR 3,600.
## Goodwill
Acquired goodwill is amortisable for tax purposes over its economic life, up to a maximum of ten years.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses are generally deductible expenses when determining taxable income.
## Interest expenses
Broadly, the Finnish interest deduction limitation rules determine that the deductibility of a company's net financing expenses in Finland is limited to 25% of the company's adjusted taxable income (EBITD) and is applied at the level of an individual company.
In case the total net financing expenses (including both internal and external financing) exceed EUR 500,000, the interest deduction limitations will apply. Should the total net financing expenses exceed the threshold of EUR 500,000, the deductible net financing expenses are limited to 25% of the company's adjusted taxable income (EBITD, i.e. taxable income including group contributions and adding back interest expenses and tax depreciation). Thus, in this case, the amount that exceeds 25% of the company's EBITD is non-tax deductible. However, external net financing expenses are always fully deductible up to EUR 3 million and will be deducted before internal financing expenses. This means that in case the net external financing expenses already exceed 25% of the company's EBITD, any of the internal financing expenses cannot be deducted.
There are certain exceptions to the above rules (both exemptions and additional limitations), and, in general, the provisions are very complex.
The limitations on interest deduction provisions were amended as of 1 January 2022. The changes concern provisions on the exception based on the balance sheet comparison and the exception related to public infrastructure projects. Deduction for interest expenses, which has been allowed when based on balance sheet comparison, will be limited in situations where a party owning a significant share of the group has funded the group. Amendments were also made to the exemption regarding public infrastructure projects.
As of 1 January 2023, the balance sheet test is not available when, in the consolidated financial statements, interest expenses payable to group entities (ownership of 10% or more) represent 20% or more of the interest expenses paid towards external parties. In addition, the exemption regarding infrastructure projects was amended. A privately owned entity implementing a long-term public infrastructure project ordered by a public entity is allowed to deduct the otherwise non-deductible net interest expenses paid to entities not part of the sphere of interest. The new provision concerning infrastructure projects is applicable retroactively as of tax year 2019 onwards. 
_See Thin capitalisation in the section_.
## Bad debt
In general, bad debts incurred from sales receivables, etc. are tax deductible. The bad debts must also be deducted for accounting purposes.
## Charitable contributions
Donations are deductible for CIT purposes in certain cases.
In order for a donation to be tax deductible, the amount of the donation should be at least:
  * EUR 850, but not more than EUR 250,000, if made to an EEA member state or to a publicly financed university or other higher educational institution in the EEA to benefit the sciences, the arts, or the Finnish cultural heritage, or
  * EUR 850, but not more than EUR 50,000, if made to an association, foundation, or other institution in the EEA nominated by the Tax Administration and to benefit the sciences, the arts, or the Finnish cultural heritage.


Donations of not more than EUR 850 (e.g. to charitable purposes) are, in general, tax deductible.
## Taxes
Income taxes are non-deductible when determining taxable income. However, real estate tax and YLE tax are deductible.
## Education costs of employees
Employers are allowed to make an additional tax deduction for certain education costs of their employees. It is required that the employer has made a qualifying work community development plan and the education relates to the current or future tasks of the employee. The deduction entails both internal and external courses. The amount of the deduction is the average daily salary of all employees working for the employer multiplied by the amount of all qualifying educational days of all employees. This amount is subsequently divided by two. The maximum amount of qualifying education days is three days per employee within the fiscal year in question. The deduction has no tax consequences for the employees.
The education cost deduction will be completely removed in 2025. The deduction can still be utilized for the 2024 tax year.
## Net operating losses
Losses may be carried forward for ten subsequent years. However, the right to carry forward losses may be forfeited in certain instances, such as in cases where there is a direct or indirect change in the ownership of the company operating at a loss. However, a special permit can be applied in certain situations from the Finnish tax authorities to retain the tax losses despite the change in ownership. Loss carrybacks are not allowed.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
A Finnish corporation may claim a deduction for royalties, service fees, and interest charges paid to foreign affiliates, provided the underlying transaction is beneficial to it and the amounts paid are at arm’s length.


# Finland
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
Companies within a group are not consolidated for CIT purposes. However, via group contributions (i.e. lump sum payments of cash based on annual taxable profits), group companies may even out their taxable profits and losses, which leads effectively to the same result as consolidation would. A group contribution is a deductible cost for the granting company and taxable income for the receiving company, provided that all of the following are true:
  * Both companies belong to a group where there is a direct or indirect common ownership of at least 90%, and the group structure has existed for the entire fiscal year.
  * Both companies are Finnish resident for tax purposes.
  * Both companies are limited liability companies or co-operatives with business activities (i.e. have a source of income from business activities, _see the section_) and are not financial, insurance, or pension institutions.
  * The contribution is recorded in the annual statutory accounts of both companies involved and must affect their annual net income.
  * The accounting period for both companies ends at the same date.
  * The amount of contribution does not exceed the taxable business income of the granting company.
  * The contribution is not considered a capital investment.


Based on case law, the ownership chain may also be traced via foreign entities, provided there is a tax treaty between Finland and the country wherein the ultimate parent for the group is resident.
Additionally, there exists the possibility for a parent entity to deduct from its taxable income the final accrued losses of its subsidiary in certain situations.
## Transfer pricing
All transactions between related parties must take place at arm’s length. The requirement is imperative even in relation to purely domestic transactions. If the arm’s-length requirement is not followed, income or deductions of a company may be adjusted for tax purposes, in addition to which a risk for substantial penalties exists.
The transfer pricing legislation requires accurate delineation of the transaction. According to the transfer pricing legislation, in order to analyse whether the transaction between the associated enterprises complies with the arm’s-length principle, the commercial and financial relations and economically relevant characteristics affecting to these relations should be identified, and, after that, the transaction is delineated in accordance with the factual substance.
Furthermore, in exceptional circumstances, if the accurately delineated transaction between the associated enterprises differs from what would have been adopted between independent enterprises behaving in a commercially rational manner in comparable circumstances, the transaction between the associated enterprises can be disregarded and, if appropriate, replaced with another arm’s-length transaction. In addition, disregarding the transaction requires that arm’s-length price cannot be determined for the transaction, taking into account the perspectives of both parties and the options realistically available to both of the parties at the time of entering into the transaction.
The guidance provided by the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations is adopted as a significant source of interpretation in the application of the arm’s-length principle.
A Finnish company is obligated to prepare transfer pricing documentation to support transactions between its non-Finnish related parties. Documentation is subject to statutory requirements regarding content, which vary depending on the volume of related-party transactions. As of 1 January 2017, the content requirement is in line with the three-tiered documentation model introduced in the updated OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. The documentation requirement concerns Finnish companies and Finnish PEs of foreign companies that are a part of a group that has at least 250 employees or turnover exceeding EUR 50 million and balance sheet total exceeding EUR 43 million.
These thresholds are calculated at the group level. Failure to present appropriate documentation within 60 days from the tax authorities' request may lead to a punitive tax increase, however not earlier than six months after financial year end.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
The CbC reporting obligation applies to multinational groups with a consolidated turnover of at least EUR 750 million in the preceding fiscal year. The main rule is that an obligation to submit a CbC report to the Finnish tax authorities lays with the ultimate parent company if resident in Finland. However, if the ultimate parent company is not resident in Finland, the obligation lays with any other group company resident in Finland in case the foreign ultimate group company (i) is not obligated by CbC reporting requirements; (ii) is resident in a jurisdiction outside the European Union with which Finland has not concluded an agreement on exchange of information regarding CbC reports within due time; or (iii) is resident in a jurisdiction that has systematically neglected exchange of information and the Finnish tax authorities have reported this neglect.
This does not, however, apply to situations where the ultimate group company has appointed a group company resident within the European Union to submit the CbC report. Nor does it apply, under certain conditions, if the ultimate group company has appointed a group company resident outside the European Union. A notification of the company obligated to submit the CbC report shall be given to the Finnish tax authorities.
The CbC report shall contain the following country-specific data of the group companies and PEs:
  * Revenues.
  * Profit or loss before taxes.
  * Income tax paid and accrued, as well as withholding tax (WHT).
  * Bookkeeping value of equity.
  * Accumulated earnings
  * Number of employees.
  * Tangible assets, other than cash or cash equivalents.


In addition, the CbC report should include information on the business of each group company (and PE), as well as information on data sources and currency used. The government’s proposal text also suggests that other information that is considered relevant to facilitate an understanding of transfer pricing risks could be included in the CbC report.
Also, the CbC report can be provided in Finnish, Swedish, or English.
The CbC report is due within 12 months after the end of the financial year concerned. A separate notification of the company obligated to submit the CbC report shall be made by the end of the fiscal year for which the report is provided.
## Thin capitalisation
There are no thin capitalisation rules as such; interest limitation rules have been implemented instead. Broadly, the deductibility of a company’s net financing expenses are limited to 25% of that company’s adjusted taxable income. The adjusted taxable income is described as 'taxable EBITD' and is calculated as taxable income including group contributions and adding back interest expenses and tax depreciation. According to the rules, restrictions on the deductibility of interest apply to all financing expenses, i.e. interest payable to both group undertakings and external parties. Financing expenses broadly means interest expenses on all forms of debt, other costs economically equivalent to interest, and expenses incurred in connection with the raising of finance (e.g. the capitalised interest included in the balance sheet value of a related asset or the amortisation of capitalised interest would be considered financing costs).
In case the total net financing expenses (including both internal and external financing) exceed EUR 500,000, the interest deduction limitations will apply. Should the total net financing expenses exceed the threshold of EUR 500,000, the deductible net financing expenses are limited to 25% of the company's adjusted taxable income (EBITD, i.e. taxable income including group contributions and adding back interest expenses and tax depreciation). Thus, in this case, the amount that exceeds 25% of the company's EBITD is non-tax deductible. However, external net financing expenses are always fully deductible up to EUR 3 million and will be deducted before internal financing expenses. This means that in case the net external financing expenses already exceed 25% of the company's EBITD, any of the internal financing expenses cannot be deducted.
There are certain exceptions to the above rules (both exemptions and additional limitations), and, in general, the provisions are very complex. 
The limitations on interest deduction provisions were amended as of 1 January 2022. The changes concerned provisions on the exception based on the balance sheet comparison and the exception related to public infrastructure projects. Deduction for interest expenses, which has been allowed when based on balance sheet comparison, was limited in situations where a party owning a significant share of the group has funded the group. Amendments were also made to the exemption regarding public infrastructure projects.
As of 1 January 2023, the balance sheet test is not available when, in the consolidated financial statements, interest expenses payable to group entities (ownership of 10% or more) represent 20% or more of the interest expenses paid towards external parties. In addition, the exemption regarding infrastructure projects was amended. A privately owned entity implementing a long-term public infrastructure project ordered by a public entity is allowed to deduct the otherwise non-deductible net interest expenses paid to entities not part of the sphere of interest. 
In addition, the amount of debt and rate of interest should be at arm’s length. If not, a possibility for application of the general anti-avoidance provision may exist. Where a restriction is suffered (i.e. where there are non-deductible financing expenses), the financing expenses restricted can be carried forward in perpetuity.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
The CFC rules are applicable with respect to foreign entities in low tax jurisdictions controlled by Finnish residents. The undistributed profits of such foreign entities may be taxed as profit of the Finnish resident direct or indirect shareholders.
The CFC rules were amended in 2019 when the control criteria and the so-called escape rules faced significant changes. In addition, it is worth mentioning that a Finnish branch/PE of a non-Finnish company can be subject to CFC taxation in Finland. In addition, the WHT on the dividends distributed by the CFC can be credited in Finland against the CFC income. Generally, a foreign entity is considered to be low taxed if the actual income tax burden of the foreign corporation in its country of residence is lower than three-fifths of the tax burden of a comparable Finnish corporation.
According to the CFC legislation, the control is established if the Finnish person/company either alone or together with related parties have a control of at least 25%. The residence state of these related parties is irrelevant.
The Finnish CFC rules include two so-called escape rules, one applying to the EEA-area and the other applying to countries outside the EEA-area. According to the escape rule applying to the EEA-area, the CFC legislation does not apply if the company is genuinely established in the country and in fact carries actual business there.
The escape rule applying to countries outside the EEA includes the same requirement for the genuine establishment but also three additional requirements that all must be met. These three additional requirements are (i) the state of residence cannot be in the EU’s so-called 'black list', (ii) Finland must have an active agreement on the exchange of information in tax matters with the country in question (so-called 'white list' that is updated by the Finnish Tax Administration), and (iii) the foreign company must carry out business activities that are covered by the business line exception. The business line exception covers mainly industry and production and certain kinds of services.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
As a general rule, a branch is taxed like a corporation (tax rate 20%) on the profits attributable to it, provided the branch constitutes a PE in Finland. No tax is withheld on transfers of (taxed) profits to the head office.


# Finland
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Foreign tax credit
The principal method of avoiding double taxation in Finland’s tax treaties is the credit method, although the exemption method is still applied in a few older treaties. Foreign tax can be credited against taxes payable in Finland on the same income over the same period on a _pro-rata_ basis. The credit is given for taxes paid to a foreign state and covered by the relevant DTT. The maximum credit is the lesser of either the amount of the foreign tax or an amount equal to the Finnish tax payable on the income from a foreign state. This maximum is calculated on a source-by-source basis. Unused credit of foreign tax paid may be carried forward for five years on an income basket basis.
## Research and development (R&D) activities
R&D related costs may be deducted annually, or they can be capitalised.
### Additional deductibility on certain R&D subcontracting costs
A temporary law allows entities to make additional deductions on R&D subcontracting costs during tax years 2021-2027. At first, the amount of additional deductions was 50% in the tax year 2021. The law was amended to triple the deduction on R&D costs incurred in 2022-2027 up to 150%.
The minimum amount for this additional deduction during a fiscal year is EUR 5,000 and the maximum amount is EUR 500,000.
In order for these costs to be deductible, the costs must be based on cooperation in R&D activities between the taxpayer and a research organisation. The additional deduction must also be based on subcontracting invoices that make reference to a contract between the taxpayer and the research organisation that has been signed on 1 January 2021 or thereafter. Additional deduction is not granted to the extent the entity has received direct financial support from the State of Finland or other public subsidies for its R&D activity.
There are also certain requirements that the research organisation has to meet in order for the taxpayer to receive the additional deduction. The deduction can be granted only on payments to research organisations that:
  * operate in the European Economic Area
  * are a unit of a university or a research institute whose main goal is to conduct fundamental research, industrial research, or experimental development, or disseminate research results through education, publishing, or transfers of technology, and
  * further invest any profits to other research activities, dissemination of the results, or education.


This definition is intended to be consistent with the definition of a 'research and knowledge-dissemination' organisation in Article 2 (83) of European Commission Regulation (EU) 651/2014 of 17 June 2014.
### A permanent additional deduction on R&D costs
As of 1 January 2023, a new law entered into force that provides a tax incentive for R&D activities. The new permanent deduction is a combined deduction, which consists of a general additional deduction based on the amount of research expenses and an added additional deduction based on the increase of the amount of expenses. The general additional deduction can first be used in taxation of 2023 and the added additional deduction can be used in taxation from 2024 onwards.
The amount of the general additional deduction is 50% of the salary and service purchase expenses related to the taxpayer’s own R&D activities. The maximum amount of the general additional deduction in a tax year is EUR 500,000 and the minimum amount is EUR 5,000. 
The taxpayer can also receive an added additional deduction of 45% based on the increase in the amount of R&D activities if the amount of activities carried out by the taxpayer during the tax year has increased compared to the previous tax year. The maximum amount for the added additional deduction in the tax year is also EUR 500,000, but there is no minimum amount for the added additional deduction.
This law is applied simultaneously with the provisions of the law on the additional deduction for R&D activities in the tax years 2021-2027, so that the general additional deduction according to the new law would not be obtained for the same expenses on the basis of which the additional deduction according to the other law has been claimed. The general additional or added additional deduction of the new law is also not available for the same expenses for which other public subsidies have been received. Additional deductions are taken into account when confirming the tax year’s loss.


# Finland
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
Finnish corporations paying certain types of income are required to apply a 20%, 15%, or 35% WHT on payments to foreign corporations and a 30% or 35% WHT on payments to non-resident individuals or other than corporate entities.
According to domestic legislation, interest paid to a non-resident is usually tax exempt in Finland.
No WHT is levied on dividend payments received by companies resident in the EU/EEA, which would have been tax-free if paid to a Finnish corporate body, if the WHT cannot be fully credited in the company’s country of residence.
Dividends paid to a company referred to in the EC Parent-Subsidiary Directive, owning at least 10% of the capital of the dividend distributing company, are also tax exempt.
The domestic WHT rate may be 15% (or lower under a relevant tax treaty) in cases where the shares of the distributing company belong to the investment assets of the non-resident beneficiary of dividends and if certain prerequisites are met.
_See the table below for WHT rates on dividends and other payments from Finland to non-residents_.
For countries not included in the table, the WHT rate is 20% (corporate entity) and 30% (individual or other than corporate entity).
Note that each tax treaty should be studied carefully because there are often exceptions to general rules.

## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Company restructurings
In accordance with the EC Directive 2009/133/EC on mergers, divisions, partial divisions, transfers of assets, and exchanges of shares concerning companies of different EU member states, it is possible to carry out the said restructurings tax neutral if statutory conditions are met. In cross-border situations, both parties should be resident in the European Union. The principle of going concern is applied in taxation (i.e. the receiving company receives the assets with the values the transferring company had for those assets in its taxation).
## EU state aid investigations
There are no current state aid investigations going on in Finland.
## Information reporting requirement in the construction industry
A monthly notification duty of the employee and contract information to the Tax Administration applies to construction work subscribers and the main contractor of a joint construction site.
## Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
On 5 March 2014, Finland signed an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) concerning FATCA with the United States. On the basis of the agreement, Finland agreed to bring into force legislation according to which Finnish financial institutions are required to carry out specific due diligence procedures in order to identify their customers subject to tax in the United States.
Finland has implemented the FATCA into domestic law as of 20 February 2015. The amendment requires Finnish financial institutions (as defined in the IGA) to identify their reportable financial account holders and to annually report to the Finnish Tax Administration certain income and asset information with respect to account holders that have been identified to be Specified U.S. Persons.
The Finnish Tax Administration publishes tax guidance on the interpretation of the Finland-US FATCA IGA (latest update in 2023). The guidance can be used to interpret the FATCA-related customer due diligence and reporting obligations faced by Reporting Finnish Financial Institutions.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
On 29 October 2014, Finland signed an international agreement on automatic exchange of information, which requires Finland to apply the CRS for Automatic Information Exchange published by the OECD.
Finland has implemented the CRS into domestic law as of 15 April 2016. The amendment requires Finnish financial institutions (as defined in the CRS) to identify their financial account holders and to annually report to the Finnish Tax Administration certain income and asset information with respect to account holders that have been identified to be tax resident in the countries outside of Finland.
The Finnish Tax Administration publishes tax guidance on the interpretation of the CRS (latest update in 2024). The guidance can be used to interpret the CRS-related customer due diligence and reporting obligations faced by Reporting Finnish Financial Institutions.
## Information exchange within the European Union
Starting from 2016, the amended EU Directive of Administrative Co-operation in Tax Matters (Council Directive 2014/107/EU, the so called ‘DAC 2’ or ‘EU FATCA’) was implemented into domestic legislation. Under DAC 2, EU member states have to require their financial institutions to implement reporting and due diligence rules that are fully consistent with those set out in the CRS.
### DAC6 mandatory reporting
DAC6 is the EU Council Directive 2018/822, which deals with mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation in relation to cross-border arrangements. Finland has implemented the Directive to its national legislation, and the new law on reportable tax arrangements entered into force on 1 January 2020.
The reporting duty applies to tax planning structures in which the parties are from more than one member state or one member state and a third country and the arrangement includes at least one of the distinguishing hallmarks defined in the law. A distinguishing hallmark is a feature or characteristic that indicates tax avoidance. Additionally, some of the hallmarks are also subject to the main benefit test. The test determines if obtaining a tax advantage is the main purpose or one of the main purposes of the arrangement.
Reports must have been submitted within 30 days of an arrangement exceeding the reporting threshold.
The reporting requirements concern primarily intermediaries (service providers) that design, market, organise, or manage the implementation of a reportable arrangement. Service providers may be, for example, tax consultants and attorneys, financial sector operators, and parent companies of groups. Taxpayers are required to report arrangements only when an arrangement does not involve a service provider with a reporting obligation, or the service provider has the right to a waiver due to legal professional privilege.
The Finnish tax law provides for a range of penalties, which varies depending on the gravity of breach:
  * Minor omissions in reports or in the process applied: A maximum penalty of EUR 2,000.
  * Substantial omissions or completion of reporting only after requested by the tax authorities: A maximum penalty of EUR 5,000.
  * Deliberate or gross negligence: A maximum penalty of EUR 15,000.


### DAC7 due diligence and reporting requirements of platform operators
The Council Directive (EU) 2021/514 of 22 March 2021 amending Directive 2011/16/EU on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation, also known as DAC7, entered into force on 1 January 2023. Finland has implemented the legislation through the Act on the Reporting Obligation of Digital Platform Economy Operators in the Field of Taxation, in addition to amendments to other acts, such as the Tax Assessment Procedure Act. The Finnish Tax Administration has published detailed guidance in the application of DAC7 reporting rules as well as a technical guidance for the reporting platform operators.
DAC7 places due diligence and reporting requirements on platform operators. Platform operators must report information about the sellers registered on and activities facilitated through their platform to the competent authority of a member state, and the member state must exchange the information with other member states. Operators are also required to carry out due diligence procedures to identify reportable sellers.
A reporting platform operator shall report the information to the competent authority no later than 31 January of the year following the calendar year, with an exception for sellers who were already registered on 1 January 2023. For them, information must be collected by the end of 2024 and reported by 31 January 2025. Platform operators in scope include operators who have a tax residency, a place of management, or PE in the European Union or have been incorporated under the laws of a member state. Operators who facilitate the carrying out of a relevant activity by reportable sellers or a relevant activity involving the rental of immovable property located in a member state are also in scope.
Reportable sellers include any sellers that are registered on the platform to perform relevant activities and are not excluded sellers. Relevant activities include activities carried out for compensation, such as:
  * the rental of immovable property, including both residential and commercial property, as well as any other immovable property and parking spaces,
  * the rental of any mode of transport,
  * a personal service, and
  * the sale of goods.


In Finland, a reporting platform must confirm to the Tax Administration that it has no reportable sellers by submitting a 'nil' report, which is not required in all member states. The penalty charge may also differ from country to country, Finland’s approach being similar as in other cases of negligence by third-party submitters of information: up to EUR 15,000, depending on the severity of the negligence. If a platform operator neglects its reporting duties, it may also be prohibited from operating in Finland.
## Hybrid mismatch rules
New legislation regarding hybrid mismatch rules entered into force on 1 January 2020. This legislation provides for the implementation of the hybrid mismatch rules of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive, as amended by Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 (ATAD2). It addresses the exploitation of double deduction mismatches, deduction without inclusion mismatches, mismatches arising through structured arrangements, and mismatches arising through different treatment of the allocation of income and expenditure between a PE and its head office. The new legislation sets rules regarding denial of deduction or inclusion of income in the taxable base in order to avoid the mismatch situations, and it applies to both corporations and partnerships, as well as PEs.
Starting from 1 January 2022, the legislation on the reverse hybrid entities was amended to fully implement the ATAD2 Directive. According to the new legislation, non-resident partners of Finnish partnerships will have to pay tax on the income of a reverse hybrid entity in Finland if the conditions for applying the new rules are met. A reverse hybrid entity refers to a situation in which a Finnish partnership is regarded as a separate taxpayer under the laws of another state.


# Finland
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
Generally, since 2020, companies and other legal entities have only one income source; income from business and professional activities. It is taxed in accordance with the Business Income Tax Act (“BITA”).
However, companies' agricultural activities are taxed in accordance with the Agricultural Income Tax Act. Furthermore, certain corporate types, such as non-profit organisations and mutual real estate companies (MRECs) and housing companies, may have personal-source income taxed in accordance with the Income Tax Act (ITA), and BITA shall be applicable only in case such parties are carrying out business activities. As a general rule, the expenses of one source of income cannot be deducted from the taxable income of another source, and a loss from one source of income cannot offset taxable income from another source.
All taxable income received by a company is taxed at the CIT rate of 20%, irrespective of the source to which it is attributable.
In general, Finland has a very broad income concept, and taxable income includes all income derived from a company’s activities, though there are some significant exceptions, including (among others):
  * Capital contributions by shareholders.
  * In most cases, dividends from unlisted companies (_see Dividend income below_).
  * Liquidation gains and capital gains qualifying for the participation exemption (_see Capital gains below_).
  * Proceeds from disposal of company’s own shares.
  * Merger gain.


There is no general distinction between capital gains and other income; capital gains of a company are taxed as part of its general income either in the ‘business income’ basket or the ‘other income’ basket. No rates other than the general CIT rate of 20% are applied to any part of taxable income of a company.
Taxable income of a company generally is computed on an accrual basis (i.e. income is taxable in the year it is earned). However, exemptions to this main rule do exist, including unrealised exchange gains and losses, which are taxable/deductible in the year of the rate change.
## Inventory valuation
Inventories may be written down to the lower of direct first in first out (FIFO) cost, replacement cost, or net realisable value. Conformity between book and tax reporting is required.
## Capital gains
Capital gains and losses are generally included in the taxable business income (i.e. sales proceeds are included in the taxable income, and the undepreciated balance of the asset sold is deducted in the sales year) and treated as ordinary income. However, the entire stock of machinery and equipment is treated as a single item, and the capital gain on machinery and equipment is entered as income indirectly by deducting the selling price from the remaining value of the stock of machinery and equipment.
Capital gains arising from the sale of shares are tax exempt via a participation exemption, under certain circumstances. Specifically, capital gains arising from the sale of shares are tax exempt if:
  * the seller is not a company carrying out private equity activities (as defined by the BITA)
  * the seller has owned continuously, for a period of at least one year, at least 10% of the share capital of the target company, and
  * the shares are part of the seller’s fixed assets and the shareholding is included in the seller’s business income source for tax purposes.


For the participation exemption to apply, the target company cannot be a real estate company, a housing company, or a company the activities of which mainly include owning of real estates. The target company must also be a Finnish company, a company referred to in the European Commission (EC) Parent-Subsidiary Directive, or a company resident in a country with which Finland has concluded a tax treaty that applies to the target company’s dividend distribution.
Note that a capital gain is taxable to the extent that the gain corresponds with a previous tax-deductible write-down or provision made in connection with the acquisition cost of shares, subsidies received for acquiring shares, or previous capital losses deducted for Finnish tax purposes from intra-group transfer of the shares.
Capital losses are non-deductible in situations where capital gains are exempt from tax.
### Non-resident capital gains tax on the indirect transfer of Finnish real estate
As a general rule, Finland taxes non-residents on their Finnish-source income only. A (non-exhaustive) list of such income is in Section 10 of the Income Tax Act. Until March 2023, this Section meant that non-residents were subject to Finnish capital gains tax on transfers of Finnish real estate or transfers of shares in Finnish housing limited companies or other limited companies or cooperatives whose total assets are mostly (>50%) Finnish real estate. Although the list is not intended to be exhaustive, based on domestic legal practice, capital gains on the transfer of shares in companies that indirectly hold real estate has not been regarded as Finnish-source income. However, in March 2023, the tax base was extended to cover indirect transfers of Finnish real estate as well.
A new provision to extend the capital gains taxation of non-resident companies investing in Finnish real estate came into effect on 1 March 2023 and applies to all indirect real estate disposals by non-residents. The purpose of the change of law is to ensure Finland is exercising its taxing rights on sale of shares in real estate companies as broadly as possible under the relevant tax treaties in force.
According to the new provision, the profit realised on the transfer of shares, or similar rights, of an entity will be subject to capital gains tax in Finland if more than 50 % of the total assets consist directly or indirectly of Finnish real estate. When evaluating the ownership ratio, the last 365 days before the sale are considered; if the ownership condition is met at any time during this period, the indirect sale is subject to capital gains tax in Finland. Indirect ownership, within the meaning of the provision, could be formed through several companies, and the companies in the ownership chain could be domestic or foreign companies. 
The taxation of indirect holdings will apply to transfers of Finnish and foreign entities, regardless of their legal form and possible chain of ownership. Therefore, the extended provision covers transfers of foreign real estate holding companies and transfers of shares in a limited partnership or special investment fund that invests in Finnish real estate (as long as majority of the assets are directly or indirectly Finnish real estate). The taxpayer has an obligation to declare income arising from indirect transfers of Finnish real estate.
However, it should be noted that the following exclusions and protection against the provision may be available.
  * The transfers of publicly listed companies are excluded from the scope of the provision.
  * Foreign investment funds that are considered comparable to Finnish tax-exempt investment funds are tax exempt in Finland by virtue of the domestic legislation.
  * Applicable double tax treaties (DTTs) may provide protection against the provision. Currently, only about half of Finland’s DTTs allow taxation of indirect transfers of immovable property and none contain the so-called '365-day rule'.


## Dividend income
Dividends received by a Finnish company are tax exempt in most cases.
However, dividends received by a Finnish company are fully taxable (100%) if:
  * the dividend is received from a publicly quoted company, the receiving company is not a publicly quoted company, and the shareholding is less than 10% of the equity of the distributing company
  * the dividend is distributed by a non-resident company that is not such as mentioned in the EC Parent-Subsidiary Directive or other company resident in an EU or EEA country that is not liable to pay at least 10% tax for its income, or
  * the dividend is distributed by a company resident outside the European Union or European Economic Area.


Note that most of the Finnish tax treaties include provisions enabling tax-exempt dividends from the tax treaty country in case of at least a 10% shareholding.
Furthermore, dividends received are partly (75%) taxable if the dividend is received on shares belonging to 'investment assets' and the receiving company does not own at least 10% of the equity of the distributing company that is resident in another EU member state and covered by the EC Parent-Subsidiary Directive or the dividend is received on shares belonging to 'investment assets' and the distributing company is resident in Finland or an EEA country but not a company covered by the EC Parent-Subsidiary Directive (note that only financial, pension, and insurance institutions may have assets that are considered as 'investment assets').
Finland has implemented into domestic tax legislation the changes in the Parent-Subsidiary Directive (concerning mismatches in tax treatment of profit distribution to avoid situations of double non-taxation and general anti-abuse rules, directives 2014/86/EU and 2015/121/EU) by limiting Finnish companies' right to receive tax-exempt dividends. Due to these changes, dividends received by a Finnish company are always considered fully taxable in case:
  * the dividend is tax deductible for the distributing company, or
  * the dividend distribution relates to an arrangement or series of arrangements mainly aimed at achieving a tax benefit that is not meant to be the purpose of the dividend article and is not genuine, taking into account all the facts and circumstances related to the case (i.e. the arrangement or series of arrangements is not based on solid business reasons).


### Stock dividends
Stock dividends (bonus shares) may be distributed to stockholders, which are corporations and other legal entities with some exceptions, free of tax on the shareholder (_see Dividend income above_).
### Distributions from reserves for invested unrestricted equity
Distributions from reserves for invested unrestricted equity are, in general, deemed as dividends. However, distributions from non-listed companies can be deemed as capital gain if they are:
  * a return of capital investment made by the same taxpayer
  * distributed within ten years of the investment, and
  * clarified by the taxpayer that the above-mentioned conditions are met.


Distributions cannot be deemed as a capital gain if the reserves for invested unrestricted equity have been formed in conjunction with company restructurings (merger and acquisition [M&A] processes).
## Interest income
Interest income of a company is taxed as part of its general income, thus the regular CIT rate of 20% is applied.
## Royalty income
Royalty income of a company is taxed as part of its general income, thus the regular CIT rate of 20% is applied.
## Foreign income
A Finnish corporation is taxed on foreign dividends when the decision to distribute dividends is made and on foreign branch income and other foreign income (e.g. interest and royalties) as earned. The principal method of avoiding double taxation is the credit method, although the exemption method is still applied in a few older treaties (_see the section for more information_).


# Finland
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
Finnish resident companies are subject to Finnish corporate income tax (CIT) on their worldwide income (i.e. unlimited tax liability). Also, Finnish permanent establishments (PEs) of non-resident companies are subject to Finnish CIT on their worldwide income attributable to the PE.
The CIT rate is 20%.
## Pillar Two Implementation
Finland has implemented Pillar Two legislation, including Income Inclusion rule (IIR), the Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR), and the Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (QDMTT). The IIR and QDMTT are applied for financial years starting on or after 31 December 2023, and the UTPR is applied for financial years starting on or after 31 December 2024.
The Finnish Pillar Two law closely follows the related EU Directive and the Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) Model Rules. In the government proposal the central role of the OECD’s (existing and future) guidance is clearly acknowledged in the proposal as a key to ensure harmonious implementation globally and to avoid differing interpretations across jurisdictions. However, some relevant aspects of the OECD’s recent guidance are not yet incorporated in the Finnish law, and further updates to the law are expected.
The Finnish constitution requires that a tax law should include a sufficient level of detail to allow taxpayers to calculate their tax liability and leave little room for interpretation. These constitutional restrictions may cause uncertainties with respect to application of specific rules based on the OECD guidance where those deviate from the Finnish Pillar Two legislation. 
_For more detailed information and most recent updates, please visit_
## Public service broadcasting tax
Public service broadcasting tax (_Yleisradio_ or YLE tax) for companies and organisations is based on the taxable income for a fiscal year. The tax amounts to 140 euros (EUR) per year if the taxable income of the organisation is at least EUR 50,000. For organisations with taxable income exceeding EUR 50,000, the tax is levied at EUR 140 plus 0.35% of the taxable income exceeding EUR 50,000. The maximum of the annual tax is EUR 3,000, which will be payable by organisations with taxable income of EUR 867,142 or more.
YLE tax is deductible in the taxation of income of a company.
## Local income taxes
No municipal or local income taxes are levied in Finland on the income of a company.


# Finland
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate is 25.5% (24% until 31 August 2024). A reduced rate of 14% is applied to food and animal feed. The reduced VAT rate of 14% also applies to restaurant and catering services. A reduced VAT rate of 10% is applied to certain goods and services (e.g. books, newspapers and magazines, accommodation, passenger transport). As of 1 January 2025, all goods and services subject to reduced VAT rate of 10% except newspapers and magazines will be moved to the reduced rate of 14%.
## Customs duties
Goods imported into Finland from outside the European Union need to be customs cleared and might be subject to customs duties. The rates of customs duties are determined at the EU level.
### Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)
The CBAM is also applicable for imports into Finland. The CBAM entered into force in its transitional phase as of 1 October 2023. It initially applies to imports into the European Union of certain goods and selected precursors whose production is carbon intensive and at most significant risk of carbon leakage. These goods are cement, iron and steel, aluminium, fertilisers, electricity, and hydrogen. The CBAM will be fully implemented as of 1 January 2026, and importers will need to declare each year the quantity of goods imported into the European Union in the preceding year and their embedded greenhouse gases (GHGs). Importers will then surrender the corresponding number of CBAM certificates. The price of the certificates will be calculated depending on the weekly average auction price of EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) allowances expressed in EUR/tonne of CO2 emitted.
## Excise duties
Product specific excise duties are levied on tobacco and alcohol products, certain fuels, electricity, soft drinks, and beverage packaging.
Finland has several excise tax exemptions and reliefs in place for energy and alcohol used in e.g. manufacturing and datacentres. Finland levies excise tax on electricity at the EU minimum level of 0.063 cents/kWh.
The Finnish tax authority has digitalised nearly all excise tax administration procedures, and handling times are among the shortest within the European Union.
## Real estate tax
Municipalities impose an annual real estate tax. The tax is levied on the taxable value of buildings and land. The municipal council determines the applicable tax rates, although the minimum and maximum tax rates are set by tax legislation. The tax is deductible from taxable business income or agricultural income if the real estate is used for business or agricultural purposes. The tax is deductible from taxable income of the so-called 'other-source income' if the real estate is used to acquire other taxable income than business income.
## Transfer tax
Amendments to the Act on transfer taxation entered into force on January 2024 and 2025 onwards. The first amendment reduced applicable transfer tax rates, and the second amendment made the companies distributing dividends liable for transfer tax if the company distributes dividends as shares or other securities.
Generally, the transfer tax is payable by the transferee. However, dividend distributing company is liable to file a transfer tax return and pay the tax on dividends available to be drawn as shares or other securities on or after 1st of January 2025. If the decision to distribute dividends does not specify the date on which the dividends become available to be drawn, the company is liable for transfer tax if the decision is made on or after 1 January 2025. The company can file the transfer tax return on dividends distributed as securities in the online portal of the Finnish tax authorities
A transfer tax of 3% of the sales price is payable on transfer of real estate located in Finland. A transfer of shares in Finnish companies and other domestic securities is subject to a transfer tax of 1.5%. A transfer of shares in Finnish housing companies and real estate companies is subject to a transfer tax of 1.5%.
A transfer tax of 1.5% is payable on a transfer of shares in a foreign company whose activities consist mainly of owning or holding (directly or indirectly) real estates in Finland, provided that either the transferor or the transferee is a resident of Finland or, alternatively, a Finnish branch of a foreign credit institution, a Finnish branch of a foreign investment firm, or a Finnish branch of a foreign fund management company.
Transfer tax is calculated as a certain percentage of the sales price and potential other consideration. The consideration includes payments made by the transferee to other parties than the transferor as well as obligations assumed by the transferee towards the transferor or another party, provided that such payment or obligation accrues to the benefit of the transferor. If the transferee acquires shareholder loans from the transferor in connection with the share acquisition, the amount of shareholder loans is included in the transfer tax base as of 2024 onwards. In case of transfer of shares in a real estate company, additional provisions concerning transfer tax base are applicable.
No transfer tax is payable on the transfer of securities that are subject to trading on a regulated market or multilateral trading facility in the European Economic Area (EEA). Similarly, no transfer tax is payable if both the seller and the transferee are non-residents. Transfer tax is, however, always payable on transfers between non-residents if the transferred shares are shares in a Finnish housing or real estate company.
## Stamp tax
No stamp taxes are levied in Finland.
## Payroll taxes
The employer has a liability to withhold income taxes on remuneration subject to tax in Finland, including cash remuneration and non-cash benefits based on their taxable value. The taxes can, however, be withheld only on cash compensation, and the maximum income tax withholding liability equals the amount of cash remuneration.
## Social security contributions
According to the Finnish social security legislation, both Finnish and foreign employers have a liability to pay several social security payments in Finland in cases where an employee performs one's tasks partly or wholly in Finland. The liability concerns all employers, regardless of the form of the company and whether the foreign company has a PE in Finland. The percentage rates for the employer’s (and employee’s) social security contributions are revised on an annual basis.
_Compulsory social security contributions payable by the employer and employee are described in the section in the Individual tax summary_.
If an employee is regarded as a foreign-posted employee and has an A1 certificate or a certificate of coverage from one's home country stating the other country's social security coverage, the liability to take out Finnish social insurances and pay the respective contributions is excluded or limited.
