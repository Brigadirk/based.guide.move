Taxpayers are expected to submit to the tax administration the annual return of revenue derived from their business venture during the period serving as the tax base by:
  * 15 March for taxpayers under the Large Taxpayers' Unit.
  * 15 April for taxpayers reporting to Medium-sized Tax Centres and Specialized Tax Centres.
  * 15 May for taxpayers under Divisional Tax Centres.


This return must be presented in conformity with the OHADA accounting system.
No one may invoke a claim on the state to shirk its return and payment obligations.
Despite the declarative tax system applicable in Cameroon, the tax administration may send a pre-completed return of collected revenue or any other taxable item, with the tax amount owed, to any natural or legal person paying taxes or duties as per laws and regulations in force.
The taxpayer that feels overtaxed or wrongfully taxed under a pre-filled tax return procedure shall submit a request for correction to the competent taxation centre within one month of receipt of such return. In such case, the tax authorities and the taxpayer shall have 30 days within which to decide the final taxes established by a collection notice (CN).
Failure to pay within 15 days of receiving the CN or respond to a pre-filled tax return in time shall be tantamount to accepting the terms thereof.
### Other tax filings
Firms falling under a dispensational or special tax regime shall file, within the same time limit, a summary declaration of transactions of the previous year for which they obtained tax benefits, including theoretical taxes and levies corresponding to the said transactions.
Firms shall, within the same time limit, submit to the tax administration a summary of all the stock movements of the previous year, together with the software used in managing the said stock.
Approved intermediaries shall, through electronic means, provide the Directorate General of Customs, on a monthly basis, the information on the status of all foreign financial transactions carried out with their customers and on their personal behalf.
## Payment of tax
An instalment representing the 2.2% or 5.5% minimum tax of turnover realised during each month shall be paid to the tax authorities not later than the 15th day of the following month.
Advance payment of 0.5%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 14%, 15%, 15.04%, or 20% is withheld at source by the buyer or the customs administration on purchases and imports destined to be resold, depending on the tax regime applicable to the buyer or importer. _See Minimum tax in the section for more information_.
The balance of CIT is paid, at the latest, by:
  * 15 March for taxpayers under the Large Taxpayers' Unit.
  * 15 April for taxpayers reporting to Medium-sized Tax Centres and Specialized Tax Centres.
  * 15 May for taxpayers under Divisional Tax Centres.


following the fiscal year-end, when submitting the CIT return.
### Surplus tax payments
A surplus tax payment can be offset against future taxes of the same nature to be paid.
Excess payments of CIT shall be reimbursed in case of cessation of activities.
For the specific case of VAT, a reimbursement procedure is provided for by the GTC under certain conditions. Such VAT credit refund procedure shall depend on whether the taxpayer is classified in the category of low, medium, or high-risk company.
## Tax audit process
There is no audit cycle in Cameroon.
As of January 2018, whatever the cause, any importer or exporter wishing to terminate one's customs activities shall first inform the customs administration at least 90 days beforehand and request a customs audit. In the absence of this prior audit, the taxpayer concerned, the taxpayer's officials, and/or the taxpayer's representatives shall remain jointly and severally liable for the customs debts subsequently established.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations is four years.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The topics of focus for tax authorities include the following:

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
## Depreciation
Depreciation is generally computed on a straight-line basis over the useful life according to the rates provided for by the GTC, including those that might have already been deferred in times of deficit.
The following depreciation rates are generally accepted for tax purposes:
Assets | Depreciation rates (%)  
---|---  
Construction | 5 to 20  
Stationary equipment and tools | 5 to 20  
Portable equipment | 10 to 100  
Transport equipment | 10 to 33.33  
Railway lines | 1 to 10  
Engines | 5  
Rehabilitation | 5 to 25  
Furniture fittings and other equipment | 10 to 33.33  
Fishing equipment and fishing vessels | 15  
The deduction of depreciation can be carried forward indefinitely.
The threshold for small equipment and tools to be included in the balance sheet shall be XAF 500,000.
Depreciation rates specific to certain sectors of activity may be fixed by a separate joint instrument of the ministers in charge of finance and the sector concerned. 
## Goodwill
With regard to rules governing the deduction of provisions and depreciation, impairment of goodwill shall be allowable for CIT purposes.
## Start-up expenses
There is no specific provision in the GTC relating to start-up expenses.
However, the OHADA Accounting Principles effectively state that start-up expenses shall be capitalised and must be completely depreciated as early as possible: over two to five years, except bond premiums, which are depreciated throughout the life of the loan.
No distribution of profit should be carried out before the complete depreciation of start-up expenses.
## Intellectual property (IP)
Sums paid to related entities for the use of valid patents, brands, designs, and models are capped at the overall limit of 2.5% of the taxable income before the deduction of expenses claimed. When they are paid to entities located outside the CEMAC that directly or indirectly hold shares or are members of the Cameroonian entity's board of directors, they shall be considered as sums accruing from the distribution of profits. As such, they are not allowable.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are fully deductible.
However, the deduction of interests on sums of money left or placed at the disposal of local entities by partners or related companies who directly or indirectly own at least 25% of the share capital or corporate voting rights is capped at:
  * One and a half times (1.5) the amount of equity. Interests on the portion of the loan which exceeds this limit shall be added back for CIT purposes and subject to distribution tax at 16.5%.
  * 25% of profit before CIT and before deduction of the said interests and depreciation taken into account in determining such profit.


Otherwise, interests on the excess amount shall not be deductible. In this case, the excess interests paid are added back for CIT purpose and subject to distribution tax at the rate of 16.5%.
Where the two situations are met, the tax authorities will choose the one that generates the highest tax liability.
The deduction above is applicable where the following conditions are met:
  * The existence of a written and duly registered loan agreement.
  * The subscribed share capital has been fully paid up.


## Bad debt
The deductibility of provisions for bad debts is subject to the following conditions:
  * The debt must be specified (i.e. clarification is needed on the nature, amount, and the debtor).
  * The company must show that it has unsuccessfully carried out actions for debt recovery (e.g. reminder letters, notice to pay, complaints).


For losses related to bad debts to be deductible, they should have been subjected to all amicable or forced collection methods and means provided for by the OHADA Uniform Act on the Organization of Simplified Procedures for Collection and Enforcement Procedures. Otherwise, they shall not be deductible.
In this regard, the impossibility of recovering the debt must be evidenced by:
  * a deficiency report prepared by a bailiff
  * a bankruptcy decision duly passed by the judge, if necessary, or
  * a decision passed by a judge, bearing out the debtor who disputed the debt.


However, losses due to bad debts of an amount less that XAF 500,000, which have been provisioned over a minimum period of five years, shall be deducted automatically, without having to justify the exhaustion of the amicable or forced recovery procedures provided for by the regulations in force. 
## Charitable contributions
Acts of liberality, gifts, and subsidies shall not represent the charges deductible from profits.
However, payments made to research and development (R&D) bodies and to collective philanthropic, educational, sports, scientific, social, and family institutions and bodies, on condition that the latter are situated in Cameroon, shall be deductible as soon as there is proof of payment and as long as they do not exceed 0.5% of the turnover for the fiscal year. Similarly, gifts made on the occasion of a disaster shall be deducted in the form and conditions determined by order of the Minister of Economy and Finance.
Liberalities, gifts, and subsidies awarded to clubs participating in the elite national competitions or to recognised organisations responsible for the organisation of official sport competitions are deductible, provided they are justified, within the limit of 5% of the annual turnover.
## Fines and penalties
Compounding fees, fines, confiscations, and any penalty concerning persons who violate legal, economic, and fiscal provisions shall not be deducted from the profits subject to taxation.
## Taxes
Only the professional taxes issued for collection during the fiscal year and which are to be borne by the firm in relation to the operations carried out in Cameroon shall be subject to deduction.
CIT, WHT, and PIT shall not be considered as deductible expenses for the levying of taxes.
## Net operating losses
Any loss sustained in a given year can be carried forward up to the fourth year following the recording of the loss. The carryback of losses is not permitted in Cameroon.
For credit institutions and companies in the state portfolio undergoing restructuring, the excess deficit can be carried over to the sixth year following the deficit year.
Losses due to damage in inventories shall be deductible from the taxable basis when they are duly established and validated by a Commissioner of damage in the presence of a taxation officer with the rank of at least controller, under the conditions specified in the Manual of Tax Procedures.
However, for damages and breakages incurred by companies in the brewing sector, the related losses are deducted at a flat rate of 1% of the total production volume.
## Payments to foreign entities
Head office overhead expenses for operations carried out in Cameroon and the remuneration of certain effective services (studies, technical, financial, or accounting assistance) provided to Cameroonian firms by foreign natural persons or corporate bodies are not totally deductible.
Fees paid are deductible up to a maximum of:
  * 2.5% of intermediary earnings as a general rule
  * 1% of the turnover for firms specialised in public works, and
  * 5% for design firms operating in accordance with regulations relating to design firms and consulting engineers.


The notion of technical assistance shall include services provided by entities located either overseas or in Cameroon.
Expenses linked to transactions with natural persons or legal entities resident or established in a territory or state considered to be a tax haven shall not be deductible. This rule shall not apply to imports of goods made in those countries. A tax haven is any state where the tax on the income of a natural person (PIT) or legal entity (CIT) is less than a third of that paid in Cameroon, or any state or territory considered not to be co-operative in matters of transparency or of exchange of information required for fiscal purpose by international or financial organisations. The rate to be considered in Cameroon for that purpose is 35% for PIT and 30% for CIT.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
There is specific taxation of groups within the CEMAC area.
Where a joint stock company and a private limited company own either registered stock in a joint stock company or shares in a private limited company, the net proceeds of the share in the second company paid to the first during the financial year shall be deducted from the total net profit of the latter, less a percentage for costs and charges. This percentage is fixed at 10% of the total amount of the proceeds. This system shall apply when all of the following conditions are met:
  * The stocks or shares owned by the parent establishment represent at least 25% of the capital of the subsidiary firm.
  * The parent and subsidiary firms have their registered office in a CEMAC state (Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, and Republic of Congo).
  * The stocks or shares allotted at the time of issue are still registered in the name of the participating company that undertakes to retain them for at least two consecutive years in registered form.


## Transfer pricing
There are provisions in the GTC that relate to transfer pricing.
Within the framework of a tax audit, the documents required for the justification of transfer pricing shall be presented to the tax inspectors at the start of the procedure. Items such as business transactions, payments in consideration for intangible rights, allocations of costs and expenses (head office costs, agreements to share costs, disbursements, etc.), financial transactions, etc. are particularly targeted for close scrutiny.
Companies in the large taxpayers unit shall declare participation in companies that are equal to or more than 25% of the share capital of the latter, as well as the documentation to justify their transfer pricing policy for intra-group transactions, at the same time as their annual tax return.
Companies with a transfer pricing policy for cross-border trade in goods and services are required to submit their transfer pricing documentation to the customs authorities by 31 March of each year at the latest. The failure to transmit this declaration is assimilated to the offence of refusal to communicate the documents and is sanctioned.
Since 1 January 2024, financial institutions and similar bodies (including banks, financial establishments, and insurance companies) have been required to:
  * Identify the tax residence of all financial account holders, including the individuals who control these accounts.
  * Communicate to the tax authorities the information required for the application of agreements concluded by Cameroon on the automatic exchange of information for tax purposes. This information is provided by means of a declaration drawn up in accordance with a model provided by the tax authorities. This information may be provided by the Cameroon tax authorities to the authorities of countries that have signed an agreement with Cameroon allowing the automatic exchange of information.
  * To keep records of actions taken to meet the above obligations, as well as all supporting documents.


## Thin capitalisation
The deduction of interests on sums of money left or placed at the disposal of local entities by partners or related companies who directly or indirectly own at least 25% of the share capital or corporate voting rights is capped at:
  * one and a half times the amount of equity or
  * 25% of profit before corporate tax and before deduction of the said interests and amortisations taken into account in determining such profit.


Otherwise, interests on the excess amount shall not be deductible.
The deduction above is applicable where the following conditions are met:
  * The existence of a written and duly registered loan agreement.
  * The subscribed share capital has been fully paid up.


## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
We are not aware of any special provisions for CFCs. Indeed, subject to the provisions of international conventions and the provisions relating to group taxation mentioned above, revenue from stocks and shares held in a company based abroad shall be subject to income tax in Cameroon.


# Cameroon, Republic of
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
The local branch of any foreign company is taxed at the same rate as a company. The net profits (after CIT) of entities having their residence or head office outside Cameroon (such as the branch of a foreign company) are assumed to be distributed each fiscal year to companies not located in Cameroon. Their net profits (after CIT) shall therefore be subject to the WHT on distributions at 16.5%.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
Resident corporations in Cameroon are taxed on their worldwide income; non-resident corporations are taxed only on Cameroon-source income.
The following shall be deemed to be operating in Cameroon and subject to corporate income tax (CIT):
  * Undertakings headquartered in Cameroon or with an effective management office in Cameroon.
  * Undertakings that have a PE in Cameroon or with an effective management office in Cameroon.
  * Undertakings that have a dependent representative in Cameroon.
  * Undertakings that carry out activities that form a full commercial cycle in Cameroon.


The profits subject to CIT are determined with sole regard to profits earned by entities located in Cameroon (for residents) or transactions effected in Cameroon (for non-residents having a permanent establishment [PE] in Cameroon).
The net taxable profits are established after deduction of all charges directly entailed by the exercise of activities subject to assessment in Cameroon.
The total Cameroon CIT rate is 33% for companies with a turnover above XAF 3 billion. For companies with a turnover of less than XAF 3 billion that meet the additional criteria set by law, the tax rate is set at 27.5%.
## Taxation system/regime
Corporate bodies are assessed according to the following taxation systems determined on the basis of the turnover realised:
  * **Flat rate taxation system** : Sole proprietorships with an annual turnover of below XAF 10 million, except for logging companies, professional officers, and liberal professions.
  * **Simplified taxation system** : Sole proprietorships and corporate bodies with an annual turnover equal to or above XAF 10 million and below XAF 50 million.
  * **Actual earnings taxation system** : Sole proprietorships and corporate bodies with an annual turnover equal to or above XAF 50 million. It should be noted that, as of 1 January 2023, the turnover achieved is no longer the criterion for inclusion in the actual system for certain legal entities. The following legal entities are automatically included in this regime, regardless of their turnover:


  *     * New companies in the oil, mining, gas, credit, microfinance, insurance, and mobile phone sectors.
    * New taxpayers who have been approved for one of the tax incentive schemes (_see The private investment tax incentive regime in the section for more information_).
    * Public notaries.


  * **Non-profit organisations system** : Any public, private, or confessional entity with personality, including foundations, whose goal is not to make profit for distribution among its members and whose activity does not compete with activities of for-profit entities, shall fall under the non-profit organisations system. Such entities include the following:
    * International bodies and non-governmental organisations, subject to conventions.
    * Public establishments and regional and local authorities, as well as their public utilities boards.
    * Companies or organisations recognised as being of public purpose.
    * Public low-cost housing agencies.
    * All types of _de jure_ or _de facto_ associations, mutual societies, clubs, and private clubs.
    * Social welfare and social security organisations.
    * Public and denominational educational and health establishments.
    * Generally, any organisation with or without legal personality and whose main goal is not to carry out commercial activities.
  * **Non-professional taxpayer taxation system** : Non-professional taxpayers are those who receive income exclusively from wages, salaries, pensions, life annuities, and/or income from transferable securities, and property income, and, in general, any passive income.


## Minimum tax
There is a 2.2% or 5.5% minimum tax in Cameroon based on turnover and depending on the tax regime of the taxpayer. The advance payment shall be 10% for any taxpayer that is not on the register of a tax office. The 10% rate shall be increased to 20% for forestry companies where, in addition, they do not provide evidence of possessing a logging permit duly issued by the competent authority.
The 10% rate also applies to remunerations paid to non-salaried sales agents or representatives and agents of direct network sales. The 15% rate applies to taxpayers not registered with a taxation centre and engaged in import activities. The 15% rate shall be increased to 20% where the taxpayer carries out the sale of in-bond goods.
The rate of deduction at source representing the instalment of CIT is fixed at 5.5%, irrespective of the tax regime of the service provider, for invoices relating to public procurement amounting to less than XAF 5 million.
The advance payment shall be 15.04% of the gross margin for firms subject to the actual earnings tax system and falling under regulated profit margin sectors, subject to the option for the tax regime of common application.
