# Cameroon, Republic of
## Overview
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
The Republic of Cameroon, a country located in Central and Western Africa, is bordered by Nigeria and the Atlantic Ocean to the west, Chad to the northeast, the Central African Republic to the east, and Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and the Republic of Congo to the south. Cameroon is divided into ten regions, with Yaoundé as the capital. Cameroon's currency is the _Communauté Financière Africaine_ franc (XAF), and its official languages are French and English.
Cameroon has generally enjoyed stability, which has permitted the development of agriculture, roads, and railways, as well as a petroleum industry. Because of its oil resources and favourable agricultural conditions, Cameroon has one of the best-endowed primary commodity economies in sub-Saharan Africa. International oil and cocoa prices have a significant impact on the economy. Since 1990, the government has embarked on various International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank programs designed to spur business investment, increase efficiency in agriculture, improve trade, and recapitalise the nation's banks.
