## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
The Liechtenstein Parliament passed the law on the automatic exchange of information (AIA law) with various amendments to the Liechtenstein Tax Act on 6 November 2015. The AIA law corresponds mainly with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) common reporting standard (CRS) and shall introduce a uniform standard for exchanging tax information with tax authorities of other countries. The AIA law entered into force on 1 January 2016.
Furthermore, the Liechtenstein Parliament passed the amending Protocol to the agreement between the European Community (EC) and Liechtenstein on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments (European Union [EU] interest savings agreement) on 6 November 2015. The amending Protocol changes the EU interest savings agreement into an AIA agreement. The amending protocol entered into force on 1 January 2016.
With the tax law amendments that entered into force on 1 January 2017, the correspondence principle for dividends to avoid double non-taxation was introduced. Individual investors (shareholders or beneficiaries) shall only benefit from the participation exemption on dividend income if the payment from ≥ 25% participations held as business assets is not tax deductible in the source country. The correspondence principle, however, does not apply for dividends received from participations that are held as private assets.
Dividend income and capital gains deriving from foreign participations held as business assets are subject to anti-abuse provisions. Dividend income and capital gains deriving from investments in foreign legal entities are not tax-exempt for income tax purposes anymore if more than 50% of the total income of the foreign legal entity consists of passive income and its taxable income is subject, directly or indirectly, to low taxation. The grandfathering for participations established before 2019 ended on 31 December 2021.

  * Permanent establishments (PEs).
  * Real estate.
  * Income from employed or self-employed activity.
  * Attendance fees.

## Communal tax
Communal tax is a surcharge on the national income tax due. Communities levy a surcharge of between 150% and 180%. The surcharges are fixed annually by the local governments. Consequently, the tax rate consists of the national tax rate combined with the surcharges, which results in tax rates from 2.5% to 22.4%.
For individuals with a limited tax liability who are ordinary tax-assessed, a general municipal multiplier of 150% will be applied.
## Lump sum taxation (tax based on expenditure)
In the case of persons who, for the first time or after at least ten years away from the country, take up residence or habitual abode in Liechtenstein, are not Liechtenstein citizens, do not work in Liechtenstein, and finance their costs of living through the income from their wealth or other funds received from abroad, a tax based on expenditure may, upon application, be levied in lieu of the wealth tax and income tax. Real estate situated in Liechtenstein is subject to the wealth tax.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
## Taxable period
The tax returns are filed on a calendar-year basis.
## Tax returns
Returns must be filed annually, normally by mid to end of April of the year following the respective tax year. An exemption might be granted upon a written request to the communal tax authorities. For an extension period of more than one month, a prepayment of 80% of the previous year's taxes is required. The maximum extension period is five months.
Employees must enclose a certificate of remuneration issued by their employers.
## Payment of tax
The tax liability is definitive when the tax assessment has been delivered. Taxable persons can either pay the taxes within 30 days or make an objection against the tax assessment.
Employers need to deduct a withholding tax (WHT) from the salary of their employees. As of 2019, employees may also be required to pay WHT if certain conditions are met. Employees do not need to pay a provisional tax bill.
The income tax of self-employed persons (as well as of legal entities) needs to be paid provisionally, based on the taxable income of the last tax return. Provisionally paid taxes are credited to the definite tax due.

## Social security contributions
The taxpayer’s share of social security contributions (old-age and dependent pension schemes, disability insurance) is 4.70% (with an upper limit of 18% for self-employed and employed individuals) and 0.5% for unemployment insurance on the first CHF 126,000 of compensation.
## Real estate profit tax
Capital gains from the sale of real estate, or equivalent actions with the same result, are subject to a separately assessed real estate profit tax. The taxable gain is generally the difference between proceeds of the sale and the original purchase price of the property plus any capital expenditure incurred. The basic tax rate is the income tax rate for singles without children, which ranges between approximately 3% and 24%, depending on the amount of taxable real estate gain. The transfer of the economic ownership of real estate (e.g. via the sale of the majority of the shares in a real estate company) may trigger real estate tax as well.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
Liechtenstein has adopted the VAT law of Switzerland, while having its own VAT administration.
The general VAT rate is 8.1% (7.7% up to 31 December 2023). A reduced rate of 2.6% (2.5% up to 31 December 2023) is applicable to deliveries of food, drugs, newspapers, magazines, and books. Furthermore, lodging/accommodation is taxed at a reduced rate of 3.7%. Note that various services are VAT-exempt (e.g. health, social security, education, banking, insurance).
_See the section in the Corporate tax summary for further information._
## Wealth tax
Movable and immovable assets are subject to wealth tax. In principle, wealth tax is levied based upon the fair market value.
The taxable wealth is multiplied by a standard interest 4% to calculate a notional income, which is subject to income tax together with other income.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Liechtenstein does not levy inheritance, estate, or gift taxes.
## Dedication tax
Dedication of assets to a non-taxable entity (non-profit organisation according to Art. 107 Abs. 4a PGR) or under circumstances that make the assets no longer subject to wealth taxation triggers a tax of 3.5% of the wealth tax value of the contribution. The donator is taxable.
To the extent that, due to the transfer of wealth to a legal person or special asset dedication not exempted from tax liability pursuant to article 107 paragraph 4a PGR, this wealth is no longer subject to the wealth tax and privileges or shares do not become liable to the wealth tax, the transferor shall pay a tax in the amount of 3.5% of the wealth-tax value of the contribution.
In addition to the state tax of 3.5%, there will be a surcharge for the community of 3.5% multiplied by 150% to 180%; consequently, the maximum dedication tax is 10.5%.
