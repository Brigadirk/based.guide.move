## Foreign tax relief
Credit in the form of a rebate from South African tax is allowed for taxes paid on foreign income.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
The most significant recent changes impacting the taxation of individuals in South Africa are as follows:
  * From 1 March 2024, to the extent that a non-resident beneficiary has or obtains a vested right to the income received by / accrued to a South African resident trust, the trust will be treated as fiscally opaque, i.e. the trust (instead of the non-resident beneficiary) will be taxed on the income.
  * The introduction of a two pot retirement system, announced in 2023, took effect from 1 September 2024. 
  * From a tax administration perspective, effective from 1 December 2022, natural persons withone or more outstanding income tax returns will be subject to fixed non-compliance penalties.
  * All individuals who are provisional taxpayers with assets above 50 million South African rand (ZAR) will be required to declare specified assets and liabilities at market values in the 2023 tax returns and subsequent year returns.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
South African residents are taxed on their worldwide income. Credit is granted in South Africa for foreign taxes paid on income from a non-South African source. Non-residents are taxed on their South African sourced income. The same rates of tax are applicable to both residents and non-residents.
Progressive tax rates apply for individuals. The rates for the tax year commencing on 1 March 2024 and ending on 28 February 2025 are as follows:
## Personal income tax rates
Income (ZAR) | Tax on column 1 (ZAR) | Tax on excess (%)  
---|---|---  
0 to 237,100 | 0 | 18  
237,101 to 370,500 | 42,678 | 26  
370,501 to 512,800 | 77,362 | 31  
512,801 to 673,000 | 121,475 | 36  
673,001 to 857,900 | 179,147 | 39  
857,901 to 1,817,000 | 251,258 | 41

## Taxable period
The tax year for individuals ends at the end of February. In exceptional cases accounts may be drawn up to a different date. Spouses are taxed separately and must submit separate returns.
## Tax returns
The date for the filing of returns is fixed each year by government notice. Individuals with a single source of taxable employment income below ZAR 500,000 do not need to submit tax returns.
SARS also issues auto-assessments to certain individuals calculated using data received from employers, medical schemes, banks, retirement annuity funds, and other institutions. If the taxpayer is in agreement with the auto-assessment, no further action is required in the case of a refund due, while payment must be made before the due date if owing SARS. The taxpayer must complete and file a tax return if not in agreement with the auto-assessment. The date for the filing of the return is fixed by government notice.
## Payment of tax
Pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) WHT is withheld on remuneration for employment. Where PAYE deductions are made from remuneration, these deductions constitute nothing more than advance payments toward the liability for normal tax.
Individuals earning non-remuneration income are required to register as provisional taxpayers and must make two provisional tax payments per year, the first by the end of August and the second by the end of February, based on an estimate of taxable income for the year.
## Tax audit process
There is no prescribed audit process and an audit can be initiated by any factor as determined by SARS. The audit or inspection will commence with a request from SARS for the taxpayer to make available any such records or information as may be required.
## Statute of limitations
Tax debts to the state prescribe after a period of 15 years. Submitted tax returns that have been assessed may not be reopened after a period of three years from date of assessment unless there has been fraud, misrepresentation or non-disclosure by the taxpayer.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
High net worth individuals and trusts are currently a focus of SARS, as well as automatic exchange of information between tax authorities. Since October 2021, SARS has appointed a new director of its unit for high net worth individuals to renew its focus on conducting investigations into individuals and families, as well as commencing lifestyle audits for individuals.


# South Africa
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
## Employment expenses
Certain limited expenses may be deducted by employees from their employment income. Such expenses include business-related travel, automobile, and entertainment expenses, with the amount that is deductible by an employee also being limited to the amount of the relevant allowance that is granted to the employee by their employer. A capital depreciation deduction is also available for allowance assets used in the course of employment. Legal fees incurred in respect of employment income are also deductible.
Employees who earn most of their income in the form of commissions may, subject to certain requirements, deduct their home office expenses.
As a general rule, allowances (subject to certain limits), granted to an employee by an employer to meet business expenditure are taxable in South Africa, but only to the extent that they are not so expended for business or exceed the maximum limit for deduction. Allowances to meet purely domestic or private expenditure, such as the cost of living, are taxable.
## Personal deductions
### Charitable contributions
Donations to certain approved public benefit organisations are allowed as deductions, up to a maximum of 10% of taxable income.
### Medical expenses
Medical scheme contributions for taxpayers and their dependants (subject to certain maximum limits) convert to a specified monetary amount tax rebate. This rebate can be set-off against the personâ€™s tax liability (_see the section for more information_). The conversion rate for persons over the age of 65 and persons with a disability is higher.
The contributions in excess of the specified credit amount as well as any other medical expenses are converted to medical tax rebates at a specified rate. Persons over the age of 65 and persons with a disability are subject to a higher conversion rate and are also not subject to a further threshold for the excess, which applies to persons under the age of 65 who have no disability.
### Income insurance policy
Premiums paid on a loss of income insurance policy as a result of death, disablement, severe illness, or unemployment are not allowed as a deduction. However, a corresponding exemption results in none of the proceeds being taxable.
### Retirement funds
Contributions to a pension, provident, or retirement annuity fund are deductible (subject to certain maximum limits), provided that such funds are registered in South Africa.
## Standard deductions
There are no other standard deductions from income for natural persons. The other deductions that may be claimed by persons earning remuneration income are limited (_see Business deductions below, for more information_).
## Business deductions
If the taxpayer is carrying on a business in their individual capacity or in partnership, the deduction of business expenditure or losses is available to them on the same basis as to companies.
Where the deductions and allowances permissible under the Income Tax Act exceed income, an assessed loss results which may be carried forward for set-off against income earned in future years. Assessed losses that are realised by an individual who falls into the highest tax bracket and that result from so-called 'secondary trades' (such as sports, arts, dealing in collectibles, hobby-farming, and rental of property) are ring-fenced in certain circumstances.
## Losses
Assessed losses incurred (deductible expenses exceed income) can be carried over to the next tax year to be set-off against the taxable income of that following year, provided that the taxpayer trades in that following year. 
Taxpayers who earn employment income and are subject to income tax at the maximum marginal rate of 45% may, upon meeting certain requirements, have their losses from carrying on a secondary trade ring-fenced to that specific secondary trade.

## Treatment of trusts
The tax rate on the taxable income of a trust other than a special trust (special trusts being trusts created for the benefit of mentally or physically handicapped individuals and trusts created in terms of a will for the benefit of minor children that are relatives of the deceased) is 45%. Trusts do not qualify for the tax rebates referred to above. Special trusts are taxed at the rates used for individuals.
A trust that has been approved as a public benefit organisation is exempt from tax, unless it earns trading income in which case it would pay tax at a rate of 27% on its trading income.
Capital gains are included in a trust's taxable income at a rate of 40% for special trusts and 80% for all other trusts.
Trusts have to adhere to certain additional disclosure requirements relating to beneficial ownership and are also required to submit returns to the SARS regarding distributions made to beneficiaries. 
Trusts are tax transparent for the most part where the income of the trust vests in a beneficiary in the same tax year. As of 2024, if the income of a South African trust vests in a non-resident beneficiary, the trust will be taxable on the income (i.e. instead of the non-resident beneficiary). 
## Treatment of partnerships
Partnerships are treated as tax transparent with the partners being taxed on the income of the partnership and being entitled to any deductions that the partnership would have been entitled to in accordance with the profit-sharing ratio. New beneficial ownership disclosure requirements will be implemented in the near future.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
## Employment income
Taxable remuneration includes all cash amounts received for services rendered (including bonuses and allowances) as well as most benefits in kind (such as the use of assets and 'soft' loans). For non-residents, these amounts form a part of South African gross income if they are effectively connected to the person's employment in South Africa. There are no special concessions for short-term foreign employees, except under DTTs.
South African residents who receive employment income for performing their employment-related tasks in a foreign country are exempt from tax on the first ZAR 1.25 million of the employment income, provided that they have, during any 12-month period, spent more than 183 full days (including a continuous period of at least 60 full days) outside South Africa.
As of 2024, non-resident employers who conduct business through a PE in South Africa will be required to register for payroll taxes and withhold these taxes from employees' remuneration (where applicable). 
## Equity compensation
Equity instruments acquired by virtue of employment or office held as director, whether from the employer or an associated institution in relation to the employer, are subject to income tax on the difference between the market value of the equity instrument and the consideration paid by the employee or office holder on the date that the equity instrument 'vests'.
Generally, an equity instrument will 'vest' when there are no restrictions attached to the instrument that affect the full and unencumbered ownership of the instrument.
## Business income
Self-employment income is derived from an unincorporated business, partnership, trade, or profession. Persons earning self-employment income could include partners in a partnership or persons earning commission or professional fees or income from independent services.
An amount received or accrued from self-employment will be taxable in South Africa. Non-residents will only be taxed on South African-sourced self-employment income.
## Capital gains
The maximum effective tax rate on capital gains is 18%. 40% of net capital gains realised are taxed at the normal income tax rates. An individual is entitled to an annual exclusion of ZAR 40,000 in determining the net capital gain for a year (in the year that the taxpayer dies, this annual exclusion is increased to ZAR 300,000).
All foreign capital gains realised by a South African resident are included in the South African tax net. For a non-resident, only the gains from the disposal of South African immovable property, interests in â€˜land richâ€™ companies and the property of a South African permanent establishment (PE) are included.
Any disposal of South African immovable property by a non-resident is subject to WHT. Where the seller is a non-South African resident individual, the rate of WHT is 7.5%. This is not a final tax but an advance against the seller's actual tax liability for the year. Where it is expected that the actual tax liability will be less than the WHT, SARS may allow the WHT to be reduced.
Where an individual who is resident in South Africa disposes of a primary residence, up to ZAR 2 million of the capital gain will be exempt from capital gains tax (CGT). If the property has previously been leased or used partly for purposes of trade, an apportionment of the exclusion will apply.
## Dividend income
Dividends paid by South African resident companies (or by non-resident companies if the shares in respect of which the dividends are paid are listed on a South African exchange) to individual shareholders are generally subject to a 20% dividend withholding tax, regardless of residency of the shareholder. Most foreign dividends accrued to or received by South African residents are exempt from tax if the resident holds at least 10% of the equity shares and voting rights in the company. Most other foreign dividends are subject to tax at an effective rate of 20%.
## Interest income
Interest received by or accrued to an individual is taxable. However, an exemption applies to the first ZAR 23,800 of local interest income (ZAR 34,500 for taxpayers who are 65 years of age or older).
Non-resident individuals are exempt from income tax unless the individual is physically present in South Africa for more than 183 days in aggregate during the year preceding the date on which the interest accrues or the debt on which the interest arises is effectively connected to a PE in South Africa. This exemption aligns with the WHT on interest paid from a South African source to a non-resident, levied at a rate of 15%.
## Rental income
Rental income from fixed or movable property is included in taxable income subject to allowable expenses and losses being deductible against such income.
## Exempt income
Exemptions from income exist for natural persons subject to meeting the specified requirements. Exemptions include (subject to limitations and conditions):
  * remuneration of certain non-resident employees of foreign states employed in South Africa
  * certain pensions received from sources outside South Africa by both residents and non-residents
  * lump sum payments from qualifying life policies
  * special uniform allowances received by an employee
  * employment relocation allowances received by an employee
  * foreign employment income received by resident employees up to ZAR 1.25 million (specific time periods applicable)
  * bona fide scholarships and bursaries
  * amounts of alimony received by a spouse under a judicial separation or divorce, and
  * amounts received or accrued on tax free investments.

## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
## Medical tax credit
A medical tax credit is available in respect of medical scheme contributions for taxpayers under the age of 65. This rebate replaced the deduction that was previously available. For the tax year commencing on 1 March 2024, the monthly rebates for medical scheme contributions are as follows:
  * Taxpayer: ZAR 364.
  * First dependant: ZAR 364.
  * Every subsequent dependant: ZAR 246.


The annual rebate applicable to excess medical scheme contributions and other medical expenses is calculated as follows:
  * Taxpayer over 65 years of age: 33.3% of the sum of qualifying medical expenses paid and the amount by which medical scheme contributions paid exceed three times the medical scheme tax credits for the year.
  * Taxpayer with a disability: 33.3% of the sum of qualifying medical expenses paid and the amount by which medical scheme contributions paid exceed three times the medical scheme tax credits for the year.
  * Taxpayer under 65 years with no disability: 25% of the sum of qualifying medical expenses paid and the amount by which medical scheme contributions paid exceed four times the medical scheme tax credits for the year, limited to the amount exceeding 7.5% of taxable income.


## Tax rebates
A taxpayer is entitled to so-called tax rebates that are deducted from tax payable. The rebates have the effect of establishing tax thresholds below which no tax is payable.
For the 2025 tax year (i.e. the tax year commencing on 1 March 2024 and ending on 28 February 2025), the following rebates apply:
  * Primary rebate: ZAR 17,235 for all natural persons.
  * Secondary rebate: ZAR 9,444 if the taxpayer is 65 years of age or over.
  * Tertiary rebate: ZAR 3,145 if the taxpayer is 75 years of age or over.




# South Africa
## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
A natural person ordinarily resident in South Africa, or who is physically present in South Africa for a specified period, is considered a resident for tax purposes. There is no statutory definition of â€˜ordinarily residentâ€™. South African courts have held that a taxpayer is ordinarily resident in the country of their most fixed or settled residence, the country to which they would naturally, and as a matter of course, return from their wanderings, or their usual or principal home.
If not ordinarily resident in South Africa, an individual is considered a South African resident if the individual is physically present in South Africa for more than 91 days, in aggregate, in the relevant tax year and each of the preceding five tax years, and also for more than 915 days, in aggregate, in the preceding five tax years. If a person, who has become a South African resident in terms of this physical presence test, spends a continuous period of at least 330 days outside South Africa, then the individual ceases to be a resident from the date of the beginning of the absence from South Africa.
On ceasing to be tax resident in South Africa, an individualâ€™s qualifying worldwide assets are deemed to be disposed of on the day before their date of departure from South Africa. Any growth in value on the assets could trigger a capital gains tax liability. It should be noted that there are other tax return filing requirements for the year of assessment during which a natural person ceases to be a South African tax resident.

## Social security/Unemployment insurance contributions
South Africa does not have a comprehensive social security system or a national healthcare program; consequently, no significant social security taxes are levied. Employees and employers are each obligated to make contributions to an unemployment insurance fund at the rate of 1% of gross remuneration. The employee's contribution is withheld by the employer. However, both the employer and employee's contributions are limited to a remuneration of ZAR 212,544  _per annum_ per employee. 
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is an indirect tax that is largely directed at the domestic consumption of goods and services in South Africa. The tax is designed to be paid mainly by the ultimate consumer or purchaser in South Africa. It is levied at two rates, namely a standard rate (currently 15%) and a zero rate (0%). 
Under the VAT system, vendors generally levy and account for VAT on taxable supplies made and are entitled to a deduction of the VAT incurred on expenses paid for purposes of making such taxable supplies. Only the â€˜added valueâ€™ is therefore ultimately taxed.
Practically, VAT is a self-assessment tax, and vendors are required to submit periodic VAT returns. The two main tax periods are either monthly (generally for large vendors) and bi-monthly (which is the standard tax period issued by the SARS). 
The amount of input tax that the vendor is entitled to for the specific tax period is set off against the output tax due to the SARS, and the net amount is either due and payable to or refundable by the SARS. 
Very few business transactions carried out in South Africa are not subject to VAT. The tax is generally collected by businesses that are registered with the SARS as vendors on all taxable supplies throughout the production and distribution chain. Sales or supplies by non-vendors are not subject to VAT.
#### VAT registration and administration
##### Compulsory registration 
All suppliers of goods and services having an annual turnover exceeding ZAR 1 million must register as a vendor and charge VAT on taxable supplies made in the course or furtherance of their enterprise. 
In addition, where a person expects that its taxable turnover will exceed ZAR 1 million in the next 12 months in terms of a written contractual agreement, such person is also required to register as a vendor and levy VAT on the taxable supplies made in the course or furtherance of their enterprise.
Non-resident suppliers of electronic services are required to register for VAT once the value of taxable supplies has exceeded ZAR 1 million in any consecutive 12-month period. 
##### Voluntary registration 
A person may elect to register as a VAT vendor if their annual taxable turnover exceeds ZAR 50,000.
Notwithstanding this, where the turnover does not exceed this amount, there are some specific rules to consider in order to register voluntarily, as follows: 
  * Where a person is carrying on an enterprise and the total value of taxable supplies made or to be made by that person has not yet exceeded ZAR 50,000 but can be reasonably expected to exceed this amount within 12 months from the date of registration, the person may register on a voluntary basis under certain circumstances. These circumstances are set out in the applicable regulations and mainly deal with when the SARS will accept that the afore-mentioned threshold will reasonably be expected to be exceeded. 


  * If a person is likely to make taxable supplies only after a period of time, the person may register if the activities are of a nature set out in the applicable regulations. These activities are also set out in the applicable regulations and include, for example, construction or mining type activities.


#### Taxable supplies
Standard-rated and zero-rated supplies are known as taxable supplies. Other supplies are known as either exempt supplies or non-supplies (i.e. supplies that are not subject to VAT). 
#### Goods and services
â€˜Goodsâ€™ are corporeal movable things, fixed property, and real rights in such things and property. â€˜Servicesâ€™ are very broad and encompass not only traditional services like consulting or legal advice but includes the granting, assignment, cession, or surrender of any right or the making available of any facility or advantage.
#### Electronic services
â€˜Electronic servicesâ€™ are defined quite broadly and include any supply of services by means of an electronic agent, electronic communication, or the Internet for a consideration. Further changes to these regulations are expected in the near future.
A non-resident supplier of electronic services will be regarded as conducting an enterprise in South Africa if two of the following criteria are applicable: 
  * The recipient has a residential address in South Africa. 


  * The recipient has a business address in South Africa.


  * Payment is received from a South African bank account.


#### Imports
Goods are subject to VAT on importation into South Africa. However, the VAT Act has a schedule setting out the specific goods that are exempt from VAT on importation.
Services imported by any person and used or consumed otherwise than for making taxable supplies is subject to VAT in South Africa. However, services imported wholly for taxable purposes is not subject to VAT in South Africa.
#### Zero-rated supplies
The VAT Act sets out supplies of goods or services that may be taxed at the zero rate. As VAT is a destination-based tax, exported goods and services may be zero-rated. 
Special provision is also made to zero rate the following (amongst others):
  * Certain basic foodstuffs. 


  * Fuel products subject to the fuel levy.


  * Specified goods utilised for farming purposes.


  * The sale of an enterprise as a going concern, 


Under a zero-rated supply, a vendor charges VAT at 0% on the value of the supply and obtains a credit for the VAT paid on taxable supplies utilised in the making of the zero-rated supplies.
#### Exempt supplies
The VAT Act sets out specific supplies of goods or services that are exempt from VAT. Examples of exempt supplies include financial services, residential rentals, non-international passenger transport by road or rail, and educational services. However, all fee-based financial services are subject to VAT at 15%. 
No VAT is deductible on expenses incurred for the purpose of making exempt supplies.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
South Africa does not levy any net wealth/worth taxes.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Estate duty is levied on the dutiable amount of a deceased personâ€™s estate. An abatement of ZAR 3.5 million is deducted from the net value of the estate in order to determine the dutiable amount, on which estate duty is calculated at the rate of 20% on the value of the estate to the extent that it does not exceed ZAR 30 million and at a rate of 25% to the extent that the value of the estate exceeds ZAR 30 million. A non-resident's estate will be subject to estate duty, but only the assets located in South Africa will be included in the estate for the purposes of the duty.
Donations tax is payable by South African resident individuals at a rate of 20% of the value of the donated property to the extent that this value does not exceed ZAR 30 million, and at a rate of 25% to the extent that the value of property donated exceeds ZAR 30 million. Exempt donations include those between spouses, donations to approved public benefit organisations and all other donations by an individual that, during the tax year, do not exceed ZAR 100,000 in aggregate.
## Property taxes
Local municipalities levy rates on land. These rates are based on a percentage of the municipal valuation of land and improvements, and vary by municipality. Generally, a higher rate is levied on properties zoned for business use.
## Luxury and excise taxes
Excise duty is levied on certain locally manufactured goods as well as their imported equivalents. A specific duty at a pre-determined amount is levied on tobacco and liquor. An _ad valorem_ duty is levied on certain luxury goods and automobiles.
Relief from excise duty is available for exported products, and for certain products produced in the course of specified farming, forestry, and (limited) manufacturing activities.
## Other non-income taxes
### Transfer duty
Transfer duty is payable on the transfer of immovable property or rights in such property located in South Africa. The duty is payable by the person acquiring the property at the following rates:
Value of property (ZAR) | Transfer duty rate  
---|---  
Not exceeding 1,100,000 | 0  
1,100,001 to 1,512,500 | 3% on value above 1,100,000  
1,512,501 to 2,117,500 | 12,375 plus 6% on value above 1,512,500  
2,117,501 to 2,722,500 | 48,675 plus 8% on value above 2,117,500  
2,722,501 to 12,100,000 | 97,075 plus 11% on value above 2,722,500  
Exceeding 12,100,000 | 1,128,600 plus 13% on value above 12,100,000  
Transfers of immovable property that are subject to VAT are exempt from the transfer duty.
### Securities transfer tax (STT)
STT applies to the transfer of listed and unlisted securities. The tax rate is 0.25%, which is applied to the taxable amount in respect of the transfer of a security. The taxable amount is usually the consideration for which the security is purchased, or (if the consideration is less than the market value of the security) the market value of the security. If the consideration declared is less than the market value, or if no consideration was paid, STT will be payable by the company that issued the shares in question (or, in the case of listed shares, by a regulated intermediary). However, the company or regulated intermediary can then recover the tax from the person acquiring the shares. Slightly different rules apply in the case of listed securities.
### Skills development levy (SDL)
SDL is a compulsory levy to fund education and training. It is payable by an employer and cannot be deducted from the remuneration payable to an employee. Small employers with an annual payroll of less than ZAR 500,000 are exempt from the levy. SDL is levied at the rate of 1% of payroll. It is payable monthly, together with income tax that the employer has withheld on its employeesâ€™ salaries.
### Workmenâ€™s compensation
Employers are liable for workmenâ€™s compensation, calculated by applying to the employeeâ€™s earnings varying rates depending on the employerâ€™s industry. An exemption applies where an employee is employed in a private household only.
## Withholding taxes (WHTs)
The following WHTs apply to South-African sourced income payable to a foreign resident. The statutory rates may be reduced by double tax treaties (DTTs).
  * WHT on royalties: 15% of the gross amount of royalties.
  * WHT on foreign sportspersons and entertainers: 15% of the consideration for the person's activities in South Africa.
  * WHT on dividends: 20% of the gross amount of dividend.
  * WHT on interest: 15% of the gross amount of interest.
  * WHT on the sale of South African immovable property: 7.5% of the consideration where the property is sold by a non-resident individual. This is not a final tax but an advance on the final tax liability and may be reduced upon a ruling from the South African tax authority.
