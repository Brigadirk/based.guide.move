## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
  * The Global Minimum Tax Bill for the implementation by South Africa of the Pillar Two legislation is under consideration by Parliament (expected promulgation date is the end of December 2024). The Bill proposes to introduce two measures to effect the Pillar Two proposals, namely an Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) and a Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax for Qualifying Multinationals (QDMTT) for years of assessment commencing on or after 1 January 2024.
  * In October 2024, the Protocol amending the South Africa-Kuwait Double Taxation Agreement (Kuwait DTA) entered into force. The Protocol amends a number of the Kuwait DTA articles, notably the source country is now afforded the right to tax dividends (up to a maximum rate). Prior to the Protocol, the Kuwait DTA enabled the allocation of sole taxing rights on dividends under the South Africa-Netherlands and South Africa-Sweden DTAs to the residence country as a result of so-called most favoured nation (MFN) provisions in those DTAs. Due to the Protocol amendments, the MFN provisions are ’switched off’ and the source country will have taxing rights on the dividends as provided for in the respective DTAs.
  * To encourage the production of electric vehicles in South Africa, the 2024 Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (expected promulgation date is the end of December 2024) provides for a deduction (150% of cost) by a motor vehicle manufacturer for qualifying assets brought into use from 1 March 2026 and before 1 March 2036 on production capacity for electric and hydrogen‐powered vehicles in South Africa.
  * National Treasury has published three tax policy discussion documents for stakeholder input, i.e. Taxation of Alcoholic Beverages, Phase 2 of Carbon Tax, and the Tax Treatment of Collective Investment Schemes. These are expected to give rise to changes to be announced in the 2025 Budget.
  * In November 2023, South Africa joined 47 other countries in agreeing to adopt the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework.
  * The corporate income tax (CIT) rate was reduced to 27% (from 28%) for tax years ending on or after 31 March 2023.
  * Base broadening measures related to the restructure of the CIT system proposed a limitation on the use of assessed losses and on interest deductions. The following measures took effect for tax years ending on or after 31 March 2023: 
    * The scope of the interest limitation rules was expanded to include payments that are economically equivalent to interest, and the fixed-ratio limitation for net interest expense was limited to 30% of earnings (i.e. tax EBITDA). The limitation applies to interest on debt with persons in a controlling relationship where the interest is not subject to tax in the hands of the recipient. 
    * Tax losses carried forward may only be applied against 80% of taxable income, subject to a 1 million South African rand (ZAR)  _de minimis _provision.
  * The government is conducting a comprehensive review of all corporate tax incentives, with a view to further broaden the CIT base and to avoid complicated tax incentives that reduce progressivity by unfairly advantaging specific sectors or groups of taxpayers and that hamper efficient administration of the tax system. The research and development (R&D) tax incentive was amended, and the incentive (in its amended form) is available for a period of ten years from 1 January 2024.
  * An expanded renewable energy tax incentive was introduced for the period 1 March 2023 to 28 February 2025 to alleviate the energy crisis. The incentive takes the form of a 125% deduction in the first year for renewable energy generation projects.
  * The first phase of the carbon tax was extended by three years for the period 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2025. There is a substantial increase in the carbon tax rate trajectory from 1 January 2023 onwards. Allowances are expected to decrease over time.
  * The tax regime for the upstream petroleum industry was reviewed, and the minimum flexible royalty rate was increased from 0.5% to 2%. The maximum rate will remain 5%.
  * South Africa ratified the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Multilateral Instrument (MLI) in September 2022. The MLI entered into force for South Africa on 1 January 2023.
  * A non-resident employer who conducts business through a permanent establishment (PE) in South Africa will be required to register for payroll taxes and to withhold and pay over such taxes to the South African Revenue Service (SARS), as applicable.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
## Taxable period
The corporate tax year is the same as the company’s financial year. It may be changed upon application showing reasonable cause.
## Tax returns
Annual income tax returns must be submitted within one year from the end of the company’s tax year. The annual tax return includes a supplementary reconciling return where requested. Furthermore, schedules apply for CFCs, short-term insurers, mining companies, headquarter companies, and learnership allowances.
‘Signed off’ financial statements are required to be submitted with the annual tax return.
## Payment of tax
Payments are made with provisional returns filed at six-month intervals from the tax year-end based on an estimate of taxable income for the year. Interest is charged on any underpayment outstanding for more than six months after the tax year-end, except in the case of February year-ends, in which case it is seven months. Any balance (together with interest) is then paid following assessment.
## Tax audit process
There is no prescribed audit process, and an audit can be initiated by any factor as determined by the SARS. The audit or inspection will commence with a request from the SARS for the taxpayer to make available any such records or information as may be required.
## Statute of limitations
Tax debts to the state prescribe after a period of 15 years. Tax returns submitted that have been assessed may not be reopened after a period of three years from date of assessment by the SARS or five years if it is a self-assessment by the taxpayer, unless there has been fraud, misrepresentation, or non-disclosure by the taxpayer.
The prescription period may be extended by three years in the case of an assessment by the SARS or by two years in the case of self-assessment in respect of certain complex matters, such as transfer pricing and general anti-avoidance cases.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The SARS, in their 2020/21 to 2024/25 Strategic Plan, stated that the key strategic focus of the SARS will be the following:
  * Providing clarity and certainty for taxpayers and traders of their obligations.
  * Making it easy for taxpayers and traders to comply with their obligations.
  * Detecting taxpayers and traders who do not comply, and making non-compliance hard and costly.
  * Developing a high performing, diverse, agile, engaged, and evolved workforce.
  * Increasing and expanding the use of data within a comprehensive knowledge management framework to ensure integrity, derive insight, and improve outcomes.
  * Modernising SARS systems to provide digital and streamlined online services.
  * Demonstrating effective resource stewardship to ensure efficiency and effectiveness in delivering quality outcomes and performance excellence.
  * Working with and through stakeholders to improve the tax ecosystem.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
A company is resident in South Africa if it is incorporated, established, or formed in South Africa or has its place of effective management in South Africa. However, a company that is deemed to be exclusively resident in another country in terms of a DTA is excluded from SA residency.
In terms of an Interpretation Note issued by the SARS, the place of effective management is regarded as the place where key management and commercial decisions that are necessary for the conduct of its business as a whole are, in substance, made. This approach is consistent with internationally accepted principles.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
South Africa does not, as a general rule, tax non-residents on the basis of having a PE in South Africa. Rather, non-residents are subject to income tax in South Africa on income derived from a South African source. The South African source rules deem income from the disposal of movable property that is effectively connected with a South African PE (as defined from time to time in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] Model Tax Convention) to be from a South African source. 
Non-residents are subject to tax on capital gains realised on the disposal of any asset effectively connected with a South African PE (as defined from time to time in the OECD Model Tax Convention) of the person.


# South Africa
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
## Depreciation and depletion
A depreciation (wear and tear) allowance may be deducted on movable assets used for the purpose of trade. There are no statutory provisions relating to rates of wear and tear, but the SARS has published a table of periods over which the assets may be written off. The rates of wear and tear, based on the cash cost, are calculated either according to the straight-line or diminishing-balance method.
New and unused machinery used in a process of manufacture or in a similar process is depreciable at the rate of 40% in the first year of use and 20% in the three following years. If the machinery is not new and unused, an allowance of 20% per year over five years is available.
An accelerated depreciation allowance (50% in the first year of use, 30% in the second, and 20% in the third year) applies to the machinery and articles used in farming, production of biodiesel or bioethanol, and production of energy from certain renewable sources. This allowance has been temporarily expanded to allow taxpayers to claim a 125% deduction in the first year for all renewable energy projects. The expanded incentive will only be available for investments brought into use for the first time between 1 March 2023 and 28 February 2025.
Specific allowances are also provided for pipelines, transmission lines, railway lines, rolling stock, ships, mining operations, and other qualifying industrial assets.
Buildings and other permanent structures may not be depreciated, apart from an annual allowance for each of the following:
  * Buildings used in a process of manufacture or a process similar to a process of manufacture: For buildings erected before 1 January 1989, a 2% rate applies per year. For buildings erected after 1 January 1989, a 5% rate applies.
  * Hotel buildings: For buildings built prior to 4 June 1988, a 2% rate applies per year. For hotel buildings erected after 4 June 1988, a 5% rate applies. Improvements within the existing building framework that commenced on or after 17 March 1993 are depreciated at the rate of 20%.
  * Agricultural cooperative storage buildings: For buildings built prior to 1 January 1989, a 2% rate applies per year. For buildings erected on or after 1 January 1989, a 5% rate applies.
  * Housing projects of not less than five units: Housing projects of not less than five units of residential accommodation, which consist of more than one room and the erection of which commenced on or after 1 April 1982 and before 21 October 2008, are subject to a 2% rate of depreciation. After 21 October 2008, an allowance of 5% is available on this type of property. The 5% depreciation rate is available to the taxpayer provided that the unit is used by the taxpayer solely for trade purposes, the unit is situated in South Africa, and the taxpayer owns at least five units in South Africa used for the purposes of trade. An additional allowance is available for a low-cost residential unit.
  * Buildings in urban development zones: Improvements to an existing building in an urban development zone, where the existing structural or exterior framework is preserved and brought into use before 31 March 2014, qualify for an accelerated allowance of 20% per year. Buildings that are erected, extended, or added to in an urban development zone on or after 21 October 2008 and which are not covered by the first mentioned allowance qualify for a 20% allowance in the first year and an 8% allowance in the following ten years. As of 21 October 2008, new and unused low-income residential units located in urban development zone demarcations are subject to an additional annual depreciation allowance. The rate is 25% in the first year, 13% in the succeeding five years, and 10% in the year following the last year. Improvements are subject to a depreciation allowance of 25% over a period of four years. The allowance will no longer be available if a building ceases to be used solely for the purposes of trade, was disposed of in a previous year of assessment, or was brought into use after 31 March 2025.
  * Commercial buildings: The cost to the taxpayer of any new and unused building owned by the taxpayer, or any new and unused improvement to any building owned by the taxpayer, if that building or improvement wholly or mainly is used by the taxpayer for trade purposes, other than the provision of residential accommodation, is subject to a 5% rate of depreciation. This allowance is applicable to any building or improvement contracted for on or after 1 April 2007 and the construction of which commenced on or after 1 April 2007.


An allowance for assets disposed of or scrapped during a year of assessment is determined by reference to the cost less allowances already granted and the proceeds on disposal (if any). Recoupments of allowances granted are taxable where disposal proceeds exceed the tax basis at the time of sale. Such recoupments cannot exceed the cost of the asset. Proceeds above cost will be taxed as a capital gain.
Book depreciation does not need to be consistent with tax depreciation.
No cost or percentage depletion is available for natural resources.
## Goodwill
The sale and purchase of goodwill is generally a transaction on capital account, and the person paying for the goodwill will usually be unable to claim a deduction. No capital allowances are available for goodwill.
## Start-up expenses
Special relief is provided for start-up (or pre-trade) expenditure to allow for a deduction in the year that trade commences. The expenses are only deductible if they would have been deductible had they been incurred after the commencement of trade. These expenses and any loss they create are ring-fenced and may only be deducted against income from the trade to which the start-up costs relate.
## Interest expenses
Generally, interest expenditure incurred in the production of non-exempt income and for the purposes of trade is deductible. However, interest that is incurred to produce income that is exempt from tax will not be allowed as a tax deduction. A special dispensation applies to the deduction of interest on debt used to acquire shares in a company, provided certain requirements are met.
Special rules apply to determine the amount of interest and timing of any deductions taking into account all payments and receipts in respect of debt instruments with interest being determined on the basis of an internal rate of return.
Certain debt instruments that are convertible to shares or may be settled in shares or where repayment is subject to solvency or related to connected-party debt with a maturity of 30 years or more are treated as hybrid debt instruments and no interest deduction is allowed in respect thereof. Certain hybrid interest is also treated as a dividend.
In addition, the interest deduction for interest paid between parties in a controlling relationship is limited where such interest is not subject to income tax or WHT on interest at the full domestic rate. Any excess interest may be carried forward to the following year for deduction. Effective for tax years ending on or after 31 March 2023, the scope of the interest limitation rules is expanded to include payments that are economically equivalent to interest, and the percentage for net interest expense will be limited to 30% of adjusted taxable income (i.e. tax EBITDA).
Further interest deduction limitations also apply to interest paid on debt used to fund acquisitions of shares or businesses under certain of the corporate rollover relief provisions (_see the section_). 
The deduction of cross-border interest paid to connected persons is subject to transfer pricing rules (_see Transfer pricing and thin capitalisation in the section_).
## Bad debt
Bad debts are tax deductible if the debt relates to an amount that has been included in the taxpayer’s taxable income in any tax year if it is due at the end of the year of assessment. A tax allowance is also provided for in respect of doubtful debts.
Any bad debts arising on loaned money is deductible if it was lent in the course of a money-lending business.
## Charitable contributions
Donations to certain charitable organisations approved as public benefit organisations are tax deductible, up to a maximum of 10% of taxable income.
## Cost of inventory
The cost of inventory is, in principle, deductible as soon as the inventory is acquired. However, at the end of each year, the cost of the inventory still on hand has to be added to the company’s income. Then in the next year, it can be deducted again. This has the effect of timing the deduction of the cost of inventory to match the time of its realisation.
## Assets acquired for shares issued
When assets are acquired by a company in return for shares issued to the seller, the purchaser of the assets is deemed to have incurred expenditure equal to the market value of the shares immediately after acquisition. Special rules apply in the case of a mismatch in the value of the shares and assets.
## Fines and penalties
Any fine or penalty imposed in respect of an unlawful activity carried out in South Africa, or in any other country where it would be unlawful in South Africa, is not deductible for tax purposes.
## Taxes
Most taxes (other than income taxes, donations tax, WHT on interest, and dividends tax) are deductible from taxable income for the corporation, provided they qualify for deduction under general rules.
## Net operating losses
Assessed losses may be carried forward indefinitely, provided an active trade or business of a similar nature is carried on without interruption. For tax years ending on or after 31 March 2023, companies with assessed losses will be entitled to set off any balance of assessed loss carried forward to the extent that the set-off amount does not exceed the higher of ZAR 1 million and 80% of the taxable income for that year.
Loss carrybacks are not provided for in South Africa.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Deductions may be claimed for royalties, managerial service fees, and interest charges paid to foreign affiliates, provided such amounts approximate those that would be paid to an unrelated party in an arm’s-length transaction.
Interest deductions may be limited in certain circumstances (_see Interest expenses above and Transfer pricing and thin capitalisation in the section_).


# South Africa
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
Group taxation is generally not permitted in South Africa. However, relief is given for transactions between group companies to allow for reorganisations, provided certain requirements are met.
In general, the relief will only apply to transactions between companies within the same group. A group of companies is defined as a controlling company and one or more controlled companies in relation to that controlling company. A controlling company means a company holding, directly or indirectly, at least 70% of the equity shares of any other company. Foreign-incorporated companies do not form part of a group of companies for the purposes of this relief unless effectively managed in South Africa, although relief is extended to controlled foreign companies (CFCs) in certain circumstances.
Corporate rollover relief is available for asset-for-share transactions, amalgamation transactions, intra-group transactions, unbundling transactions, and transactions relating to liquidation, winding-up, and deregistration.
The relief may cover the capital gains tax arising from the disposal of capital assets, income tax arising from the disposal of a depreciable asset, income tax arising from the disposal of trading stock, donations tax arising from the disposal of an asset, dividends tax, VAT, securities transfer tax, and transfer duty.
## Transfer pricing and thin capitalisation
South Africa has transfer pricing legislation applying to cross-border transactions involving connected persons. The transfer pricing legislation applies the arm’s-length standard.
The transfer pricing legislation does not separately address transfer pricing and thin capitalisation. Rather, thin capitalisation is simply treated as a potential breach of the general arm's-length standard (i.e. in relation to the level of funding).
Where a transfer pricing adjustment is required to be made, that adjustment is subject to a secondary adjustment where it is deemed to be either a dividend or a donation.
In addition, South Africa has formally adopted the OECD’s three-tiered documentation approach, and certain taxpayers are required to electronically submit Country-by-Country Reports, Master File, and/or Local File returns within 12 months of the end of their financial year.
The SARS has also, in recent years, expanded the transfer pricing questions contained in the CIT returns. In answering these questions, taxpayers are required to make a full disclosure of all requested information, as well as any information that may be relevant.
A pilot bilateral advance pricing agreement programme will be introduced in the near future.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
If one or more residents together, directly or indirectly, hold more than 50% of the voting or participation rights in a foreign company, then it is a CFC in relation to those residents. The income of a CFC is imputed to the residents in proportion to their holdings, subject to certain exclusions and tax credits, where applicable. The most notable exclusions are for high-taxed CFCs and for income attributable to ‘foreign business establishments’.


# South Africa
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
Non-residents of South Africa are subject to tax on income derived from a source in South Africa. SA branches of foreign companies are not considered to be separate legal entities for tax purposes, and no tax is withheld on transfers of profits to the head office. Branches of foreign companies are taxed at a rate of 28% (for tax years ending before 31 March 2023) and are not liable for dividends tax or any branch profits repatriation tax. The CIT rate is reduced to 27% for tax years ending on or after 31 March 2023.
Note that a branch must register as a taxpayer and submit tax returns. Separate financial statements must be drawn up for the SA branch. For all practical purposes, the SARS will treat the branch as a separate entity. For example, inter-branch cost recoveries levied by the head office incurred in the production of SA income normally will be allowed as a deduction by the branch, although this treatment is not extended to interest on inter-branch loans.
In terms of DTAs, the taxation of branches is limited to cases where the branch constitutes a PE.


# South Africa
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
## Foreign tax credit
The South African Income Tax Act makes provision for a rebate against CIT in respect of foreign taxes paid on foreign-sourced income or a deduction against income of foreign taxes paid on SA-sourced income. In both instances, the taxpayer must be an SA resident, the income must be included in taxable income, and that income must have been subject to a foreign tax that is not recoverable. The rebate is limited to the total normal tax payable calculated by applying the ratio of the total taxable income attributable to the foreign tax to the total taxable income. The deduction, however, may not exceed the income on which the foreign tax was levied.
## Research and development (R&D)
The current costs related to certain R&D activities carried on in South Africa are 150% deductible, subject to pre-approval by a government-appointed approval committee. The cost of machinery and other capital assets acquired for the purposes of R&D may be depreciated 50% in the first year of use, 30% in the second, and 20% in the third year. Buildings used in the process of R&D may be written-off over a 20-year period.
The incentive has been amended (mainly to simplify the current incentive and also to make it easier to administer), and the incentive (in the amended form) is available for a period of ten years from 1 January 2024.
## Headquarter company regime
A ‘headquarter company’ regime encourages the use of South Africa as a location for intermediate holding companies.
The main benefits offered to a headquarter company are:
  * Exemption from South Africa's CFC rules.
  * Exemptions from dividend WHT on the headquarter company's dividend distributions.
  * Exemption from the WHT on interest in certain circumstances.
  * Exemption from South Africa's transfer pricing rules on back-to-back loans, outbound loans, back-to-back intellectual property (IP) licensing arrangements, and outbound IP licensing arrangements.
  * The participation exemption for dividends received from, or gains derived on the disposal of, foreign qualifying holdings (these exemptions are not specific to headquarter companies but are available generally to SA-resident shareholders).


The requirements for a headquarter company are as follows:
  * The headquarter company must be SA resident.
  * Each shareholder in the headquarter company must hold at least 10% of the headquarter company's equity shares and voting rights. This means that a headquarter company can never have more than ten shareholders.
  * At least 80% of the headquarter company's assets (measured on a ‘cost’ basis and excluding cash and certain bank deposits) must be comprised of certain assets related to the foreign companies in which the headquarter company holds at least 10% of the equity shares and voting rights. Specifically, these assets must be: 
    * the equity shares in those companies
    * loans to those companies, and
    * IP licensed to those companies.
  * At least 50% of the headquarter company's gross income must be comprised of dividends, interest, royalties, rentals, service fees, or proceeds from the sale of equity shares or IP from its 10%-plus holdings, where the gross income exceeds ZAR 5 million.


## Industrial policy projects
In 2008, a ZAR 20 billion incentive package for investors in energy efficient projects was announced. The incentive is available for industrial projects participating in the manufacturing sector (other than alcohol or alcohol-related products, tobacco or tobacco-related products, arms and ammunition, and biofuels, which have a negative impact on food security). Companies are divided into those with a qualifying status and those with a preferred status. The status is determined in terms of a point system.
The proposed project must either be a ‘brownfield project’ (expansion or upgrade of an existing industrial project) or a ‘greenfield project’ (a wholly new industrial project, which uses new and unused manufacturing assets). Approved projects may be granted a tax allowance known as an additional investment allowance equal to 55% (100% if located in an industrial development zone) of the cost of any manufacturing asset used in an industrial policy project with preferred status or 35% (75% if located in an industrial development zone) of the cost of any manufacturing asset used in any other approved industrial policy project.
The additional investment allowance may not exceed ZAR 900 million in the case of any greenfield project with a preferred status, ZAR 550 million in the case of any other greenfield project, ZAR 550 million in the case of any brownfield project with a preferred status, or ZAR 350 million in the case of any other brownfield project.
In addition to the above, a company may also claim a deduction known as an additional training allowance.
Note that although the incentive has now expired, industrial-policy projects approved before 31 March 2020 continue to be entitled to the Section 12I benefits.
## Special Economic Zones (SEZs)
An SEZ incentive was introduced for companies carrying on business in certain approved SEZs comprising of a reduced corporate tax rate of 15% as well as a 10% allowance in respect of the cost of new and unused buildings owned by a qualifying company or any new or unused improvements to any building owned by a qualifying company.
In addition, employment incentives were introduced for employers carrying on a trade in an SEZ that will allow for an employees' tax reduction for the employer in respect of qualifying employees, up to a prescribed monthly amount.
VAT and customs relief are also available if the business is located within a Customs Controlled Area.
The incentive ceases to apply in respect of any year of assessment commencing on or after 1 January 2031. 
## Energy efficiency savings
The energy efficiency savings incentive provides an income tax deduction to qualifying taxpayers. The deduction equates to ZAR 0.95 for each kilowatt hour (or equivalent) saved by the taxpayer during the relevant year of assessment against a baseline from the beginning of the year.
The incentive has been extended to 31 December 2025.
## International shipping incentive
Income from international shipping of a resident company that holds a share in a South African flagged ship is exempt from income tax. Qualifying shipping companies can also use a currency other than the rand as the functional currency.
## Training contracts (learnership agreements)
There is an incentive that encourages employers to train employees in a regulated environment to facilitate skills development and job creation. This tax incentive is available for registered training contracts and allows for an additional income tax deduction (i.e. in addition to the usual deductions for remuneration expenses) for employers. The sunset date for the incentive has been extended from 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2027.


# South Africa
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
## Payments to residents
The only payments to residents that are subject to WHT are in respect of dividends, although dividend distributions to South African resident companies are exempt from dividends tax.
## Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Multilateral Instrument (MLI)
South Africa ratified the BEPS MLI in September 2022. 
The MLI entered into force for South Africa on 1 January 2023 and applies to South Africa’s 'Covered Tax Agreements' that are affected:
  * in respect of WHTs, from 1 January 2023, and
  * in relation to other taxes, for tax years starting on or after 1 July 2023.


There are slightly different effective dates for the modifications in respect of dispute resolution.
## Royalties payable to non-residents
Royalties and know-how payments made to non-residents for the use of or right to use IP rights in South Africa are deemed to be from an SA source. The payer of the royalty or know-how payment is obligated to deduct a WHT of 15% of this payment, which is a final tax payable by the recipient of such income.
## Dividends payable to non-residents
A dividend WHT of 20% applies to any dividend paid by a resident company to a non-resident or by a non-resident company to a non-resident where the shares in respect of which the dividends are paid are listed on a South African exchange. The tax is imposed on the beneficial owner of the dividend and not on the company, with the exception of _in specie_ dividends. The payer of the dividend or regulated intermediary is required to deduct the 20% WHT from the payment. 
## Interest payable to non-residents
A 15% WHT on interest applies to interest payable from an SA source to non-residents on certain debt instruments. The resident payer of the interest is required to deduct the 15% WHT from the payment.
## Service fees payable to non-residents
No domestic WHT is levied on fees payable to non-residents.
## Treaty rates for dividends, interest, and royalties
The WHT may be reduced by the terms of the relevant tax treaty, as shown below.
Note that the treaty rate is the maximum allowable rate to be charged by the treaty countries; where this rate is higher than the domestic tax rate, the latter will apply.

## Intergovernmental agreements (IGAs)
South Africa entered into an agreement with the United States to improve international tax compliance and to implement the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). The date of entry into force was 28 October 2014.
South Africa is also a party to the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance on Tax Matters as well as a number of bilateral tax information exchange agreements. As a signatory to the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information, also referred to as the Common Reporting Standard (CRS), South Africa enacted domestic enabling legislation. The first exchange date was September 2017. South Africa also has bilateral CRS agreements with Hong Kong, Qatar, and Singapore.
South Africa has also entered into a number of Bilateral Country-by-Country (CbC) Competent Authority Agreements to exchange CbC reports.
## Base Erosion and Profit shifting (BEPS)
South Africa is a member of the OECD’s Inclusive Framework on BEPS and has been amongst the first adopters of BEPS Actions in general. Notably, South Africa:
  * was amongst the first batch of signatories to the Multilateral Instrument (MLI) in June 2017 (South Africa ratified the MLI in 2022), and
  * enacted (in 2016 and 2017) domestic regulations to enact transfer pricing documentation requirements aligned with Chapter V of the OECD’s 2017 Transfer Pricing Guidelines (also referred to as BEPS Action 13), including the exchange of CbC reports.


The legislation to implement Pillar Two is contained in the 2024 Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (expected to be promulgated at the end of December 2024) and proposes to introduce two measures to effect the Pillar Two proposals, namely an Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) and a Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax for Qualifying Multinationals (QDMTT) for years of assessment commencing on or after 1 January 2024.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
On 9 October 2020, updated CRS regulations were published in the Government Gazette. These regulations replace earlier regulations from 2016 and introduce mandatory disclosure rules and administrative procedures in relation thereto.
The mandatory disclosure rules introduced ensure access to information on CRS Avoidance Arrangements and Opaque Offshore Structures for purposes of ensuring compliance with the CRS and the effective implementation of the anti-avoidance rules.
Broadly, the rules follow the OECD’s model mandatory disclosure rules to identify and counter offshore structures and arrangements that are designed in an attempt to circumvent financial account reporting under the CRS.
Although the definitional portions of the rules are effective from 1 June 2021, an intermediary’s obligation to disclose a CRS Avoidance Arrangement or Opaque Offshore Structures to the SARS comes into effect on 1 March 2024.
## Mandatory Disclosure Rules
The Tax Administration Act provides for the mandatory reporting of certain arrangements by persons who derive tax benefits or financial benefits from such arrangements, are promoters of the arrangement, or are parties to the arrangement.
Broadly, there are two types of reportable arrangement:
  * those containing certain hallmarks and where the tax benefit exceeds ZAR 5 million, and
  * arrangements that have been listed as reportable arrangements in a public notice.


If an arrangement is a reportable arrangement, it is required to be reported by a person to the SARS within 45 business days of it becoming a reportable arrangement or of the person becoming a participant in the reportable arrangement. A person need not disclose the reportable arrangement if a written statement is obtained from another participant that the reportable arrangement has been disclosed.
## Crypto Asset Reporting Framework
In November 2023, South Africa joined 47 other countries in agreeing to adopt the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework.
## Exchange control
South Africa has exchange control regulations that aim to restrict the buying and selling of a national currency or to preserve foreign currency reserves.

## Inventory valuation
Inventories generally are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Write-downs of inventory for slow-moving and obsolete items must be justified, and a general policy on a percentage basis is not permitted. Last in first out (LIFO) is not accepted for tax purposes.
## Capital gains
Although the capital gains tax forms part of income tax, the two taxes are not fully integrated. While gains realised by companies are taxed at the normal CIT rate, only 80% of gains are included in taxable income, making the effective capital gain tax rate for companies 22.4% for tax years ending before 31 March 2023 and 21.6% for tax years ending on or after 31 March 2023.
## Dividend income
Dividends are generally taxed in the hands of the beneficial owner at a rate of 20% (_see Dividends tax in the section_). Dividends tax is withheld by the company declaring the dividend on behalf of the shareholder receiving it. _In specie_ dividends are subject to tax in the hands of the company and not the beneficial owner.
Foreign dividends received by or accrued to an SA-resident taxpayer are included in income based on a formula and taxed at the normal CIT rate, which results in an effective tax rate of 20%. Qualifying foreign dividends are also generally not subject to tax where they are received by resident shareholders holding in excess of 10% of the equity shares and voting rights of the company declaring the dividend. Dividends received by residents holding less than 10% of such shares will generally be taxable in South Africa, subject to a tax credit for foreign taxes payable by the recipient shareholder.
### Stock dividends
Stock dividends (capitalisation issues of shares) are not subject to CIT or dividends tax.
## Interest income
Interest income of resident companies is taxed at the normal CIT rate.
Interest received by a non-resident company is only subject to CIT if the debt claim in respect of which it is paid is effectively connected with a PE of that non-resident company in South Africa during the tax year, and where that non-resident company is registered as a taxpayer in South Africa.
A 15% domestic withholding tax (WHT) applies to interest paid on certain debt instruments to non-resident companies and where the interest is not subject to CIT.
## Royalty income
Royalty income of resident companies is taxed at the normal CIT rate.
Royalty income received by a non-resident company is only subject to CIT if the property in respect of which the royalty income is paid is effectively connected with a PE of that non-resident company in South Africa during the tax year, and where that non-resident company is registered as a taxpayer in South Africa.
A 15% WHT applies to royalties paid to non-resident companies where the royalties are from a South African source and where the royalty is not subject to CIT.
## Foreign income
Foreign income of an SA-resident company is subject to tax in South Africa on the earlier of receipt or accrual. However, income that may not be remitted to South Africa in terms of the laws of the country where the amount arose is deferred until the income can be remitted. Double taxation may be avoided under certain DTAs or by way of unilateral credit or deduction for foreign tax payable on foreign income (_see Foreign tax credit in the section_).


# South Africa
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
A South African (SA)-resident company is subject to CIT on its worldwide income, irrespective of the source of the income. Non-residents are taxable on SA-source income.
For tax years ending before 31 March 2023, the CIT rate applicable to the corporate income of both resident and non-resident companies is a flat 28%. This rate is reduced to 27% with effect for years of assessment ending on or after 31 March 2023.
Small business corporations that meet the requirements (including only natural persons as members/owners and with gross income of not more than ZAR 20 million) are taxed at the following rates for tax years ending on any date between 1 April 2024 and 31 March 2025:
  * 0% on the first ZAR 95,750 of taxable income.
  * 7% on taxable income above ZAR 95,750 but not exceeding ZAR 365,000.
  * ZAR 18,848 + 21% on taxable income above ZAR 365,000 but not exceeding ZAR 550,000.
  * ZAR 57,698 + 27% on taxable income exceeding ZAR 550,000.


Special CIT rates apply in certain industries, such as gold mining and long-term insurance (_see below_).
## Alternative turnover-based tax for very small companies
To reduce the compliance costs for very small companies, a turnover-based presumptive tax is available. Companies with a turnover of less than ZAR 1 million per year can elect to pay this tax instead of normal CIT, at a rate ranging from 0% to 3%, depending on the level of turnover.
## Dividends tax
Dividends tax is imposed at 20% on dividends declared and paid by all resident companies as well as by non-resident companies in respect of shares listed on a South African exchange.
Dividends are tax exempt if the beneficial owner of the dividend is an SA-resident company, SA-retirement fund, or other prescribed exempt person.
The tax must be withheld by the company that pays the taxable dividend or, where the dividend is paid by a ‘regulated intermediary’, by the regulated intermediary (generally, this applies to listed shares). In the case of _in specie_ dividends (i.e. dividends paid 'in kind’ or dividends other than dividends paid in cash), the company declaring the _in specie_ dividend is liable for the dividends tax (and not the beneficial owner of the dividend).
Exemptions from dividends tax and treaty-imposed reduced rates only apply if the beneficial owner of the dividend has made a prescribed declaration and undertaking to the paying company or regulated intermediary.
## CIT for mining companies
Special rates of normal tax, based on a standard formula, are prescribed for companies mining for gold. Companies mining for other minerals are subject to the same rate of normal tax that applies to ordinary companies.
## CIT for long-term insurance companies
Life insurance companies are required to follow the ‘five-funds approach’, with policies divided into five funds, depending on the nature of the beneficiary. Each fund is then allocated assets according to the risk carried by the fund. Each of the five funds is treated as a separate taxpayer and taxed at the rate applicable to that type of fund. These rates are 30% for individual policyholder funds, 0% for untaxed policyholder funds, and the standard CIT rate for company policyholder funds, risk policy funds, and corporate funds (a corporate fund being the company itself).
## Local income taxes
No local government taxes on income apply to either SA-resident or non-resident companies.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is an indirect tax that is largely directed at the domestic consumption of goods and services in South Africa. The tax is designed to be paid mainly by the ultimate consumer or purchaser in South Africa. It is levied at two rates, namely a standard rate (currently 15%) and a zero rate (0%). 
Under the VAT system, vendors generally levy and account for VAT on taxable supplies made and are entitled to a deduction of the VAT incurred on expenses paid for purposes of making such taxable supplies. Only the ‘added value’ is therefore ultimately taxed.
Practically, VAT is a self-assessment tax, and vendors are required to submit periodic VAT returns. The two main tax periods are either monthly (generally for large vendors) and bi-monthly (which is the standard tax period issued by the SARS). 
The amount of input tax that the vendor is entitled to for the specific tax period is set off against the output tax due to the SARS, and the net amount is either due and payable to or refundable by the SARS. 
Very few business transactions carried out in South Africa are not subject to VAT. The tax is generally collected by businesses that are registered with the SARS as vendors on all taxable supplies throughout the production and distribution chain. Sales or supplies by non-vendors are not subject to VAT.
### VAT registration and administration
#### Compulsory registration 
All suppliers of goods and services having an annual turnover exceeding ZAR 1 million must register as a vendor and charge VAT on taxable supplies made in the course or furtherance of their enterprise. 
In addition, where a person expects that its taxable turnover will exceed ZAR 1 million in the next 12 months in terms of a written contractual agreement, such person is also required to register as a vendor and levy VAT on the taxable supplies made in the course or furtherance of their enterprise.
Non-resident suppliers of electronic services are required to register for VAT once the value of taxable supplies has exceeded ZAR 1 million in any consecutive 12-month period. 
#### Voluntary registration 
A person may elect to register as a VAT vendor if their annual taxable turnover exceeds ZAR 50,000.
Notwithstanding this, where the turnover does not exceed this amount, there are some specific rules to consider in order to register voluntarily, as follows: 
  * Where a person is carrying on an enterprise and the total value of taxable supplies made or to be made by that person has not yet exceeded ZAR 50,000 but can be reasonably expected to exceed this amount within 12 months from the date of registration, the person may register on a voluntary basis under certain circumstances. These circumstances are set out in the applicable regulations and mainly deal with when the SARS will accept that the afore-mentioned threshold will reasonably be expected to be exceeded. 


  * If a person is likely to make taxable supplies only after a period of time, the person may register if the activities are of a nature set out in the applicable regulations. These activities are also set out in the applicable regulations and include, for example, construction or mining type activities.


### Taxable supplies
Standard-rated and zero-rated supplies are known as taxable supplies. Other supplies are known as either exempt supplies or non-supplies (i.e. supplies that are not subject to VAT).
### Goods and services
‘Goods’ are corporeal movable things, fixed property, and real rights in such things and property. ‘Services’ are very broad and encompass not only traditional services like consulting or legal advice but includes the granting, assignment, cession, or surrender of any right or the making available of any facility or advantage.
### Electronic services
‘Electronic services’ are defined quite broadly and include any supply of services by means of an electronic agent, electronic communication, or the Internet for a consideration. Further changes to these regulations are expected in the near future.
A non-resident supplier of electronic services will be regarded as conducting an enterprise in South Africa if two of the following criteria are applicable: 
  * The recipient has a residential address in South Africa. 


  * The recipient has a business address in South Africa.


  * Payment is received from a South African bank account.


### Imports
Goods are subject to VAT on importation into South Africa. However, the VAT Act has a schedule setting out the specific goods that are exempt from VAT on importation.
Services imported by any person and used or consumed otherwise than for making taxable supplies is subject to VAT in South Africa. However, services imported wholly for taxable purposes is not subject to VAT in South Africa.
### Zero-rated supplies
The VAT Act sets out supplies of goods or services that may be taxed at the zero rate. As VAT is a destination-based tax, exported goods and services may be zero-rated. 
Special provision is also made to zero rate the following (amongst others):
  * Certain basic foodstuffs. 


  * Fuel products subject to the fuel levy.


  * Specified goods utilised for farming purposes.


  * The sale of an enterprise as a going concern, 


Under a zero-rated supply, a vendor charges VAT at 0% on the value of the supply and obtains a credit for the VAT paid on taxable supplies utilised in the making of the zero-rated supplies.
### Exempt supplies
The VAT Act sets out specific supplies of goods or services that are exempt from VAT. Examples of exempt supplies include financial services, residential rentals, non-international passenger transport by road or rail, and educational services. However, all fee-based financial services are subject to VAT at 15%. 
No VAT is deductible on expenses incurred for the purpose of making exempt supplies.
## Customs duties
Customs duties are charged on importation of goods into South Africa at rates ranging between 3% and 45%. In addition, import duties may also include anti-dumping and countervailing duties of up to 150%. No customs duties are charged on trade between South Africa and Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, and Swaziland, as these five countries constitute the Southern African Customs Union.
The Agreement establishing the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) came into effect on 1 January 2021 with the aim to boost intra-African trade. On 31 January 2024, South Africa launched the start of preferential trade under the Agreement, and the following countries are now eligible to trade with South Africa under the Agreement: Algeria, Cameroon, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, and Tunisia. For other African countries (excluding South African Development Community [SADC] countries, which trade under the SADC Trade Protocol), preferential trade under AfCFTA is only possible once the tariff schedules have been negotiated.
## Excise duties
Excise duty is levied on certain locally manufactured goods as well as their imported equivalents. A specific duty at a pre-determined amount is levied on tobacco and liquor products, and an _ad valorem_ duty (calculated as a percentage of price) on certain luxury goods and automobiles. Relief from excise duty is available for exported products and for certain products produced in the course of specified farming, forestry, and (limited) manufacturing activities.
## Property taxes
Local municipalities levy rates on land. These rates are based on a percentage of the municipal valuation of land and improvements and vary from municipality to municipality. Generally, a higher rate is levied on properties zoned for business use.
## Transfer duty
Transfer duty levied on the sale of immovable property is payable by the person acquiring the property within six months from the date of acquisition at the following rates:
Purchase price (ZAR) | Transfer duty rate  
---|---  
Not exceeding 1,100,000 | 0%  
1,100,001 to 1,512,500 | 3% on value above 1,100,000  
1,512,501 to 2,117,500 | 12,375 plus 6% on value above 1,512,500  
2,117,501 to 2,722,500 | 48,675 plus 8% on value above 2,117,500  
2,722,501 to 12,100,000 | 97,075 plus 11% on value above 2,722,500  
Exceeding 12,000,001 | 1,128,600 plus 13% on value above 12,100,000  
Transfers of immovable property subject to VAT are exempt from transfer duty.
## Securities transfer tax (STT)
STT is levied at a rate of 0.25% of the taxable amount in respect of the transfer of a security. The taxable amount is usually the consideration for which the security is purchased or the market value of the security if the consideration declared is less than the market value or if no consideration was paid. STT is payable by the company that issued the securities in question. However, the company can recover the tax from the person acquiring the shares. Slightly different rules apply in the case of listed securities.
## Payroll taxes
Employers are liable to withhold pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) on behalf of their employees. PAYE is payable to SARS on a monthly basis, calculated on the remuneration paid to an employee. The rates vary depending on the employee’s remuneration.
## Skills Development Levy (SDL)
SDL is a compulsory levy to fund education and training. It is payable by an employer and cannot be deducted from the remuneration payable to an employee. Small employers with an annual payroll of less than ZAR 500,000 are exempt from the levy. SDL is levied at the rate of 1% of payroll. It is payable monthly, together with income tax that the employer has withheld on its employees’ salaries.

A full or partial refund of the diesel general fuel levy may be claimed in certain industries, such as agriculture, fishing, mining and, temporarily, for manufacturers of foodstuffs.
## Electricity levy

## Carbon tax
With effect from 1 June 2019, carbon tax is levied on entities that conduct activities in South Africa and that have 'scope 1' greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions exceeding a certain threshold. Generally, the threshold is thermal capacity of 10MW, but the exact threshold is determined with reference to the activity conducted by the entity.
The tax is levied in respect of the sum of the GHG emissions of a taxpayer in respect of a tax period (i.e. every calendar year, with the exception of the first tax period, which commenced on 1 June 2019 and ended on 31 December 2019).
Generally, scope 1 GHG emissions comprise direct emissions, being emissions from owned or controlled sources (as opposed to scope 2 or 3 GHG emissions, which are indirect emissions).
Carbon tax returns are required to be submitted (and any carbon tax due must be paid) in July of the year following the relevant tax period.
The first phase of carbon tax has been extended by three years for the period 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2025. The transitional support measures afforded to companies in the first phase (e.g. tax-free allowances and revenue-recycling measures) will continue over this period. 
The tax rate for carbon tax for 2024 is ZAR 190 per ton of CO2-equivalent emissions. The rate trajectory increases steeply from 1 January 2025 onwards (i.e. 2025 - ZAR 236, 2026 - ZAR 308, 2027 - ZAR 347, 2028 - ZAR 385, 2029 - ZAR 424, and 2030 - ZAR 462).
Tax-free allowances are currently available to reduce the carbon tax liability to a maximum of 95% of taxable emissions. Taking into account the allowances, the effective tax rate is currently much lower and ranges between 5% and 40% of the statutory rate. Allowances will likely decrease over time.
