## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
The following are some of the more recent significant developments that were introduced in Maltese tax law:
  * Maltese tax law provides for a tax deduction for expenditure of a capital nature on intellectual property (IP) or IP rights incurred in the production of income. Such deduction should be taken over the life of the relevant IP but, in any case, over a minimum period of three consecutive years. As of the financial year 2023, such expenditure of a capital nature on IP/ IP rights may, at the option of the taxpayer, be deducted in full in the year in which the expenditure is incurred or in the year in which the IP/ IP rights are first used or employed in producing the income.
  * Transfer Pricing Rules were published in November 2022 and apply for basis years commencing on or after 1 January 2024. _Further information on the Transfer Pricing Rules is set out_ _under_ _Transfer_ _pricing in the_ _section_.
  * In terms of the European Minimum Tax Directive, Malta applied the derogation provided by the European Union (EU), and the application of the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) and the Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR) is deferred by up to six years. The said Directive was transposed into Maltese law by means of the EU Global Minimum Level of Taxation for Multinational Enterprise Groups and Large-Scale Domestic Groups Regulations, 2024, published in February 2024.
  * The possibility of setting up protected/segregated cell companies in the aviation and shipping sectors remains an option under Maltese law. Such cell companies allow for the possibility of segregating vessels or aircraft portfolios within the same corporate entity, thus segregating the risks and benefits attributable to the particular cell, without affecting the risks and benefits attributable to other cells within the same cell company.
  * By means of the Consolidated Group Income Tax Rules, a parent company and its 95% subsidiary can form a fiscal unit for income tax consolidation, provided certain conditions are satisfied.
  * The Patent Box Regime Deduction Rules provide for deductibility rules applicable to income derived from qualifying IP.
  * Further tax incentives for occupational pension schemes are available.
  * The minimum shareholding requirement of a ‘participating holding’ under the Maltese Income Tax Act is 5%. This enables Maltese companies holding at least 5% of the equity shares to claim a participation exemption (subject to the satisfaction of other conditions) on dividend income and gains derived by a Maltese company from a qualifying ‘participating holding’ or from the disposal of such holding (apart from this 5% minimum equity holding, there may be other alternative conditions to qualify for the participation exemption). 
  * A notional interest deduction (NID) system, aiming to approximate the tax treatment of equity with that of debt.
  * By virtue of a number of schemes, such as the Start-up Finance (2024) Regulations and a number of research and development (R&D) schemes, undertakings operating in various industries may qualify for assistance by the Malta Enterprise.
  * Recent value-added tax (VAT) regulations require payment service providers to keep records of payments made and to submit such information to the VAT Commissioner in accordance with the provisions of Council Directive (EU) 2020/284 of 18 February 2020 amending Directive 2006/112/EC.
  * The Convention between the Republic of Malta and the Kingdom of the Netherlands, in respect of Curaçao for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income came into force on 1 September 2024.
  * With effect from 1 January 2025, the special scheme for VAT purposes applicable to Small Undertakings was amended to take into account various EU-wide changes (such as widening this scheme so as to include certain cross border transactions).

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Taxable period
The year of assessment is a calendar year, but a company may obtain authorisation from the Maltese Commissioner for Tax and Customs to have a different year-end (i.e. other than 31 December).
## Tax returns
An income tax return for income earned during the previous year must be filed for every year of assessment. The tax return for a company must be submitted by the later of nine months following the end of the financial year or by 31 March following the year of assessment (however, in recent years, the Commissioner for Tax and Customs has provided concessionary extensions to such statutory deadlines in the case where the tax return is submitted electronically). Penalties are incurred on late filing of returns. The tax return submitted by the company is a self-assessment, and the Commissioner for Tax and Customs will not raise an assessment unless the Commissioner is not in agreement with the self-assessment.
## Payment of tax
Companies are charged tax in the currency in which their share capital is denominated.
During the basis tax year, a company is generally required to make provisional tax (PT) payments every four months. In general, the PT payments are based on the last self-assessment filed by the company, and payments are divided into three instalments of 20%, 30%, and 50%, respectively. Any tax liability that is still due at the tax return date after deducting all tax credits must be settled immediately with the submission of the return. Following a recent legislative change, interest at 0.6% per month (or part thereof) is charged on any unpaid tax that is payable on or after 31 August 2022 (immediately before such date, interest was at 0.33%). 
In certain instances, especially for companies with a high percentage of business interests outside Malta, PT may not be payable, and the tax payment is normally paid on the earlier of the date profits are distributed or 18 months after the end of the relevant accounting period.
## Tax audit process
The Maltese Commissioner for Tax and Customs is entitled to raise an investigation and notify the taxpayer in writing that the department is initiating a tax enquiry. In such investigations, the taxpayer will typically be required to provide information and supporting documentation in respect of queries raised by the Revenue. The taxpayer has a right to appoint a representative on their behalf.
## Statute of limitations
An assessment may be issued by the Maltese Commissioner for Tax and Customs no later than five years from the end of the year in which the tax return is filed. In the event of non-full disclosure or wilful incorrect/misleading information, the aforesaid prescription period will not apply.
In respect of the payment of tax, additional tax, interest, or any penalty, an action may be taken during any time from the date on which it becomes due and payable up to eight years from that date or, where an assessment in respect thereof has been made, from the date on which that assessment becomes final and conclusive.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The Maltese Commissioner for Tax and Customs follows international tax developments closely and is also involved in discussions and representations on such matters in various fora.


# Malta
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
All companies incorporated in Malta are considered to be both domiciled and resident in Malta. Other bodies of persons (including companies incorporated overseas) are considered to be resident in Malta when the control and management of their business are exercised in the country.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Although Maltese tax legislation contains a number of references to the term ‘permanent establishment’, the term is not defined by Maltese legislation. Indeed, in terms of Maltese domestic tax law, a non-resident is, in principle, subject to Maltese tax on income arising in Malta, irrespective of the existence or otherwise of a PE in Malta (subject to any double tax treaty [DTT] provisions that would apply if in conflict with Maltese tax law).
In the event that the Maltese Commissioner for Tax and Customs is required to interpret such a term, reference would typically be made to the definition contained in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Convention.


# Malta
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
The basic condition for deductibility of expenses is that deductions are allowable only with respect to expenditures that are wholly and exclusively incurred in the production of income.
In order to be in a position to claim a tax deduction, a valid tax invoice/other equivalent document sustaining the expense may have to be provided if requested by the Maltese Commissioner for Tax and Customs.
Apart from the general tax deductibility rule stated above, the Maltese Income Tax Act also provides a number of exceptions whereby specific expenses of a capital nature may also be tax deductible, subject to the satisfaction of the statutory conditions applicable thereto. The following are some further comments on specific items of expenditure.
## Depreciation and depletion
Tax depreciation is computed on the straight-line method. The rate of depreciation on plant and machinery varies according to the category of the plant and machinery in question.
Maltese tax law prescribes the minimum number of years over which items of plant and machinery are to be depreciated as follows:
Category | Years  
---|---  
Computers and electronic equipment | 4  
Computer software | 4  
Motor vehicles | 5  
Furniture, fixtures, fittings, and soft furnishings | 10  
Equipment used for constructions of buildings and excavation | 6  
Catering equipment | 6  
Aircraft - aircraft airframe | 4  
Aircraft - engines | 4  
Aircraft - engine or airframe overhaul | 4  
Aircraft - interiors and other parts | 4  
Ships and vessels | 10  
Electrical and plumbing installations and sanitary fittings | 15  
Cable infrastructure | 20  
Pipeline infrastructure | 20  
Communications and broadcasting equipment | 6  
Medical equipment | 6  
Lifts and escalators | 10  
Air conditioners | 6  
Equipment mainly designed or used for the production of water or electricity | 6  
Other machinery | 5  
Other plant | 10  
The wear and tear rate on industrial buildings and structures (including hotels, car parks, and offices) may not exceed 2% _per annum_. New acquisitions of industrial buildings and structures are entitled to a concurrent extra 10% allowance in the year of acquisition. Tax depreciation is not required to conform to book depreciation.
The total allowances over the asset’s useful life may not exceed 100% of its cost. If a surplus arises on disposal of a tax-depreciated asset, it is either added to the year’s income or utilised to reduce the cost of any replacement. If the asset has been under-depreciated, a balancing allowance is granted.
No deduction is available for the depletion of natural resources.
The rules on tax deductions for wear and tear of plant and machinery provide for certain specific treatment in particular situations, including, among other things, the following:
  * To establish the cost of an asset when it is transferred between related companies, the lower of the actual cost of the asset or the tax written-down value adjusted by any balancing charge or allowance incurred by the transferring company should be applied.
  * Deductions for wear and tear are allowed only where proper records and documentation have been kept that support the cost of the respective assets.
  * A proportional deduction is allowed where an asset is used partly in the production of income and partly for other purposes.


## Intellectual property (IP)
Maltese tax law provides for a tax deduction for expenditure of a capital nature on IP or any IP rights incurred in the production of income. Such expenditure should be tax deductible over the life of the relevant IP but, in any case, over a minimum period of three consecutive years. As of the financial year 2023, such expenditure of a capital nature on IP/ IP rights may, at the option of the taxpayer, be deducted in full in the year in which the expenditure is incurred or in the year in which the IP/ IP rights are first used or employed in producing the income. Subject to certain conditions, a proportion of the excess may be carried forward for deduction against qualifying income in future years.
Malta also has in place a Patent Box Regime. These Rules provide for a deduction in relation to qualifying income derived from 'qualifying IP' on or after 1 January 2019. The Rules have been drafted in a manner so as to be compliant with the OECD modified nexus approach and the EU Code of Conduct on Business Taxation.
'Qualifying IP' includes patents and utility models, software, and IP assets relating to medical products. In order for a significant proportion of IP income to qualify for benefits, a significant proportion of the actual R&D activities must have been undertaken by the qualifying taxpayer itself. The beneficiaries in such circumstances would be the owners of the qualifying IP or the holder of an exclusive licence in respect of the qualifying IP. The Patent Box Regime deduction is calculated based on a formula and subject to satisfying a number of conditions.
## Goodwill
In the event that goodwill were to fall within the purport of IP for the purposes of the tax deductibility rules under Maltese tax law, then it may possibly be argued that an expenditure on goodwill may be tax deductible. However, this would need to be analysed on a case-by-case basis.
## Start-up expenses
Certain pre-trading expenses (i.e. staff training, advertising, salaries/wages) are also allowed as a deduction, subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions:
  1. The expenditure is incurred not more than 18 months before the commencement of the trade or business.
  2. The expenditure is not deductible in ascertaining the trading or business income of the person carrying on such trade or business but would have been so deductible under (i) above had it been incurred after that time.


In the event that the above conditions are satisfied, such expenditure is treated as incurred on the day on which the trade or business is first carried on by the person.
## Interest expenses
Interest on any borrowed money is an allowable deduction if it is paid on capital employed in acquiring income. The expense is allowable even though the borrowing would have been made for a capital purpose. This special rule is in addition to the deduction for interest paid on money due on revenue account (such interest should be deductible under the general rule of deductibility), such as interest on trade debts or charged on normal business overdraft facilities. There is a restriction in respect of interest deductibility where the relevant advance is in connection with the financing of Maltese immovable property and subject to certain other conditions. 
As of 1 January 2019, interest limitation rules were introduced that reflect the provisions set out under the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD). These rules set a cap on the amount of interest tax deductions that may be availed of. The limit applies with respect to borrowing costs that exceed interest income. This is capped at 30% of tax-adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA). It should be noted that no capping applies where exceeding borrowing costs fall below EUR 3 million. Maltese application of the directive provides for a grandfathering clause, meaning that loans that were concluded before 17 June 2016 fall out of the scope of the directive.
Where a taxpayer forms part of a group, the taxpayer may, subject to certain conditions, fully deduct exceeding borrowing costs if it can demonstrate that the ratio of its equity to its assets is equal to or higher than that of the group of which it forms part. 
There are also derogations to the interest limitation rule, such as standalone entities (i.e. companies that are not part of a group for financial accounting purposes, that are not associated enterprises or PE’s), certain types of financial companies, such as credit institutions, and long-term infrastructure projects.
If borrowing costs are exceeded during one year and cannot be fully deducted, they may be carried forward without limitation. If, on the other hand, the allowed interest capacity is not fully used, this can be carried forward for a period of five years.
## Bad debt
Bad debts incurred in any trade, business, profession, or vocation are allowed in the year they become bad if proved to the satisfaction of the tax authorities. No deduction is given for provisions for bad debts and for bad debts incurred in activities other than a trade, business, profession, or vocation. Any bad debt that is later recovered is deemed as income for the year in which it is received.
## Charitable contributions
The general rule is that charitable contributions are not deductible for Maltese tax purposes unless expressly provided for by law.
## Fines and penalties
The general rule is that fines and penalties are not deductible for Maltese tax purposes.
## Taxes
Technically, taxes suffered should not be deductible for Maltese tax purposes. However, the typical interpretation of the Maltese Commissioner for Tax and Customs is that as long as no relief of double taxation is claimed for the tax, then such tax should be available as a tax deduction.
## Other significant items
  * The Income Tax (Deductions) Rules of 2001 provide for specific conditions on deductions with respect to the use of cars and the payment of employee compensation. The cost on which capital allowances on certain motor vehicles may be claimed is restricted to EUR 14,000. Deductions for lease payments on cars are restricted in a manner that corresponds with the stated restriction of EUR 14,000 that applies to capital allowances on owned cars. With respect to payment of employee compensation, the Deduction Rules require that in order for employee compensation to be allowed as a deduction for tax purposes in the hands of the employing company, it must have been duly accounted for. In particular, the employee compensation must have been reported on the appropriate forms and within the statutory time limit to the Maltese Commissioner for Tax and Customs. The rules also provide for restrictions on deductibility of emoluments with respect to the payment of certain fringe benefits to employees.
  * A tax deduction in respect of transportation costs of employees to and from the place of work using means of transport capable of carrying more than eight persons has been introduced. Under the applicable rules, undertakings may claim a deduction against its income equivalent to 150% of the employee transportation costs incurred in the relative year, subject to certain conditions being satisfied.
  * As of 1 January 2024, any cash donations made by companies to voluntary organisations that are enrolled with the Commissioner for Voluntary Organisations and operate directly in the field of social, environmental, or animal welfare may claim a tax credit against such a donation. The credit is capped at 35% of total donations made by the company or EUR 500, whichever is lower.


  * Further to the EU initiative in order to align the EU member states to the OECD’s action plan on base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS), as of 1 January 2020, anti-hybrid legislation (with the exception of reverse-hybrid mismatches) was implemented into local legislation. Such anti-hybrid legislation aims to neutralise hybrid mismatches (e.g. hybrid financial instruments, hybrid entities, PE mismatches, dual residency mismatches) that arise as a result of a different tax treatment in two or more jurisdictions (both EU member states and third countries) and give rise to the following: 
    1. Double deduction (DD), which refers to a deduction of the same payment, expenses, or losses in the jurisdiction in which the payment has its source, the expenses are incurred, or the losses are suffered (payer jurisdiction) and in another jurisdiction (investor jurisdiction). Anti-hybrid legislation aims to neutralise the mismatch primarily by denying the deduction in the investor jurisdiction or, if the deduction is not denied in the investor jurisdiction, such deduction shall be denied in the payer jurisdiction. However, any such deduction shall be eligible to be set-off against dual inclusion income whether arising in a current or a subsequent tax period (i.e. income that is included under the laws of both jurisdictions where the mismatch outcome has arisen).
    2. Deduction without inclusion (D/NI), which refers to a deduction of a payment (or deemed payment between the head office and PE or between two or more PEs) in any jurisdiction in which that payment (or deemed payment) is treated as made (payer jurisdiction) without a corresponding inclusion for tax purposes of that payment (or deemed payment) in the payee jurisdiction. A measure to neutralise the hybrid mismatch is that such deduction shall be denied in the payer jurisdiction. On the other hand, if the deduction is not denied in the payer jurisdiction, the amount of the payment that would otherwise give rise to a mismatch outcome shall be included as taxable income in the payee jurisdiction.
  * Apart from the above, other amendments (reverse-hybrid mismatches) stipulate that as of 1 January 2022 non-resident entities holding in aggregate a direct or indirect interest in 50% or more of the voting rights, capital interest, or right to share profits in a hybrid entity shall be deemed to be residents of Malta.


  * The EU Tax Dispute Resolution Mechanism Directive Implementation Regulations lay down the rules on how to resolve disputes between the interpretation and application of agreements and conventions that provide for the elimination of double taxation of income between Malta and other member states.


## Net operating losses
Net operating losses may be carried forward indefinitely until absorbed. There is no carryback of losses, even in terminal years. Unabsorbed capital allowances may be carried forward only against the same underlying source of income. Where the source ceases to exist, any remaining balance of unabsorbed capital allowances is lost.
Certain rules apply in relation to the discretion of the Commissioner for Tax and Customs to allow tax losses/capital allowances to be taken over by the surviving company following a merger/division.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
There are no restrictions on the deductibility of royalties and interest (except for interest, discount, or premium that are in any manner connected to Maltese immovable property and subject to the satisfaction of certain other statutory conditions, in which case, the interest/discount/premium should not be tax deductible in Malta). As of 1 January 2019, one also needs to consider the ATAD provisions on interest deductibility and service fees paid to foreign affiliates as long as the particular expenses are considered to be incurred in the production of the particular income and satisfy the applicable statutory conditions. Interest, discount, premium, or royalties derived by non-residents are exempt from Maltese tax, subject to the applicable statutory requirements.
## Notional interest deduction (NID)
The NID is calculated by multiplying the deemed notional interest rate by the balance of risk capital that the undertaking has at year-end. The undertaking shall be entitled to a deduction for sums that are deemed to be payable by way of interest on risk capital or such part thereof as may be determined by the undertaking for the particular year. The notional interest rate is the risk-free rate set on Malta Government Stocks with a remaining term of approximately 20 years plus a premium of 5%. The risk capital of the undertaking includes mainly share capital, share premium, reserves, and interest-free loans as at year-end. The NID may also be claimed by a Maltese PE of a non-Maltese resident undertaking. In that case, the risk capital is taken to be the capital attributable to the PE.
The maximum deduction in any given year cannot exceed 90% of chargeable income, and any excess can then be carried forward to the following year. Certain anti-avoidance rules apply to prevent abuses of the NID.


# Malta
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
Two companies that for tax purposes are resident exclusively in Malta, where one company is a 50% plus subsidiary of the other or both are 50% plus subsidiaries of a third Malta-resident company, qualify as members of a group of companies. Allowable losses may be surrendered by a company to another company within the group where both companies have concurrent accounting periods and form part of such group throughout the entire basis year for which this relief is claimed.
## Consolidated Group (Income Tax) Rules
In relation to accounting periods commencing in calendar year 2019 and subsequent years, there is the possibility of income tax consolidation in Malta.
Consequently, companies forming part of a group of companies (as defined) may elect to be treated as one single taxpayer (subject to the satisfaction of certain statutory conditions). This would be achieved by allowing a parent company to elect that its subsidiary/ies and itself will form a fiscal unit, resulting in the subsidiary/ies being treated as transparent.
As a result, upon successful registration, the parent company would be considered the ‘principal taxpayer’ of the fiscal unit, and the chargeable income of the members of the fiscal unit would be taxable solely in the hands of such principal taxpayer. Furthermore, transactions taking place between persons forming part of the fiscal unit (excluding transfers of immovable property situated in Malta subject to a final tax) are disregarded and fall outside the scope of Maltese income tax legislation.
The primary conditions to be satisfied for a successful registration are that:
  * the parent company holds at least a 95% shareholding in the subsidiary, and
  * the accounting period of the members of the fiscal unit starts and ends on the same date.


The Legal Notice also establishes other requirements that will need to be satisfied to establish a fiscal unit.
## Transfer pricing
On 18 November 2022, Transfer Pricing rules (“the Rules”) were introduced in Malta. 
The Rules apply to basis years commencing on or after 1 January 2024, with respect to arrangements entered into on or after 1 January 2024, and any arrangements entered into prior to 1 January 2024 that are materially altered on or after that date. 
As from 01 January 2027, the Rules will also apply to any arrangements entered into before 01 January 2024 and which were not materially altered after 01 January 2024. 
Micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are excluded from the scope of the Rules (i.e. those entities fulfilling the criteria laid down in Annex I of Commission Regulation (EU) No 651/2014). 
The Rules apply to cross-border arrangements entered into between associated enterprises. Any transactions between Maltese-resident entities are excluded from the scope of the Rules. Securitisation transactions are also excluded from the scope of the Rules. The Rules will also not apply where the aggregate arm’s length value of all items of income and expenditure of:
  * A revenue nature forming part of cross-border arrangements does not exceed €6m; and
  * A capital nature forming part of cross-border arrangements does not exceed €20m;


in the year preceding the year of assessment.
Bodies of persons that should be considered as associated enterprises for the purposes of the Rules include enterprises over which there is direct or indirect control through a holding of more than 75% of the voting rights or ordinary share capital, or alternatively, by virtue of any powers conferred by the articles of association or other document regulating the controlled body of persons. Bodies of persons subject to common control by virtue of the 75% threshold will also fall within the scope of the Rules.
Where bodies of persons are constituent entities of a multinational enterprise group, and thus subject to country-by-country reporting obligations, the percentage interest in the voting rights or the ordinary share capital will be of 50% (rather than 75%).
For the purpose of the Rules, cross-border arrangements should include the following arrangements:
-An arrangement between a Maltese-resident company and a non-Maltese-resident party;
-An arrangement between a Maltese-resident company and a permanent establishment situated outside Malta to which the arrangement is effectively connected; and 
-An arrangement between a company that maintains a permanent establishment in Malta to which the arrangement is effectively connected, or otherwise derives income or gains arising in Malta, and a non-Maltese resident party.
In terms of the Guidelines in relation to the Transfer Pricing Rules, issued by the Maltese Tax and Customs Administration (MTCA), the methodologies set out in Chapter II of the OECD TP Guidelines are the preferred methodologies to determine the arm’s length price. Other methods may also be accepted in accordance with the OECD TP Guidelines.
Furthermore, the documentation that is required to be held by entities which fall within scope of such Rules, shall be in line with Chapter V of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines (i.e. Master File and Local File). 
The Rules also set out a framework for the request and issuance of unilateral transfer pricing rulings and advance pricing agreements.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
The CbC reporting requirement applies to MNE groups, being any group that includes two or more enterprises (including any PEs) the tax residence of which falls in two different jurisdictions, in respect of fiscal years starting on or after 1 January 2016. The Regulations apply for MNE groups having a total consolidated group revenue of at least EUR 750 million (or an equivalent amount in local currency) during the fiscal year immediately preceding the reporting year.
## Public country-by-country reporting (Public CbCR)
The EU’s Public CbCR Directive was transposed into Maltese legislation on 17 May 2024. The Public CbCR will take effect in Malta for accounting periods beginning on or after 22 June 2024. 
MNE groups based in the EU/EEA and non-EU based MNEs doing business in the EU/EEA through a branch or subsidiary with a consolidated annual revenue of at least EUR 750 million for two consecutive years fall within the scope of the Directive.
## Thin capitalisation
The Maltese tax regime does not contain thin capitalisation rules. However, reference should be made to the interest limitation rules set out _under Interest expenses in the section_.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
As a result of the transposition of the ATAD into Maltese legislation, Malta introduced the concept of CFC legislation into Maltese tax law and such legislation became effective as of 1 January 2019. 
A CFC is defined in the Regulations as:
  1. an entity in which a Maltese resident taxpayer, alone or together with its associated enterprises, holds a direct or indirect participation of more than 50% of the voting rights, or owns directly or indirectly more than 50% of the capital or is entitled to receive more than 50% of the profits of that entity, and
  2. the actual corporate tax paid by the entity is lower than the difference between the tax that would have been charged on the entity under the Income Tax Acts and the actual foreign corporate tax paid.


A CFC also includes the PE situated outside Malta of a Maltese resident taxpayer where the condition set out in paragraph (ii) applies.
Where an entity/PE is considered to be a CFC, the Regulations require the non-distributed income of the CFC arising from non-genuine arrangements that have been put in place for the essential purpose of obtaining a tax advantage to be included in the tax base of the Maltese resident entity.
The Regulations (in line with the ATAD) provide that an arrangement or a series thereof are to be regarded as non-genuine to the extent that the entity or PE would not own the assets or would not have undertaken the risks that generate all, or part of, its income if it were not controlled by a company where the significant people functions, which are relevant to those assets and risks, are carried out in Malta and are instrumental in generating the controlled company's income.
The Regulations also provide for the manner and amount of CFC profit to be included in the tax base of the Malta resident entity.
CFCs whose profits fall within certain minimum thresholds are excluded from the application of this regulation.


# Malta
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
The tax rate on branch income for branches set up in Malta is the same as that for Maltese resident companies. Other than the tax charged on a branch's income, no tax is withheld on transfers of profits to the head office.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Foreign tax credit
A credit for foreign taxes may be applied against the Maltese tax charge (_see Foreign income in the section for more information_).
## Inbound investment
Investments by foreigners may be readily repatriated together with profits.
As of 1 January 2020, one would need to take into consideration the new provisions for exit taxation under Maltese tax law introduced in line with the adoption of the ATAD provisions.
In terms of these exit tax provisions, with effect from 1 January 2020, a taxpayer may be subject to tax on capital gains where assets are owned by the taxpayer and are transferred outside the Maltese income tax net in the following circumstances:
  * the assets are transferred from the head office in Malta to its PE outside Malta, in so far as Malta no longer has the right to tax capital gains from the transfer of such assets due to the transfer
  * the assets/business of a non-resident are transferred from its PE to the head office/another PE outside Malta in so far as Malta no longer has the right to tax capital gains from the transfer of such assets due to the transfer, or
  * transfer of tax residence from Malta to a place outside Malta except for those assets that remain effectively connected with a PE in Malta.


In the circumstances outlined above, the taxpayer is deemed to have transferred those assets and may be considered to have derived a capital gain. The capital gain is calculated by reference to an amount equal to the market value of the transferred assets, at the time of exit of the assets, less their base cost for tax purposes.
The income tax that may become chargeable on the deemed transfer becomes payable by not later than the taxpayer’s subsequent tax return date. This said, the payment may, in certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions, be deferred by paying it in instalments over five years.
## Incentives for inbound investment
The Malta Enterprise Act and other related legislation provide a comprehensive package of incentives for inbound investment. These incentives are reserved for enterprises carrying on certain activities in Malta, mainly manufacturing activities. The focus is on high-value-added activities, and pre-approval of a project’s eligibility for benefits by Malta Enterprise may be required. In general, eligibility does not depend on whether the company produces for the local or export markets. The main tax incentives include the following:
  * Enterprises carrying out qualifying activities, which include such activities as manufacturing activities, pharmaceuticals, R&D activities, industrial services, computer programming, audio-visual productions, certain educational activities, and certain hospitality activities, may qualify for aid in terms of the Invest - Support for Initial Investment Projects scheme. The scheme was launched by Malta Enterprise in January 2024. Eligible undertakings may be awarded aid in the form of investment aid tax credits, cash grants, subsidies on interest rates on loans, and/or bank guarantees. Such guidelines form the basis of the investment aid scheme that is in force until 31 December 2026. The aid is calculated as a percentage of qualifying expenditure incurred in relation to a qualifying initial investment project, and the aid intensities vary from 10% to 35%, depending on the size of the undertaking and as well on whether the project is to be carried out in an assisted area or otherwise. The application in relation to such investment projects should reach Malta Enterprise by 30 September 2026 and should cover eligible investment projects commencing on or after 1 January 2024 and by 31 December 2026.
  * Certain tax credits and special incentives may be available, subject to certain conditions. These tax credits are calculated on the basis of specific expenditures incurred by a company, while the special incentives grant tax exemptions on all or part of the chargeable income in specified circumstances.
  * No further tax is charged on distributions from profits that had previously been taxed at a reduced rate. This benefit is also extended to amounts that were not subject to tax on account of investment tax credits and specific tax credits/special incentives.


The combination of certain tax treaties and Maltese domestic law lowers the Maltese tax rate on certain companies receiving certain industrial assistance (i.e. mainly assistance in terms of the Malta Enterprise Act, Business Promotion Act, and Business Promotion Regulations) to 15%.
A number of other schemes administered by Malta Enterprise (e.g. Business Development Scheme, Smart and Sustainable Investment Grant Scheme, Start-Up Finance Scheme, Green Mobility Scheme etc) cater to undertakings operating in a number of industries and may provide tax benefits to the eligible undertakings.
In addition, the Seed Investment Scheme (Income Tax) Rules offer tax relief to start-ups with the aim of encouraging access to finance to SMEs. In terms of these rules, ‘qualifying investors’ should be entitled to a tax credit amounting to 35% of the aggregate value of their investment in qualifying companies (total tax credit not exceeding EUR 250,000 _per annum_). Such tax credit would be set off against the tax due by the qualifying investor in respect of any income or gains brought to charge to tax in the year of assessment following the basis year when the investments are made. The tax credit may be carried forward until it is fully absorbed. In addition, qualifying investors may be entitled to an exemption from tax in respect of any gains or profits derived from the disposal of their qualifying investments, where such investments are disposed of after the lapse of three years from the date of subscription to the equity shares.
As part of Malta’s new Operational Programme, the Malta government has launched a number of new grant schemes to support SMEs in undertaking investments and enhance their competitiveness. The schemes that are currently available address various types of investments, in particular by SMEs, being digitalisation projects, capital investments, and start-ups. The schemes are administered through an open rolling call with, generally, monthly cut-off dates. The last call closes on 28 February 2025.
Malta Enterprise, throughout the past few years, launched various schemes and incentives, including:
  * The Business Start 2021 scheme, where start-up undertakings in their early stage of development may apply for a grant of up to EUR 10,000 for the development of their business proposal. Applications in relation to such scheme are accepted until 30 October 2026.
  * The Innovate - Innovation Aid for SME scheme aims to facilitate the creation of a business research partnership between SMEs and research knowledge dissemination organisations to carry out projects leading to product, process, and organisational innovation through financial assistance calculated at 50% of the eligible costs capped at EUR 250,000.
  * The Exploring Research Grant aims to provide aid to certain undertakings that require to carry out a feasibility study in preparation of industrial research and experimental development activities. The aid takes the form of a cash grant based on the size of the undertaking, but which in any case is capped at €100,000
  * The Skills Development scheme aims to provide support to businesses providing training with the scope of developing and updating their workforce’s skills and knowledge. The aid is based on the size of the undertaking, and is capped at €2 million per skills development project 
  * The Family Business Grant Scheme supports family businesses in succession planning to ensure a smooth transition and retain their status. It provides part financing for advisory and mediation services
  * The Accelerate 2024 Scheme supports businesses in their first seven years by financing participation in a Malta Enterprise-recognized Accelerator Programme. It targets ventures with growth potential and viable business concepts based on technical and scientific know-how. The application deadline is 31 October 2030.


### Start in Malta
In 2022, the Start in Malta initiative was launched, which is aimed at significantly boosting the Maltese start-up ecosystem. Start in Malta is a one-stop shop that offers assistance services so that more start-ups may establish themselves in Malta, together with assistance for start-ups to apply for the schemes offered by Malta Enterprise, some of which have been detailed above. _More information may be accessed at_.
### Start-Up Residence Permit
As part of the Start in Malta initiative, the Malta Start-up Residence Programme grants a three-year residence permit (which may be extended for an additional five years), which entitles non-EU nationals to reside in Malta while launching a start-up venture. Enterprises qualifying for this programme need to have been registered for not more than seven years, and a tangible investment of EUR 25,000, which increases to EUR 35,000 in case the enterprise involves more than four founders, is required to be made.
## International business profits
Other Maltese tax considerations that may be relevant in an international business context include the following:
  * Maltese tax law provides for a beneficial tax treatment in respect of securitisation vehicles and similarly to re-insurance special purpose vehicles.
  * Possibility to set up cell entities in Malta, _inter alia_ , for insurance business, collective investment schemes, securitisation vehicles.
  * The possibility of setting up protected/segregated cell companies in the aviation and shipping sectors has been introduced in Maltese law. Consequently, Maltese company law now provides for the formation, constitution, authorisation, and regulation of cell companies carrying on or engaged in aviation or shipping business. Such cell companies allow for the possibility of segregating vessels or aircraft portfolios within the same corporate entity, thus segregating the risks and benefits attributable to the particular cell, without affecting the risks and benefits attributable to other cells within the same cell company. This should grant additional flexibility for the Maltese aviation and maritime sector, especially in respect of the variety in the types of entities that may be used in carrying on the particular activities and relative to the granting and receipt of financing involving ships and aircraft.
  * A beneficial tax regime is available in respect of collective investment schemes.
  * The Maltese fiscal implications relative to trusts and private foundations vary, depending on a number of circumstances, including: (i) the particulars of the parties involved (e.g. domicile or residence of the trustees/administrator or beneficiaries), (ii) the act or event under review (e.g. the settlement of property, transfers of beneficial interests, distributions of trust/foundation assets), and (iii) the nature of the trust/foundation assets. Furthermore, in certain circumstances, tax transparency provisions are set out in the law, particularly so as to allow, among other things, the application of tax exemptions that would have applied to beneficiaries if there was no trust relationship or foundation.
  * An option exists for a step-up in the cost of acquisition of assets situated outside Malta (including companies) effecting a change in domicile or residence or becoming Maltese companies as a result of cross-border mergers.


## Other tax credits
A tax credit for micro enterprises is provided under the Micro Invest Scheme. The credit amounts to 45% (or 65% for undertakings operating in Gozo) of eligible capital expenditure and/or wage costs incurred, which tax credit would then be utilised against the tax incurred on income derived from the qualifying trade or business activity for that financial year, subject to certain maximum limits applied over three consecutive fiscal years.
The applicant undertaking cannot employ more than 50 full-time employees, and the maximum eligible tax credits per single undertaking is EUR 50,000 over any period of three consecutive fiscal years. This maximum credit is further increased to EUR 70,000 in respect of undertakings operating in Gozo, family businesses, and female-owned undertakings. Certain cappings on the total amount of _de minimis_ aid granted to a single undertaking apply.
The Research and Development (2024) Regulations provide a basis to assist undertakings that carry out R&D projects (as defined) intending to develop or improve services, products, or processes through experimental development and/or industrial research. This measure also encourages cooperation between undertakings by providing additional assistance for collaborative R&D projects. The aid consists of a tax credit or cash grant calculated at a rate of up to 80% of eligible costs, depending on the size of the undertaking and the type of R&D undertaken. Applications under this scheme will be accepted by Malta Enterprise until 31 December 2026.

Notes
Treaties relating to international air and shipping traffic are in force with Switzerland and the United States (US).
The numbers in parentheses refer to the following notes:
  1. No WHT is imposed on dividends distributed by Maltese companies (except for distributions of untaxed income to resident persons other than companies) because no additional tax is imposed on distributions other than the tax charged on the company with respect to the distributed profits. Malta makes no distinction between portfolio and substantial holdings. Under Maltese law, the dividend is grossed up by a figure representing the tax imposed on the company's profits when these were originally earned thereby. Under Malta's full-imputation system of taxation of dividends, the corporate tax is assimilated with the shareholder's personal income tax with respect to the dividend. In the shareholder's hands, the dividend is taxed at the gross amount, and the relevant amount of corporate tax offsets the shareholder's tax liability on income from all taxable sources with no further tax liability being imposed on the shareholder in respect of such dividends.
  2. Interest and royalty income derived by non-residents is exempt from tax in Malta as long as certain conditions are complied with (e.g. they are not effectively connected to a PE of the recipient situated in Malta).
  3. On the basis that Malta operates the full-imputation system of dividends, dividends are not subject to further tax when distributed by a company registered in Malta to a non-Maltese resident. Furthermore, if the rate provided under the Dividends Article in the respective treaty provides for a lower rate than the Maltese corporate tax rate incurred by the company on the respective profits (standard corporate tax rate of 35%), then this may result in a refund of Maltese tax in terms of Malta’s full imputation system (such a refund situation may arise in the treaties with Austria, Bulgaria, Kuwait, Libya, and Romania). In a number of treaties, the rate of deduction and of tax is reduced to 15% in the case of companies enjoying certain tax incentives. _See also Note 1 with respect to Malta’s full-imputation system of taxation of dividends._
  4. Distributions of dividends by a Maltese company where the dividend represents a distribution of untaxed income attracts a 15% WHT where the shareholder is (i) a Maltese resident other than a company, (ii) a non-resident person who is directly or indirectly owned and controlled by, or acts on behalf of, a Maltese domiciled and ordinarily-resident individual, or (iii) an EU/EEA individual who has declared that at least 90% of worldwide income is derived from Malta.

## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
The agreement concluded between the Republic of Malta and the United States to improve international tax compliance and to implement the FATCA (the 'Agreement') entered into force on 26 June 2014. On 18 November 2014, the FATCA Regulations were accordingly issued implementing the said intergovernmental agreement (IGA). Guidelines on the implementation and interpretation of the FATCA Regulations and the said Agreement have been issued by the Maltese Commissioner for Tax and Customs and are updated periodically.
Furthermore, the Exchange of Information (United States of America) (FATCA) (Amendment) Order was enacted in 2015.
Guidelines on FATCA, providing guidance for its implementation and interpretation, have also been issued by the Maltese Commissioner for Tax and Customs and should be periodically updated. 
## The Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and EU Council Directive 2011/16/EU and 2014/107/EU
By virtue of LN 384 of 2015 entitled the ‘Cooperation with Other Jurisdiction on Tax Matters (Amendment) Regulations, 2015’, the EU Council Directive 2014/107/EU of 9 December 2014 amending Directive 2011/16/EU as regards mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation (DAC2) and the CRS have been accordingly implemented into Maltese legislation, with effect from 1 January 2016.
Guidelines on the implementation and interpretation of the DAC2 and CRS have also been issued by the Maltese Commissioner for Tax and Customs and updated periodically, with the last update issued on 28 February 2024. Although FATCA and CRS/DAC2 reporting is to be done primarily by the XML Schema reporting, the Maltese Commissioner for Tax and Customs updated the alternative online reporting tool available to Maltese Financial Institutions that were classified as Reporting Malta Financial Institutions for DAC2 and CRS purposes. The reporting tool includes both the report to be submitted relating to the FATCA as well as DAC2/CRS. According to the latest Guidelines, the alternative online reporting tool is only made available after Reporting Malta Financial Institutions request authorisation from the Maltese Commissioner for Tax and Customs, after they successfully manage to explain why they are unable to report by using the XML Schema reporting.
## Disclosure of Tax Arrangements (DAC6)
The provisions of the fifth update to Council Directive 2011/16/EU on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation have been transposed and implemented into Maltese law (DAC6 or the Directive). The rules transpose the Directive provisions and impose mandatory disclosure by intermediaries (and taxpayers, in specified situations) of certain arrangements with an EU cross-border element where the arrangements bear certain 'hallmarks' set out in the Directive.
It should be noted that there are certain instances wherein an intermediary may waive the filing of certain information in certain situations. In such circumstances, the reporting obligation may shift to another intermediary or, in absence of such intermediary, to the relevant taxpayer. However, the intermediary is nevertheless required to notify such persons of their reporting obligations.
In the case that intermediaries have waived such reporting obligation, the said intermediaries are required to provide the Maltese Commissioner for Tax and Customs with an annual update specifying other intermediaries or taxpayers who will be carrying out the reporting.
## Reporting obligations for digital platforms (DAC7)
Legal Notice 8 of 2023, which was published on 20 January 2023, introduced rules that transposed the provisions of the sixth update to Council Directive 2011/16/EU on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation into Maltese law (DAC7). DAC7 extends the EU tax transparency rules to digital ’platforms‘ and introduces an obligation on ’reporting platform operators‘ to collect, verify, and report specific information with respect to ’reportable sellers‘ that have undertaken ’relevant activities‘ through their platforms. DAC7 also introduces new automatic exchange of information between the EU tax authorities regarding the taxable events and income generated through these platforms. Furthermore, DAC7 includes a legal framework to enable joint audits. In joint audits, two or more countries join to form a single audit team to conduct a taxpayer examination.
Reporting platform operators are required to report to the local tax authorities specific information with respect to the operator itself and also with respect to the reportable sellers by 31 January of the year following the calendar year in which the seller is identified as a reportable seller. The tax administrations must then exchange the information between member states within one month, i.e. by the end of February. Penalties for non-compliance may apply.


# Malta
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Inventory valuation
Inventory valuations are generally made at the lower of cost or market value. In general, the book and tax methods of inventory valuation will conform. However, the last in first out (LIFO) method is not accepted for taxation purposes. Obsolescence is accepted where proven, but there are no provisions to take into account the effects of monetary inflation on the inventory valuation.
## Capital gains
Tax is chargeable on capital gains realised on the transfer of immovable property (real estate), shares and other securities, business, goodwill, business permits, copyrights, patents, trade names, trademarks, any other intellectual property (IP), interests in a partnership, and beneficial interests in a trust.
In respect of transfer of Maltese immovable property, a WHT system applies (_see Property transfer taxes in the section_).
Furthermore, _similarly to the stamp duty situation set out in the section_ , in the event that the market value of shares held by a person is reduced following a change in the company’s issued share capital or voting rights and the value shifts onto the other shareholders, the transferor will be deemed to have transferred the said value to the transferee(s) and such value shifting may be subject to a tax on capital gains (although certain exceptions/exemptions may apply).
No tax is levied on investments that yield a fixed rate of return. A tax exemption applies in certain instances and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions on the capital gain arising on the transfer of shares in a company listed on a recognised stock exchange other than shares held in certain collective investment schemes.
Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, if the asset is transferred between group companies, no loss or gain is deemed to arise from the transfer. Note that a provision exists that brings to charge the transfer of shares in property companies (as specifically defined) that were originally subject to intra-group tax deferral when the transferee ceases to be a member of the original group within six years from the date of such intra-group transfer.
Gains arising outside Malta and derived by a company that is either not domiciled or not ordinarily resident in Malta are not subject to tax. There are also a number of exemptions provided in the law. For example, gains realised by non-residents on transfers of units in Maltese collective investment schemes, similar investments relating to linked long-term insurance business and shares, or securities in Maltese companies (except for companies holding certain Maltese immovable property) are exempt from tax.
### Rollover relief
Rollover relief is granted with respect to capital assets used in a business for a period of at least three years and transferred and replaced within one year by an asset used solely for similar business purposes (i.e. no tax is chargeable on the capital gain). In such instances, the cost of acquisition of the new asset is reduced by the gain on the transfer of the previous asset that would otherwise have been taxable.
Maltese tax law also provides for the surrendering and claiming of allowable losses between companies that form part of the same group (_see the section for more information_) as well as for reorganisation relief, subject to certain specific conditions.
## Dividend income
Dividends received by one resident company from another, whether or not a subsidiary, are taxable on the gross amount in the recipient’s hands. If the distributed profits have been taxed, no further tax should be chargeable to the recipient company. However, for resident shareholders, if the corporate rate of tax in the year in which the profits are earned is lower than that in the year in which they are distributed, an amount equivalent to the difference in rates (topping up) is payable. If the distribution is made from untaxed income, the dividend will be tax-free in the hands of the recipient company.
Dividends and gains on disposal of shares received by a corporate investor from a non-resident company (or from a non-resident partnership, subject to certain conditions), as well as profits from a PE, including a foreign branch, may qualify for a participation exemption in Malta, subject to the satisfaction of certain statutory conditions. 
The participation exemption may also apply to gains upon the disposal of equity holdings in Maltese-resident entities. Distributions of taxed income by Maltese-resident companies are not subject to further tax under the full imputation system.
All tax refund claim forms submitted should identify and disclose information relating to all the direct and indirect beneficial owners of the shareholder claiming the tax refund. Further to the changes relative to the beneficial ownership register brought about by the 5th AML Directive (EU) 2018/843, which was transposed into Maltese legislation through LN26 of 2020, art 5(3) of the Income Tax Management Act was amended (effective from 1 June 2020) such that the relevant certificate will only be considered as compliant where it identifies and discloses all the beneficiaries and ultimate beneficial owners of relevant trusts/fiduciary arrangements.
The participation exemption shall not apply to income derived from a participating holding in a body of persons resident for tax purposes in a jurisdiction that is included in the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for any period of three months during the year preceding the year of assessment. This exclusion does not apply if it is proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the said body of persons maintains sufficient significant people functions in that jurisdiction (listed as non-cooperative) as is commensurate with the type and extent of the activity carried on in that jurisdiction and the income earned therefrom.
### Stock dividends
A Maltese company may distribute bonus shares from profits, whether of an income or capital nature, and from share premium and capital redemption reserves. When bonus shares represent a capitalisation of profits, they are deemed to be dividends for tax purposes. Such bonus shares are subject to tax in the recipients’ hands, gross of any tax paid at the corporate level on the relative profits, but tax credits equivalent to the gross-up of tax are available to stockholders.
## Interest income
Interest is chargeable to tax under the provisions of Article 4(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act and subject to the standard corporate tax rate. Nevertheless, in the event the receipt of interest falls within the definition of ‘investment income’ as established by Maltese tax legislation, a WHT of 15% may be generally applicable. Furthermore, in the case of interest income payable to non-Maltese residents, such interest should be exempt from Maltese tax, subject to the satisfaction of certain statutory conditions.
## Royalty income
Similar to interest income, royalty income is chargeable to tax under the provisions of Article (4)(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act (_see Intellectual property in the section for a description of the possibility of a tax deduction for expenditure of a capital nature on IP or any IP rights_). In the case of royalty income payable to non-Maltese residents, such royalty should be exempt from Maltese tax, subject to the satisfaction of certain statutory conditions.
## Rental income
Corporates and individuals in receipt of income from the letting of urban and/or rural property and of commercial tenements and clubs, provided that such properties are not being rented to or from a related body of persons (as defined), have the option to apply a final 15% tax on the gross rental income (other tax rates may apply in specific circumstances).
Otherwise, the rental income is subject to normal rates of tax, but special tax deduction rules apply.
## Foreign income
A company is taxable on its worldwide income when it is ordinarily resident and domiciled in Malta. A company that is either not ordinarily resident or not domiciled in Malta is taxable on its foreign income only insofar as such income is remitted to/received in Malta (or where such foreign income is treated as arising in Malta). Foreign tax is relieved by way of tax credits. This may occur under the terms of a DTT. Where no treaty exists, the foreign tax can be relieved through a system of unilateral relief. Relief for underlying tax is also granted with respect to dividend income, either in terms of a DTT or as unilateral relief. Such relief may be available if, among other things, evidence of tax paid abroad is produced.
Profits of Malta resident companies are subdivided for Maltese tax purposes into five accounts: the Immovable Property Account, the Final Tax Account, the Maltese Taxed Account, the Untaxed Account, and the Foreign Income Account. The last of these includes, among other things, taxable profits of Maltese-resident companies resulting from foreign investments; profits of a foreign PE; and profits resulting from foreign investments, assets, or liabilities of an onshore bank licensed in Malta. Income allocated to the Foreign Income Account for which no evidence of tax paid abroad is available can qualify for a flat-rate foreign tax credit of 25%.
The Immovable Property Account includes profits and income derived directly or indirectly from immovable property situated in Malta. The Final Tax Account includes, among other items, profits that have been subject to a final tax at source (apart from Maltese immovable property). The Maltese Taxed Account includes any other taxed profits while the Untaxed Account represents the difference between the distributable profits and the profits allocated to the other taxed accounts.
Under Malta’s system of taxation of dividends, shareholders receiving distributions from the Maltese Taxed Account and/or the Foreign Income Account may be entitled to a tax refund of part of the tax suffered by the distributing Maltese company on such profits being distributed. The tax refund may be either a six-sevenths refund, a five-sevenths refund, or a two-thirds refund of the tax suffered by the Maltese distributing company on the distributed profits. The type of the tax refund depends on the nature of the income to be distributed.


# Malta
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
A company incorporated in Malta is considered as both domiciled and resident in Malta and is consequently taxable on a worldwide basis. A non-Maltese incorporated company that is resident in Malta through management and control is subject to Maltese tax on income arising in Malta and on income received in/remitted to Malta.
Companies are subject to income tax at a flat rate of 35%. There is no corporate tax structure separate from income tax.
## Petroleum profits tax
Petroleum profits tax is levied as income tax with similar deductions being allowed in respect of incurred expenditure. In the case of a Production Sharing Contract signed after 1 January 1996, any petroleum profits are taxed at the standard corporate tax rate of 35%. However, all other petroleum profits are subject to a 50% tax rate.
## Insurance profits tax
Insurance profits tax is levied as income tax and subject to the normal standard tax rate of 35% as other corporate profits; however, the manner in which such profits are ascertained is subject to a number of detailed rules that take into account the special nature of the insurance industry. In the case of non-resident companies, the computation is applied with reference only to business carried on in or from Malta.
Recently introduced rules on the taxation of insurance businesses adopting IFRS 17 came into effect from the year of assessment 2024 for accounting periods starting on or after 1 January 2023, which apply to insurers deriving gains or profits from the business of insurance. The rules regulate (i) the determination of total income based on adjusted profit before tax; (ii) the adoption gains or losses arising from the implementation of IFRS 17 and (iii) provide for an irrevocable option for insurers to spread the tax payment on the adoption gains equally over a maximum period of five consecutive years, subject to an election made by the insurer.
## Shipping profits tax
A tonnage tax system is applicable under Maltese law. Such regime covers profits from shipping activities as defined under the applicable regulations that are derived by qualifying Maltese-flagged and EU/European Economic Area (EEA) vessels as well as non-EU/EEA vessels satisfying certain additional rules. Furthermore, qualifying ship management activities are also entitled to the tonnage tax system.
The Maltese tonnage tax regulations allow the exemption of certain shipping income from being charged under income tax. These regulations provide that, subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions, which conditions are modelled on the EU Community Guidelines on state aid to maritime transport, and the full payment of all relevant tonnage taxes by a shipping organisation, a shipping organisation shall not be charged further income tax on the income derived from shipping activities. Income derived from ship management activities may also qualify for the tonnage tax exemption. Furthermore, any further tax derived from income or profit gained from the sale or other transfer of a tonnage tax ship, which ship had been acquired and sold whilst under the tonnage tax system, or from the disposal of any rights to acquire a ship, which when delivered or completed would qualify as a tonnage tax ship, would be exempt.

## Corporate - Other taxes

## Value-added tax (VAT)
Supplies of goods and services in Malta are typically subject to VAT at the standard rate of 18%. However, certain supplies may be subject to a reduced VAT rate, such as 7% on eligible accommodation and on entrance to sporting facilities, and 5% on other supplies like the supply of electricity, the importation of works of art, collector’s items and antiques, certain confectionery items, certain medical accessories, certain printed matter (including electronic publications), and certain items for exclusive use by persons with a disability. . Moreover, a reduced rate of 12% is applicable in relation to certain services involving the custody, management of securities and credit guarantees, as well as those involving the hire of pleasure boats and certain health care services.
Exports of goods to countries outside the European Union, food (as defined) for human consumption, and numerous financial services (as defined) are exempt from VAT. Some of these exempt supplies also give the supplier a right to claim an input tax credit of VAT incurred on purchases made during the course of such supplies.
For a number of years now, the place of supply of telecommunications, broadcasting, and electronic services to non-taxable persons is considered to be the place where that non-taxable person is established, has one's permanent address, or where one usually resides. As of 1 January 2019, this is not applicable if the supplier is only established in Malta and the total value of the services supplied to a non-taxable person established in any other member state other than Malta does not exceed 10,000 euros (EUR) in the same calendar year. As of 1 January 2021, this threshold includes supplies of distance sales made in other EU member state (_see_ _E-commerce changes below_).
### Quick fixes
In line with an EU-wide initiative, a number of ‘quick fixes’ are incorporated into Maltese VAT legislation with the intention of improving the day-to-day functioning of the VAT system for EU cross-border business-to-business (B2B) trade, particularly where goods are concerned. These ‘quick fixes’:
  * place an added emphasis on the need to include a client’s VAT number in relevant documentation, as well as having to submit a recapitulative statement, when applying the zero-rate for intra-Community supplies
  * shall not consider as a supply of goods certain transfers of call-off stock to a storage facility in a different member state
  * shall help determine the allocation of transport (to determine which supply shall be taken as an exempt intra-Community supply/acquisition) when goods are supplied successively across multiple member states in the course of chain transactions, and
  * as a result of the above, put in place additional requirements with respect to records that a taxable person must retain.


### E-commerce changes
As part of the e-commerce changes, VAT regulations for business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce apply. These regulations will impact online sellers (particularly if they would be selling more than EUR 10,000 of goods in an EU member state other than the one in which they are established), operators of online market platforms, couriers, and the end consumers themselves (as there may be changes to the VAT that would need to be levied on a given transaction). These changes also include a number of provisions that concern distance sales, such as the following:
  * Taxable persons who facilitate distance sales (including of small value consignments of goods originating from outside the European Union) to end-customers through the use of an electronic interface (i.e. a marketplace, platform, portal, or similar online means) may have to consider various changes to their respective VAT obligations, including being deemed to be receiving and onward supplying such goods themselves.
  * The distance sales provisions have been extended to also capture goods that originate from a third country/territory, which also determines the manner in which the subsequent VAT obligations are to be handled by that taxable person.


### Small undertakings 
A small undertaking may avail of a simplified VAT registration (referred to as an Article 11 VAT Registration) with a reduced compliance burden. This type of registration is now no longer limited to transactions taking place only in Malta but may also cover some transactions in other EU Member States (provided that, the relevant thresholds have not been exceeded). Entities established outside of Malta may also avail of such a VAT registration if the transactions taking place in Malta are below the applicable threshold. 
### Brexit 
Following the agreement of the Brexit deal, the Maltese VAT Act has been updated in line with the said deal to take into account that Northern Ireland is to be considered as a territory of a member state for VAT purposes. Similar treatment is also extended to the UK Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia and the Principality of Monaco.
### Other recent changes
Pursuant to a decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), the local VAT authorities have reiterated that, where a company is being remunerated for making available to another company the services of a Director, this would, in fact, constitute an economic activity that falls within the scope of VAT.
There has also been a renewed focus (including an increase in late-filing penalties) on compliance with filing obligations for ancillary declarations, such as with the timely submissions of recapitulative statements (referred to as EC Sales Lists in some jurisdictions). A similar focus is being placed by the authorities on the timely submission of IntraStat declarations. 
Likewise, there has also been an increase in late-payment interest to 0.6% per month (or part thereof) that a VAT payable balance remains outstanding.
In accordance with recent VAT updates, payment service providers are required to keep sufficiently detailed information in accordance with the specification set out in the said regulations of at least 25 separate cross-border transactions and the payees making such payments. Furthermore, such records are to be submitted to the VAT Commissioner, in accordance with the provisions of Title V of Council Directive 2006/112/EC, thus enabling the Maltese VAT authorities to monitor the supply of goods and services and combat VAT fraud.
With effect from 1 January 2025, where certain services are streamed or otherwise made virtually available, the place of supply of these services shall be the place where the non-taxable person is established, has his permanent address or usually resides.
## Customs duties
Goods imported from outside the European Union may be subject to customs duties. A Customs Code provides for customs procedures and concepts, which are based on European Community requirements.
In 2019, the Malta Free Zones Act was issued to provide for the regulation and administration of the affairs of Free Zones in Malta and to determine and regulate the undertakings authorised to carry out activities within such Free Zones. The Act specifies the different activities that may be carried out within such Free Zones, including activities such as production, manufacture, assembly, testing, repair, logistics, packaging, and warehousing. Furthermore, the Act provides for the relevant authority to issue guidelines to establish terms and conditions pertaining to eligibility to various schemes, incentives, tax exemptions, benefits, and grants that may be issued by the relevant authority for undertakings operating within such Free Zones.
## Excise duties
Excise duties are chargeable on certain energy products, certain alcoholic drinks, certain manufactured tobacco products, and mobile telephony services.
## Property taxes
Maltese tax legislation does not contain any wealth taxes or other similar taxes on property, save for the property transfers tax outlined below.
## Property transfer taxes
Transfers of immovable property situated in Malta are generally subject to a final withholding tax (WHT), which, in most cases, is charged on the transfer value of the property. In the case of transfers of Maltese immovable property made on or after 1 January 2015, the WHT on such transfer should, in general, be 8% or 10% (the latter rate applying in the case where the property was acquired before 1 January 2004). Certain other rates of WHT may apply in specific circumstances. 
The final tax rate on transfers of immovable property situated in urban conservation areas, whereby the transferor had declared that one has carried out works on that property in compliance with a permit issued by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority (MEPA) providing for the restoration and/or rehabilitation of that property, is set at 5% of the transfer value, subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions.
Transfers of immovable property acquired through _causa mortis_ or donation may be taxed at 12% WHT on the difference between transfer value and acquisition value. Taxpayers can opt out of this mechanism and have the transfer taxed at the default rate on the transfer value as set out above.
The first EUR 100,000 of any profits or gains arising on the assignment or cessation of any rights acquired under a promise of transfer of immovable property or any rights thereon will be subject to a tax at the rate of 15%.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is charged on, among other transactions, transfers of immovable property (5% for both residents and non-residents) and marketable securities (2%; 5% in the case of transfers of shares in property companies). Persons who are subject to duty in terms of Maltese law should now be registered with the Commissioner for Revenue.
The exemption from duty on the restructuring of holdings through mergers, demergers, amalgamations, and re-organisations within a group of companies also applies to partnerships. As a result, no duty should be chargeable on the exchange of a partnership interest for shares from one company to another where the transferor and the transferee form part of the same group of companies. In addition, no duty shall be chargeable on the transfer of a partnership interest for consideration from a company or partnership to another company or partnership. This shall apply where the transferor and the transferee form part of the same group of companies, or where any or both of them are partnerships, and they would have been considered to form part of the same group if they had been a company or companies.
In the case of the transfer by gratuitous title of (i) marketable securities owned by individuals and of (ii) commercial tenements (i.e. business property) that had been used in a family business for a minimum period of three years preceding the transfer, to the transferor’s spouse, descendants, and ascendants in the direct line and their spouses, or in the absence of descendants to such transferor’s brothers or sisters and their descendants, stamp duty is chargeable at a reduced rate of 1.5%. The 1.5% reduced stamp duty rate only applies if the donation is made by public deed and is made prior to 1 January 2026. Once this reduced rate is applied, no other exemption or duty relief will apply to such transfers.
In the event that the market value of shares held by a person is reduced following a change in the company’s issued share capital or voting rights and the value shifts onto the other shareholders, the transferor would be deemed to have transferred the said value to the transferee(s) and such value shifting may be subject to a stamp duty liability (although certain exceptions/exemptions may apply).
Maltese legislation also provides for the possibility of a stamp duty exemption in a number of instances, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Some of the more commonly availed of exemptions include the acquisition or disposal of marketable securities by or in the following: (i) licensed collective investment schemes; (ii) licensed persons providing management, administration, safekeeping, or investment advice to collective investment schemes; (iii) companies being owned more than 50% by non-Maltese residents and satisfying certain other conditions; and (iv) a company being owned more than 50% by non-Maltese residents and that carries on or intends to carry on more than 90% of its business outside of Malta.
A stamp duty exemption should also apply (subject to certain conditions) in instances where there is a transfer of partnership interest.
## Payroll taxes
In terms of the Final Settlement System (FSS) rules, an employer is required to withhold income tax and social security contributions (_see below_) at source from the employees’ salaries. Such deductions of tax/social security should be forwarded by the employer to the Malta Tax and Customs Administration within specific time frames.
## Employer's social security contributions
Employers are required to pay social security contributions at the rate of 10% of the individual employee’s salary and at fixed rates, for calendar year 2025, of EUR 54.43 per week for annual salaries equal to or exceeding EUR 28,303.08, in the case where the employee is born on or after 1 January 1962 (it should be noted that the employee is also required to pay an equivalent weekly amount).
The rates of social security generally increase annually and take effect from the commencement of the calendar year in question.
### Salaried persons
Social security contributions amount to 10% of the employee’s basic weekly wage, payable by both the employee and the employer, subject to a minimum and maximum contribution. The maximum contribution varies depending on the age of the insured person as follows:
  * For employees born before 1 January 1962, the current maximum weekly contribution is EUR 45.19.
  * For employees born on or after 1 January 1962, the current maximum weekly contribution is EUR 54.43.


### Self-employed/Self-occupied persons
Social security contributions amount to 15% of the self-employed/self-occupied person’s annual net income earned during the previous year and are also subject to a minimum and maximum contribution. The maximum contribution varies depending on the age of the person as follows:
  * For persons born before 1 January 1962, the current maximum weekly contribution is EUR 67.79.
  * For persons born on or after 1 January 1962, the current maximum weekly contribution is EUR 81.64.
