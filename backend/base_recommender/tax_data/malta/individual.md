## Foreign tax relief
There are no special credits for short-term residents. Income taxes paid abroad on income that becomes taxable in the hands of a Maltese resident may qualify for a credit if a double taxation treaty (DTT) has been concluded with the relevant country or under the unilateral relief provisions of Maltese law.
## Tax treaties
_See the section in the Corporate tax summary for a list of countries with which Malta has a DTT_.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
Malta taxes individuals who are both domiciled and ordinarily resident in Malta on their worldwide income.
Any person who is ordinarily resident in Malta but not domiciled in Malta is taxable only on income arising in Malta and on any foreign income remitted to Malta (i.e. on income and chargeable gains arising in Malta and on income outside Malta that is received in Malta). Such persons are not taxable in Malta on income arising outside Malta, which is not received in Malta, and on capital gains arising outside Malta, regardless of whether they are received in Malta, or otherwise.
However, persons who are married to an individual ordinarily resident and domiciled in Malta are subject to a worldwide basis of taxation (and not on a source and remittance basis).
A non-resident individual is taxed only on income and chargeable gains arising in Malta.
Individuals are subject to tax on income arising in a calendar year (i.e. the basis year), which is assessed to tax in the year following the year in which it arises (i.e. the year of assessment).
## Personal income tax rates
Income is taxable at graduated progressive rates, ranging from 0% to 35%. The 35% tax bracket is reached at annual chargeable income in excess of EUR 60,000. 
### Basis year 2025
Tax rates for basis tax year 2025 are as follows:
#### Married resident taxpayers
Taxable income (EUR) | Rate (%) | Deduct (EUR)  
---|---|---  
From | To  
0 | 15,000 | 0 | 0  
15,001 | 23,000 | 15 | 2,250  
23,001 | 60,000 | 25 | 4,550  
60,001 | and above | 35 | 10,550  
Subject to certain conditions, the married rates also apply to single parents, widows/widowers, and separated parents.
#### Single resident taxpayers (or married couples opting for a separate computation)
Taxable income (EUR) | Rate (%) | Deduct (EUR)  
---|---|---  
From | To  
0 | 12,000 | 0 | 0  
12,001 | 16,000 | 15 | 1,800  
16,001 | 60,000 | 25 | 3,400  
60,001 | and above | 35 | 9,400  
#### Parent rates
Taxable income (EUR) | Rate (%) | Deduct (EUR)  
---|---|---  
From | To  
0 | 13,000 | 0 | 0  
13,001 | 17,500 | 15 | 1,950  
17,501 | 60,000 | 25 | 3,700  
60,001 | and above | 35 | 9,700  
The parent rates can be claimed by individuals who maintain under their custody a child, or pay maintenance in respect of their child, where:
  * such child is less than 18 years of age (or between 18 and 23 years of age if attending full-time education at a university, college, or other educational establishment), and
  * such child is not gainfully occupied, or, if gainfully employed, does not earn more than EUR 3,400  _per annum_.


The parent rates provide more preferential tax bands in lieu of single/separate tax rates.
Individuals who in terms of Maltese tax laws are:
  * considered as ordinarily resident but not domiciled in Malta (and who therefore are subject to income tax in Malta on a source and remittance basis)
  * are not subject to any other minimum tax threshold under Maltese law, and
  * during the calendar year preceding the year of assessment derived (together with their spouse, in the case of couples married and living together) income arising outside Malta of at least EUR 35,000 or equivalent, which was not received in Malta in full,


should be subject to a minimum tax in Malta of EUR 5,000 for the said year.
In calculating such minimum tax liability, any tax paid in terms of Maltese income tax law, whether by withholding or otherwise, should be taken into account, unless it is a final tax paid on the transfer of immovable property situated in Malta. The said minimum tax liability of EUR 5,000 should be calculated before double tax relief.
Taxpayers who calculate their income tax charge at the ‘single’ rates of tax; and during calendar year 2025 will only derive income from employment (other than income from the holding of an office of a director) that does not exceed EUR 12,050 (up from EUR 11,620), are to deduct €12,000 in arriving at their income chargeable to tax. 
A reduced income tax rate of 7.5% applies in respect of income derived by registered professional football or water polo players, athletes, or licensed coaches. As of 2024, this shall be extended to other persons engaged in sports activities. 
Artists receiving income from artistic activities (as defined) conducted on a self-employed basis may opt to be taxed at a flat rate of 7.5% on the first EUR 50,000 turnover earned. When this option is applied, the rest of the income is to be added to the main income and taxed at the progressive tax rates. The tax is final and no set-off or refund shall be granted.
Recipients of royalty income derived by an individual in one's capacity as an author from qualifying literary works may opt to tax the full gross amount of such royalty income at a reduced rate of 7.5% (decreased from 15%). The literary publication must be eligible for copyright in terms of the Maltese Copyright Act. The tax is final, no set-off or refund shall be granted, and it is payable by 30 April of the relative year of assessment.
Subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, income derived from part-time work may qualify for a reduced tax rate of 10%, subject to a capping of EUR 10,000 _per annum_ for part-time employment and EUR 12,000 _per annum_ for part-time self-employment. Taxpayers may opt not to avail of this tax rate, in which case tax on such income should be charged at normal rates.
The income tax rate applicable on qualifying overtime emoluments remains 15% on the first EUR 10,000, provided that the basic weekly wage does not exceed EUR 375. Overtime emoluments exceeding this amount are taxable at the standard applicable rates of income tax.
Taxpayers subject to Maltese income tax on certain emoluments payable under a contract of employment requiring the performance of work or duties mainly outside Malta may opt to be subject to income tax at a flat rate of 15% if they satisfy certain conditions, including: (i) the said contract of employment should be for a period of at least 12 months and lasts at least 12 months, and (ii) the taxpayer should not be in Malta for a period that, in aggregate, is more than 30 days (disregarding vacation leave, sick leave, and period preceding commencement or following termination of contract).
Income tax rules have been issued in relation to third country nationals who hold a valid Nomad Residence Permit, which entitles the main applicant to work remotely from Malta. In terms of the said Rules, the main applicant is subject to income tax in Malta on income derived from ‘authorised work’ at a flat rate of 10%, before double tax relief (if applicable). Such income will be considered as the first part of the taxable income of the main applicant. Furthermore, generally, the main applicant is not subject to income tax in Malta on income arising from ‘authorised work’ in the first year. The maximum amount of non-taxable pension income increased from EUR 14,968 to EUR 16,220, with persons claiming married rates entitled to a further EUR 3,600 tax free in respect of income from other sources. These thresholds are available through the use of tax rebates on pension income after calculating the tax due using the normal rates on all income.
Certain pension income will gradually not be considered part of the taxable income, over a period of five years starting from 1 January 2022, as follows:
  * Basis year 2022, 20% of pension income, subject to a capping of EUR 2,864.
  * Basis year 2023, 40% of pension income, subject to a capping of EUR 5,987.
  * Basis year 2024, 60% of pension income, subject to a capping of EUR 9,732.
  * Basis year 2025, 80% of pension income, subject to a capping of EUR 13,309.
  * Basis year 2026 and subsequent years, 100% of pension income, subject to a capping of EUR 16,636.


Moreover, for basis year 2025, tax rebate thresholds on pension income were increased as follows:
(a) Person taxed at the ‘single’ rates: (pension income less EUR 12,000) x 15%, capped at EUR 696;
(b) Person taxed at the ‘parent’ rates: (pension income less EUR 13,000) x 15%, capped at EUR 546;
(c) Person taxed at the ‘married’ rates:
i) (pension income less €15,000) x 15%, capped at €246;
ii) a further tax rebate is allowed against the tax on chargeable income, as follows: (all chargeable income less €15,000) x 15%, less rebate under (i) above, capped at €540.
As of 2024, widows’/widowers’/survivors' pension will no longer be taxable for individuals who have not attained 61 years of age. The beneficiaries will continue to be entitled to receive the pension income that would have been received by their spouse had they still been alive.
## Different types of programmes available for individuals
The Global Residence Programme is aimed at attracting more third country national individuals in taking up residence in Malta without taking up employment in Malta, with foreign-source income remitted to Malta by the beneficiary or its dependants being taxed at a flat rate of 15%, subject to a minimum tax of EUR 15,000 _per annum_. Beneficiaries should satisfy a number of qualifying criteria in order to be eligible for the beneficial tax treatment. In particular, applicants must hold immovable property in Malta for a purchase price of not less than EUR 275,000 (with lower thresholds applicable in the case of property situated in certain areas in Malta and/or Gozo). Alternatively, individuals may rent property in Malta for an annual rental payment of not less than EUR 9,600 (with lower thresholds applicable in the case of property situated in certain areas in Malta and/or Gozo).
The Residence Programme Rules 2014 (RPR) replaced the High Net Worth Individual Rules. The RPR reflects the same scheme as that provided under the Global Residence Program, but the former may be availed of by European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA)/Swiss nationals who are not permanent residents of Malta. Under the RPR, similar to the position under the Global Residence Programme Rules, any foreign income derived by beneficiaries or their dependants and remitted to Malta is taxed at the reduced rate of 15% (flat rate), subject to a minimum tax of EUR 15,000 _per annum_.
A Malta Retirement Programme is applicable to pensioners in receipt of periodic pension income. Such pension income must constitute at least 75% of the pensioner's chargeable income in Malta, and such pension must be received in Malta. A number of other statutory conditions apply in order to be eligible for the said programme. Again, under this programme, foreign-source remitted income is taxed at 15%, subject to a minimum tax liability of EUR 7,500 _per annum_ and an additional EUR 500 per each dependant, _per annum_. This Programme is now extended to third country nationals.
Subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, a returned migrant may elect to be taxed on a source and remittance basis (rather than on a world-wide basis). In this case, foreign-sourced income received in Malta exceeding the tax-free brackets of EUR 4,200 for single taxpayers and EUR 5,900 for married taxpayers should be subject to income tax at a flat rate of 15%, subject to a minimum tax liability of EUR 2,325 _per annum_.
The United Nations (UN) Pensions Programme Rules, 2015 are designed to attract foreign pensioners retiring from the United Nations. Similar to the Global Residence Programme and other programmes already in place, applicants must satisfy a number of conditions, including holding immovable property in Malta for a purchase price of not less than EUR 275,000, or EUR 220,000 for property situated in certain areas. Alternatively, individuals may rent property in Malta for an annual rental payment of not less than EUR 9,600, or EUR 8,750 for property situated in certain areas. A beneficiary who should receive at least 40% of the UN pension or a widow’s/widower’s benefit in Malta is not subject to income tax on such income in Malta. Other foreign-source remitted income should be taxed at a flat rate of 15%, subject to a minimum tax of EUR 10,000 (or EUR 15,000 where both spouses are in receipt of a UN Pension), after double tax relief.
The Highly Qualified Persons Rules cater to expatriates (i.e. individuals who are Maltese residents but not domiciled in Malta) in receipt of income payable in terms of a 'qualifying contract of employment' in respect of activities carried out in Malta. Subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, such expatriates may be subject to tax on such income at a beneficial flat rate of 15%. The beneficial rate may be availed of by individuals occupying an 'eligible office' in financial services or gaming sectors or in undertakings holding an air operators certificate. These Rules also cover specific positions of employment in the sphere related to assisted reproductive technology.
Beneficiaries of the said rules may benefit from the reduced tax rate for a period of five years in the case of EEA and Swiss nationals and for a period of four years in the case of third country nationals. Furthermore, any person who is eligible to fall under the said Rules (irrespective of whether one has opted to benefit from the provisions of the said rules or otherwise), upon submitting an application, shall be eligible for two further extensions for the qualifying period, five years with respect to EEA and Swiss nationals and four years with respect to third-country nationals. Such extensions are subject to the continued adherence to the other provisions of the Rules and provided that the maximum qualifying period shall not exceed a consecutive period of 15 or 12 years, as the case may be.
In terms of the current rules, no determinations in terms of the Highly Qualified Persons Rules shall be issued by the competent authorities after 31 December 2025, and any such determination issued must refer to an employment in respect of which the benefit provided by these rules commences by not later than 31 December 2026 and ceases to apply by 31 December 2030. However, in the budget speech , the government committed to continue providing incentives to attract highly skilled workers and that such rules will also be extended to employees of entities providing back office services.
The Qualifying Employment in Aviation (Personal Tax) Rules were introduced with the aim of attracting EEA/Swiss and third country nationals not domiciled in Malta to hold an eligible office in the aviation sector in Malta. By virtue of these rules, eligible individuals may benefit from a beneficial tax rate of 15% on employment income from such activities, subject to receiving an annual income of at least EUR 45,000 and subject to the satisfaction of certain other conditions. The beneficiary may avail of this arrangement for five consecutive years from when one is first liable to income tax in Malta, with the possibility to apply for two extensions of five years each, provided that the eligibility under these rules should not exceed a consecutive period of 15 years.
Beneficiaries in receipt of employment income from a qualifying employment in maritime activities and the servicing of offshore oil and gas industry activities may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, opt to be taxed on such income at a flat rate of 15%. The qualifying contract of employment should give rise to a minimum salary (excluding fringe benefits) of EUR 65,000 in respect of a year of assessment.
In terms of the Qualifying Employment in Innovation and Creativity Rules, beneficiaries in receipt of employment income from a qualifying contract under these Rules may opt to be taxed on such income at a flat rate of 15%. The qualifying contract of employment should give rise to a minimum salary (excluding fringe benefits) of EUR 52,000 in respect of a year of assessment. The beneficiary may avail of this arrangement for four consecutive years from when one is first liable to income tax in Malta, with the possibility to apply for an extension of five years.


# Malta
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
## Taxable period
The tax returns are filed on a calendar-year basis.
## Tax returns
Husband and wife (or two partners who have registered their partnership as a civil union) are jointly responsible for filing tax returns, and spouses must choose who between them is to be registered as the ‘responsible spouse’. Typically, the ‘responsible spouse’ cannot be changed before the lapse of five years. The responsible spouse may elect to have the tax on the other spouse's earned income/pension income computed separately. If a separate computation is chosen, husband and wife (or partners as aforesaid) are assessed separately at the single or the parents taxpayers' rates. Unearned income is taxable in the hands of the spouse/partner earning the higher level of income.
A couple that is married and living together may elect to receive a separate income tax return if both spouses earn employment, self-employment (excluding directors fees), or pension income from past employment, or they have an agreement of separation of assets.
The tax return, together with a self-assessment, must be submitted by the end of June of the year following the basis tax year. In certain instances and subject to the discretion of the Commissioner for Tax and Customs, an individual may not be required to file a tax return. In such instances, one should receive a statement from the Tax Authorities outlining one's tax position; if one does not agree with the position outlined in the said statement, one may then request a tax return and file it accordingly. Penalties are incurred on late filing of returns. The self-assessment is deemed to represent the correct tax position, and an assessment should not be raised unless the Commissioner for Tax and Customs disagrees with the self-assessment.
## Payment of tax
In terms of the Final Settlement System (FSS) Rules, an employer is required to withhold income tax and social security contributions at source from the employees’ salaries (including taxable fringe benefits), which, in most cases, equals the individual's total tax liability. Such deductions of tax/social security should be forwarded by the employer to the Commissioner for Tax and Customs within specific time frames.
Where income is not subject to the FSS (e.g. self-employed persons), the taxpayer is required to make three payments in the basis tax year under the provisional tax (PT) system. The PT payments are based on the last self-assessment filed by the individual, and the payments are divided into three instalments of 20%, 30%, and 50%, respectively. The tax liability that is still due at the tax return due date, after deducting all tax credits, must be settled immediately with the submission of the return. Payments of income tax due by 31 August onwards, which will not be paid by the due date, will be subject to interest at the rate of 0.6% (increased from 0.33%) per month or part thereof, until the tax remains unpaid. The total interest shall not exceed the amount of the tax due.
Tax refunds due by the Commissioner are subject to interest at the rate of 0.6% per month or part thereof from 1 September 2022.
Provisional tax is also payable at 7% on the selling price of certain assets disposed of on account of tax.
A final WHT of 15% is imposed on specified types of investment income (e.g. banking interest paid to Maltese residents), unless the taxpayer opts to be taxed at the tax rates applicable to him/her.


# Malta
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
## Employment expenses
To be deductible, expenses of an employee must be incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of the income and must be necessarily incurred. Where the employer reimburses employees for expenses incurred on the employer's behalf, no tax liability should arise in the hands of the recipients unless a gain or profit accrues to them from the arrangement.
## Personal deductions
Alimony payments paid by a taxpayer to an estranged spouse are allowed as a deduction, while the receipt of the alimony is taxable in the hands of the recipient. The receipt of a payment for the maintenance of children is not taxable in the hands of the estranged spouse and not deductible in the hands of the person making the payment. 
Certain deductions are allowable, which include:
  * fees paid to a named school in respect of a child with special needs for the services of a facilitator (capped at a maximum amount)
  * fees paid for childcare services for children below the age of 12 to a _bona fide_ childcare centre (capped at a maximum amount)
  * fees paid for residence in a private home for the elderly (capped at a maximum amount)
  * fees paid to a named private school for children either in kindergarten, primary school, or secondary education
  * fees paid in respect of children under the age of 16 years for certain sports, cultural, or artistic events (capped at EUR 300)
  * fees paid for the use of school transport (capped at a maximum amount of EUR 150), and
  * fees for residency services in respite homes or centres or for community support services (capped at a maximum amount).


## Personal allowances
No personal allowances by way of deductions or credits are granted.
## Business deductions
Certain allowances are available for business-related expenses in the case of persons exercising a trade, business, profession, or vocation. These include, _inter alia_ , scientific research, bad debts, and losses carried forward.


# Malta
## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
## Employment income
Gains or profits from employment income arising in Malta are usually fully taxable, including the value of ‘any benefit provided by reason of any employment or office’. Remuneration received for services rendered outside Malta by persons not domiciled or not ordinarily resident in Malta should not be liable to tax in Malta. Apportionment is used where necessary.
All rewards for services rendered, including fringe benefits and benefits in kind, are taxable, although some exemptions are provided. Taxable benefits include living allowances, housing allowances, tax reimbursements (grossed up), use of car, and paid vacation trips.
### Fringe benefits
Fringe benefits regulations provide the valuation criteria for fringe benefits and the instances where a fringe benefit is deemed not to arise.
Three main categories of fringe benefits are identified by the regulations.
#### Category 1 - Use of motor vehicles
The valuation of a fringe benefit arising on the use of a car is calculated on the basis of three elements: the car use value, the maintenance value, and the fuel value. The car use value is equivalent to 17% of the car value, or 10% if the car is more than six years old. In respect of both the maintenance and fuel value, the basis of valuation is 3% of the car value if the latter does not exceed EUR 28,000 and 5% of the car value in any other case. The fringe benefit is equal to the aggregate of these three elements multiplied by a percentage representing the private use of the car. The private use percentage varies depending on the respective car value and may go up to 60%.
The private use element (i.e. the taxable element) of a car cash allowance is 50% of the allowance if the allowance is EUR 2,340 or less, or the cash allowance less EUR 1,170 if the allowance exceeds EUR 2,340.
The said private use element of a vehicle should not be deemed to constitute a fringe benefit when a vehicle, the value of which does not exceed EUR 16,310, is used by a salesperson or a support person who is not a company official, provided that due approval is given by the Commissioner for Tax and Customs.
Amendments to the Fringe Benefit Rules have clarified that vans are included as non-taxable vehicles and that the use of vehicles by messengers and drivers do not constitute a fringe benefit.
#### Category 2 - Use of other assets, including accommodation
Use of immovable property/accommodation involves a chargeable fringe benefit of 5% of the higher of the market value and the original cost of the immovable property. No fringe benefit is deemed to arise in certain situations (e.g. use of an official residence by the holder of public office, temporary accommodation for security purposes). The cost of making the immovable property available for use by the employee (e.g. water, electricity, ground rent, redecoration, repairs and maintenance, professional fees) is also a fringe benefit.
The fringe benefit on the use of other assets (other than immovable property and motor vehicles) stands at 12% of the higher of the market value and the original cost of the asset. The original cost is reduced by 40% in the case of assets that are owned for more than six years. Use of computers, related equipment, and internet connection service is not considered a fringe benefit.
To determine the price of immovable property held under a title of emphyteusis, the price of acquisition should be considered to be the price or premium which may have been paid according to the deed of emphyteusis without the requisite to increase the amount by five times the annual ground rent payable.
Where property is held under a title of emphyteusis by the provider of the benefit or by a related person, the annual value of an immovable property used for private use should be taxed on the higher value between 5% of the market value, the total of 5% of the cost of the property and an amount equivalent to the relative annual ground rent.
Movable property should be taxed at 12% of the higher value between the market value and the cost of the property. The original cost is reduced by 40% in the case of assets that are owned for more than six years. Use of computers, related equipment, and internet connection service is not considered a fringe benefit.
#### Category 3 - Other benefits
The value of other fringe benefits is the actual cost to the employer of providing the fringe benefit or the market value thereof. This category of fringe benefits includes, amongst other items, beneficial loan arrangements, reimbursement of private expenses, discounted goods and services, free or subsidised meals, and gifts. Valuation criteria differ according to the type of benefit, with the possibility of a partial or a full exemption in certain cases.
Certain items are not deemed to constitute a benefit, for instance, exemptions on cost of travel (including relocation costs and costs of the journey between shifts or periods of work) and exemptions for health-related costs (including costs of medical exams, preventive medical care for work-related risks, and work-related counselling).
The benchmark interest rate with reference to beneficial loan arrangements is 6.5% _per annum_.
In the case of share option schemes, a share option becomes taxable when the option is exercised. In this respect, the taxable value of the said share option would be equivalent to the full excess of the price that the shares would realise on the open market, on the date when the benefit is provided, above the price actually paid for those same shares. The taxable value should be taxed separately from the other chargeable income and subject to a flat rate of 15%.
Telephony services, computer equipment, recreational and child-minding facilities, health insurance (subject to some restrictions), certain awards, and certain training courses, among other items, provided to employees are not considered to be fringe benefits.
## Capital gains and investment income
Tax on capital gains is imposed on any gain realised on the transfer of immovable property (real estate), shares and other securities (excluding investments that yield a fixed rate of return), business, goodwill, business permits, copyrights, patents, trade names, trademarks, and any other intellectual property (IP), interests in a partnership, and a beneficial interest in a trust. Gains from the transfer of other assets should fall outside the scope of such tax.
Furthermore, certain transfers are subject to an exemption from income tax on capital gains. The exemption from income tax on capital gains upon certain transfers of shares listed on the Malta Stock Exchange was extended to certain transfers of shares listed on foreign stock exchanges that are recognised by the Commissioner for Tax and Customs (subject to certain conditions).
The rate of tax is the marginal rate of tax applicable to the particular taxpayer. In the case of transfers of Maltese immovable property (or any rights thereon) made on or after 1 January 2015, the withholding tax (WHT) on such transfers should in general be 8% or 10% of the transfer value (the latter rate applying in the case where the property was acquired before 1 January 2004). Certain other rates of WHT may apply in specific circumstances.
Transfers _inter vivos_ of immovable property situated in Malta or any real rights thereon over such property shall be made at the rate of 8% or 10% of the transfer value.
No tax is chargeable on a transfer of certain property by a company to its shareholder or to an individual related to its shareholder in the course of winding up or in the course of a distribution of assets pursuant to a scheme of distribution. This applies where the said shareholder is an individual or one’s spouse who owns, directly or indirectly, not less than 95% of the share capital and voting rights of the said company transferring the property, provided a number of conditions are satisfied.
Subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, transfer of a property to a tenant who had previously leased the same property for a number of years in terms of a scheme administered by the Housing Authority under a scheme administered by the Housing Authority is exempt from final tax on the first EUR 200,000 of the transfer value. In cases where the exemption will not apply, a reduced rate of tax may be applicable.
Capital gains arising outside Malta and derived by a person who is either not domiciled or not ordinarily resident in Malta or who is a returned migrant who qualifies for a reduced rate of income tax are not subject to tax, even if remitted to Malta.
Subject to the applicable statutory requirements, non-residents are exempt from tax on any interest, discount, premium or royalties, and capital gains from specified sources (e.g. disposal of units in collective investment schemes and of shares or securities in companies, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions).
A final WHT system operates under the investment income provisions of the Income Tax Act for certain types of investment income paid by certain payers to specified categories of (Maltese-resident) recipients (_see Payment of tax in the_ _section for more information_).
No tax is levied on investments that yield a fixed rate of return. A tax exemption also applies on the transfer of shares in a company listed on a recognised stock exchange (as of year of assessment 2018, this exemption was widened in scope) other than shares held in certain collective investment schemes.
### Transfers of immovable property in Urban Conservation Areas
Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, transfers of immovable property that are made by 31 December 2025 are exempt from income tax on the first EUR 750,000 of the transfer value if:
  * the property was constructed at least 20 years before the transfer and has been vacant for at least 7 years and is still vacant as at the date of the transfer, or
  * the property is situated in an Urban Conservation Area.


## Dividend income
### Dividends from Maltese companies
Malta operates a full imputation system of taxation of dividends. Through this system, the tax paid at company level is regarded as a prepayment for the tax due by the shareholder upon the eventual distribution of profits. Individual shareholders will, subject to certain conditions, not be subject to further income tax on the receipt of a dividend of taxed profits (or exempt profits which are exempt up to the level of the ultimate shareholder) from a Maltese company. Subject to certain thresholds of income, individual shareholders should be entitled to deduct the tax credit attaching to the dividend against their total income tax liability.
### Dividends from foreign companies
Maltese resident and domiciled individuals are taxed on a worldwide basis of taxation, and therefore dividends from foreign corporations should be subject to income tax in Malta. Maltese resident but not domiciled individuals are subject to income tax in Malta on dividends from foreign corporations only if such dividends are remitted to/ received in Malta.
Dividends are taxed at the standard progressive rates of tax applicable to individuals. Foreign withholding tax suffered should be granted as a credit against the Malta tax liability on the foreign dividend income, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The credit must not exceed the tax liability in Malta on that income.
## Rental income
Any person who owns immovable property that has been restored in accordance with any scheme issued for this purpose by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority and rents out such property may opt to be subject to tax at a final WHT rate of 10% on the gross rental income received in respect of rent for residential purposes and a final WHT of 15% for commercial purposes. Rent also includes ground rent for both urban and rural tenements.
Persons in receipt of rent/ground rent of residential property and of commercial tenements and clubs (in all cases, not necessarily restored property), provided that the commercial tenements and clubs are not being rented to or from a related body of persons (as defined), have the option to apply a final 15% tax on the gross rental income.
Any person who derived rental income from a private residential lease with a duration of a least two years and registers such lease as a long private residential lease with the relevant authority, if they opt to be taxed on such gross rental income at 15%, may also be entitled to a tax rebate. 
Otherwise, the rental income is subject to normal rates of tax, but special tax deduction rules apply. Indeed, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, where the general progressive tax rates apply, interest payable on loans to acquire/improve the property, licence fees, and rents payable may be deducted if incurred in the production of passive rental income.
## Assignments of rights acquired under a promise of sale agreement
Income derived from the assignment of rights acquired under a promise of sale agreement relating to the transfer of an immovable property situated in Malta that is made after 31 December 2020 is subject to a flat tax rate of 15% on the full amount.

## Certain tax exemptions for investment services expatriates and insurance expatriates
Certain tax exemptions are provided to investment services expatriates and insurance expatriates as defined under the Maltese Income Tax Act and subject to the satisfaction of certain statutory conditions (these cannot be taken together with the Highly Qualified Persons Rules). An investment services expatriate and an insurance expatriate may not be subject to Maltese tax in respect of the following income (otherwise liable to tax) relating to expenditures incurred for the benefit of the expatriate or one’s immediate family by the investment service/insurance company for the first ten years of assessment from when the said expatriate becomes liable to Maltese tax. The respective expenses include:
  * Removal costs when relocating to or from Malta.
  * Accommodation expenses incurred in Malta.
  * Travel costs to or from Malta.
  * Provision of a car to be used by the expatriate in Malta.
  * A subvention/cost of living allowance of not more than EUR 600 per month.
  * Medical expenses and medical insurance.
  * School fees for children.


Furthermore, interest, royalties, and capital gains on disposal of units in collective investment schemes and company shares/securities (subject to certain conditions) that are received by such expatriates are exempt from Maltese tax.
An investment services expatriate may also be exempt from payment of Maltese social security contributions, subject to certain conditions.
## Voluntary Occupational Pension Scheme (VOPS) Rules
The VOPS Rules were recently amended to further enhance the fiscal measures already in place to incentivise the occupational pension system in Malta. The VOPS Rules apply to certain types of employers as defined, including self-occupied persons and associations representing employers and self-occupied persons. The fiscal measures introduced by the Rules can be summarised as comprising:
  * An annual tax credit available to the employer amounting to the lower of 25% of the amount of contributions paid and EUR 750 for each employee in respect of whom the contributions are paid.
  * Tax deductibility for the employer on the amount of contributions paid, subject to a capping.
  * An annual tax credit available to employees who voluntarily make additional contributions into the employer’s scheme of 25% of the aggregate amount of the qualifying contributions made during a year, up to a maximum of EUR 750 or such other amount as may be prescribed by the Minister from time to time.
  * Non-taxation for the employee under the Fringe Benefits Rules in respect of contributions made by the employer for the employee’s benefit.
  * For a scheme to qualify under the VOPS Rules, it needs to allow individuals to start withdrawing benefits as from the age of 61 years but not later than the age of 70 years, in line with the objective of sustaining one’s income after retirement.


## Personal Retirement Scheme (PRS) Rules
The PRS Rules are a set of tax measures intended to incentivise contributions to PRSs.
An annual tax credit is available to individuals who make contributions to a PRS of 25% of the aggregate amount of the qualifying contributions made during a year, up to a maximum of EUR 750. Similar to the VOPS, for a scheme to qualify under the PRS Rules, it needs to allow individuals to start withdrawing benefits as from the age of 61 years but not later than the age of 70 years.
## Tax credit to parents of children with a disability
Parents of children with a disability will be entitled to an annual tax credit of EUR 750 _per annum_ for each child (increased from EUR 500) to assist with any private therapy that may be required.
## Tax credit on higher educational qualifications 
Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, an individual under the age of 40 who attains a PhD or a Master’s degree or an equivalent qualification thereto (MQF Level 7 or 8) may be eligible for a tax credit equivalent to the tax chargeable on the income for whole-time employment . If the individual pursues the relevant course of studies on a part-time basis, the tax credit is reduced by 50%.
The Deduction and Tax Credits (Relevant Qualifications for Industry) Rules provide for a tax credit of up to 70% of the study costs paid for a certification, degree, or post-graduate degree, as approved by the Ministry of Education. The tax credit may only be claimed once the relevant qualification is obtained and the Department of Education issues a tax credit certificate. The said tax credit may be claimed against the tax liability on chargeable income by either the parents or the student. If the tax credit is not claimed in full, then the balance may be carried forward to the next years. This tax credit was extended to courses of studies commencing up to 31 December 2025.
By virtue of the Get Qualified Scheme, individuals following a course of studies that commences not later than 31 December 2025 and leads to a certification, diploma, degree, or post-graduate degree course may be entitled to benefit from a tax credit to recover part of the costs incurred. The costs relate to fees paid by the individual to the university, institution, or other entity recognised by the Ministry for Education and Employment for the training and educational services leading to the approved qualification or fees for sitting for examinations required to achieve the approved qualification.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
There are few specific rules relating to residence, ordinary residence, domicile, locality of income, or the remittance of income to Malta. Persons are usually held to be domiciled in a country where they have their permanent home. The locality where income arises is determined in accordance with the category of income concerned, and different criteria may apply to different sources of income. Persons are considered to be ordinarily resident in Malta when they are so resident in the ordinary or regular course of their lives. The remittance of income to Malta is a question of fact.

## Social security contributions
For calendar year 2025, both the employer and the employee are each required to pay social security contributions at the rate of 10% of the individual employee’s salary and at fixed rates of EUR 54.43 per week for annual salaries exceeding EUR 28,303, provided the employee was born on or after 1 January 1962.
For self-occupied / self-employed individuals, social security contributions amount to 15% of the annual net income earned during the previous year. The maximum contribution for persons born on or after 1 January 1962 amounts to EUR 81.64.
All the rates are generally revised upwards at the start of every calendar year.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
Supplies of goods and services in Malta are subject to VAT at the standard rate of 18%, although certain reduced rates apply in respect of specific goods/services.
Taxable persons whose economic activity consists principally in supplies of services and whose annual turnover is not higher than EUR 35,000 may qualify as small enterprises. If so, such persons are not required to charge VAT on their supplies, but they would still have a registration requirement (unless the services provided are exempt without credit supplies).
_See the section in the Corporate tax summary for more information._
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Malta.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There are no inheritance, estate, or gift taxes in Malta.
## Customs and excise duties
Other taxes imposed include customs and excise duties on certain goods. There is also a tax on air travel.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is applicable on certain documents and transfers, including transfers of immovable property and marketable securities (although certain exemptions may apply) and issues and renewals of insurance policies. Furthermore, in the event that the market value of shares held by a person is reduced following a change in the company's issued share capital or voting rights and the value shifts onto the other shareholders, the transferor would be deemed to have transferred the said value to the transferee(s), and such value shifting may be subject to a stamp duty liability (although certain exceptions/exemptions may apply).
In principle, stamp duty is imposed, _inter alia_ , on heirs upon inheritance of immovable property at a rate of 5% and on shares in a Maltese company / interest in a Maltese partnership (not being a 'property company' or 'property partnership') at a rate of 2%. Stamp duty is also imposed on transmissions by death of immovable property situated in Malta and shares in Maltese companies. Certain exemptions from stamp duty may, however, apply in respect of such transmissions. 
No stamp duty shall be charged on the first EUR 250,000 of donations of immovable property from parents to their children for the children’s residential purposes. The duty to be charged on the remaining value shall continue being charged at the reduced rate of 3.5%.
No stamp duty shall be charged on the first EUR 200,000 of the transfer value upon the acquisition of immovable property for their sole residence by first-time buyers, provided that the transfer is made by 31 December 2025.
Subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, transfers of properties that had been leased to a tenant for a number of years under a scheme administered under the Housing Authority are not subject to stamp duty on the first EUR 200,000 of the transfer value. In cases where the exemption will not apply, a reduced rate of stamp duty may apply.
Subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, where a person sells one's residential property so as to acquire another residential property and such person does not own other properties, the duty paid on the first EUR 86,000 of the value of the replacement property shall be refunded. This has been extended to acquisitions made up to 31 December 2025. 
Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, transfers of immovable property that are made by 31 December 2025 are exempt from stamp duty on the first EUR 750,000 of the transfer value if:
  * the property was constructed at least 20 years before the transfer and has been vacant for at least 7 years and is still vacant as at the date of the transfer
  * the property is situated in an Urban Conservation Area, or
  * the property was developed in accordance with the approved criteria, including traditional Maltese features.


The interest on duty on documents on transfers _causa mortis_ amounts to 4% _per annum_ or part thereof, which interest applies as from the lapse of one year from the date of such transfer, until the date when the necessary declaration is filed.
The interest rate on unpaid stamp duty is of 0.33% for every 30 days or part thereof, until the amount due remains unpaid.
Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, no duty is levied in the case of transfers of immovable property upon the devolution of a dwelling house to a surviving spouse/cohabitant, in the case of a transfer of immovable property upon death by a parent or legal guardian to a disabled individual, or in the case of a transfer of a dwelling house upon death by a parent to their descendants in the direct line.
In the case of the transfer by gratuitous title of (i) marketable securities owned by individuals and of (ii) commercial tenements (i.e. business property) that had been used in a family business for a minimum period of three years preceding the transfer, to the transferor’s spouse, descendants, and ascendants in the direct line and their spouses, or in the absence of descendants to such transferor’s siblings and their descendants, stamp duty chargeable is at a reduced rate of 1.5%. This reduced rate applicable to transfers by gratuitous title has been extended to 31 December 2024. Once this reduced rate is applied, no other exemption or duty relief should apply to such transfers.
