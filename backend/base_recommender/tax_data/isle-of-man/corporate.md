## Pillar Two
In November 2024, Tynwald approved the Global Minimum Tax (Pillar Two) Order 2024, which comes into force for in-scope groups (MNE groups with annual revenue of Euro 750 million or more in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Ultimate Parent Entity) in respect of fiscal years commencing on or after 1 January 2025. The Global Minimum Tax (Pillar Two) Order 2024 implements the following in the Island:
A 15% Domestic Top-up Tax (DTUT): This tax has been designed such that it should achieve Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (QDMTT) Safe Harbour status with the OECD.
Multinational Top-up Tax (MTUT): This tax has been designed such that it will be granted Qualified IIR status and applies in respect of low-taxed MNE profits arising outside the Island.

## Taxable period
An accounting period for tax filing purposes can be no more than 12 months.
## Tax returns
All companies are required to submit income tax returns on an accounting-period basis, whether they are liable to tax at 0%, 10%, 20%, or a combination of these rates. The tax return is due for submission one year and one day following the end of an accounting period. Where the financial statements cover more than 12 months, two (or more) returns may be required.
Companies are required to file their income tax returns online.
Fixed rate penalties apply if returns are filed late. The Assessor of Income Tax also has the powers to raise a default assessment where a tax return has not been filed.
## Payment of tax
Payment of tax is due within one year and one day of an accounting period end. Interest is charged on tax paid late.
## Tax audit process
There is no formal regular tax audit process in the Isle of Man. The Assessor of Income Tax can make an enquiry into a return within the time limits set out below.
## Statute of limitations
Generally, the Assessor of Income Tax may make an enquiry into a tax return no later than 12 months from the date that the tax return is delivered to the Assessor.
If, however, the Assessor discovers that income tax has not been assessed that should have been assessed, the Assessor is able to make an assessment of that tax within a period of four years from the end of the relevant accounting period.
The Assessor also has powers to require the production of documents.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The Isle of Man government is focused on delivering openness and transparency across all areas of Isle of Man taxation. The government and the tax authorities work closely with international bodies such as the EU Code of Conduct group and the EU's Economic and Financial Affairs Council to ensure that the Island is fully compliant with international standards in areas such as tax transparency and exchange of information. The Island is already recognised on the OECD White List as being in the top tier of countries for transparency and information exchange.
The Isle of Man is focused on reducing the avoidance of income tax and national insurance contributions of individuals using personal service companies and has introduced legislation to tackle this issue.
There is also more focus on the taxation of dividends paid to shareholders, particularly in relation to whether a payment is a _bona fide_ dividend or disguised remuneration.
In order to comply with commitments made to the European Union, from 1 January 2019, a 'substance' requirement for companies resident in the Isle of Man for tax purposes was introduced. The legislation is targeted at companies that derive income from 'relevant sectors' as defined in the legislation but which do not have any real economic activity and presence in the Isle of Man.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
A company incorporated in the Isle of Man is automatically resident for tax purposes and must therefore file an annual income tax return, whether it pays tax at 0%, 10%, 20%, or a combination of these rates.
A company that is incorporated elsewhere will be considered resident in the Isle of Man if it is 'managed and controlled' in the Isle of Man, and it will be taxed on its worldwide income accordingly. 'Managed and controlled' is generally interpreted as being the place where the board of directors meets, although this is not always conclusive.
In cases where a company is resident in a country with which the Isle of Man has a tax treaty, then a tie-breaker may operate to determine residence.
Note that a company that is incorporated in the Isle of Man will not be resident if it can prove to the satisfaction of the Assessor that:
  * its business is centrally managed and controlled in another country
  * it is resident for tax purposes under the other country's law
  * either it is resident for tax purposes in the other country under a double tax agreement (DTA) in which a tie-breaker clause applies or the highest rate at which any company may be charged to tax on any part of its profits in that other country is 20% or higher, and
  * there is a _bona fide_ commercial reason for its residence status in the other country, which is not motivated by a desire to reduce Isle of Man tax.


## Permanent establishment (PE)
A place of business includes a PE, such as a branch office or shop, factory, workshop, or mine. The definition of a PE is not set out in statute, and, in cases where the company is resident in a country with which the Isle of Man has a DTA, the terms of the agreement will determine the companyâ€™s residence.
## Substance test
For accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019, legislation is in place to ensure that corporate entities satisfy a 'substance test' in the Isle of Man. The legislation is targeted at those companies in the Island that receive income from certain 'relevant activities' identified by the European Union (EU) but that do not have any real economic activity and substantial economic presence in the Island.
All companies with activities and income in a 'relevant sector' in an accounting period will be required to demonstrate that they have adequate substance in the Island. 
Relevant sectors are defined as follows:
  * Banking
  * Insurance
  * Shipping
  * Fund management
  * Finance and leasing
  * Headquarters
  * Distribution and service centres
  * Operation of a holding company
  * Holding intangible property (intellectual property)


To satisfy the adequate substance requirements, a company must demonstrate that it: 
  * is directed and managed in the Island
  * has an adequate number of (qualified) employees proportionate to the level of activity carried on in the Island
  * has adequate expenditure proportionate to the level of activity carried on in the Island
  * has an adequate physical presence in the Island, and 
  * conducts core income-generating activity (CIGA) in the Island.


If a company in a relevant sector does not meet the economic substance requirement in an accounting period, it will be subject to sanctions, including financial penalties, which will be levied in respect of each period in which the company fails to meet the requirements. The level of financial penalty will increase in cases of repeated periods of failure, and the company may ultimately become subject to a winding up order.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
Relief is given in calculating the taxable profit of a company if the expense is incurred in the normal course of the business and is incurred wholly and exclusively for business purposes. However, certain expenses that are deducted in the computation of profits are not allowable for tax purposes. These include depreciation, unpaid but accrued pension and bonus payments, certain lease payments, and customer entertainment costs.
## Depreciation
Depreciation charged in accounts in not allowable for tax purposes. Instead, relief for depreciation is given using 'capital allowances' based on a reducing-balance method. Plant and machinery, tourist premises, industrial buildings, commercial buildings within a designated area, fish processing buildings, and agricultural buildings and works have an initial allowance of 100%. There are restrictions on allowances for expensive motorcars.
Isle of Man government grants are not taken into account in determining the amount of expenditure on which allowances may be given.
Tax depreciation is not required to conform to book depreciation.
Upon disposal, allowances will be reclaimed on the sale proceeds, restricted to cost.
## Goodwill
No relief is given against trading profits for the purchase of goodwill.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses incurred in the three years prior to the commencement of trading, which would have been deductible as a trading expense if incurred after the commencement of trading, are treated as a loss arising in the year trading commenced, and relief for these losses can be claimed, subject to the normal loss-relief rules.
## Interest expenses
Interest paid to lenders subject to Isle of Man tax is allowable in full. Interest paid to lenders not subject to Isle of Man taxation is allowable if it is incurred in the normal course of the business and is wholly and exclusively for business purposes. Only interest charged at a reasonable commercial rate will be allowed as a deduction.
## Bad debt
Relief against trading profits is only available in respect of specific bad debts. General provisions are not allowable.
## Charitable contributions
Broadly, trading companies are able to claim a deduction for donations made to charities, subject to a maximum of IMP 15,000 or 1% of their taxable income, whichever is greater.
## Fines and penalties
No relief is available for any payments made in respect of fines or penalties, whether related to income tax compliance or otherwise.
## Taxes
Business rates, _as detailed under Local income taxes in the section,_ are deductible when calculating net taxable profit.
## Net operating losses
Losses can be carried forward indefinitely against future profits from the same trade.
Trading losses incurred may be carried back against preceding year profits. There are additional rules that apply in the opening years of trade. Terminal losses in the last year of trade can be carried back against profits for the previous three years.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
There is no formal transfer pricing regime in the Isle of Man, and payments made to foreign affiliates, such as royalties, management charges, and service fees, are deductible under normal principles. If, however, the Assessor of Income Tax is of the opinion that the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of any transaction is the avoidance or reduction of tax liability, assessments may be made to counteract that avoidance or reduction.
_For details of WHTs, please see the section._

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
Trading losses and excess capital allowances may be surrendered (subject to certain restrictions) between 75% affiliates resident in the Isle of Man. Similar concessions are available to members of a consortium, but only a fraction of the loss or excess may be set-off, that fraction being equal to the membersâ€™ share in the consortium in the relevant year of assessment.
## Transfer pricing
There is no formal transfer pricing regime in the Isle of Man. If, however, the Assessor of Income Tax is of the opinion that the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of any transaction is the avoidance or reduction of tax liability, assessments may be made to counteract that avoidance or reduction of tax liability.
## Country-by-Country Reporting (CbCR)
The Isle of Man has implemented legislation to enact CbCR. CbCR is one of four minimum standards under the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project that aims to improve transparency between multinational businesses and tax authorities, and to help identify aggressive tax avoidance. The Isle of Man CbCR Regulations set out matters including the definition of certain terms, filing and notification obligations, and the format for CbCR.
Under CbCR, multinational enterprise groups (MNE groups) with consolidated group revenue of 750 million euros (EUR) or more are required to report specified data on their international operations to their tax authority annually. That tax authority will in turn automatically exchange CbCR information to jurisdictions in which the MNE group operates and has an appropriate international agreement to exchange such information. In the Isle of Man, the first reporting fiscal year was that beginning on or after 1 January 2017.
Where there is no CbCR reporting obligation, there is a requirement to notify the Assessor of Income Tax of the name of the entity that is undertaking the reporting and to provide certain other information. This information is required as part of the company's Isle of Man income tax return.
## Thin capitalisation
There is no specific thin capitalisation rule in the Isle of Man.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There is no CFC regime in the Isle of Man.

  * Dividends: WHT is not required. 
  * Loan interest and royalties: WHT is generally not required, but there are certain exceptions that may apply. 
  * Other: The Assessor of Income Tax in the Isle of Man has the power to require WHT, at a rate determined by the Assessor (typically 20%), on payments of taxable income made to a non-resident (e.g. payments made to non-resident sub-contractors).

## Tax treaties
As of 31 December 2024, the Isle of Man had entered into 11 comprehensive DTAs, 13 limited scope DTAs, and 39 tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs) based on the OECD models.
Information has been exchanged with the United States with effect from 30 June 2015 under an agreement to improve international tax compliance and to implement the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA).
The UK and Isle of Man governments have been exchanging additional information with effect from 30 June 2016 under an agreement extending the automatic disclosure of tax information. The agreement is modelled on the requirements of FATCA.
The Isle of Man has also adopted the Common Reporting Standard (CRS), the new global standard for tax information agreements.
## Choice of business entity
There are several different entities through which businesses may operate in the Isle of Man. These include companies, limited liability companies, partnerships, limited partnerships, and protected cell companies.


# Isle of Man
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
The general rules for the calculation of taxable income are the same whether a company is liable to tax at 0%, 10%, 20%, or a combination of these rates.
## Inventory valuation
Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market value. Any method of valuation that accords with sound commercial principles is acceptable for tax purposes, provided it is adopted consistently at the beginning and end of the accounting period and does not conflict with tax law. In practice, inventories are normally valued for tax purposes at the lower of cost or net realisable value. A first in first out (FIFO) basis of determining cost where items cannot be identified is acceptable, but not the base stock method or the last in first out (LIFO) method.
In general, the book and tax methods of inventory valuation must conform.
## Capital gains
There is no capital gains tax in the Isle of Man.
## Dividend income
Dividends are taxed at the standard rate of 0%. Dividends received from Isle of Man companies do not suffer withholding tax (WHT).
## Banking income
Licensed banks are taxed at 10% on income from deposit taking, any related activities, and interest earned from the investment of regulatory reserves only.
Income earned on capital and reserves in excess of the regulatory capital, group funded lending, fiduciary deposits, assurance, insurance, custody, trust, and corporate services is not classified as banking business and is taxed at the 0% rate.
General expenses are allocated against 0% and 10% income streams on a _pro rata_ basis.
The 20% rate applies to income earned by banks from real estate situated in the Isle of Man.
For 2024/25, a new 15% rate will be applied to certain banking business and large retailers. This rate will only apply to those banks and retailers whose profits would otherwise be subject to a top-up tax outside the Isle of Man under the OECDâ€™s Pillar 2 Global Minimum Tax initiative.
## Royalty income
Royalties are taxed at the standard rate of 0%.
## Rental income
Companies with profits arising on rental income in respect of land or property situated in the Isle of Man are charged to income tax at a rate of 20%. This rate applies whether or not the company is resident in the Isle of Man.

# Isle of Man
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
Companies resident in the Isle of Man are taxed on their worldwide income and are required to file an annual income tax return reporting worldwide taxable profits calculated in line with local legislation and practice.
A non-resident company incorporated outside the Isle of Man but having a place of business or a permanent establishment (PE) on the Isle of Man will be taxed on the profit attributable to the Isle of Man establishment.
There are three rates of corporate income tax (CIT).
The 10% rate applies to income from:
  * a banking business carried on in the Isle of Man on the basis of a deposit taking licence issued by the Isle of Man Financial Services Authority, and
  * retail activities (i.e. the sale of goods to consumers through retail premises) carried on in the Isle of Man, but only if that profit exceeds 500,000 Isle of Man pounds (IMP) in the year.


The 20% rate applies to income derived from real estate situated in the Isle of Man.
The 0% rate applies to all other income.
Where an election is made, certain companies subject to Manx income tax at the standard 0% rate can elect to pay tax at the 10% rate.
The general rules for the calculation of taxable income are the same whether a company is liable to tax at 0%, 10%, 20%, or a combination of these rates. Both resident and non-resident companies are taxed on their income at the same rates.
Note that for 2024/25, a new 15% rate will be applied to certain banking business and large retailers. This rate will only apply to those banks and retailers whose profits would otherwise be subject to a top-up tax outside the Isle of Man under the OECDâ€™s Pillar 2 Global Minimum Tax initiative.
Unilateral relief from double taxation in respect of foreign-source income is given by way of tax credit.
## Local income taxes
There are no profit-based taxes levied by local government in the Isle of Man. However, commercial business rates are payable. Premises are assessed and given a â€˜rateable valueâ€™ that forms the basis of the annual rates charge levied.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is a transaction-based tax applied on the domestic supply of most goods and services and is currently charged at a standard rate of 20%. VAT is designed to be a tax borne by the final consumer, and there is a mechanism for businesses to recover VAT incurred in a supply chain, subject to meeting certain conditions.
For VAT purposes, the Isle of Man forms a single territory with the United Kingdom (UK), and the VAT rules are broadly identical. This means that VAT is charged on supplies between Isle of Man and UK businesses as if they were domestic supplies. The Isle of Man has its own tax authority for VAT and other indirect taxes, which works in conjunction with the UK tax authorities.
Some supplies are charged at 0%, including food, books and publications, and public transport, and there is also a 5% rate applied to domestic property repairs, amongst other things. Finally, some supplies are exempt from VAT, including insurance and financial services, betting and gaming, education, and healthcare.
## Customs and excise duties
In addition to VAT, the Isle of Man forms a common jurisdiction for customs and excise duties with the United Kingdom, and, again, the rules are broadly identical. Customs duties are levied on most goods imported from outside the European Union into the Isle of Man, and there are various rates of duty that apply. Excise duties apply to such things as alcohol, tobacco, and fuels, and there are various rates of duty that apply. There is also a levy on commercial passenger flights known as Air Passenger Duty.
## Property taxes
There are no property-related taxes for companies other than (i) income tax payable at a rate of 20% on their profits from the rental or development of land or property situated in the Isle of Man and (ii) business rates _as detailed under Local income taxes in the section_.
## Transfer taxes
There are no capital transfer taxes in the Isle of Man.
## Stamp taxes
There is no stamp duty payable in the Isle of Man.
## Betting duty
There are no other transaction taxes in the Isle of Man other than betting duty on gaming transactions, which is levied at differing rates of up to 15%, depending on the nature of the gaming transaction and whether it is online or land-based.
## Payroll taxes
Employers in the Isle of Man are responsible for deducting tax from an employeeâ€™s remuneration under the Income Tax Instalment Payments (ITIP) scheme. An employer is any person, which includes any individual, company, partnership, or public body, that engages or hires the services of someone and, in return, pays a wage or fixed payment.
The scheme covers everyone who receives remuneration and includes employees, office holders (e.g. directors), and pensioners. Any remuneration is subject to ITIP, and tax should be deducted in accordance with the individualâ€™s tax code.
For the purposes of ITIP, â€˜remunerationâ€™ means any payment of salary, wages, fees, commission, pensions, or annuities and some termination payments.
## National Insurance contributions
In addition to deducting â€˜National Insuranceâ€™ contributions from their employeesâ€™ earnings, employers in the Isle of Man are required to make a â€˜secondaryâ€™ National Insurance contribution in respect of each of their employees, depending on the individualâ€™s circumstances.
The standard rate of secondary contribution is 12.8% on earnings over IMP 145 per week.
