Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
## Foreign tax relief
An individual resident in Denmark is entitled to deduct foreign income taxes paid or accrued on foreign-source income from the Danish tax payable up to a maximum of Danish tax paid on that part of the taxable income that is foreign-source income. Relief according to DTTs may be claimed if their provisions are more favourable.
Unutilised credits are not refundable and cannot be carried back or forward.
## Tax treaties
### Double taxation treaties (DTTs)
To avoid double taxation on income, Denmark has concluded DTTs with a large number of countries. All tax treaties contain rules on tax information exchanges, and specific EU regulations also apply.Double taxation may also occur in relation to inheritance tax. To counteract this situation, Denmark has concluded treaties with the other Scandinavian countries, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and the United States in this respect.Countries with which Denmark currently has DTTs and where the treaty contains a remuneration clause are:
Argentina | Faroe Islands | Latvia | Sweden

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
The employment deduction is raised to a maximum of DKK 55,600 in 2025.
Furthermore, the taxation of share income is eased by raising the threshold for when the higher tax rate of 42% on share income must be paid instead of 27%. In 2025 a 27% tax rate apply on the first DKK 67,500 of share income, and a 42% on share income exceeding DKK 67,500.
For married couples living together at the end of the income year, the thresholds are doubled.
The thresholds are to be raised in 2026 and 2027.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
An individual may be taxed in Denmark as having full tax liability to Denmark, as having limited tax liability to Denmark, or according to special expatriate rules or rules regarding work force hire.
Individuals who are residents in Denmark are subject to full tax liability (i.e. liable to tax on their worldwide income unless the individual is considered to be tax resident in another country according to a double taxation treaty [DTT]).
An individual who is fully tax resident in Denmark will, as a main rule, be taxed according to the ordinary tax scheme by up to 52.07% (55.90% including AM tax, which is also income tax for DTT purposes) in 2025. A number of deductions are applicable; consequently, the effective tax rate is lower in most cases.
An individual not fully tax liable may have limited tax liability to Denmark. Limited tax liability is restricted to income from Danish sources, listed in the Danish Tax at Source Act, Section 2, including:
  * salary for work performed in Denmark paid by or on behalf of an employer with a legal venue in Denmark
  * salary for work performed in Denmark where the stay exceeds 183 days within 12 months
  * certain other types of personal income, including directors fees, pension distributions, and social security benefits
  * remuneration covered by the special rules on hiring out personnel (_see Work force hire scheme below_)
  * income arising from a business enterprise with a permanent establishment (PE)
  * income from property located in Denmark
  * dividends from Danish companies
  * royalty income from Denmark, and
  * remuneration for advisory assistance, under certain circumstances.


An individual with limited tax liability to Denmark will, as a main rule, be taxed by up to 52.07% (55.90%, including AM tax) on income from sources in Denmark in 2025.
## Personal income tax rates
Generally, individuals are subject to national income tax, municipal tax, labour market tax, and church tax (_all described below_).
When assessing the tax under the ordinary scheme, the following types of income apply:
  * Personal income (salary, benefits in kind, self-employment income, pension income, etc.).
  * Capital income (interest income, interest expenses, net taxable capital gain, etc.).
  * Taxable income (personal income added to capital income and adjusted for certain itemised deductions).
  * Share income (dividends, capital gains on shares).
  * Property value (value of property situated in Denmark or abroad).


The different types of income are subject to different taxes and are consequently taxed with different rates. This also means that the value of a deduction differs depending on in which income the deduction can be made.
The tax rates are as follows:
Taxes (2025) | Income basis | Tax rate (%)  
---|---|---  
State taxes:  
Bottom tax | Personal income | 12.01  
Top tax | Personal income | 15.00  
Local taxes:  
Municipal tax (average) | Taxable income | 25.068  
Labour market tax | Personal income | 8.00  
Share tax:  
0 to 67,500 Danish kroner (DKK) | Share income | 27.00  
More than DKK 67,500 | Share income | 42.00  
Note that tax bands and local taxes may be adjusted annually.
Altogether, the marginal tax rate cannot exceed 52.07% (2025). However, labour market tax, share tax, property value tax, and church tax are not comprised by this rule.
Net capital income is taxed at a rate up to 42% (in 2025). Negative net capital income and other allowances may be deducted but not with full effect.
## National taxes
National taxes are categorised as bottom and top tax, due to which personal income becomes subject to progressive taxation.
### Bottom tax
The bottom tax base is represented by the personal income plus positive net capital income. Bottom tax implies a taxation of 12.01% (2025).
### Top tax
The base for top tax for a single person is the personal income plus positive net capital income. Top tax is 15% of the part of the top tax base exceeding DKK 611,800 (2025) after a deduction of 8% labour market tax. 
## Local taxes
### Municipal tax
Local income tax (municipal tax) is calculated on taxable income at a flat rate dependent on the municipality in question. The country average is 25.068% (2025).
## Labour market tax
Labour market tax amounts to 8% of the personal income.
## Share tax
Share income up to DKK 67,500 (2025) (DKK 135,000 for a married couple) is taxed at 27%. Share income in excess of this amount is taxed at 42%.
## Church tax
Church tax is imposed at a flat rate dependent on the municipality in question. The country average for church taxpayers is approximately 0.64% (2025). Church tax is imposed by municipalities and is only charged for members of the Danish State Church (Lutheran). When registering in Denmark, all individuals should explicitly state if they should not be comprised.
## Other income taxes
### Special expatriate scheme
According to the special expatriate tax regime, expatriates who are employed in Denmark and scientists assigned to Denmark may be able to apply for a flat tax rate of 27% on their gross salary for up to 84 months. A number of conditions must be met, including that the guaranteed monthly salary, before deduction of deductible employee pension contributions, must be at least DKK 78,000 (2025) in average in the calendar year. Special rules apply for researchers. The 27% tax rate is calculated on cash salary, employer-provided telephone/Internet, the taxable value of employer-provided company cars, and employer paid taxable health insurance. All other income is taxed in accordance with normal rules. No deductions are allowed against the flat rate taxed income. The employee’s stay in Denmark may be longer; however, after the 84-month period, the employee’s income is taxed at ordinary rates.
As the labour market tax also applies, the combined tax rate is 32.84% each year during the 84-month period.
### Work force hire scheme
The work force hire scheme is a separate Danish limited tax liability. The concept of ‘work force hire’ implies that the employee continues to be formally employed by the employer in the home country but is hired out to a company in Denmark as the host country under terms similar to a normal employment relationship. The company in Denmark is therefore deemed to be the employer for tax purposes to be covered by the work force hire rules. First and foremost, it must be possible to substantiate that the company in Denmark (the deemed employer) is also responsible for the work performed by the employee. Also, work performed as part of the activity of the Danish company may be seen as work force hire due to a recent change of the rules concerning work force hire. Employees who are hired by a Danish company under a work force hire arrangement are taxed in Denmark at a flat rate of 30% of the gross remuneration, etc. No deductions are allowed. Labour market tax should be paid as well. This gives a combined tax rate of 35.6%. The work force hire rules only apply to employees who are not liable to either ordinary limited tax liability or full tax liability in Denmark. Consequently, if their stay in Denmark is expected to exceed six consecutive months or 183 days within any 12-month period, it is not possible to use the work force hire rules. The six-month period is not interrupted by stays abroad due to holiday, etc. However, the period will be interrupted if the stay abroad involves a work assignment.
Note that there is particular focus from the tax authorities on the work force hires rules and compliance in general.


# Denmark
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
## Taxable period
The Danish tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December.
## Tax returns
Provisional taxes are withheld or collected on the basis of an estimated income for the current year. Accordingly, a preliminary income assessment should be filed with the Danish Tax Authorities.
All individuals who are either subject to full or limited tax liability to Denmark are obligated to submit a tax return, including all necessary additional information regarding income, to the Danish Tax Authorities by 1 May or no later than 1 July in the year following the relevant income year. When the final tax return has been reported, the Danish Tax Authorities elaborate a final tax assessment that states whether the individual has an underpayment of tax, excess tax, or neither of the two.
Individuals leaving Denmark have to file a tax return at the normal deadline. Income in the year of departure must be pro-rated in the same way as in the year of arrival.
If an individual is liable to either full or limited tax liability only for part of the calendar year, their income will be annualised. The individual may apply for the use of their actual income during the calendar year instead of annualising the income.
## Reports and withholdings
In general, a reporting obligation is attached to almost any taxable payout. The reporting obligation lies with the authority, company, employer, bank, etc. that makes the payout. For certain kinds of payouts, such as salary, there is also an obligation for the employer to withhold the tax.
In connection with the payout of interests, the financial institution is responsible for reporting the payout but not for withholding the tax. This means that an underpayment of tax will occur for individuals who do not pay the tax immediately or have taken the payout into account in a preliminary tax return.
As for dividends, a tax of 27% must be withheld by the company distributing the dividend.
As for royalties, a withholding tax of 22% must be operated by the payer.
There are no specific withholding requirements regarding private individual’s profits from sales of private property. However, property value tax is part of the preliminary tax return and withheld this way.
Income from foreign sources must be reported in the final tax return by individuals who are tax treaty residents in Denmark.
## Payment of tax
Tax liabilities for a certain income year should be stated in a preliminary income assessment and in this way make it possible to pay taxes during the income year in question. When doing so, all known income and expenses must be taken into account.
Should unexpected income or expenses occur during an income year, the preliminary income assessment can be changed. Alternatively, it is possible to make a voluntary payment of tax.
Ownership of property in other countries than Denmark must also be reported.
When the final tax has been assessed during the year following the income year in question, an underpayment of tax or an excess tax may occur. As a starting point, any underpayment of tax up to an amount of DKK 24,000 (in 2025) will be carried forward to the income year that follows the year in which the tax assessment is made. Exceeding underpayment of tax will be collected in three instalments, with due dates on 1 August, 1 September, and 1 October in the year of the assessment.
Taxes are either withheld and paid at source, paid through giro payment forms, or as a bank transfer.
## Tax audit process
Tax administration in Denmark in general is handled by the Danish Tax Authorities.
The collection of taxes is based partly on the reporting from the taxpayer and partly on the compulsory reporting from employers, banks, and financial institutions, etc.
Each taxpayer is responsible for checking that the correct tax has been paid, and on the homepage of the tax authorities everyone with a Danish civil registration (CPR) number has their own electronic tax file, which provides access to all information (in Danish) about paid taxes, withholdings etc. A code to this file can be requested on the homepage of the tax authorities.
## Statute of limitations
In general, time frames and due dates are defined by law and regulations in Denmark. This means that, as a main rule, limitations regarding tax claims are set in three years after the due date.
The main rule on statute of limitations after three years can be suspended if the tax authorities were not aware of the claim or the debtor.
Criminal acts can be investigated beyond the three years.
Further, generally, there is an ultimate limit of ten years.
## Topics of focus for the tax authorities
Compliance in general has a high focus, and dawn raids are used where combined efforts are used by tax authorities, immigration authorities, and other relevant authorities. There is an increased audit focus on cross-border work/transactions.


# Denmark
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
The complex Danish tax system is reflected in a number of possible deductions. The tax value of a deduction varies depending on in what type of income or in what tax base the deduction can be made. A deduction in personal income has a higher tax value than a deduction in taxable income, as only church tax and municipality tax are calculated on taxable income, whereas personal income is subject to the calculation of top tax where almost no deductions are possible. The actual effect of a deduction will also vary with the level of local taxes.
Deductions that have not been taken into consideration in connection with the preliminary tax return and therefore have not led to a reduction of the monthly withheld tax may lead to a refund of tax when the final tax for an income year is assessed.
Deductions can only be made related to income from sources that are taxable in Denmark, and it is not possible to deduct expenses exceeding the income.
## Employment expenses
In general, an employment allowance is available for any individual engaged in active employment. The allowance amounts to 12.30% of the employment income and cannot exceed DKK 55,600 (in 2025).
Salary earners may deduct travelling expenses from home to work, travelling expenses necessitated by different workplaces, contributions to unemployment insurance, membership fees to professional trade associations, and union subscriptions.
Furthermore, under certain circumstances, salary earners' expenses related to the performance of their work, such as technical literature, work clothes, etc., may be deductible from the taxable income if they exceed a basic amount (DKK 7,300 in 2025).
### Travel to and from work
A deduction is granted for daily travel to and from work, provided the employees are not granted a company car and that the employer does not pay for the transportation. The distance from home to the place of work and back must be more than 24 kilometres. The deduction in 2025 is DKK 2.23 for 25 to 120 kilometres and DKK 1.12 per kilometre exceeding 120. For individuals living in certain outskirts, the allowance is DKK 2.47 per kilometre exceeding 120.
Usage of the Øresund connection (the bridge and tunnel between Denmark and Sweden), or the Storebælts connection (the bridge and tunnel between the Island of Funen and Sealand) also entitles one to an extra mileage allowance. The allowance amount depends on the means of transport.
### Deductions for travel expenses
The right to deduct travel expenses is maximised to DKK 32,800 annually (2025). The maximum applies to both the deduction of standard rate and actual expenses but does not affect an employer’s ability to pay tax-free allowances, reimburse the employees expenses, or provide free food and lodging.
In general, the rules regarding deductions of travel expenses imply that employees in relation to a work-related trip can either get their expenses reimbursed by the employer as a business expense or make deductions when determining taxable income.
Allowances/deductions can either be based on actual documented expenses or on standard rates. In 2025, the standard rates are DKK 597 per day for meals and miscellaneous and DKK 256 per day for lodging.
### Contributions to pension schemes
Contributions to a lifelong annuity pension plan established with a Danish pension fund, an insurance company, or a financial institution are tax-exempt if made by the employer and, within certain limits, tax deductible if made by the individual.
In addition to the tax benefit from the above-mentioned exemption/deduction for contributions, the contributions will also trigger an additional tax deduction in the tax calculation; up to a certain limit. The rate depends on the age of the taxpayer; the closer to the retirement age, the higher the deduction rate.
As a general rule, deductible contributions to a pension plan may not exceed DKK 65,500 (2025) if paid by the individual into a private pension plan, and the same ceiling applies as to contributions paid by the employer (i.e. DKK 65,500 [2025]) unless it is a lifelong annuity plan. However, due to special regulations applicable in connection with later repatriation, the contribution paid by/for an expatriate to a Danish pension plan should be handled carefully.
Contributions to a foreign pension scheme may be tax exempt/tax deductible if certain circumstances are observed or according to certain DTTs.
### Moving costs
Expenses in connection with an assignment may be deductible from ordinary taxable income, provided the expatriate continues to work for the same employer. If an employer reimburses business related moving expenses that are supported by vouchers, the reimbursement is not taxable in some circumstances.
### Service expenses
Certain approved expenses regarding household services may be deducted. The deduction is capped at DKK 12,400 in 2025 per individual. 
For 2025, the deductible value for the use of household services is around 25%.
### Double household
A married assignee whose spouse remains in the home country may be eligible for a double-household deduction if the conditions are met. The deduction amounts to DKK 400 per week or actual expenses with the proper documentation.
## Personal deductions
### Charitable contributions
Donations to certain approved charities, foundations, institutions, etc. are deductible in the determination of taxable income. The maximum deductible amount per year is DKK 19,000 (in 2025), regardless of whether the contributions are spread out among different foundations. The foundation must report the donations made annually to the tax authorities.
### Child benefits
In 2025, a tax-free child benefit of DKK 21,168 _per annum_ is payable to the custodial parent of children aged 0 to 2 (inclusive) if the parent is fully tax liable to Denmark and is not covered by the social security system in the home country. The annual benefit for children aged 3 to 6 is DKK 16,754 and for children aged 7 to 14 is DKK 13,188 and is paid on a quarterly basis. For children aged 15 to 17, the amount is DKK 13,188 per year.
An individual who pays child support maintenance because of divorce is entitled to an annual deduction per child.
### Interest expenses
Interest expenses are deductible from capital income and are generally deducted in the year in which they fall due. Penalty interest paid in connection with late payment of taxes is non-deductible. Deduction of interest expenses covering a period of more than six months and falling due more than six months before the end of that period must be allocated to the period to which the expenses relate.
### Bad debt
In general, losses on debt are not deductible or refundable.
### Association expenses
A taxpayer can deduct expenses incurred for quotas for membership of employer associations, unions (maximum DKK 7,000 per year [2025]), and other professional associations that aim to defend the economic interests of the professional group to which the taxpayer falls. Furthermore, contributions to unemployment insurance schemes and pre-retirement schemes are deductible. Deductions are made in the determination of taxable income. The associations must annually report the payments received from each member to the tax authorities.
### Fines and penalties
Private persons cannot deduct any fines or penalties. If an employer pays fines imposed on employees in carrying out their work, the employer may deduct the amounts, but the payout will be considered taxable income for the employee who cannot deduct the fine.
## Personal allowances
In Denmark, personal allowances take the form of tax credits (_see the_ _section for more information_).
## Losses
The treatment of losses depends on whether the shares are quoted or unquoted. Losses on shares quoted on a regulated stock exchange can be offset against gains (i.e. dividends and capital gains) on other quoted shares within the same year. Any unused losses may be carried forward for an unlimited period of time. If the taxpayer is married, any unused losses can also be offset against the spouse’s gains on quoted shares.
Losses on unquoted shares can be offset against gains (i.e. dividends and capital gains) on both quoted and unquoted shares within the same year. If the total annual share income becomes negative, the tax value of the loss on unquoted shares (27%/42%) may be deducted from the ordinary income taxes of the individual liable to taxation.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
## Employment income
All remuneration from employment, whether in cash or in kind, is subject to tax when the employee has obtained a legal right to the remuneration, regardless of where payment is made and regardless of whether remitted. The liability extends to any living or housing allowance and any reimbursement of tax or other personal liability, whether paid directly to an employee or borne by the employer on the employee’s behalf.
The Danish Parliament has adjusted the rates for taxation of company cars in order to promote environmental and climate 'friendly' cars, which are used as company cars. Accordingly, the thought is that the environmental amount in the coming years will be weighted higher in the total taxation of a company car, while the purchase price must be weighted less.
These adjustments of the rates are gradual and takes place between 2021 and 2025, as illustrated in the below table:
Percentage | Prior 1 July 2021 | 1 July 2021 to 31 December 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2025  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Rate on the car value up to DKK 300,000 | 25 | 24.5 | 24 | 23.5 | 23 | 22.5  
Rate on the car value above DKK 300,000 | 20 | 20.5 | 21 | 21.5 | 22 | 22.5  
Environmental charge | 150 | 250 | 350 | 450 | 600 | 700  
Payments by reimbursement to an employee for expenses for travel, entertainment, or any other service to be performed on behalf of the employer are taxable only to the extent that they are not actually expended in the performance of the service. Special rules apply for free housing provided by the employer. For some work-related benefits in kind, a limit of DKK 7,300 (2025) applies. Further, there are special rules related to tax-free allowances for travel costs and mileage.
Any employee who is given a free telephone from their employer is taxed on DKK 3,300 (2025), regardless of actual usage and saved private expenditures. If spouses are both comprised by this tax, a reduction of the tax is applicable.
## Equity compensation
Share-based payments are, as a starting point, taxed as any other remuneration from employment, with the marginal tax rate at approximately 56%. However, the rules are very complicated and dependent on the specific situation. A beneficial reward scheme has been reintroduced from 1 July 2016.
Further, special rules apply under certain conditions and limitations for 'small start-up businesses', as defined in the legislation.
## Business income
In general, private business owners (i.e. individuals operating a business on their own account and risk) are comprised by the general tax rates, etc. as employees. However, a number of rules and practises only apply to private business owners.
It may be possible for independent business owners to use a special tax scheme, the Business Tax Scheme. This scheme primarily ensures that private business owners get full value when deducting commercial investments (e.g. interest expenses) thereby increasing the possibilities of consolidating and expanding the business by taxing the savings more gently than savings made for private purpose.
To obtain the approval to apply the Business Tax Scheme, a number of formalities regarding bank accounts, withdrawals, and accounting, ensuring that private and corporate funds can be distinguished, must be observed. Basically, the business taxable profit is all taxable income with deduction of all corporate expenses. When using the Business Tax Scheme, the business profit that is not cashed for private use is taxed at 22%, which is equivalent to the corporate tax.
## Capital gains and investment income
Generally speaking, Denmark imposes tax on capital gains arising from the sale of private (non-business) assets. Typical assets not subject to capital gains taxation (if assets are non-business related) are furniture, art, and jewellery.
### Properties
Gains from the sale of a privately owned property, which has served as the primary place of living for the owner (during the period of ownership), will not be subject to capital gain taxation if the property is located on a lot/land that is less than 1,400 square metres in size. This is known as the '_parcelhusregel_ '. If the lot/land is larger than 1,400 square metres, then the realised gain may still be exempted from taxation depending on actual circumstances. A similar rule exists for vacation houses/properties (known as '_sommerhusreglen_ '), although conditions differ somewhat from what applies for ordinary houses/properties.
Taxable capital gains from the sale of other property acquired after 1 January 1999 are taxed either as personal income or capital income. Special transitional rules apply to profits on property acquired before 1 January 1999 and sold in the income year 1999 or later. 
For individuals subject to full tax liability (resident and tax treaty resident in Denmark), foreign properties owned are subject to special exit tax rules. Under these rules, an unrealised gain due to increase in the property value (of a property located outside of Denmark) will be subject to exit tax upon departure from Denmark. Gain is determined based on value of the property upon arrival to Denmark (or date of purchase if bought while already living in Denmark) converted to Danish kroner using the exchange rate on the date of arrival/date of purchase, and then the value of the property in Danish kroner using the exchange rate on the date the Danish tax liability (tax liability as resident subject to taxation on worldwide income) ceases.
### Capital gains and investment income
Taxable gains and investment income are added to the taxable income. Certain allowances are available.
The taxable income of an individual subject to full tax liability (resident and tax treaty resident in Denmark) includes interest, dividends, profits from gains on sale of shares, rents, royalties, professional fees, pensions, annuities, and alimony from all sources, wherever located, subject to any limitation that may be imposed under a tax treaty.
While sale of ordinary shares is taxable based on a realisation principle, a so-called mark-to-market taxation is applied on certain investment funds, ETFs, etc., which implies that each year taxable gain/loss is to be declared even though a sale has not actually occurred. The gain/loss is determined based on the market value at the start of the year compared to the value end of the year (values for start and end of the year will be changed to value upon arrival/departure if moving to/out of Denmark during the year). Value is to be converted to Danish kroner using the exchange rate at start of the year/end of the year, so this will cover both gain due to increase in value of the investment fund, etc. and gain due to currency fluctuations.
A person must declare income/gain/loss along with the filing of a Danish tax return each year, including profit/loss above a threshold of DKK 2,000 concerning bonds, certain other securities, and realised gains due to exchange rate fluctuations on deposits or debt in foreign currency.
Capital gains taxation also applies to capital gains related to transactions of funds between accounts kept in other country of Danish kroner, where a capital gains arises due to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the relevant currency and Danish kroner between the time where the money was originally deposited and the time where the same funds are later withdrawn. In this regard, a first in first out principle is applied. Capital gain determined in this regard is composed by the threshold of DKK 2,000 per year (_see above_). This type of capital gain evaluation is to be made for persons who are considered resident and tax treaty resident in Denmark and will include any withdrawals of funds from accounts with funds in other currency than Danish kroner (possible also for transfers between accounts in the same bank), payments made to reduce mortgage principal, etc.
### Pension
In certain cases, foreign pension plans will not qualify as tax approved under Danish tax rules, and, in that case, the pension plan will be subject to mark-to-market taxation. This applies for individuals subject to full tax liability (resident and tax treaty resident in Denmark).
The gain/loss is determined based on the market value at the start of the year compared to the value at the end of the year (values for start and end of the year will be changed to value upon arrival/departure if moving to/out of Denmark during the year). Value is to be converted to Danish kroner using the exchange rate at the start of the year/end of the year, so this will cover both gain due to increase in value of the pension plan and gain due to currency fluctuations. 
Besides the capital gains taxation, there may also be possible taxation related to contributions made to the foreign pension plan if such are still being made.
## Treatment of intellectual property (IP)
Individuals shall include profit or loss regarding sales of IP in their personal income. This means that profit from sale is subject to ordinary taxation.
Royalties, defined as payment for the right to use any patent, trademark, secret formula, etc., are subject to a fixed tax rate of 22%, which must be withheld by the payer of the royalty. According to many tax treaties, Denmark has either waived right to tax the royalties or accepted a lower tax.

## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
A personal allowance of DKK 51,600 (in 2025) is granted to all individuals over the age of 18. For individuals under the age of 18, the personal allowance is DKK 51,600 (in 2025). The personal allowance leads to a reduction of income tax. Where a spouse cannot utilise the whole personal allowance, the balance is normally transferred to the other spouse. The value of the tax reduction is calculated based on the applicable tax rates.
For individuals who are subject to limited tax liability, the personal allowance is granted only in relation to income such as salaries and pensions, and where the individual is subject to limited tax liability to Denmark during the whole year. If the individual is subject to limited tax liability to Denmark for less than one year, the personal allowance may be chosen based on certain conditions.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
An individual becomes fully tax liable by taking up residence in Denmark or staying in Denmark for more than six consecutive months. Residence in Denmark is deemed to exist if an individual acquires or rents a home in Denmark (or is provided with an employer paid accommodation) and stays in Denmark for other purposes than short stays for vacation purposes or the like. Generally, taxation commences from the date of arrival.
An individual who does not set up residence will become subject to full Danish tax liability from the first day of one’s stay if one stays in Denmark for at least six consecutive months. When determining the six-month period, short stays outside Denmark due to holidays etc. are included, whereas stays abroad due to employment may interrupt the six-month period.

## Social security contributions
The Danish social security system is financed primarily through ordinary tax revenue and only very limited social security contributions for employees and employers.
All individuals working in Denmark and fully tax liable to Denmark and who are covered by Danish social security must also pay labour market supplementary pension (ATP).
Danish social security contributions and in some cases foreign social security contributions are deductible from personal income for tax purposes. The employer is responsible for withholding and paying the contributions on behalf of their employees.
Social security annual rates (2025) | DKK  
---|---  
Employee:  
ATP | 1,188  
Employer:  
ATP | 2,376  
Contribution to maternity fund, estimated | 1,500  
Industrial injuries insurance, estimated * | 5,000  
Other public social security schemes, partly estimated | 5,300  
* Please be informed that the estimated industrial injuries insurance may vary, depending on the field of work that the insured employee is employed within, the number of employees that the employer intends to insure, the specific insurance company, etc.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The Danish VAT rate is 25%.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
From 1997, the wealth tax has been abolished. However, individuals must still fill out asset declarations as to foreign pension schemes and certain investments. 
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Inheritance left by a Danish resident is, in general, subject to Danish estate tax regardless of the country of residence of the beneficiary. Inheritance received by a Danish resident from an individual who was not resident in Denmark prior to death is not subject to Danish estate tax except if the inheritance consists of property located in Denmark or of assets related to a PE in Denmark. However, if an estate is settled before a Danish court, the entire inheritance will become taxable in Denmark, regardless of the country of residence of the deceased and the heirs. Estate tax amounts to 15% and is levied on the part of the assets that falls to the deceased’s children and descendants, stepchildren and their descendants, parents, or cohabitant during the last two years of one’s life. Inheritance and insurance payments that fall to the deceased’s spouse are exempt from estate tax. Inheritance received by any other relatives than the above-mentioned is subject to a supplementary estate tax of 25% of the value of the asset after deduction of the first 15%. The taxes are not levied on the first DKK 346,000 (in 2025) of the estate.
Gifts and donations not exceeding DKK 76,900 (in 2025) to the donor’s descendants are tax exempt. Gifts to the descendant’s spouses may not exceed DKK 26,900 (in 2025) to be tax exempt. Gifts and donations to the donor’s offspring and their descendants in excess of DKK 76,900 are levied with a gift tax amounting to 15%, and gifts to the donor’s stepparents and grand stepparents are levied with a gift tax of 36.25%. Gifts or inheritance between unrelated individuals are taxable as ordinary income if the recipient is fully tax liable to Denmark. A gift is not deductible for the donor.
## Property taxes
### Property value tax
Property owners are obligated to pay property value tax. Property value tax annually amounts to 0.51% of the value of a property up to DKK 9,200,000 and 1.4% of the value exceeding DKK 9,200,000. 
Property value tax is charged on both Danish properties and properties situated in another country. Properties that are rented out are not subject to property value tax, regardless of where the property is situated. Instead, the net profit from the rental business is taxable.
### Property and land taxes
As a property owner, one is liable to pay two types of property tax: property tax and land tax. Property taxes are calculated as a percentage (tax rate) of the latest public property assessment. However, before the taxes are calculated, a deduction of 20% is granted. A so-called precautionary principle has been adopted, which considers the uncertainty that will always be presented when a property is assessed. 
The land tax is paid through your preliminary income assessment and your tax assessment notice. 
## Luxury and excise taxes
In Denmark, numerous excise taxes and duties apply on goods (e.g. light balls, sugar, liquor, tobacco). The taxes/duties are indirectly paid by the consumer through the prices of the goods and are thereby withheld and paid to the authorities by the entity selling the goods. A number of these taxes are expected to be reduced or abolished in the coming years.
## Stamp taxes
In general, stamp duty primarily occurs in connection with registration of rights regarding property and land.
Furthermore, insurance documents are liable to stamp duty if the risk is situated in Denmark.
## Taxes/duties regarding cars
When a motor vehicle is registered in Denmark for the first time, a registration duty must be paid. The motor vehicle cannot get a license plate before the duty has been paid.
The rates in 2025 for passenger cars are 25% of the value up to DKK 72,900, 85% of the value from DKK 72,900 up to DKK 226,500, and 150% of the value in excess.
If the stay in Denmark is anticipated to be temporary, other rules may be applied.
There is also an environmental addition to the taxable value of company cars. The addition consists of the annual motor vehicle tax, which is a quarterly fixed tax to be paid on all cars. The environmental addition provides a further incentive for the employee to choose a fuel-efficient company car, as the motor vehicle tax is based on the car’s fuel consumption.
## Custom duties
Goods for private use can be imported duty-free to Denmark from another European Union (EU) country. Denmark complies with the EU guidelines regarding the amounts of cigarettes, liquor, wine, and beer to be looked upon as serving private use.
Furthermore, import of personal possessions when arriving from a non-EU country may be exempted from customs duties, excises, and VAT, provided a number of conditions are fulfilled.
According to the rules in the Danish Customs Act, an individual is obligated to inform the tax authorities if Denmark is entered or left with cash amounts, traveller’s cheques, or the like with a value exceeding 10,000 euros (EUR).
The Danish tax authorities must also be notified of foreign bank accounts and deposits. Information on foreign life, pension schemes, and investments must also be submitted. Special forms must be filed.
## Tax regarding growth of a pension scheme (PAL tax)
In Denmark, individuals are taxed of the growth of their pension schemes. The tax rate is fixed at 15.3%. It is possible for individuals moving abroad to apply for exemption from this tax.
PAL tax is collected by the insurance company or pension fund, etc. that is obligated to withhold and pay the tax on behalf of the owner of the plan.
## Exit tax
Exit taxation applies for individuals who have been considered as resident and tax treaty resident in Denmark, who are leaving Denmark with assets, including but not limited to shares, options, bonds, certain pension plans, certain property investments, etc.
In case an individual's ties to another country during one's time in Denmark has been to a country with which Denmark does not have a DTT, then the exit tax rules may apply if the individual has been considered resident in Denmark according to internal Danish rules.
Specific exit tax rules apply for each type of asset. However, exit tax for individuals leaving with shares, bonds, claims, and financial contracts only applies if the individual has been subject to full Danish taxation (resident or resident and tax treaty resident) for at least seven out of the past ten years at the date of departure (date on which resident taxation ceases).
The rules apply to both Danish and foreign assets, shares, investment funds, financial contracts, deposit accounts, etc.
If comprised by the exit tax rules, the assets, etc. comprised will be considered as realised on the date of departure, and the individual will be liable to pay the Danish tax due on this unrealised gain (this is so-called exit tax, '_fraflytterskat_ ' in Danish). It may be possible to file for postponement of payment of the exit tax, provided a number of conditions are met and recurring obligations fulfilled. The possible postponement agreement will be different depending on the assets/investment type in question.
