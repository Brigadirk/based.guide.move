## Taxable period
The tax year in Slovenia is the calendar year.
## Tax returns and payment
### Annual tax return
Employment income, income from business activity, income from agriculture and forestry, transfer of property rights, and other income must be included in the annual tax return. In addition, all compulsory contributions and advance tax payments made during the tax year must also be reported.
The Slovene tax authority issues a preliminary tax calculation by end of March or end of May for the previous tax year. A taxpayer may file an objection against the preliminary tax calculation within 30 days after its dispatch. If the taxpayer does not object to the preliminary tax calculation within the prescribed deadline, the preliminary tax calculation is considered as annual PIT assessment. If a taxpayer does not receive a preliminary tax calculation by 15 June for the previous tax year, the taxpayer has to submit an annual tax return by 31 July for the previous tax year.
The difference between the total tax payable and the total amount of advance tax payments made during the year must be paid or refunded within 30 days after receipt of the tax assessment.
### Income from capital
Income from capital (i.e. dividends, interest, capital gain) and rental income is taxed separately and is not included in the annual tax return.
Income from interest and dividends received from abroad has to be declared by 28 February for the previous calendar year. The income tax paid is considered as final tax.
Income from interest on monetary deposits with banks or savings banks registered in Slovenia or the European Union should be declared by 28 February for the previous calendar year if the total interest exceeds EUR 1,000. The income tax paid is considered as final tax.
Income from capital gains has to be declared by 28 February for the previous calendar year. Capital gain derived from disposal of real estate shall be declared within 15 days from disposal of real estate. The income tax paid is considered as final tax.
Rental income should be declared by 28 February for the previous calendar year. The income tax paid is considered as final tax.
### Income from business activity
The tax return for income from business activities should be submitted by 31 March for the previous calendar year.
### Income from agriculture and forestry
The tax return for income from agriculture and forestry should be submitted by 31 March for the previous calendar year.

## Tax treatment of payments to seconded employees
There is a reduction of the tax base for PIT for employees that are on a secondment in a foreign country, as follows:
  * In the case of an uninterrupted secondment of up to 30 days (up to 90 days for drivers in international traffic), the reimbursements for food are excluded from the tax base up to the amount that applies to temporary absence (e.g. subsistence allowance). When considering secondments that last beyond 30 days (90 days for drivers in international traffic), the mentioned costs are not included in the taxable base in the amount of reimbursement for food during work, increased for 80%.
  * Reimbursements for the costs of travel are not included in the taxable base, whereas the reimbursements of the costs of travel to and from the workplace, in the foreign country, are not included in the taxable base in the amount that applies to the transport to work and from work. Reimbursements of costs of travel to and from the place of secondment at the start or at the end of the secondment are not taxed in the amount and under the conditions that apply to temporary duty.
  * Reimbursements of costs for accommodation are not included in the taxable base in the amount of actual costs, given that the uninterrupted secondment is no longer than 90 days.


Moreover, seconded workers are entitled to a special tax base, which does not include 20% of the salary or maximum EUR 1,000 in a single month, under the following conditions:
  * The employee is on a secondment in a foreign country or Slovenia.
  * The secondment lasts more than 30 days without interruptions.
  * The distance from the usual place of residence to the place of work is more than 200 km, considering the shortest road connection.
  * The contract of employment sets down the salary of the employee on a secondment in the amount of at least 1.5 times the last known average wage of the employees in Republic of Slovenia.
  * The employee on the secondment was not a tax resident of the country of secondment in the last five years before the secondment.


The mentioned exclusion is temporary and can only apply to income that has been paid out in a maximum of 60 months in the time period of ten years from the first secondment.
## Taxation of the business performance payment
The changes to the PIT Act are bringing a more beneficial taxation of the business performance payment. The business performance payment is excluded from the taxable base in the amount of one average monthly wage of the employees in Slovenia. It can be paid in cash as well as benefits-in-kind (e.g. company shares). 
Such a treatment is possible if the right for business performance payment to all entitled employees is specified in the employer’s general act or the collective bargaining agreement.
