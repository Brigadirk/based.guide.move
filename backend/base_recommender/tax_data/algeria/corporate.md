Last reviewed - 31 May 2024
## New tax measures introduced by Finance Law (FL) 2024
### Abolishment of the Tax on Professional Activity (TPA)
In order to reduce the tax burden for economic operators, the TPA has been definitively removed from the Algerian tax system.
### Introduction of Local Solidarity Tax (LST)
The LST is a new tax that replaces the TPA. The new tax is deemed on monthly turnover for specific activities, notably: 
  * pipeline transport of hydrocarbons (set at the rate of 3%), and
  * mining activities (set at the rate of 1.5%).


The taxation rules are similar to those of the TPA.
### Tax measures to improve purchasing power
Value-added tax (VAT) exemptions apply until 31 December 2024 to the following operations:
  * The import and sale of certain widely consumed products intended for human consumption, including peas, chickpeas, beans, lentil, broad beans, rice, and others. The detailed list of products covered by this temporary exemption is set forth in article 65 of FL2024.
  * Sales of locally produced fruit, fresh vegetables, eggs, broiler chicken, and turkey.


### Extension of VAT exemption period for new technologies
The VAT exemption has been extended until 31 December 2026 for Internet-related services and fees, notably: 
  * Fees and royalties relating to fixed Internet access services, as well as expenses relating to the leasing of bandwidth intended exclusively for the provision of fixed Internet service.
  * Fees associated with hosting web servers in data centres located in Algeria and in .DZ (dot dz).
  * Website design and development fees.
  * Fees related to maintenance and support relating to website access and hosting activities in Algeria.


This measure aims at reducing communication costs and promoting information and communication technology development.
### Taxation of recoverable waste at reduced VAT rate
Waste recovery for recycling is encouraged by extending the application of the reduced rate of VAT, set at 9% on the sale of the recoverable waste to the following materials: wastepaper, rubber, end-of-life tires, used motor, gearbox and lubrication oils, edible oils and fats, and lead-acid batteries, when the latter are intended for recovery.
### Taxpayers reporting obligations
#### Introduction of a penalty for failure to file the annual return of salaries and other paid emoluments (Gn°29)
Failure to file or late submission of the annual statement of salaries and other emoluments paid (Gn°29) now entails the application of a penalty set at the rate of 5% of the annual wage. 
It should be noted that extending of the deadline for filing the annual corporate income tax (CIT) return (Gn°4) does not automatically extend the deadline for filing the Gn°29 return. In this respect, therefore, the deadline is set on 30 April of each year, with no possibility to postpone under the current tax regulation.
#### Clarification on the reporting and payment obligations relating to the withholding tax (WHT) on profits distributed to legal entities
Article 11 of FL2024 introduces article 154 into the Direct Tax Code (DTC), specifying that debtors distributing income from transferable securities must pay the 5% WHT at the time of payment, following reporting obligations and penalties outlined in articles 121 and 122.
### Tax audits
#### Amendment of the rules governing tax audits
Articles 44 and 45 of FL2024 bring forth enhanced provisions, ensuring increased guarantees for taxpayers undergoing accounting audits, selective audits, or in-depth audits of the overall tax situation (VASFE), as follow:
  * Extended preparation time: 
    * Accounting audits and selective audits: Minimum preparation time increased from 10 to 20 days.
    * VASFE: Minimum preparation time extended from 15 to 30 days.
  * Access to taxpayer's charter: 
    * The audited taxpayer for each type of audit now has the ability to consult their charter on the Directorate General of Taxes (DGI) website.


  * VASFE audit notice requirements:


    * Full disclosure on the audit notice, including names and ranks of auditors, the audit period, and relevant taxes.
    * Mandatory written notification to the audited taxpayer regarding any changes in auditors during the VASFE audit.


#### Possibility of seeking expert assistance for tax audits
In the ongoing drive against fraud, tax evasion, and intricate tax planning, tax authorities now harness the expertise of external specialists during tax audit missions, to navigate nuanced challenges in sectors such as hydrocarbon, mining, pharmaceuticals, and financial services.
This progressive step comes with a pivotal requirement: designated experts must uphold professional secrecy, mirroring the confidentiality obligations incumbent upon the tax administration's internal agents, as stipulated in article 65 of the Tax Procedures Code (TPC).
### Collection
#### Payment schedule: Reduction in the initial instalment
In order to reduce the impact on the cash flow of taxpayers wishing to sign up to a payment schedule, FL2024 provides for a reduction in the minimum initial payment of the tax liability from 10% to 5% when the commitment is signed with the head of the tax collection department.
### Registration duties
#### Reorganisation of transfer duties applicable to certain lease contracts
Article 28 of FL2024 supplements the provisions of article 222 of the Registration Code (RC), making the following deeds subject to a fixed duty of 4,000 Algerian dinars (DZD):
  * Rental of premises for professional or commercial use under an _’Ijara Mountahia Bitamlik_ ‘ or leasing contract.
  * Rental of equipment.


In addition, the previous wording of article 222 of the RC had provided for the payment of a 2% duty on lease contracts.
The purpose of fixing this fee at DZD 4,000 is to encourage operators to use this type of financing.
### Financial markets
#### Exemption for income and capital gains from the financial and bond markets
As part of the development of financial and bond market activities, Article 67 of FL2024 extends the exemptions provided for by Article 44 of FL 2019, in terms of personal income tax (PIT), CIT and registration duties, for a period of five years, until 31 December 2029.
PIT and CIT exemptions apply to the following operations:
  * Income from shares and similar securities listed on a stock exchange or bonds and similar securities with a maturity of five years or more listed on a stock exchange or traded on an organised market, as well as income from shares or units in undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities.
  * Income and capital gains from the sale of bonds, similar securities, and similar treasury bonds listed on a stock exchange or traded on an organised market with a minimum maturity of five years issued within a period of five years.
  * Bank term deposits for a period of five years or more.


Furthermore, transactions involving securities listed on a stock exchange or traded on an organised market are exempt from registration duties.
#### Reduction in CIT rate when share capital is listed on the stock market
To encourage companies listing their capital on the stock exchange, Article 68 of FL2024 provides for the renewal for a period of three years, from 1 January 2024, of the reduction in CIT proportionally to the rate of opening of share capital on the stock exchange.
### Islamic finance
#### Exclusion of certain incomes from CITable base
To encourage the growth of Takaful insurance operations, FL2024 introduced adjustments to the tax legislation, notably by amending article 147 Ter of the DTC, aimed at establishing tax neutrality and equitable tax treatment similar to that applied to conventional insurance operations. 
More specifically, the proposal is to exclude from the CITable base income from the mandatory investment of pooled funds in Sharia-compliant financial instruments under Takaful insurance when dedicated to charitable acts under the supervision of the National Sharia Authority for the Islamic Finance Industry.
#### Exemption for Retakaful transactions
Article 34 of FL2024 extends the VAT exemption for reinsurance operations to those relating to Retakaful contracts.
### Tobacco industry
#### Complementary Tax on tobacco company’s profits revised upwards
Article 10 of FL2024 amended article 150 bis of the DTC, relating to the Complementary Tax applied to profits made by tobacco manufacturers. 
The changes include an increase in the tax rate applied through the introduction of the concept of integration rate and the definition of integration. 
Indeed, integration is defined as the industrial process of manufacturing a final product by incorporating locally produced raw materials and components.
For this purpose, depending on the integration rate of each company, the Complementary Tax is set at: 
  * 16% when the integration rate is equal to or more than 40%.
  * 20% when the integration rate is less than 40%.


However, for newly licensed tobacco manufacturers, the tax rate to be applied is set at 16% for a period of three years from the date of starting the business, irrespective of their integration rate. 
It is also specified that the methods for calculating the integration rate will be set by a decree from the Ministry of Finance. 
#### Increase in the Additional Tax on Tobacco Products (ATTP)
Article 72 of FL2024 provides for an increase in the rate applied to tobacco products from DZD 37 to DZD 50, which represents a 35% increase in the ATTP per pack or box. This measure is justified by the low tax pressure applied to tobacco products in Algeria compared with other countries. 
#### Solidarity contribution 
To encourage tobacco manufacturers to source their products from the domestic market, and thus limit their reliance on imports, article 86 of FL2024 provides for an increase in the rate of the solidarity contribution from 2% to 5%, applicable to raw materials and inputs used in the manufacture of tobacco products.
#### Transport of tobacco leaves
The amendment to Article 271 of the Indirect Taxes Code (ITC) provided for in Article 42 of FL 2024 entails that companies processing tobacco leaves will now have to obtain an acquired security deposit for the transportation of these products, except for direct movements from the plantation to the dryer and then to the warehouse.
This measure aims to strengthen the traceability of tobacco leaves, giving tax authorities a better overview of these movements for more effective tax control.
### Measures related to state’s private domain
#### Introduction of a rental royalty for land concessions intended for commercial housing promotion projects
As a reminder, AFL for 2023 had introduced a rental royalty payable over a 33-year period for real estate concessions granted as part of investment projects.
Article 82 of FL2024 also provides for the introduction of a similar scheme applicable to commercial housing promotion projects. The latter involves the payment of an annual rental fee, set by the relevant local real estate authority, corresponding to 1/20 of the market value of the conceded land.
It should be emphasised that the concession in question can be converted into a transfer under the conditions specified in this article as soon as the project has been completed and the certificate of conformity obtained in accordance with the regulations in force, and with the agreement of the granting body.
In addition, the concession guarantees that the promoter will obtain a building permit. It also enables the promoter to take out a hypothec with credit institutions on the real estate rights resulting from the concession.
In addition, article 83 of FL2024 provides that performing concession deeds for land intended for the construction of these projects gives rise to the payment of a state remuneration according to the following rates:
  * 1% calculated on the cumulative amount of annual rental royalties corresponding to the time allotted to the property promoter to complete the project when this amount is less than or equal to DZD 500,000.
  * 75% when the amount of these royalties exceeds DZD 500,000.


Lastly, article 78 of FL2024 also stipulates that performing concession deeds is subject to registration duties and land registration tax at the following rates:
  * 2% registration fee calculated on the cumulative amount of annual royalty fees corresponding to the time allotted to the property promoter to complete the project.
  * 5% for land registration tax calculated on the same basis as above.


#### Introduction of electronic payment at the state private domain and land registry offices
As part of the strategy to modernise the administration of the national domain, FL2024 (Article 85) introduced the possibility of paying state, land, and cadastral fees and taxes electronically.
#### Benefit from the payment schedule for state royalties
It should be recalled that the provisions of Article 87 of FL2018 had provided for the possibility for domain collectors to grant a payment schedule for the collection of various domanial debts or any other due amounts for the settlement of the price of transfer of land or real estate.
This schedule is granted for a maximum period of 36 months, after the initial minimum payment of 10% of the amount of the state-owned claim.
The new wording introduced by Article 86 of FL2024 provides that the initial payment requirement of 10% of the amount of the claim does not apply in case of royalties payable in respect of the use of agricultural land.
### Customs measures
#### Completing customs formalities electronically
As part of the government's ongoing modernisation and development of public administration, article 80 of FL2024 amending and supplementing article 91 Ter of the Customs Code provides that customs declarations will henceforth be made electronically, except in special circumstances.
The same article states that customs procedures will be carried out based on digital documents, that the declarant is required to keep the original documents making up the file for the period stipulated by law (i.e. 15 years), and that these must be presented at the request of any customs department.
Finally, it is important to note that electronic declarations have the same legal effects as manual declarations. 
#### Declaration of the amounts of money held on entering or leaving the country.
Article 81 of FL2024 amends the provisions of article 198 bis of the Customs Code, to require travellers entering or leaving the country to declare in writing to the customs authorities sums denominated in national or foreign currencies when they exceed the threshold set by laws and regulations. The model for this declaration will be published by order of the Minister of Finance.
It should be noted that prior to FL2024, the obligation to declare was limited solely to the holding of an amount denominated in foreign currency exceeding the regulated threshold. The finance law therefore extends the scope of this obligation to include amounts denominated in domestic currency.
#### Authorisation for customs clearance of engines for the propulsion of boats less than five years old
With the aim of relaunching fishing and aquaculture activities through the rehabilitation of the national fleet, article 92 of FL2024 authorises customs clearance for the release for consumption, in used condition, of engines used to propel boats less than five years old, under certain tariff subheadings, for the benefit of owners and/or operators of fishing and aquaculture vessels.
#### Lower customs duties on inputs used in the manufacture of spectacle frames
Article 93 of FL2024 also provides for a reduction in customs duties on inputs used to manufacture spectacle frames. This provision applies to:
  * Cellulose acetate sheets for the design of spectacle frames, classified under tariff subheading 3920.73.30.00, for which the customs duty is reduced from 15% to 5%.
  * Parts and accessories for spectacles, under tariff heading 9003.90, for which the customs duty is reduced from 30% to 15%.


This measure is designed to encourage the development of the spectacle frame manufacturing industry.
#### Import of inputs for aquaculture farming activities
As a reminder, FL2022 provided for imports of inputs required for livestock farming to be subject to the reduced 5% customs duty rate and the reduced 9% VAT rate. 
In this same context, article 90 of the current FL2024 provides that the benefit of this provision will henceforth be conditional on the presentation, at customs clearance, of a certificate issued by the services of the Ministry responsible for fisheries.
#### Imports of crude soya oil
Article 91 of FL2024 extends the deadline for importing crude soya oil free of customs duties and VAT to 31 December 2024. As a reminder, this deadline was set by Article 18 of the Amending Finance law for 2023 (which supplemented and amended Article 148 of FL2022 on 31 December 2023 (i.e. a further year extension).
The new wording of Article 148 of FL2022 requires crude oil importers/processors to begin the production process for this raw material by 31 December 2024, at the latest, or to acquire it on the domestic market. Should they fail to begin the production process, the operators in question will lose the benefit of the compensation and customs and tax exemptions provided for in Article 148.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 31 May 2024
## Taxable period
The taxable period is the fiscal year, which corresponds generally to the calendar year. For periodic activity, the fiscal year could be different from the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Companies are required to file an annual tax return before 30 April of the following year, together with a detailed statement of proceeds paid to third parties with respect to subcontracted services, hiring of personnel and equipment, leases, and technical assistance services, as well as transfer pricing documentation. Monthly tax returns, which include VAT, TPA, CIT instalments, WHTs, PIT, and payroll taxes, should be filed within 20 days of the following month.
## Payment of tax
CIT is paid before May 20 and after the tax return is submitted after offsetting the corporate income instalments already paid before the CIT liquidation. Three CIT instalments are due on 20 March, 20 June, and 20 November, each equal to 30% of the CIT of the previous year.
## Tax audit process
As a general rule, the tax administration informs the company when a tax audit has to be performed. The tax audit notification indicates the audited taxes (in all cases: CIT/TPA/VAT) and the concerned period. The company can be assisted by an expert, and it can ask the tax administration about several issues subject to audit. The tax audit is concluded by sending a final tax reassessment notification.
Some discounts or moderations can be granted to a debtor that is usually punctual in meeting its tax obligations and honouring its debts. For this purpose, taxpayers may, if indigent or hinders introduce a release request to the tax administration, seek remission or moderation of direct taxes properly established. A payment schedule may be granted to a company or to an individual in order to honour, progressively, their liabilities.
Taxpayers may also apply for some reconsideration by the tax administration. The following alternatives are available:
  * Applications for reconsideration by the tax administration (_recours gracieux_). The application may refer to direct and assimilated taxes, related penalties, recovery penalties, and fiscal fines.
  * Conditional rebate (_remise conditionnelle_). Conditional rebate could relate to penalties and fiscal fines. It may concern tax penalties applied under direct taxes, turnover taxes, registration fees, stamp duties, indirect taxes, and non-codified taxes.
  * In order to enjoy these arrangements, the taxpayer must make a written application to the competent authority to which the conditional rebate is requested.


## Statute of limitations
Subject to some exceptions, the fiscal statute of limitations is four years.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The tax administration will focus on non-deductible expenses, the declaration of turnover, and, more often, on transfer pricing issues.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 31 May 2024
According to the provisions of Article 137 of the Algerian Tax Code, a company is considered as an Algerian tax resident entity in cases where it is incorporated under the Algerian law and is realising (i) commercial, industrial, or agricultural activities (physical presence obligation) or (ii) taxable profits through dependent agents. However, please note the existence of the PE concept, which can also refer to permanent place of business.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The Algerian legislation introduces the PE concept in Article 137 of the Algerian Tax Code, relating to territoriality rules of CIT. This Article provides that CIT is due in Algeria on a resident or non-resident person if it:
  * Habitually conducts a trade, industry, or agricultural business in the country in the absence of a PE within the meaning of conventional tax provisions.
  * Derives profits through an agent in Algeria.
  * Conducts operations in Algeria representing a complete commercial cycle.
  * Derives profit generated by operations relating to the property they own in Algeria.
  * Derives profits for which the right to tax is attributed to Algeria by virtue of a tax treaty.


When a company carries on its activity both in Algeria and abroad, its profit is, unless the contrary is proven by separate accounts, presumed to be made in Algeria in proportion to the production operations, or failing that, to the sales made in that territory.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 31 May 2024
## Depreciation and amortisation
The depreciation rates are determined according to common usage and the accounting rules, for example:
  * The depreciation rate for office items is 10% or 20%.
  * The depreciation rate for industrial buildings is 5%.
  * The depreciation rate for cars is 20% or 25%. The depreciation base for cars is limited to DZD 3 million.


According to the new provisions of FL2023, it is expected that fixed asset depreciation periods and rates will be determined by an order from the Ministry of Finance.
## Low-value fixed assets
Starting from 2022, low-value fixed assets are deductible up to DZD 60,000.
## Goodwill
Under the SCF, goodwill is registered in the local books as a non-current/intangible asset of the balance sheet and can be amortised over a period of 20 years. Therefore, the depreciation of goodwill recorded according to the Algerian accounting standards is deductible from the CIT base with no limitation.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses are deductible when paid and cannot be capitalised and depreciated.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are deductible when paid.
## Bad debt
A bad debt provision becomes deductible when legal action has been taken to recover the debt or when evidence is provided that the receivable has become irrecoverable.
## Charitable contributions and subsidies
Granted subsidies and contributions for charitable organisations are deductible for CIT calculation purposes up to DZD 4 million/fiscal year.
## Advertising gifts 
Advertising gifts are deductible up to DZD 1,000 /unit, up to the limit of DZD 500,000. 
## Pension expenses
Pension expenses are deductible when paid.
## Payments to directors
Payments to directors are deductible.
## Research and development (R&D) expenses
For expenses incurred within the framework of R&D, as well as those incurred within the framework of ’open innovation programs‘, that are carried out by companies with the ’start-up‘ or ’incubator‘ label, the rate of deductibility is set at 30% of the taxable profit, capped at DZD 200 million.
## Bribes, kickbacks, and illegal payments
Bribes, kickbacks, and illegal payments are non-deductible from the CIT basis.
## Legal fines and penalties
Legal fines and penalties are non-deductible from the CIT basis.
## Contractual penalties
Penalties paid as part of contractual provisions are deductible for CIT calculation purposes, provided that the beneficiary of penalties is a taxable entity in Algeria.
## Taxes
Taxes duly paid are deductible, except for the CIT itself, which is not deductible. Also non-deductible for CIT purposes are the tax on apprenticeship and training and tax on passenger cars.
## Net operating losses
Carryforward losses are permitted until the fourth fiscal year following the year of loss. Carryback losses are not permitted.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments to foreign affiliates are deductible when effectively paid.


# Algeria
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 31 May 2024
When an Algerian company holds 90% or more of the shares of one or more Algerian companies, the group may choose to be taxed as a single entity. Hence, CIT is payable only by the parent company. Under this system, the profits and losses of all controlled subsidiaries in Algeria are consolidated. The consolidated group may also benefit from other tax advantages, such as exemption from VAT and TPA on the inter-group transactions.
## Transfer pricing
An arm’s-length approach to transfer pricing applies. Companies that are members of groups of companies, including those operating in the hydrocarbons sector governed by the legislation relating to hydrocarbons, as well as foreign companies operating in Algeria temporarily, within the contractual framework of the real regime, must submit their transfer pricing documentation along with their annual tax returns (before 30 April of each year). Failing this, a penalty of DZD 2 million applies if the documentation to support transfer pricing practices is not provided by the deadline date and within 30 days after a first request is made by the Algerian tax administration. Moreover, tax authorities are entitled to apply a 25% penalty on the deemed transferred profits.
Please note that, since 2017, related companies should keep management accounts in order to justify their transfer pricing policies, which should be provided upon tax administration request. Moreover, since 2018, related companies are required to present the consolidated accounts, upon request of the tax administration, if these entities keep consolidated accounts.
As of 2019, companies obligated to submit transfer pricing documentation are required, upon a tax audit, to provide the auditors with additional documents in order to enable them to assess the reality of controlled transactions.
## Thin capitalisation
Article 2 of the FL 2019 provides a new provision that limits the deduction of financial interest paid to shareholders within the frame of their business relationships with the Algerian company.
As a reminder, Article 141 of the Direct Tax Code (CIDTA) provides full deductibility of interests on loans paid to shareholders concerning trading operations. However, the use of this type of financing allows companies to deduct interests on debt that may be artificial, or even to deduct interests instead of capital increases.
In this context, the new provision provides the deductibility of these charges to the average effective interest rates communicated by Bank of Algeria, with a double condition that the capital has to be fully paid-up and the sums available to the company should not exceed 50% of the capital. This measure is inspired by the so-called 'thin capitalisation measures' under Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action 4.
According to this provision, the financial interests paid to the shareholders of the company established in Algeria are deductible from the CIT base. However, they remain within the limit of the amount that could have been obtained by applying the average rate communicated by Bank of Algeria. This measure makes it possible to avoid over-indebtedness of the company and negatively impacting the taxable income of the company.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no CFC rules in Algeria.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 31 May 2024
Branch tax is levied at the rate of 15%. Note that, since 2010, it is no longer possible to register a legal branch in Algeria. However, under certain conditions, a foreign company could operate in Algeria by registering its contract with the local tax authorities by registering a tax branch/PE. Under this scenario, a 15% tax rate applies on the deemed distribution of profits after tax, which may be reduced or removed by the applicable DTT provisions.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 31 May 2024
## Rebates granted to resident companies

## Investment incentives
Tax incentives can be granted to new investors, subject to the application of a specific request with the Algerian Agency for Investment Promotion (AAPI). The tax incentives can be granted for the investment phase and for the exploitation phase. They can be granted for a period of three years or ten years, depending on the kind and the size of the business.
Other incentives can be granted for start-up businesses under CIT, TPA, customs duties, and VAT to encourage youth investment.
Many tax regimes and tax holidays/incentives are available to attract foreign direct investors in Algeria. For example, there is a temporary exemption from CIT of ten years for investing companies in specific zones or those creating 500 jobs or more. VAT and custom duties exemptions are also available during the investment phase.
There is also a ten-years temporary exemption from CIT for companies making decisive investment that have potential for creating jobs and wealth.
There is a five-year reduction of CIT for companies whose securities are introduced on the stock exchange.
## Foreign tax credit
Algerian tax law does not provide for unilateral tax relief. A DTT, however, may provide for bilateral relief.


# Algeria
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 31 May 2024
_As explained in the section_ , the WHT levied on services is 30%, which covers CIT, TPA, and VAT (i.e. three taxes in one). The calculation base is the gross amount of the services invoiced. In principle, it could be reduced or removed by a DTT.
The WHT levied on dividends (15% for both residents and non-residents) and the 10% WHT levied on interest can be reduced in the presence of a DTT.
In accordance with Article 46 of FL 2022, distributed profits between Algerian resident entities that have been previously subject to CIT undergo a 5% WHT.
The WHT levied on royalties is 30%. In the presence of a DTT, the WHT cannot exceed 5%, 10%, or 12%, depending on different cases.

Notes
  1. Equipment rental may be considered as royalties, or remuneration of services entering in the scope of industrial and commercial benefits, or other remuneration. Royalties paid for the use of industrial equipment in the frame of an international leasing contract is subject to a tax allowance of 60% applied based on such WHT. Thus, the effective tax rate of WHT will be 12% = 30% * (1 - 60%). For software, a reduction of 30% is applicable, making the effective tax rate 21%. VAT should be self-assessed in this case.
  2. Domestic rate applies. There is no reduction under the treaty.
  3. 5% if the beneficial owner is a company that directly or indirectly holds at least 10% of the capital of the company paying the dividends. 15% in all other cases.
  4. 10% if the beneficial owner is resident in Algeria and interests sourced from France and 12% if the beneficial owner is resident in France and interests sourced from Algeria.
  5. 5% for royalties paid for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic, or scientific work, including cinematographic films, or films, tapes, and other means of image or sound reproduction.

## Exchange controls
A non-resident foreign company can open a non-resident account in local currency (i.e. dinars), called an ‘INR account’, based on the contract to be performed and on its registration to tax. An INR account can be used only for the object (purpose) for which it is opened.
A non-resident foreign company can also open a CEDAC (_Compte Etranger en Dinars Algériens_ _Convertible_) account, which must be credited only from abroad in foreign currency.
The CEDAC account allows payment in dinars as well as in hard currency. Furthermore, there is no restriction or limitation for transferring any remaining sum in the CEDAC account back abroad in foreign currency or for drawing any foreign payment instrument. The exchange rate that will be used for converting Algerian dinar to foreign currency is the official rate at the date of the debit.
Please note that a non-resident foreign company will not be able to transfer any balances from INR accounts to its CEDAC account or abroad without the express authorisation of the central bank, except in case of reimbursing temporary funding from the CEDAC account as part of a cash call (such reimbursement must be for the exact same amount).
Please note that trading companies cannot pay any dividends to their foreign shareholders.
## Choice of business entity
Foreign companies can run a business in Algeria through various forms of legal entities (e.g. joint stock company [SPA], limited liability company, partnership company), a joint venture or consortium, or PE. As for legal entities, the foreign companies should comply with the local shareholding requirement for importation for resale activities and strategic activities. Indeed, the foreign company cannot hold more than 49% of joint venture share-capital performing importation for resale activities and strategic activities in Algeria.

Last reviewed - 31 May 2024
Taxable income is determined using the accounting profits and adding back non-deductible expenses and deducting the allowable non-taxable incomes.
## Inventory valuation
The inventory valuation method for tax purposes must match the accounting method as defined by the Algerian Financial Standards (SCF).
## Capital gains
Capital gains realised on the sale of assets are taxed as ordinary income when realised by a company subject to CIT. For certain assets, 30% relief is given where the assets have been held for up to three years, and 65% relief is given where the movable assets have been held longer. Capital gains on the disposal of assets can be exempted if the company commits to re-invest them within a three-year period.
## Dividend income
Dividends to non-resident shareholders are subject to WHT at source of 15%, which may be reduced or neutralised by an applicable DTT. Starting with fiscal year (FY) 2018, dividends to resident shareholders (natural persons) are subject to a WHT at source of 15% (previously 10%).
In accordance with Article 46 of FL 2022, distributed profits between Algerian resident entities that have been previously subject to CIT undergo a 5% WHT.
Bear in mind that the received profits are not included in the taxable base for CIT calculation purposes.
## Interest income

Rental income paid to non-residents is subject to 30% WHT, except for international lease agreements, where a reduction of 60% on the taxable basis is applicable, making the effective tax rate 9.60%. However, since January 2017, international lease agreements having benefited from the 60% taxable base reduction are subject to the Algerian VAT set at the rate of 19%, which must be reverse charged by the local payer.
## Royalty income
In accordance with the domestic tax law, royalties are subject to 30% WHT. A reduction of 30% on the taxable basis is applicable for royalties paid for the use of software, making the effective tax rate 21%.

Note that royalties on software having benefited from the 30% taxable base reduction, as well as royalties paid based on the DTT provisions (reduced rates as part of the DTT preferential regime), are subject to the Algerian VAT set at the rate of 19%, which must be reverse charged by the local payer.
## Unrealised gains/losses
Realised gains and losses are subject to CIT. However, unrealised gains and losses are not subject to CIT. There are specific provisions relating to the free re-evaluation of assets.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 31 May 2024
Corporate entities are taxed on activities performed in Algeria via the following two regimes:
## Standard tax regime
### Resident companies
The standard tax regime is applicable for all tax resident companies, which are taxed in Algeria on their worldwide income. The standard tax regime includes the following taxes:
  * Corporate income tax (CIT) is set at the rate of: 
    * 19% for manufacturing activities.
    * 23% for building activities, public works, and hydraulics, as well as tourist and thermal activities, excluding travel agencies.
    * 26% for all other activities not mentioned above.
For mixed activities involving the application of several CIT rates, the taxable profits under each rate are determined according to the turnover portion declared or taxed for each activity.Note that there is a 10% reduced rate for reinvested profits in the frame of manufacturing activities.Nil corporate annual tax returns include the payment of a minimum CIT amounting to DZD 10,000.
  * Tax on professional activity (TPA) has been definitively removed from the Algerian tax regime. A new Local Solidarity Tax (LST) has been introduced levied on certain activities in order to offset the reduction in tax revenues collected by local authorities issuing from the suppression of TPA.
  * LST is deemed on the monthly turnover, excluding VAT, realised by economic operators carrying out one of the following activities: pipeline transport of hydrocarbons (set at the rate of 3%) and mining activities whose profits are subject to PIT or CIT (set at the rate of 1.5%).


_See the section for a description of rebates granted for certain activities_.
### Non-resident companies
In the absence of a double tax treaty (DTT), the basic principle that governs taxation of non-resident entities is that such entities are taxable in Algeria on their Algerian-source income whatever the way and wherever the location the work is carried out, provided only that the same are rendered or used in Algeria.
As a consequence, an entity will be liable for CIT via the WHT regime (_see below_) in Algeria through the execution of a related contract (services contract) to be performed in Algeria. From an Algerian point of view, such a contract is not an investment and is, by nature, temporary. Note that it is possible to execute several contracts under the same permanent establishment (PE).
In the presence of a DTT, a foreign company will be taxed in Algeria if it has a PE only. In this respect, in case the services would not trigger a PE in Algeria, the services will be subject to VAT under the reverse-charge mechanism, to be paid by the service importer.
Article 34 of FL 2022, amending and supplementing the provisions of Article 137 of the Algerian Tax Code, brings forth the clarification of the territoriality concept of CIT by including in the CIT scope the profits made by foreign companies in Algeria and whose right of taxation is attributed to Algeria under DTTs signed by Algeria. These consist of:
  * Profits made through a PE within the meaning of the tax treaty provisions.
  * Profits, products, and incomes related to transactions involving property owned by these companies in Algeria, even on an occasional basis.
  * Any other profit for which the right to tax is attributed to Algeria under a tax treaty.


## Withholding tax (WHT) regime
Non-resident entities performing service contracts in Algeria are subject to the WHT regime. The 30% WHT, which encompasses the CIT, the TAP, and the VAT, is required to be levied on services only. The calculation base is the gross amount of the services invoiced.
Please note that, since 2017, contracts that had been taxed under the WHT are also subject to the Algerian VAT when its basis of calculation benefited from a reduction in the rate or rebates as provided for by the local tax legislation or the DTTs (i.e. software licence contracts, international lease agreements, etc.).
## Local income taxes
There are no local or provincial taxes on income in Algeria. LST is being distributed for each district/location where there is a principal or secondary establishment.

For this purpose, an additional provisional safeguard right (_Droit Additionnel Provisiore de_ _Sauvergarde_ or DAPS) has been set up on a limited list of imported goods. DAPS rates range from 30% to 200%.
For 2022, a new list of 2,608 goods subject to DAPS has been released.
Specific customs exemptions and temporary admission regimes are granted to the oil and gas sector and to investments under the incentives tax regime of the National Agency of Investment (ANDI in French).

## Pollution tax
Assets that may cause environmental damage are subject to a pollution tax.
