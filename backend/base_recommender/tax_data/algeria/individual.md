## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 31 May 2024
## Taxable period
The taxable period is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
The individual tax return has to be deposited before 30 April (for the FY20 annual tax return and as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, the deadline has been postponed to 30 June 2021). Withheld income tax has to be declared with 20 days following the month of income payment.
## Payment of tax
Income tax in the framework of the individual tax return is paid upon receipt of tax notification. The withheld income tax is paid when depositing the monthly tax return.
## Tax audit process
As a general rule, the tax administration informs the individual that a tax audit has to be performed. The tax audit notification indicates the audited taxes (in all cases: Individual income taxes/VAT) and the concerned period. The individual has some rights. Indeed, one can be assisted by an expert, and one can ask the tax administration about several issues subject to audit. The tax audit is concluded by sending a final tax reassessment notification.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations is four years.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 31 May 2024

## Employment income
Employment income is taxable at a marginal rate of 35%.
Monthly salaries not exceeding DZD 30,000 are exempt from PIT.
## Equity compensation
Equity compensation is taxable at a marginal rate of 35%.
## Business income
Business income is taxable at a marginal rate of 35%.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are taxed at 15% for residents and 20% for non-residents.
## Dividend income
Dividends are taxed at 15% for both residents and non-residents.
## Interest income
Interest is taxed at 10%.
## Rental income
Based on the new taxation regime (effective starting from 1 January 2023), rental gross income not exceeding DZD 1,800,000 will be subject to a discharging withholding tax (WHT) of:
  * 7% on income stemming from the rental of residential properties.
  * 15% on income stemming from the rental of unfurnished commercial or professional properties (also applicable to contracts concluded with companies).
  * 15% on income stemming from rental of bare lands. This rate will be reduced to 10% in case of agricultural lands.


Where the annual income exceeds the DZD 1,800,000 threshold, a provisional taxation of 7% will apply on the income irrespective of the nature of the property. 
Such payment could be then deducted from the final taxation of the individual annual income. In this case, the individual will be required to file to the annual PIT return on which provisional taxation will be deducted as a tax credit from the PIT due amount as determined on the basis of the total annual income.
## Exempt income
Starting from 1 January 2021, there is a PIT exemption for special living conditions of residence and isolation at up to 70% of the basic salary.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 31 May 2024
According to the Algerian tax legislation, the following are considered as having tax domicile in Algeria:
  * People having a dwelling as an owner, a usufructuary, or who rent a house for a duration of at least one year, even if the rental is made by the employer.
  * People who have their principal place of stay or the centre of their principal interests in Algeria. The criteria to determine the place of stay is its duration. This means that if a person spends more than 183 days in Algeria, over a period of one year, one will be considered as an Algerian tax resident (even if one is not a national), and one’s income (earned in Algeria and in other foreign countries) will be subject to tax in Algeria.
  * People performing a professional activity in Algeria, whether salaried or not.
