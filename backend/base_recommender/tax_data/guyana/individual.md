## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 14 October 2024
## Foreign tax relief
A credit is available for foreign taxes paid on income from an office, employment, or profits. The total credit granted may not exceed the total tax payable by a taxpayer in any year of assessment. For the purposes of computing the tax payable on total income, no deduction is allowed for foreign tax paid. Any foreign income chargeable to Guyana tax on a remittance basis is grossed up to include foreign tax paid.
Double tax relief as provided in an applicable treaty is also available where an individual derives income from a country with which Guyana has concluded a DTT.

Income is defined under the Act as any gains or profits from any trade, business, profession, or vocation for whatever period of time it may have been carried on or exercised in Guyana.
## Personal income tax rates
Resident individuals (i.e. present in Guyana for at least 183 days in the calendar year) will be entitled to a personal allowance of GYD 1,200,000 or 1/3 of their income (_per annum_), whichever is greater.
Individuals with chargeable income of less than GYD 2,400,000 _per annum_ pay tax at the rate of 28%; where their chargeable income exceeds GYD 2,400,000 _per annum_ , the incremental rate of tax applicable is 40%.

Individuals are generally selected randomly for audit, and the frequency is usually every three years. Persons are generally required to provide financial information and supporting documentation to the tax personnel.

Visas are issued under the following five categories and are valid for multiple periods of three months, up to a maximum of three years:

## Work permits
A foreign national seeking employment in Guyana is required to apply for a work permit. Guyana's work permit policy is informal due to the small population.

It may waive some of the normal procedures, such as advertising in the local paper, when it is known that the desired skills are not readily available.
A work permit is good for the duration of an expatriate's contract, up to a maximum of three years.
## Residence permits
Most residence permits are valid for one year, but permits may be obtained that are valid for up to three years. Residence permits are renewable, and the renewed permit may be valid for a maximum of three years.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 14 October 2024
An individual is deemed to be resident in Guyana where the individual resides in the country for more than 183 days in any year, resides permanently, or, being in Guyana, intends to reside there permanently. An individual will be regarded as ordinarily resident in Guyana if the individual is habitually resident in Guyana (i.e. resident in Guyana in the normal course of things).
For Guyana tax purposes, a personâ€™s domicile is the country that is regarded as one's permanent home. An individual acquires a domicile at birth from one or both of one's parents, depending on the circumstances of one's birth, and one will generally retain this domicile unless there is clear evidence that the individual had an intention to change it and acted on this intention.

The gain is calculated by deducting from the sales proceeds the cost of the asset.

Gains on assets disposed of within 12 months of acquisition are generally taxed as income.
