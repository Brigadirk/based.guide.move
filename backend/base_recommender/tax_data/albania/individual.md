## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
## Foreign tax relief
If during a tax year the resident taxpayer of the PIT realises tax income from sources outside the territory of the Republic of Albania, the tax to be paid by that taxpayer for this income must be deducted from the amount of the tax paid in a foreign country on this income. The deducted amount of foreign tax paid cannot exceed the amount of PIT that would be payable for this income if it had been realised in the territory of the Republic of Albania.
The foreign tax credit must be calculated separately for each country if the income is realised from foreign sources in more than one country.
The foreign tax credit must be calculated separately for the income included in the annual tax base and for the annual investment income.
Income tax can be credited based on the DTTs in force, up to the level of income tax rate applicable in Albania.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
Individual taxpayers, both residents and non-residents, are subject to personal income tax (PIT). Albanian law applies the principle of worldwide taxation. Resident individuals are taxed on all sources of income in and outside the territory of Albania, while non-resident individuals are taxed on income generated only in the territory of Albania.
## Personal income tax rates
Taxable income of the individual (subject to PIT) is composed of three categories: 
  * Income from employment.
  * Business income.
  * Income from investments.


### Income from employment
The following tax rates apply to income generated from employment:
Monthly personal income from employment (ALL) | Taxable income per month (ALL) | PIT rate  
---|---|---  
From | To | From | To  
0 | 50,000 | 0 | 50,000 | 0%  
50,001 |  60,000 | 0 | 35,000 | 0%  
35,001 | 60,000 | 13% of the amount exceeding ALL 35,000  
60,001 |  Above | 0 | 30,000 | 0%  
30,001 | 200,000 | 13% of the amount exceeding ALL 30,000  
200,001 | Above | ALL 22,100 + 23% of the amount exceeding ALL 200,000  
From 1 January 2025, taxable income from employment is taxed at the following progressive rates:
Annual tax base (ALL) | PIT rate (%)  
---|---  
0 to 2,040,000 | 13  
Over 2,040,000 | 23  
### Business income
Net taxable income (taxable profit) from business for commercial individuals and the self-employed is taxed at the following progressive rates:
Annual tax base (ALL) | PIT rate (%)  
---|---  
0 to 14 million | *15  
Over 14 million | 23  
*Note that, for commercial individuals and the self-employed (as well as entities) with an annual gross income up to ALL 14 million, the PIT rate will be 0%, applicable until 31 December 2029. 
Natural persons, individual traders, or self-employed individuals with an annual turnover of up to ALL 10 million have the right to choose a special regime that allows for an automatic deduction of the business expenses up to a specific percentage, depending on their business activity. Once chosen, this regime cannot be changed for three consecutive years.

Investment income is taxed at the following rates:
  * Income from dividends: 8%.
  * Any other item of investment income: 15%.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
## Taxable period
Albania’s tax year is the calendar year (i.e. 1 January to 31 December).
## Tax returns
Tax resident individuals in Albania who generate income sourced not only in Albania but also from other countries and non-residents who generate income sourced in Albania are required to submit an annual income declaration to the central tax administration. 
A tax resident individual is obliged to submit an annual PIT return when:
  * one’s annual taxable income is more than ALL 1,200,000 per year from all sources
  * one is in an employment relationship with more than one employer, regardless of the amount of income one receives from the employers, or
  * one has more than ALL 50,000 of any other type of income, not subject to final withholding tax, as per the provisions of this law.


Individuals are required to submit an annual income declaration at the central tax administration not later than 31 March of the year following the tax period for which the declaration is made.
Every natural person (self-employed or trader individual) who carries out economic activity is obliged to submit the annual tax return for business income within the deadline above.
## Payment of tax
Employers are required to withhold PIT for salaries and other compensations related to current employment.
Whereas the declaration is made on an annual basis, the taxpayer has the obligation to pay the respective tax to the tax authorities by the 20th day of the month following the month when the income was received.
The tax paid during the year will be deducted from the amount of tax calculated. In the event that the individual declaration results in tax liability, the individual should make the payment of the tax due not later than 31 March of the year following the tax period for which the declaration is made.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
Taxable income of the individual (subject to PIT) is composed of three categories: 
  * Income from employment.
  * Business income.
  * Income from investments.


Income is taxable regardless of whether it is paid in cash or in kind. Income in kind is assessed at the market value, as far as it is not defined otherwise in this law or in the by-laws issued in its implementation. 
_See the section for applicable PIT rates_.
## Capital gains
Capital gains on the sale of shares are taxable at rate of 15%. The taxable base is the difference between the sale price and the purchase price of the shares (or the nominal value).
The transfer of ownership of real estate, either land or buildings, is subject to 15% tax on the capital gain realised from the sale transaction.
## Partnership income
Partnerships are treated as separate taxable persons, which mean that an individual participating in more than one partnership should report separately for each of the partnerships they participate in.
## Exempt income
The following incomes are exempt when determining taxable income for PIT purposes:
  * Lump-sum allowances for business travel, according to the amounts determined by the fiscal legislation.
  * Income received from social and health insurance schemes.

## Social security contributions
Social security contributions are imposed on employment income.
Employees pay social security contributions at the rate of 11.2%. The employee contributions are composed of 9.5% social insurance contribution and 1.7% health insurance contribution. Employers are liable to pay social security contributions for their employees at the rate of 16.7%. The employer contribution is made up of 15% social insurance contribution and 1.7% health insurance contribution.
The social security contributions are withheld and paid by the employer.
The submission of monthly payrolls and tax returns, including the declaration and payment of PIT and social and health contribution, must be done electronically within the 20th day of the consecutive month.
The self-employed, the self-employed in a partnership, and the self-employed that hire third parties (excluding self-employed in agriculture) are liable to pay for themselves a mandatory social and health contribution made up of social insurance contribution of no less than 23% of the monthly minimum salary of ALL 40,000 and health insurance contribution of 3.4% on no less than the double minimum salary, i.e. ALL 80,000.
For purposes of social and health contributions, a company’s shareholders who also have administrative roles in the company are considered to be employees. The company is required to calculate and pay social and health contributions for such individuals at the same rates applicable for all other employees.
In case an employee is employed in two entities, they pay social insurance contributions in both entities but not more than the maximum social insurance contribution salary. In case the employee pays social insurance contributions on the maximum salary in one entity, then the salary received by the second entity will not be subject to social insurance contributions. In case both salaries do not exceed the maximum salary for social insurance contributions, then the contributions will be paid in full by the entity paying the highest salary and only for the difference with the maximum salary from the second entity. Regarding health insurance contributions, they arise on the gross salaries of the individual, without limitations. 
The law states that all registered entities should electronically submit to the tax authorities a declaration for every newly hired staff 24 hours before the employment start date and a declaration for every employee leaving the entity within ten days after the employment relationship ends. In addition, entities are required to electronically submit a list of their existing employees.

## Property taxes
Real estate tax on buildings is calculated based on the type of activity the business entity owning the building carries out. The basis for this tax is the value of the building.
Tax due is calculated on a yearly basis as a percentage of the value of the building, depending on the use of the latter, as outlined below:
  * Residential property: 0.05% of property value.
  * Commercial properties: 0.2% of property value.
