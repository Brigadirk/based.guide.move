## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year is the calendar year. 
## Tax returns
The final CIT return is due by 31 March of the year following the tax year.
## Payment of tax
Predetermined advance payments of CIT are due either by the 15th day of each month or by the end of each quarter.
According to the tax laws, CIT is paid during the year on a prepayment basis. The amount of monthly CIT prepayments is determined as follows:
  * For each of the following months: January, February, and March of the following fiscal period, the income tax amount of the fiscal period two years prior to the current period, divided by 12. 
  * For each of the next nine months of the following fiscal period, the income tax amount of the previous fiscal period divided by 12. 


The final due date for the payment of the final CIT for a fiscal year is 31 March of the following year. Note that this payment is calculated as the total amount of CIT self-assessed from the taxpayer for that particular fiscal year less total CIT instalments paid related to that year.
Penalties for non-compliance with CIT prepayment deadlines are 10% of the unpaid liability.
Companies have the obligation to pay the non-resident WHT on dividends to the tax authorities no later than 20 August of the year the financial results are approved, regardless of the fact of whether the dividend has been distributed or not to the shareholders.
## Tax audit process
Generally, the Albanian tax system is based on self-assessment, which is under continuous audit by the tax authorities. Such audits include all types of taxes that the business is subject to. If any discrepancies result from the tax audit, the tax authorities issue an assessment notice, which the taxpayer might appeal within 30 calendar days.
Taxpayers may submit a corrected declaration within 36 months from the submission of the initial declaration, provided that this declaration has not been previously inspected by the tax authorities.
## Statute of limitations
With regard to Albania's tax administration practices, the statute of limitations of a tax audit is five years. However, the statute of limitations can be extended by 30 calendar days in cases where:
  * a new assessment is made as a result of an appeal against a previous tax assessment 
  * a tax assessment is made as a result of a tax audit or investigation of the taxpayer by the tax administration, or 
  * the taxpayer is subject to a penal case related to one's tax liabilities. 


The right of the taxpayer to submit a reimbursement request is limited to five years from the moment that the credit position is confirmed.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
During a tax audit, the main focus of the tax authorities is on areas related to transfer pricing, which is becoming an increasing area of focus; WHT; and aspects affecting CIT, such as expense deductibility.
## Tax Certificates
If a taxpayer’s financial statements and tax declarations are certified as compliant with the tax legislation by certified auditing companies, the tax administration will include this as a parameter in the taxpayer risk analysis for tax inspection purposes.


# Albania
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
Based on Albanian legislation, a legal entity is deemed to be resident in Albania if it has its head office or its place of effective management in Albania.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
PE in Albania means a fixed place of business where an entity carries out, wholly or partly, its business activities, including, but not limited to, an administration office, a branch, a factory, a workshop, a mine, and a construction or installation site, as well as the performing of services (including consulting services) through the employees or other individuals for a period of six months or more in the Republic of Albania.
An entity that operates in the insurance field of another country, excluding reinsurance activity, will be considered to have a PE in the Republic of Albania if through another person collects premiums in the Republic of Albania or insures risks located in the Republic of Albania.
The determination of a PE, where applicable, is based on the provisions of the double tax treaties (DTTs) that Albania has entered into with a number of countries. When dealing with DTT provisions, the Albanian tax authorities refer to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) commentaries.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025

## Depreciation and amortisation
Allowed tax depreciation and amortisation rates and methods for each category of fixed assets are shown below:
Asset category | Method | Rate (%)  
---|---|---  
Buildings and machinery and other fixed structures installed in the building | Straight-line basis | 5  
Computers, software products, and information systems | Straight-line basis | 25  
Other assets | Straight-line basis |  20  
Intangible assets (including goodwill and start-up expenses) | Straight-line basis | 15  
Notes
  * In cases where the net book value of the asset (in the beginning of the fiscal period) is less than ALL 10,000, the taxpayer may expense it entirely.
  * The depreciation base is equal to the cost of acquisition or creation of the asset plus the cost of reconstruction of assets of the corresponding category during the tax year.
  * The depreciation basis for staff cars having a capacity up to 1+4 passengers cannot be higher than 50% of the purchase and reconstruction costs, including VAT. The cost of the 1+4 car, which is depreciated by 50%, cannot be higher than ALL 10 million.
  * Land, fine art, antiques, and jewelleries are non-depreciable assets.

Depreciation and amortisation of fixed assets at amounts higher than those allowed for tax purposes is considered a non-deductible expense.

## Interest expenses
Interest paid in excess of the average 12-month credit interest rate applied in the banking system, as determined by the Bank of Albania, is a non-deductible expense. 
Additional to the above, any interest expenses that take at least 30% or more of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) are recognised as non-deductible for CIT purposes. Interest for which the deduction is denied is carried forward for the next five years.

## Bad debt
Bad debts are only deductible if the following conditions are met simultaneously:
  * An amount corresponding with the bad debt was included earlier in income.
  * The bad debt is removed from the taxpayer’s accounting books.
  * All possible legal action to recover the debt has been taken.

This applies to all entities except those operating in the financial sector.

## Charitable contributions
There are no provisions in Albania regarding the tax treatment of charitable contributions. In general, contributions are considered as non-deductible expenses for CIT purposes.

## Fines and penalties
Fines and other tax-related sanctions are non-deductible expenses.

  * Expenses for salaries, bonuses, and other forms of personal income related to labour relations, paid to employees, including administrators, and not made through the banking system or electronic money institutions licensed by the Bank of Albania.


  * Amounts paid in cash in excess of the limits determined by the provisions of the law on tax procedures in the Republic of Albania (i.e. ALL 150,000).


  * Life and health insurance expenses of the taxpayer's employees that exceed 5% of their gross salaries for the tax year.


  * Expenses for contributions made by the employer on behalf of its employees to a private pension plan, exceeding the minimum yearly salary.


  * Expenses related to income that are not included in the taxable profit based on this law.


  * Kickbacks and bribes.


  * Sponsored amounts up to a certain limitation as per the law’s provisions.


  * Losses and damages during production, transit, storage, and trading beyond the rules defined in separate legal and by-laws that are in force.


  * Any claimed expense the measure of which is not certified by documents from the taxpayer or does not represent a real transaction.


The amounts allocated to special reserve accounts in banks and insurance companies that are calculated under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are deductible.
In the case of banks, branches of foreign banks, and non-bank financial entities licensed by the Bank of Albania for the exercise of lending activity, the write-off of bad debt is recognised as a deductible expense if the following conditions are met:
  * In cases where the loan is secured by movable or immovable property: 365 days after the filing of the request for the start of mandatory execution with the executor or at the time of execution of the movable or immovable property, whichever is the earlier date.
  * In cases where the loan is not secured by movable or immovable property: 365 days after the issuance of the execution order by the court.


Employers’ contributions towards the life and health insurance of employees are deductible.
## Net operating fiscal losses
Fiscal losses may be carried forward up to five consecutive years. However, losses may not be carried forward if more than 50% ownership of the share capital or voting rights of the company is transferred during the tax year, provided that this is accompanied by a change of business activity.
Albanian legislation does not allow losses to be carried back.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments to foreign affiliates are subject to withholding tax (WHT) unless tax relief is requested in accordance with the local legislation or any DTT in place. These payments are tax deductible if they are properly documented and incurred for business purposes only.
Payments to foreign affiliates made for the purpose of profit transfer might be subject to price revaluation by the tax authorities. Any transactions/payments made to foreign affiliates shall be performed on an arm’s-length basis.

The law on transfer pricing in Albania emphasises the following:
  * The general rule provides the application of the arm’s-length principle.
  * The taxpayer is subject to transfer pricing rules if the taxpayer performs controlled transactions with its related parties where: 
    * Controlled transactions are considered the cross-border transactions only.

      * one person participates, directly or indirectly, in the management, control, or capital of the other person, and
      * the same person or persons participate(s), directly or indirectly, in the management, control, or capital of both persons.


The taxpayer subject to transfer pricing rules must have in place the following information:
  * Documented information and analysis to verify that its controlled transactions are performed in consistency with the arm’s-length principle. Transfer pricing documentation shall be provided to the tax administration upon its request within 45 days of receiving the tax administration’s request. The content and form of the transfer pricing documentation is specified by instruction of the Minister of Finance.
  * Taxpayers engaged in controlled transactions above ALL 50 million are required to submit an annual controlled transactions template by 31 March of the year following the year subject to documentation.
  * The consistency of a controlled transaction(s) with the arm’s-length principle shall be determined by applying the most appropriate transfer pricing method from the methods provided below: 
    * Comparable uncontrolled price method.
    * Resale price method.
    * Cost plus method.
    * Transactional net margin method.
    * Transactional profit split method.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
The gross amount of interest and royalties paid to non-resident companies is subject to a 15% tax rate, while dividends and distribution of profits are taxed at a rate of 8%, unless a DTT provides a different rate.
The 15% tax rate is levied on the gross amount of payments for technical, management, installation, assembly, or supervisory work, as well as payments to management and board members.
If a non-resident company does not create a PE in Albania, and a DTT exists between Albania and the home country of the non-resident company, no WHT payment may arise.
## Double tax treaties (DTTs)
Albania has signed 46 DTTs, of which 42 are in force. 
WHT rates envisaged by applicable DTTs are provided in the following table:

Notes
These notes are not extensive. The full text of the DTT should be reviewed for a comprehensive check on the conditions of application of the reduced rates.
  1. If the recipient company directly or indirectly owns 50% of the capital of the paying company, a 0% rate of the gross amount of the dividends applies. If the recipient company directly or indirectly owns 25% of the capital of the paying company, a 5% rate of the gross amount of the dividends applies.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
## Inventory valuation
Inventory is valued at the end of each tax period using the methods stipulated in the Accounting Law, which should be applied systematically. The methods stipulated in the National Accounting Standards for the valuation of inventory at year-end are the average cost and first in first out (FIFO) methods. The accounting method of inventory evaluation cannot be changed more than once in five years.
## Capital gains
Generally, capital gains tax (CGT) is not distinct from CIT, and any capital gain is taxed as CIT at the 15% CIT rate. The capital gain is derived from the difference between the sale price and the purchase price of the asset (or the nominal value).
Capital gains, if any, are added to the taxable profit of the company and are taxed together with those profits at the 15% CIT rate. If the seller is a tax resident in a country other than Albania, based on applicable DTTs, the capital gain on sale of shares is generally taxed in the country in which the seller is resident, subject to certain provisions under domestic law and tax treaties.
Changes in the ownership of companies operating in the telecommunication sector, the hydrocarbon/mineral asset exploitation sector, and the financial sector in Albania are taxed in Albania as per the local legislation, and companies should inform the tax authorities within 45 days of the transaction.
Note that the above applies in cases when the Albanian entity has realised an average turnover of ALL 500 million for three consecutive previous years.
The Albanian entity subject to ownership changes is expected to notify the tax authorities regarding the details of the change within 45 days from the moment the ownership change occurred.
The obligation to notify does not apply if the sale of shares results in less than a 10% change in ownership of the Albanian company.
## Dividend income
Dividends and other profit distributions received by a resident entity from another resident entity or from a non-resident entity are not subject to CIT for the resident beneficiary of such income. This applies under two conditions: (i) the shareholding is greater than 10% and (ii) the shares have been held for a continuous period of at least 24 months.
## Interest income
Interest income is taxed at the rate of 15%.
## Royalty income
Royalty income is taxed as ordinary income, at the rate of 15%.
## Foreign income
Albanian resident corporations are taxed on their worldwide income. If a DTT is in force, double taxation is avoided either through an exemption or by granting a tax credit up to the amount of the applicable Albanian CIT rate.
Albanian legislation does not contain any provisions under which income earned abroad may be tax deferred.


# Albania
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
Albanian law applies the principle of worldwide taxation. Resident entities are taxed on all sources of income in and outside the territory of Albania, while non-resident entities are taxed on income generated only in the territory of Albania.
The corporate income tax (CIT) rate in Albania is 15%. CIT is assessed on the taxable profits calculated as taxable income less deductible expenses.
However, taxpayers whose activity is software production and development, registered until 31 December 2023, are subject to a 5% CIT for the periods until 31 December 2025. Similarly, taxpayers whose activity is based on agricultural co-operation and those whose activity is certified as 'agro tourism', in accordance with the respective laws, are subject to a 5% CIT until 31 December 2029.
## Local income taxes
Local taxes on income depend on a number of factors, such as type of activity, municipality where the business is located, and the annual turnover. Consequently, these taxes may vary from 20,000 to 550,000 Albanian lek (ALL).


# Albania
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate is 20%, and the standard VAT period is the calendar month.
Taxable transactions include goods and services supplied domestically as well as goods imported into Albania by a taxable person. The following transactions are also taxable:
  * Transactions performed for no consideration or for a consideration less than market value (the latter applies if the parties included in the transaction are considered as related parties).
  * Barter transactions.
  * The private use of taxable goods by a taxable person (self-supply).


### Determination of VAT payers
‘Taxable person’ shall mean any person who, despite the legal form of organisation, independently carries out any economic activity, whatever the place and the purpose or results of that activity.
The VAT registration threshold in Albania is annual turnover over ALL 10 million. Any person providing taxable supplies and whose annual turnover does not exceed ALL 10 million is not required to register, although voluntary registration is possible.
### VAT obligations for non-resident entities
For a non-taxable person, the place of supply shall be in Albania if the supplier of the non-taxable person has established their business or a fixed establishment there.
For a taxable person, the place of supply of services shall be in Albania if the taxable person who receives the service has established their business or a fixed establishment there.
### Reduced VAT rate
The reduced VAT rate of 6% is applied to the following:
  * Accommodation services.
  * Services certified as 'agritourism'.
  * Advertising services by audio-visual media.
  * Supply of books.
  * Supply of electric engine buses licensed for public transportation, with capacity of nine or more people.


The reduced VAT rate of 10 % is applied for the supply of agricultural inputs, including chemical fertilisers, pesticides, seeds, and seedlings.
### Zero-rated goods and services
The following goods and services are subject to 0% VAT in Albania:
  * Exports.
  * The supply of goods transported in the personal luggage of travellers.
  * International transport.
  * Supply of gold for the Bank of Albania.


### VAT-exempt goods and services
The VAT Law provides a list of supplies that are considered as VAT-exempt:
  * The supply by the public postal services of services, and the supply of goods incidental thereto.
  * Hospital and medical care and closely related activities.
  * The provision of medical care in the exercise of the medical and paramedical professions.
  * The supply of human organs, blood, and milk.
  * The supply of services by dental technicians in their professional capacity.
  * The supply of services by independent groups of persons who are carrying on an activity that is exempt from VAT.
  * The supply of services and of goods closely linked to welfare and social security work.
  * The supply of services and of goods closely linked to the protection of children and young persons.
  * The provision of children's or young people's school or university education.
  * Tuition given privately by teachers and covering school or university education.
  * The supply of agricultural machines.
  * The supply of veterinary services, except for veterinary services for pets.
  * The supply of auto vehicles, only with electric engines, new, with zero mileage, and not previously registered in any other country, other than those that are 6% rated.


### VAT calculation
The amount of VAT to be paid is calculated as the difference between the VAT applied to purchases (input VAT) and the VAT applied to sales (output VAT). If the input is higher than the output, then the difference is a VAT credit that can be carried forward to subsequent months. Otherwise, if the output VAT is higher than the input VAT, the difference represents VAT payable to the state.
Taxpayers who carry out taxable VAT activities, as well as VAT-exempt activities, can credit only that portion of their input VAT that corresponds to the taxable activities. To determine the amount of input VAT that can be claimed from the state, the taxpayer should estimate a VAT credit coefficient (i.e. the rate of the taxable VAT activities over total activities).
### VAT reimbursement
Taxable entities have the right to claim VAT reimbursement if the period in which VAT credits are carried forward exceeds three consecutive months and the total amount of accumulated VAT credit is equal to or above ALL 400,000.
Following the request for VAT reimbursement, taxable entities have the right to obtain the reimbursement of VAT credit within 60 days after the request is submitted. For all taxable persons who are considered as exporters based on the criteria established by the Instruction of Council of Ministers, the deadline for tax authority approval, or not, of VAT reimbursement requests is within 30 days.
### VAT returns
The submission of VAT returns and sales and purchase books must be done electronically by all taxpayers, including VAT representatives.
Electronic submission deadlines fall on the dates below:
  * For VAT books, the deadline is the tenth day of the following month.
  * For VAT returns and for the payment of the related VAT liability, the deadline is the 14th day of the following month.


## Customs duties
Albania uses the Harmonized Code System for tariff classification.
The customs duty rates range from 0% to 15%, depending on the type of goods.
Import of machinery and equipment for use in the taxpayer's business activity are generally subject to customs duties at the zero rate.
Import of vehicles are subject to customs duties at a rate of 0%.
## Excise duties
Excise duty is a tax applicable to certain goods consumed in Albania, whether imported or produced in the country.
Albanian excise legislation is based on EU Council Directive 2008/118/EC, which defines common provisions applicable for all excisable goods. It also integrates specific provisions applicable for each category of excise products.
Categories of products subject to excise duty in Albania are:
  * Energy products (e.g. petroleum, gasoil, gas).
  * Tobacco products (e.g. tobacco, cigarettes).
  * Alcohol and alcoholic beverages (e.g. beer, wine, spirits).
  * Other products (e.g. baked coffee, fireworks).


Excise duty is usually calculated as an amount per quantitative measuring unit defined for that product (e.g. per litre, per kilogram, per hectolitre, per 1,000 pieces).
Reimbursement of excise tax can be obtained on:
  * Goods that are used in a process previously approved by the customs authorities.
  * Exported products that have previously been subject to excise duty in Albania.
  * Fuel used by companies involved in the construction of electric energy resources, with an installed power of not less than five MW per source.
  * Fuel used in greenhouses, for the production of industrial and agri-industrial products.
  * Biodiesel used in transportation.


The reimbursement procedure is subject to special provisions and pre-defined criteria on the basis of which the amount to be reimbursed is calculated.
## Real estate tax
Entities that own real estate property in Albania are subject to real estate tax.
### Real estate tax on buildings
Real estate tax on buildings is calculated based on the type of activity the business entity owning the building carries out. The basis for this tax is the value of the building.
Tax due is calculated on a yearly basis as a percentage of the value of the building, depending on the use of the latter, as outlined below:
Type of building | Tax rate (%)  
---|---  
I. | Residential buildings | 0.05  
II. | Buildings used for commercial purposes | 0.20  
III. | Construction sites for which building has not been finalised within the deadline outlined in the construction permit | 30.00 *  
* The tax rate for construction sites not yet finalised is 30% of the corresponding tax rate for the entire construction area, for which the developer has been provided with a construction permit and has not managed to complete it according to the deadline defined in the act of approving the request for a construction permit.
### Real estate tax on agricultural land
Real estate tax on agricultural land is levied on each hectare and varies depending on the district where the agricultural land is located and on the land productivity categorisation.
### Real estate tax on land (non-agricultural)
Real estate tax on land (non-agricultural) is levied per square metre and varies depending on the district where the land is located.
## Stamp duties and notary taxes
There are no stamp duties on the sale contract of land or other properties. There are, however, notary taxes that are, in nature, similar to stamp duties. The notary tax on sales contracts that relate to change in ownership of immovable properties is ALL 1,000. The notary tax on sales contracts that relate to change in ownership of movable properties is ALL 700.
Depending on the agreement reached between the seller and the buyer, the notary tax can be paid either by the seller, or by the buyer, or shared between both of them.
## Registration taxes
The fee for the registration of a business entity is ALL 120; however, it can be reduced to ALL 0 if the registration is made online.
## Payroll-related taxes
Entities shall withhold personal income tax (PIT) from the gross salaries of their employees.
## Social and health contributions (SHC)
Employers shall pay SHC to the tax authorities at a rate of 15% and 1.7%, respectively. The social contributions are paid between the minimum and maximum gross salary for SHC purposes, which are ALL 40,000 from 1 April 2023 (previously ALL 34,000) and ALL 176,416 from 1 April 2023 (previously ALL 149,953), respectively. The health contributions are calculated on the total gross salary.
