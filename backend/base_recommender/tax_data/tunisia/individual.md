## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
The net global income serving as the basis of the personal income tax (PIT) shall be composed of the excess of the gross yield, including the value of the profits and benefits in kind, over the charges and expenses paid out in view of the acquisition and conservation of the income.
The net global revenue shall be composed of the total amount of the net income determined separately in accordance to the rules proper to each of the following categories of income:
  * Industrial and commercial profits.
  * Profits from non-commercial professions.
  * Profits from agricultural or fishing activities.
  * Wages, salaries, indemnities, pensions, and annuities.
  * Real estate income.
  * Income from securities and investments.
  * Foreign-sourced income.


PIT is due by all individuals considered as tax resident in Tunisia on the basis of their worldwide income (including foreign-sourced income, except those already subject to tax abroad).
For non-Tunisian tax resident individuals, Tunisian-sourced income realised by non-resident employees is subject to income tax in Tunisia, in general, through a WHT to be applied by the Tunisian established debtor.
The WHT rates depend on the nature of income as well as the existence of a double tax treaty (DTT) between Tunisia and the state of residence of the individual.
For salaries, the net income is calculated as the gross salary reduced by the mandatory social security contributions paid to Tunisian social security organisations and 10% on the amount net of Tunisian social security contributions as deduction for professional expenses, capped at 2,000 Tunisian dinars (TND).
The gross salary includes the value of benefits in kind (e.g. lodging, car, transportation, meals, school expenses, medical expenses). Benefits in kind are valued at their actual value.
For salaries, income tax is to be withheld at source by the employer (or the employee in the particular case of expatriates earning salaries from outside Tunisia for work done in Tunisia) on a monthly basis. The monthly income tax is calculated as 1/12 of the annual income tax determined according to the progressive scale below.
However, the income tax may be due at a flat rate of 20% of their gross income, before deductions for any reason whatsoever (including compulsory social security contributions for the establishment of their retirement pensions), for:
  * Non-resident employees working in Tunisia for a period or periods not exceeding six months per fiscal year.
  * Certain employees of foreign nationality (managers and trainers) employed by:


    * Totally exporting companies.
    * Oil and gas companies governed by the Decree-Law n°85-9, if the concerned employees’ work is related to exploration.
    * Oil and gas companies governed by the Hydrocarbon Code promulgated by the Law n° 99-93, whether the personnel carries out activities related to exploration or production.
    * Companies based in Free Trade Zones as defined by the Law n° 92-81.
    * Financial institutions working mainly with non-Tunisian residents, governed by the Code for financial services provided for non-residents.


## Personal income tax rates
Except in cases where the option to pay the income tax at a flat rate is possible (_see above_), income tax is calculated according to the following progressive scale:
Taxable income (TND) | Rate (%) | Effective rate on limit (%)  
---|---|---  
From | To  
0 | 5,000 | 0 | 0  
5,001 | 20,000 | 26 | 19.50  
20,001 | 30,000 | 28 | 22.33  
30,001 | 50,000 | 32 | 26.20  
50,001 | and above | 35 | -  
Note that revenues derived from activities that are subject to corporate income tax (CIT) at the reduced rate of 10% are 2/3 deductible from the PITable income. 
The Finance Law 2018 implemented a social solidarity contribution (SSC) to the benefit of the social funds, which is due by individuals (resident or not resident in Tunisia) on their income taxable in Tunisia and in application of the PIT scale. Hence, that contribution is not applicable to the income that is not taxable in application of the PIT scale, including mainly dividends, capital gains, and salary income taxable at the flat rate of 20% since these income categories are taxable at a specific PIT rate and not subject to the PIT scale. Also, income exempted from PIT will not be subject to the said contribution. The SSC is due at the rate of 1%. It is applicable from 1 January 2018.
The Finance Law 2020 provided that individuals realising exclusively salaries, wages, pensions, and life annuities and whose annual net income does not exceed TND 5,000 are exempted from the said SSC as of 1 January 2020.
Also, the finance law 2023 provided that SSC rate was decreased from 1% to 0.5% for the periods of fiscal year (FY) 23 to FY25. The said decrease shall apply for the salaries (including any taxable fringe benefits) paid as of 1 January 2023. The said decrease is provided only for the years FY23 to FY25. Subject to further changes in the coming years, the withholding tax (WHT) rate on SSC due as of 1 January 2026 shall be 1%.
Hence, the PIT scale will be as follows:
Taxable income (TND) | PIT rate excluding SSC (%) | PIT rate including SSC (%) (for the periods FY23 to FY25)  
---|---|---  
From 0 to 5,000 | 0 | 0/0.5*  
From 5,000 to 20,000 | 26 | 26.5  
From 20,000 to 30,000 | 28 | 28.5  
From 30,000 to 50,000 | 32 | 32.5  
Beyond 50,000 | 35 | 35.5  
(*) The SSC rate of 0% will apply as of 1 January 2020 only for individuals realising exclusively salaries, wages, pensions, and life annuities and whose annual net income does not exceed TND 5,000.

# Tunisia
## Individual - Other issues
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
## Work permits
Tunisian immigration legislation has not evolved much over the past few decades. Immigration laws in Tunisia are rather restrictive, and work permits are granted to foreigners only in situations where a Tunisian counterpart does not exist in the needed speciality.
Any foreigner desiring to exercise a remunerated activity in Tunisia must obtain a work contract with a Tunisian employer and hold a residence card that states the following: ’allowed to exercise a remunerated activity in Tunisia’.
Both documents are mandatory and the failure to respect this requirement exposes the employer and the foreign worker to serious fines, deportation, and even criminal charges.
The work contract between a Tunisian employer and a foreign worker shall be approved by the ministry of employment. The competent service at the ministry will approve the contract only if they are satisfied that there is a lack of Tunisian counterparts with qualifications equivalent to those of the foreign worker.
However, some categories of foreign workers do not need the authorisation of the ministry of employment and are able to work in Tunisia after filing a simple declaration within the competent services of the ministry of employment.
Once such a declaration is filed, the foreign worker obtains a certificate of ’non-submission to a work contract’ that has the same legal binding force as the approval of a work contract.
Foreign workers benefit from the same rights and have the same obligations as Tunisian workers.
All employers and foreign workers are required to strictly observe the legal requirements for hiring a foreign workforce.
## Residence permits
Once the work contract is approved (or the certificate of non-submission is obtained), the foreign worker applies for a residence card.
Upon application, the applicant receives a temporary residence card that allows them to exit and re-enter Tunisia until the final document is issued.
The Finance Law 2023 has introduced a new requirement for foreigners tax resident in Tunisia who work there in counterpart of a remuneration. Such requirement consists of the justification of their tax situation with regard to taxes due (for which the deadline for declaration has expired) on the date of submission of the renewal application for a residence permit, in accordance with the provisions of international treaties and special agreements.

# Tunisia
## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
## Employment income
For salaries, the net income is calculated as the gross salary reduced by:
  * the mandatory social security contributions (the mandatory employee contributions are 9.18% of the gross salary) and
  * 10% on the amount net of social security contributions (the 10% deduction is a deduction for professional expenses), capped at TND 2,000.


The gross salary includes the value of the benefits in kind (e.g. lodging, car, transportation, meals, school money, medical expenses, insurance).
The benefits in kind are valued at their actual value, which is the real cost paid by the employer. In case an allowance is granted to the employee, the amount of the said allowance should be used to estimate the advantage value (i.e. the rent indicated in a rental contract, the school money actually paid).
With regard to a company car, the value is either the lease amount or, if the car is under the ownership of the company, estimated at TND 100 per month, which is the value of the allowance granted to government officials and employees in the state-owned companies.
Benefits in kind granted for transport are exempted from WHT for companies incorporated in regional development zones. 
## Business income
The calculation of business net income depends on the category of the revenue.
The net income of a given category of revenue is to be determined according to specific rules applicable to that category.
For non-commercial professions, net profit constitutes the difference between the gross proceeds realised in the course of the civil year and the expenses necessary to the operation during the same year for persons maintaining accounts according to the accounting legislation into force.However, individuals realising non-commercial income may choose to be taxed on the basis of a lump-sum profit equal to 80% of their realised gross receipts.
Newly created individual companies, incorporated in 2018, 2019, or 2020, are entitled to a four-year exemption from the activity start date, subject to some conditions including mainly the start of the activity in a period of two years from the investment declaration submission and the maintenance of accounts as required by the Tunisian accounting law.
_For salaries, see Employment income above_.
For foreign-sourced income, the taxable basis constitutes the income that has not been subject to tax in the state of origin.
## Capital gains
_See Capital gains taxes in the section for information on the taxation of capital gains._
## Dividend income
Dividends distributed by Tunisian-resident companies are subject to PIT at the rate of 10%, paid as:
  * a discharging WHT for individuals, regardless of the residency criteria, or
  * an advance on the income tax for resident individuals in case the distributed dividends do not exceed TND 10,000.


Dividends distributed by non-Tunisian tax resident companies are subject to tax in Tunisia, unless they were subject to a similar tax in the state of source.
## Interest income
Interest income is subject to income tax as part of the total net income, unless expressly exempt (e.g. interest from deposits and from certificates in foreign currencies and convertible dinars).
## Rental income
Rental income earned by non-Tunisian resident persons and related to properties based in Tunisia is subject to PIT on the basis of 70% of the gross receipts.
## Exempt income
Exempt income includes the following:
  * Life annuities and temporary allotments granted to victims of labour accidents or to their heirs.
  * Life annuities granted in representation of damages and interest by virtue of a judgement for the reparation of a bodily loss.
  * Allowances, indemnities, and loans granted under any form in application of a legislation relative to social assistance, insurance, and social security.
  * Unemployment indemnities, within certain limits fixed by the law.
  * Special allowances intended to cover expenses inherent in the function or employment of workers, to the extent they are justified.
  * Interest from deposits and from certificates in foreign currencies or convertible dinars.

# Tunisia
## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
According to the Tunisian common law, an individual is considered as resident in Tunisia in case one of the below stated criteria is met:
  * The individual has one's principal residency (domicile) in Tunisia.
  * The individual has one's principal dwelling abroad but stays in Tunisia, in a continuous or discontinuous way, respectively, for one period or for several periods, the total duration of which is at least equal to 183 days per calendar year.


According to the DTTs concluded by Tunisia, when by simultaneous application of domestic tax laws of Tunisia and another state signatory of a DTT an individual is considered as resident in both states, then the provisions of the DTT relating to the criteria of determination of the tax residency will prevail. Indeed:
  * The individual shall be deemed to be a tax resident only of the state in which one has a permanent home available (habitual residency/dwelling).
  * In case the individual has a permanent home available in both states, one shall be deemed to be a resident only of the state with which one's personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests).
  * If the state in which the individual has one's centre of vital interests cannot be determined, or if one has not a permanent home available in either state, one shall be deemed to be a resident only of the state in which one stays the most.
  * If the three previous mentioned criteria are not met, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the state of which one is a national.
  * If the individual is a national of both states or of neither of them, the competent authorities of the contracting states shall endeavour to settle the question by mutual agreement.




# Tunisia
## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
## Social security contributions
The Tunisian social security system is financed by contributions from both employers (16.57%, reduced to 0.5% for wholly industrial exporting companies) and employees (9.18%) based on salaries. Employers collect and pay the social security contributions from each wage-earner.
For individuals carrying out independent activities, they may opt freely for one social regime among the regimes made available by the social authorities.
## Capital gains taxes
Capital gains derived from the disposal of immovable properties (lands and buildings) owned in Tunisia, expressly designated by the law, as well as shares in real estate civil partnerships, are subject to PIT according to the following rates:
  * 10% in cases where the property was sold after a five-year period, starting from the date of its acquisition.
  * 15% in cases where the property was sold before the expiry of a five-year period of detention, starting from the date of acquisition.


The above-stated regime is applicable to both resident and non-resident individuals.
For non-resident individuals, capital gains derived from the disposal of shares held in the capital of Tunisian-resident companies are subject to tax in Tunisia as follows:
  * In cases where the shares are listed in the Tunisian Stock Exchange: 
    * In cases where the shares were purchased prior to 1 January 2011, then capital gains will not be subject to tax in Tunisia.
    * In cases where the shares were purchased after 1 January 2011 and will be sold before the end of the year following the one during which they were acquired, then capital gains will be subject to tax. Otherwise (i.e. in cases where the shares will be sold after the expiry of the year following the one during which they were acquired), capital gains will not be subject to tax.
  * In cases where the shares are not listed in the Tunisian Stock Exchange, capital gains derived from the disposal by non-Tunisian resident persons of non-listed shares are subject to tax in Tunisia.


For resident individuals, capital gains derived from the sale of shares held in the capital of non-listed Tunisian-resident companies are considered as securities income and are subject, as such, to income tax as follows:
  * At the rate of 10% when the sale or retrocession took place after the expiry of one year following that of their subscription or their acquisition.
  * At the rate of 15% when the sale or retrocession took place before the expiry of one year following that of their subscription or their acquisition.


Also, the Finance Law 2023 provides that for resident individuals, capital gains derived from the sale of shares held in the capital of listed Tunisian-resident companies are subject to income tax at the rate of 10% when the sale or retrocession took place before the expiry of one year following that of their subscription or their acquisition.
The taxable basis is calculated as the difference between the sale price and the purchase price.
In case of realisation of several sale operations during one fiscal year and in case some operations result in capital losses whereas some others result in capital gains, the taxable base is to be determined as the balance between the total realised capital gains and the total realised capital losses during the year. Note that the Finance Law 2023 repealed the TND 10,000 tax deduction.
For non-resident persons, the due tax will be levied through WHTs due at the rate of 10% on the basis of the realised capital gains with a ceiling of 2.5% of the selling price in case the seller is an individual.
However, in case the seller realises, during the same fiscal year, capital gains and capital losses derived from the disposal of shares, then the seller may opt for the filing of an annual tax return towards the Tunisian tax authorities and the payment of the due tax at the rate of 10%, on the basis of the balance between the realised capital gains and the realised capital losses.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is levied under the Tunisian VAT Code and is due on all transactions taking place in Tunisia. The sale of goods is considered as taking place in Tunisia and thus subject to VAT if the goods sold are delivered in Tunisia. The sale of services is considered as taking place in Tunisia and thus subject to VAT if the services sold are exploited or used in Tunisia.
The standard rate of VAT is 19%. Lower rates of 7% and 13% apply to specifically designated operations.
_See the section in the Corporate tax summary for more information._
## Net wealth/worth taxes
The Finance Law 2023 has introduced a new category of tax called ’immovable property wealth tax‘. This tax concerns only individuals who hold, on 1 January of the fiscal year, real estate with net value equal to or exceeding TND 3 million, subject to DTTs.
The net value consists of the value of real estate, including the social rights in real estate civil companies (including those belonging to the dependent minor children) after deduction of debts (outstanding debts) attached to these real estates.
The tax rate is of 0.5%.
The taxable assets subject to this tax are built and not built real estate of any kind (e.g. villas, apartments, bare land).
However, the main house of the taxpayer and the real estate intended for the exercise of a professional activity (other than those not attached to a professional asset and intended for the rent to third parties) are not taxable.
This tax concerns:
  * real estate located in Tunisia, notwithstanding the country of residence of the taxpayer, and
  * real estate located abroad for taxpayers tax resident in Tunisia.


## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Inheritance of movable and immovable goods, from ancestors and descendants, are subject to registration fees at the rate of 2.5% calculated on the basis of the inherited goods value.
Inheritance of movable and immovable goods from brothers and sisters are subject to registration fees at the rate of 5% on the basis of the inherited goods value.
Inheritance of movable and immovable goods from uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, and cousins are subject to registration fees at the rate of 25% on the basis of the inherited goods value.
Inheritance of movable and immovable goods from relatives beyond the fourth degree and non-relatives are subject to registration fees at the rate of 35% on the basis of the inherited goods value.
## Property taxes
_See Net wealth/worth taxes above for a description of the immovable property wealth tax_.
## Luxury and excise taxes
There are no luxury or excise taxes in Tunisia.
