## Revision of the deadline for submission of monthly tax returns:
The Finance Law for 2024 has revised the deadline for filing monthly tax returns from day 28 to day 20 of the following month for companies that file their returns electronically.
## Four years exemption from income tax for newly created entities in 2024 and 2025:
The Finance Law for 2024 provides a four-years corporate income tax (CIT) and personal income tax (PIT) exemption to newly created enterprises that filed an investment declaration in 2024 or 2025. The first-year exemption starts from the effective start date activity and ends on 31 December of the same year. Such enterprises should enter into activity within two years from the investment declaration obtention date and should keep their accounts according to the Tunisian accounting standards.
Companies located in Regional Development areas that are entitled to the deduction from CITable income of profits derived from investments over five or ten years as from the activity effective start date can benefit from the four-years exemption period before the five- or ten-years full deduction period.
Some blacklist activities are excluded from the said PIT/CIT exemption, including companies operating in the financial and energy sectors, with the exception of renewable energies, mines, real estate development, on-site consumption, trade and transport, operators telecommunication, companies created by persons who have carried out an activity of the same nature as that carried out by new created company, as partners or managers, or having a first-degree relative (spouse or children) with persons having said status in another company carrying out an activity of the same nature.
## Establishment of a conjunctural contribution for the benefit of the state budget for the fiscal years (FYs) 2024 and 2025
The Finance Law for 2024 instituted a conjunctural contribution for the benefit of the state budget for the years 2024 and 2025. Such contribution is due at the rate of 4% of FY23 and FY24 taxable income (with a minimum of 10,000 Tunisian dinars [TND]) by banks, financial establishments (leasing companies, factoring companies, investment banks), and insurance and reinsurance companies.
## Increase of customs duties due for the import of solar panels
The Finance Law for 2024 has increased the customs duties applicable to the import operations of solar panels from 10% to 30%.
## Encouragement of companies to finance research and development (R&D) expenses
The Finance Law for 2022 provides an additional deduction of 50% of R&D expenses incurred by companies under agreements concluded with public scientific research establishments, public education and research establishments, or other public establishments authorised for research under the laws and regulations in force.
The following conditions apply:
  * The company's contribution to the total R&D expenses covered by the agreement is not less than 10% of the total amount of these expenses.
  * The additional deduction does not exceed TND 200,000 per year.


The Finance Law for 2023 increased the cap of TND 200,000 per year to TND 400,000 per year for R&D expenses incurred in the context of the green, blue, circular, and sustainable development economy.
Also, the Finance Law for 2023 provides that companies benefit from an additional deduction of 50% of innovation expenses, capped at TND 400,000 per year. The deductibility conditions of such a deduction will be fixed by decree.
Considering that the additional deduction represents a fictitious charge, which does not correspond to any current expense, it should be recorded in an extra-accounting manner through a deduction from the accounting result.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
## Taxable period
Under Tunisian law, both the accounting year and tax year follow the calendar year. However, derogation is possible if prior authorisation is obtained from the Ministry of Finance.
## Tax returns
Tunisian-established companies have the obligation to file monthly tax returns, an annual CIT return, and an annual Employer’s Declaration.
Monthly tax returns include WHTs, VAT, LAT, social lodging tax, and professional training tax, and must be filed each month before the 28th day of the following month. Filing and payment take place simultaneously.
The annual tax return is the CIT return, which must be filed before 25 March of the following year. The deadline for filing the CIT return is moved to 25 June for public liability companies and private liability companies subject to statutory audit. Filing and payment take place simultaneously.
The Employer’s Declaration has to be filed each year before 30 April of the following year. This declaration must list all fees and salaries paid or incurred, even if not yet paid, to service suppliers and employees during the concerned year. No payment is due in connection with this filing, but fees not listed on this declaration are not recognised as deductible costs.
## Payment of tax
CIT is paid through:
  * WHTs applied on certain payments and operated by the debtor on behalf of the taxpaying entity.
  * Beginning from the second year of activity, three provisional instalments, each calculated at 30% of the total CIT due for the previous year. The instalments fall due on 28 June, 28 September, and 28 December.
  * An annual tax return.


Both WHTs and provisional payments of income tax are creditable against the annual/final tax due.
Filing and payment take place simultaneously.
The most common process is the filing in person at the tax office. In this case, payment is made in cash or by check.
However, companies with turnover exceeding TND 1 million are constrained to file their tax returns electronically. Electronic filing remains optional for other companies. In this case, payment is made through bank transfer.
## Tax audit process
Tax auditors may proceed either with a spot tax audit (as provided by the Finance Law for 2022), a preliminary tax audit, or an in-depth tax audit.
### Spot tax audit
The Finance Law for 2022 introduced a new category of tax audit, namely the 'spot tax audit'. This tax audit relates to the situation of the taxpayer for a period not exceeding one year. This verification cannot be carried out more than once a year, except at the request of the taxpayer. It may cover the whole situation of the taxpayer or one or more taxes. The prior notification of the spot tax audit should indicate, in particular, its nature and, if necessary, the operations or data concerned by the tax audit. The spot tax audit does not include transfer pricing.
The spot tax audit is subject to all the rules and procedures relating to the in-depth tax audit of the fiscal situation, subject to particular provisions.
A prior notice to the spot audit should be addressed to the taxpayer, 15 days at least before the beginning of the audit. The audit period is of 30 days in case the audit is carried out based on accounts maintained by the taxpayer and 60 days in other cases. The tax notification result should be notified to the taxpayer within 30 days from the beginning of the audit.
The taxpayer should answer the tax audit notification result within ten days from the day following the date of receipt of the notification, and the tax administration should answer to the taxpayer's opposition within ten days.
Once the taxpayer receives the answer of the tax authorities to the opposition to the notification, the taxpayer should file a second opposition within seven days from the day after the notification day in cases where the taxpayer still disagrees with some or all the points raised by the tax controllers.
Also, the taxpayer can request for the submission of the tax audit file before the conciliation commission within the same deadline of seven days. That commission shall express its opinion on the file before the tax assessment notice.
In cases where the tax administration agrees to the clarifications, explanations, arguments, and documents provided by the taxpayer, then the tax audit will be closed. However, in cases where the tax administration still disagrees with some or all the evidence provided by the taxpayer or in cases where the taxpayer will not reply to the tax administration notification of the tax audit results or to the tax authorities answer to the opposition in the deadlines as detailed above, then the taxpayer will receive a tax assessment notice in a maximum period of 12 months as from the date of the notification of the tax audit results and will have to pay the notified taxes.
### Preliminary tax audit
In case of a preliminary tax audit, the taxpayer under control is not notified prior to starting the audit. However, the tax authority has the obligation to send an information request concerning the tax findings. The taxpayer has to reply within 20 days.
The tax audit is conducted in the offices of the tax administration and deals with the documents made available to them (tax returns, registered contracts, etc.). However, preliminary tax audits can never deal with the taxpayer’s accounts.
The results of the tax control are notified in writing to the taxpayer within a tax audit report, whereby the outcome of the audit activity must be detailed and the findings, if any, must be illustrated and motivated. The tax report is to be notified to the taxpayer within 90 days from the expiry date to reply to the information request (_see above_).
Indeed, the taxpayer has the possibility to answer to the tax audit report within 45 days starting from the day following the date of receipt of the report. Failing that, the taxpayer will receive a tax assessment notice in a maximum period of 30 months as from the tax audit results notification, that brings forth requests for payment of taxes and penalties to the taxpayer. In cases where the taxpayer answers to the notification of the results of the tax audit and brings additional explanations, clarifications, and documents to the tax auditors, they will be constrained to examine the evidence provided by the taxpayer and answer to the taxpayer's opposition within 90 days (as per the Finance Law for 2021) from the day following the notification date.
Once the taxpayer receives the answer of the tax authorities to the taxpayer's opposition, the taxpayer will have the possibility to file a second opposition within 15 days from the day after the notification day in cases where the taxpayer still disagrees with some or all the points raised by the tax controllers.
Also, the taxpayer can request for the submission of the tax audit file before the conciliation commission within the same deadline of 15 days. That commission shall express its opinion on the file before the tax assessment notice.
In cases where the tax administration agrees to the clarifications, explanations, arguments, and documents provided by the taxpayer, then the tax audit will be closed. However, in cases where the tax administration still disagrees with some or all the evidence provided by the taxpayer or in cases where the taxpayer will not reply to the tax administration notification of the tax audit results or to the tax authorities answer to his opposition in the deadlines as detailed above, then the taxpayer will receive a tax assessment notice in a maximum period of 30 months as from the date of the notification of the tax audit results and will have to pay the notified taxes (the tax assessment notice execution is interrupted by the payment of 10% or through a bank guarantee of 15% of the amounts due excluding amounts related to WHT and some administrative tax fines defined by the law that shall be paid at 100%). It should be noted that the Finance Law for 2020 provided that, in case a tax assessment notice is due to a default of submission of tax returns or acts required for the payment of taxes, the tax assessment notice execution is interrupted by the payment of 20% of the principal tax amount (excluding always amounts related to WHT and some administrative tax fines defined by the law that shall be paid at 100%). The tax assessment notice shall take into consideration the taxpayer’s observations enclosed in the first and the second opposition filed by the taxpayer.
Further to the receipt of the tax assessment notice, the taxpayer may make an appeal to the relevant court.
A preliminary tax audit does not prevent an in-depth tax audit of the same period and the same taxes.
### In-depth tax audit
In case of an in-depth tax audit, the taxpayer under control is notified 15 days prior to starting the audit. This period may be extended to a maximum period of 60 days.
In-depth tax audits deal with the accounts of the taxpayer under control (in cases where the taxpayer has the obligation to maintain accounts according to the accounting legislation into force) as well as any other evidence (presumptions, registered contracts, etc.).
In-depth tax audits take place, as a general rule, on the business premises of the taxpayer. However, and upon the request of the taxpayer or the tax controllers, the tax audit can be conducted in the tax authorities’ office. In this case, books, records, and any other documentation deemed necessary to the tax auditors to complete the audit have to be moved to the tax auditors’ office.
In-depth tax audits last for:
  * six months, in case the taxpayer under control is constrained by the law to maintain accounts, and
  * one year, in the other cases.


At the end of this period, the tax audit must come to an end and the tax auditors must draw up a tax audit report to be sent to the taxpayer, whereby the outcome of the audit activity must be detailed and the findings, if any, must be illustrated and motivated.
Once the tax audit report is sent to the taxpayer, the procedure of response and deadlines are the same as for preliminary tax audits.
## Statute of limitations
The period open for tax audit, unless it was subject to a previous in-depth tax audit, is:
  * Four years in case of partial omission; an omission is considered as partial in cases where the tax return is filed but the taxable base is not determined properly or in cases where the WHT rates applied to payments made to third parties are lower than the rates provided by the law.
  * Ten years in case of total omission; an omission is considered as total in cases where the tax return is not filed at the date when the company becomes under tax control.
  * Six years in case omissions, errors, and dissimulations on tax bases, rates, or tax liquidation are related to taxes declared which amounts do not exceed the following: 
    * TND 200 for companies.
    * TND 100 for individuals subject to PIT according to the real regime or subject to PIT according to the flat-rate regime under the BNC (flat rate).
    * TND 50 for individuals subject to PIT under BICs according to the flat-rate regime (flat tax).
    * TND 25 in other cases.


The four-year period and the ten-year period begin to run from 1 January (in cases where the fiscal year coincides with the calendar year) of the year following the completion of sales, earnings, receipt, or disbursement of any sum to be taxed.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The tax authorities primarily focus on extraordinary transactions (e.g. mergers, restructuring, suspension of business).
Further to the recent changes related to transfer pricing provision, the tax authorities are increasing their attention towards transactions concluded between affiliated companies.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
## Depreciation
Depreciation expenses of fixed assets that are owned by the company and within the limit of the depreciation expense calculated according to the straight-line method are deductible for the purpose of determination of taxable income at a maximum depreciation rate fixed by decree (decree 2008-492).
Buildings may be depreciated according to the accounting legislation. However, the tax deductible depreciation expense must not exceed the depreciation expense calculated at a maximum depreciation rate of 5%, according to the straight-line method. Extra depreciation expenses are to be added back to the taxable base subject to CIT.
Equipment and machinery may be depreciated according to the accounting legislation. However, the tax deductible depreciation expense must not exceed the depreciation expense calculated at a maximum depreciation rate of 15%, according to the straight-line method. Extra depreciation expenses are to be added back to the taxable base subject to CIT.
The equipment and machinery depreciation rates may be increased by 50% for companies operating in the manufacturing sector (and other than companies with seasonal activity), if the equipment is used at least 16 hours a day, or doubled if used 24 hours a day, but the tax deductible depreciation expense must not exceed the depreciation expense calculated at a maximum depreciation rate of 15%, according to the straight-line method, multiplied by 1.5 or by 2, depending on whether the equipment will be used 16 or 24 hours a day.
The tax incentives law provided for an additional deduction from taxable income/revenue at the rate of 30% with respect to amortisation of machinery, material, and equipment (except of tourism cars other than those constituting the main object of the company) acquired or manufactured by companies (other than those operating in the financial, energy except renewable energies, mines, real estate, on-time consumption, trade sectors, and telecom operators) during extension or renewal operations as defined by the investment law. Such deduction applies during the first year from the date of acquisition, manufacturing, or start of use.
Also, the Finance Law for 2024 provides that all enterprises can benefit from an additional deduction from taxable income/revenue at the rate of 30% with respect to amortisation of machinery, material, and equipment that produce renewable energy, subject to production of a certificate delivered by the competent authorities approving the nature of equipment.
Depreciation expenses of assets exploited under leasing contracts are also deductible for the purpose of determination of taxable income. In fact, even if assets exploited under leasing contracts are not owned by the company, they are booked as assets in the balance sheet and depreciated accordingly over a minimum period fixed by decree, as follows:
Asset exploited under leasing contracts | Minimum period (years)  
---|---  
Constructions | 7  
Machinery and equipment | 4  
Transportation equipment | 3  
Depreciation of low-value fixed assets not exceeding TND 500 are fully deductible from the taxable income of the year of their acquisition.
## Goodwill
Goodwill (_fonds de commerce_) amortisation expenses are not tax deductible for the purpose of the determination of taxable income.
## Start-up expenses
The maximum amortisation expense allowed for deduction is equal to 100% of the start-up expenses.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses (commissions, bank charges, interest loans, etc.) relating to loans contracted by the company and necessary for its proper functioning are tax deductible.
Interest expenses on shareholders current account are tax deductible within the limit of the maximum rate of 8%, provided that the capital is fully paid and the amount to be remunerated shall not exceed 50% of the capital; the rate of 8% is not applied to banks.
## Bad debt
Provisions for bad debts are tax deductible within the limit of 50% of the taxable result (after deduction of non-taxable revenues and add-back of non-deductible charges).
The deduction of bad debts is subject to the presentation of a detailed statement of the concerned creditors while filing the annual CIT return, as well as court cases against the creditors in order to claim payment.
Provisions for bad debts that are initially constituted tax-free and become groundless during an exercise (e.g. by the covering of the debt totally or partially) are taxable.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions are either deductible:
  * totally, in cases where they are granted notably to the state, local authorities, and state-owned companies, and to disability promotion organisations 
  * totally, with regard to the acquiring or constructing cost granted to spouses, ascendants, and descendants of martyrs of the army, internal security forces, and customs authorities
  * totally, in cases where they are granted to associations working for the support of people without family support, and that realise their activities in accordance with the legislation in force, or
  * within 0.2% of the revenue, in other cases.


The deduction of charitable contributions is subject to the presentation of a detailed statement of the beneficiaries while filing the annual CIT return of the year during which these charitable contributions were granted.
## Fines and penalties
Transactions, fines, and any other penalties for violating legal provisions are not tax deductible. However, contractual penalties (e.g. for late payment) remain tax deductible.
## Taxes
All taxes due by the company are considered as tax-deductible charges, except CIT and SSC.
Note that when the tax due by non-resident, non-PEs on royalties is borne by a Tunisian-established company (the debtor), then the correspondent charge is not tax deductible.
## Net operating losses
Under the Tunisian tax legislation, tax losses are divided into two categories: operating losses and deferred depreciation.
Operating losses are to be carried forward for five years, starting from the year following the one during which they were booked.
Deferred depreciation is to be carried forward indefinitely, starting from the year following the one during which they were booked.
With regard to the Tunisian tax legislation, operating losses cannot be carried back.
## Payments to foreign affiliates

# Tunisia
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
There are no specific tax rules for groups of companies in Tunisia.
## Transfer pricing
### Transfer pricing rules applicable starting from 1 January 2021 
The Finance Law for 2021 provided major changes in the transfer pricing conditions that were provided by the Finance Law for 2019 and which are applicable from FY20. Indeed, the threshold for the transfer pricing filing and documentation requirements was increased from TND 20 million (VAT included) to TND 200 million (VAT excluded).
Additionally, the transactions to be documented by the said companies are those concluded with companies having only dependency or control relationships with companies that are non-resident, non-established in Tunisia, and which are higher than TND 100,000.
### Transfer pricing rules applicable up to 2019 
According to the Tunisian tax legislation, where there is evidence for the tax authorities of the existence of commercial or financial business transactions between a company and other dependent companies, which, for the determination of their value, are based on rules that differ from those governing relations between independent companies and which result in the reduction of taxable benefits, the tax department is allowed to add back to the taxable result of the invoicing company the differential between the benefits that would have been realised if the practiced prices were in line with the arm's-length principle and those actually accounted for by the company.
The burden of proof is on the tax department.
There are no transfer pricing documentation or filing requirements. 
### Transfer pricing rules applicable as of 2020
The Finance Law for 2019 provides new provisions regarding transactions realised between dependent companies to be aligned with transfer pricing international standards. Indeed, as per article 48 of the CIT Code (as modified by the Finance Law for 2019), for the purpose of determination of CIT due by companies resident or established in Tunisia having relations of dependence or control with other companies belonging to the same group, that are non-resident, non-established in Tunisia (as per the Finance Law for 2021), the profits indirectly transferred to the aforementioned companies following the increase or the reduction of applied transfer prices, or by any means, are reintegrated into their taxable income. Such profits indirectly transferred are determined on the basis of their comparison with profits that would have been realised in the absence of a relationship of dependency or control.
It should be noted that companies are considered to have dependency or control relationships with other companies in case one of them owns more than 50% of the share capital or voting rights in the other company or has an effective decision-making right or are controlled by the same company/person (control is defined under the same conditions).
Also, as per the Finance Law for 2019, companies resident or established in Tunisia having relations of dependence or control with other companies as defined above, whose gross revenue (VAT excluded) is equal to or exceeds TND 200 million (as per the provisions of the Finance Law for 2021) and which have transactions with companies having dependency or control relationships that are non-resident, non-established in Tunisia, with amounts exceeding TND 100,000, should submit, under the same delay as CIT submission, a transfer pricing annual declaration according to a model to be set by tax authorities. Such requirement should apply starting from 1 January 2020.
The transfer pricing annual declaration includes, in particular, transfer pricing policy information applied by the group and information relating to transactions with companies having a dependency or control relationship.
### Advance pricing agreement (APA)
Companies having a dependency or control relationship (within the meaning of Article 48 of the CIT Code) with companies located outside Tunisia may submit for an APA relating to the transfer pricing method on their future transactions for a period ranging between three and five years.
The said agreement cannot be terminated before the expiry of its term.
The terms of conclusion of the APA are set by order of the Minister of Finance of 6 August 2019.
These provisions apply to fiscal years beginning from 1 January 2020.
### Country-by-country (CbC) reporting requirement
#### Companies concerned by the CbC report
The CbC reporting requirement is applicable to:
  * Tunisian tax resident companies that: 
    * directly or indirectly own a company or companies that make it required to issue consolidated financial statements in accordance with the accounting legislation in force or when it is required to do so if its shareholdings are listed on the Tunis Stock Exchange


  *     * realise an annual consolidated turnover (excluding taxes) for the year preceding the one concerned by the CbC report equal to or exceeding TND 1,636,800,000, and
    * are not directly or indirectly owned by another company within the meaning of the first sub-bullet above.
  * Tunisian tax resident or established companies that: 
    * are directly or indirectly owned or controlled by a company tax resident in a state that does not require the filing of the CbC report but which would be required to file this declaration if it is established in Tunisia
    * are directly or indirectly owned or controlled by a company tax resident in a state that is not included in the list of countries and territories that concluded an agreement for the automatic exchange of CbC reports with Tunisia
    * are designated by the group to perform such an obligation and inform the tax administration accordingly, or
    * are directly or indirectly owned or controlled by a company established in a state included in the list of countries and territories that concluded an agreement for the automatic exchange of CbC reports with Tunisia, when it is informed by the tax authorities of a systemic failure of the state of tax residence of the company that directly or indirectly owns it.


#### Timing
The CbC report filing obligation will be applicable starting from the fiscal year 2020. Such CbC report, when required, shall be filed no later than 12 months after the closing date of the fiscal year covered by the filing.
#### Modality and documentation
CbC reports will be exchanged with countries and territories that have concluded an agreement with Tunisia, under reciprocity conditions.
The model and content of the CbC report have been fixed by the Finance Minister decision on 29 April 2022.
The publication of the list of countries/states having concluded an agreement with Tunisia authorising the automatic exchange of CbC reports was published on 15 June 2022. 
Exceptionally, the tax administration provides that CbC report obligations were not required in 2020 and 2021 for companies resident or established in Tunisia that are owned by foreign multinational enterprises (MNEs).
## Thin capitalisation
Projects may be financed by shareholders’ equity, shareholders’ loans, or external debts.
Interest due on shareholders’ loans is tax deductible within the limit of an interest rate of 8%, provided that the following conditions are met:
  * The capital is fully paid-up.
  * The amount of the sums put at the disposal of the company must not exceed 50% of the capital.


In case shareholders’ loans exceed 50% of the share capital, then interests due in the part exceeding 50% are not tax deductible.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There is no provision in Tunisia for CFCs.


# Tunisia
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
The income attributable to a PE corresponds to:
  * the revenues generated directly by the PE further to the exercise of its activity
  * the revenues corresponding to works carried out by it, even if invoiced by the head office, and
  * the revenues that would have been realised by an independent company carrying out the same business, in case the activity of the PE is provided for free.


The following charges are deductible for the purpose of the determination of the taxable results of a PE:
  * All the charges incurred directly by this PE and necessary for its proper functioning. These charges have to be supported by proper documentation.
  * Direct charges incurred by the head office exclusively for the PE and supported by proper documentation.
  * A proportion of the indirect charges (real central administration costs) incurred by the head office. The proportion admitted for deduction is most often calculated on the basis of the turnover of the Tunisian branch against the global turnover of the head office. The deduction is limited to 10% of the Tunisian turnover in case the head office is resident of a state that did not conclude a DTT with Tunisia.




# Tunisia
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
Two laws have been promulgated in order to promote investment in Tunisia, the Investment Law and the Tax Incentives Law.
## Investment Law n° 2016-71 of 30 September 2016
### Objectives of the Investment Law
The purpose of the Investment Law is to promote investment and to encourage the creation of enterprises, notably through:
  * Increasing the added value, competitiveness, and export capacity of the national economy, and technological development at the regional and international levels.
  * Job creation and promotion of human resources competence.
  * Achieving an integrated and balanced regional development.
  * Achieving sustainable development.


### Main features of the Investment Law
The Investment Law defines the legal regime for investment promoted by persons, resident or non-resident, in all sectors of economic activities, fixed by decree.
Under the Investment Law, investors benefit from the following incentives:
  * Right to acquire, lease, or operate non-agricultural immovable property.
  * Possibility of recruiting executives of foreign nationality for up to 30% of the total number of managers; this rate is reduced to 10% as of the fourth year. In all cases, the company can recruit four executives of foreign nationality (even if the limit of 30% or 10% is less than four).
  * Free transfer of the profit, dividends, and capital abroad in foreign currency, in accordance with the applicable foreign exchange legislation. Indeed, the Investment Law specifies that the investor is free to transfer one’s capital and profits abroad in foreign currency (in compliance with the applicable foreign exchange legislation). In case the transfer requires authorisation from the Tunisian Central Bank, any refusal must be in writing. The failure to reply within the time limit to be set by decree is considered as an acceptance (except for activities excepted to be defined by decree).
  * Investment subsidies for direct investment operations, as follows: 
    * Subsidies for the increase in value added and competitiveness.
    * Subsidies for the development of employability capacity.
    * Subsidies for regional development.
    * Subsidies for sustainable development.
Conditions and modalities to benefit from subsidies are defined by decree.
  * Possibility to benefit from arbitration in case of dispute with the Tunisian State. The Investment Law provides rules for settlement of disputes between the Tunisian State and foreign investors. These shall be settled by conciliation; otherwise, the dispute may be submitted to arbitration under a specific agreement between the two parties. In case the dispute is not settled through conciliation and in the absence of an arbitration agreement, the dispute falls within the jurisdiction of Tunisian courts.


Also, as per the Investment Law, foreign investors have the same rights and obligations provided for by the Investment Law as Tunisian investors in comparable situations.
The Investment Law provided for the need to comply with response deadlines for each authorisation requested by the investor and the obligation to justify each refusal in writing. Failure to reply within the time limit constitutes acceptance under article 4 of the Law (except for activities excepted to be defined by decree).
Investors’ properties and intellectual property (IP) rights are protected in accordance with the legislation in force. Investor's property may not be expropriated except for public interest reasons, without discrimination between Tunisian and foreign investors, subject to fair and equitable compensation.
## Tax Incentives Law n° 2017-8 of 14 February 2017
The major tax incentives provided for by the Tax Incentives Law are mainly relating to:
  * Export operations. 
  * Investments in regional development zones.
  * Agricultural development.
  * Support and depollution activities.
  * Newly created companies.


## Wholly exporting activities
The following are considered as wholly exporting companies:
  * Companies with products manufactured in Tunisia, totally destined to be sold outside Tunisia.
  * Companies providing services totally used/exploited outside Tunisia.
  * Companies operating in agriculture and fisheries, manufacturing, and craft industries that sell all their products to wholly exporting companies, as well as companies established in business parks, provided that such products and goods constitute components of the final product to be exported (note that this condition no longer required as of 2021 for companies incorporated up to 2018 and as of 2019 for companies incorporated in 2019), and to international trade wholly exporting enterprises.

# Tunisia
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
The payments of certain remunerations are subject to corporate WHT in Tunisia.
The WHT is an advance payment of CIT and is thus deductible from the CIT due by the invoicing entity. To this end, the paying entity shall withhold the tax at the appropriate rate. It shall then issue a WHT certificate to the invoicing company to enable the latter to use the certificate as proof of the payment at the moment of filing its CIT return. The paying entity subsequently pays the withheld amount to the tax authorities.
According to the Finance Law for 2022, WHT certificates will be issued through an electronic platform that will be implemented by the Ministry of Finance. The scope, terms, and deadlines for the application of this provision will be set by an order of the Minister of Finance.
Regarding the WHT imputation, the Finance Law provides that WHT that should be issued on the electronic platform that has been issued manually, paid by any taxpayer or on one's behalf for a fiscal year, is not deductible from the CIT due. WHT on VAT is deductible only if it is covered by a certificate issued on the platform (subject to the terms and deadlines that will be set by the order of the Minister of Finance).
A tax fine equal to 30% of the amount of the WHT, with a minimum of TND 50 per certificate, is applicable for any person who submits a WHT certificate issued manually without going through the electronic platform set up by the Ministry of Finance.
The withheld tax is to be declared and repaid by the paying entity each month before the 28th day of the following month. The Finance Law for 2024 reduced the deadline for submission of the monthly tax return from day 28 to day 20 of the following month for companies that file and pay their tax returns electronically.
The rates of the WHT differ according to the nature of the goods/services and the rates applicable within the framework of the DTTs.
The Finance Law for 2021 has amended many WHT rates. Applicable WHT rates in Tunisia as of 1 January 2021 are as follows:
  * 10% of the gross amount of the invoices related to fees, commissions, brokerage fees, rentals, payment of non-commercial activities. The rate of 10% is reduced to 3% for fees when these amounts are paid to entities subject to CIT and individuals who keep proper accounts in accordance with the Tunisian accounting principles.
  * 15% on performance bonus paid to distributors of goods.
  * 20% on interest. This does not include interest on deposits and bonds in foreign currency or convertible dinars. 
  * 20% on director’s attendance allowance. 
  * 10% on bank loans interests granted by non-Tunisian resident banks.
  * 2.5% on the sales price indicated in a real estate sale, in case the seller is an individual.
  * 1.5% on payments exceeding TND 1,000 (including VAT) made for the acquisition of goods and services necessary to the activity and that are not subject to a specific WHT rate. This rate is reduced to 1% for companies subject to CIT at the rate of 15%. This rate is also reduced to 0.5% for companies subject to CIT at the rate of 10%.
  * 15% on other payments made to non-Tunisian tax resident persons (subject to more favourable rates provide by DTT).
  * 15% on other payments made to non-Tunisian tax resident persons deemed to have a PE in Tunisia and that fail to register with the tax authorities.
  * Dividends distributed by Tunisian-resident companies to non-resident, non-established companies, to non-resident individuals, and to resident individuals are subject to a discharging WHT at the rate of 10% of its total amount.
  * 25% on payments (payments for services, interests and director’s attendance allowances, dividends and branch tax, interests paid to banks) made to persons resident in territories/states with a privileged tax regime. It should be noted that the Finance Law for 2019 redefined the concept of 'tax havens' as 'countries or territories with a privileged tax regime', which are defined as countries or territories whose CIT rate is lower than 50% of the CIT rate due in Tunisia under the same activity. The list of the said countries/territories are fixed by a decision of the Finance Minister. In addition, the Finance Law for 2019 provided that the WHT due on payments related to services realised by companies tax resident or established in territories/states with a privileged tax regime deemed to be realised under a PE located in Tunisia and that fail to register with the tax authorities are subject to the WHT at the rate of 25% instead of 15% applicable as per the domestic law.
  * 25% on lottery and gambling gain.


## DTT rates
Note that the following WHT rates are applicable to amounts payable to non-resident, non-established companies and financial institutions according to DTTs concluded by Tunisia.
The DTT rate is applicable in case it is lower than the domestic law, provided that the beneficiary of the payment provides the corresponding tax residency certificate. In case of failure, the domestic law will be applied.

# Tunisia
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
## Inventory valuation
Inventory is valued at cost.
## Capital gains
According to the provisions of article 11 of the Income and Corporate Tax Code, “the net income of a company is determined as the result of all the operations undertaken by the company, including mainly the transfer of assets…” Consequently, capital gains, if any, arising from the transfer of assets will be considered as taxable income and will be subject to CIT.
Capital gains are calculated as the difference between the sale price, which is supposed to be equal to the fair market value, and the net book value.
In the particular case of goodwill (_fonds de commerce_) generated internally, capital gains will be equal to the total sale price, as goodwill, other than derived from acquisitions, has no value on the books of the company.
All tangible and intangible transaction assets have to be valued at their fair market value.
The goodwill (_fonds de commerce_) generated internally, even if not booked as an asset of the company, also has to be valued at fair market value.
### Particular case of capital gains resulting from mergers
Capital gains arising from the transfer of assets, other than inventories, on the occasion of a merger operation are deductible from the taxable income of the merged company and are to be added back to the taxable income of the absorbing company at up to 50% of their amount, spread out over five years.
### Particular case of revalued fixed assets (legal revaluation regime)
The Finance Law for 2019 instituted the legal revaluation regime applicable to industrial companies. According to such regime,industrialcompanies are authorised to revalue their fixed assets included in their balance sheets for the year ended 31 December 2019 and the following years. The said fixed assets exclude:
  * Buildings and lands.
  * Assets that benefited from the additional amortisation at the rate of 30% as provided by the tax incentives law.


In addition, the following assets cannot benefit from the legal revaluation regime:
  * Financial fixed assets.
  * Intangible assets (goodwill, trademarks, patents, etc.).
  * Assets other than fixed assets (inventories, trade receivables, investment securities, etc.).


The actual value of the revalued fixed assets cannot be greater than the value obtained by application at their cost/purchase price of revaluation indexes fixed by decree n°2019-971 of 28 October 2019. The Finance Law for 2023 provides that the valuation can be performed according to the provisions provided for by the accounting system of companies and deletes the above cap (value not exceeding the value calculated using the revaluation indices fixed by presidential decree).
#### Revaluation gain or loss
The revaluation gain is not subject to CIT provided that it is booked in a special equity account (special revaluation reserve) that is undistributable and unusable by any means except in case of sale. Also, the revaluation loss is not tax deductible from the taxable income.
Any reallocation (capitalisation, distribution, etc.) makes the gain available and subject to CIT or tax on distribution for the reserves distributed directly.
#### Capital gain on the sale of the revaluated assets
The capital gain is not subject to CIT within the limit of the capital gain resulting from the revaluation of the sold asset. Also, the loss derived from the sale of the revalued assets is not tax deductible from the taxable income within the limit of the revaluation gain.
The Finance Law for 2023 provides that the benefit of this revaluation regime is subject to the condition of non-transfer of the revalued assets for a minimum period of five years from 1 January of the year following that of the revaluation.
#### Deduction of additional depreciation post-revaluation
For assets subject to depreciation, accumulated depreciation deducted that is tax deductible is revalued by applying the same revaluation index applied to the historical cost of the corresponding fixed assets.
#### New provision provided by the Finance Laws for 2022 and 2023
The Finance Law for 2022 has extended the legal revaluation regime to buildings and lands for legal companies subject to CIT. Hence, all companies (in all sectors of activity) can revalue buildings and lands (as defined by accounting legislation) that are in their balance sheet according to their real value without this value exceeding the value calculated through the revaluation of the purchase or cost price in application of the revaluation indices fixed by presidential decree. The Finance Law for 2023 provides that the valuation can be performed according to the provisions provided for by the accounting system of companies and deletes the above cap (value not exceeding the value calculated using the revaluation indices fixed by presidential decree).
This revaluation applies to buildings and lands that are in the companies’ balance sheets for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 and subsequent years.
For the other fixed assets, the revaluation instituted by the Finance Law for 2019 remains limited to companies, subject to CIT, operating in the industry sector.
The revaluation gain is not subject to CIT, provided that it is booked in a special equity account (special revaluation reserve) that is undistributable and unusable by any means except in case of sale. Also, the revaluation loss is not tax deductible from the taxable income.
The revaluation of buildings and lands does not give the right to additional depreciation, the latter continue to be applied on the basis of the cost price or the historical acquisition cost and at the rates applicable before the revaluation.
In case of sale (after ten years), the capital gain is not subject to CIT within the limit of the capital gain from the revaluation of the property sold. Also, the sale loss of revalued assets is not deductible from taxable income up to the revaluation gain.
The benefit of this revaluation regime is subject to the condition of non-transfer of the revalued buildings and lands for a minimum period of ten years from 1 January of the year following that of the revaluation.
### Particular case of capital gains realised further to the assets disposal for the purpose of renewal of assets assigned to operations
According to the Finance Law for 2019, all the companies (except for those operating in the financial, energy other than renewable energy, mining, trade, on-time consumption industries, telecommunication operators, and real estate developers) could benefit from the deduction from their taxable income, up to a limit of 50%, of the capital gain derived from the disposal of tangible fixed assets allocated to the main activity, provided that such disposal occurs after five years from date of possession. Such provisions will apply for disposals performed between 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2021, subject to the following conditions: 
  * Allocate the total amount of the capital gain to the acquisition of materials and equipment necessary for the operations.
  * The registration of the capital gain in a special reserve investment account on the liabilities side of the balance sheet before the filing CIT due date related to the year of benefit of the deduction.
  * The realisation of the investment and the incorporation of the reserve special reinvestment in the company's share capital (for legal entities) at the latest at the end of the second year following that of constitution of the reserve.
  * Non-reduction of the share capital (for legal entities) for a period of five years as of the date of incorporation of the special reserve into the share capital, except in the case of the capital reduction for loss absorption.
  * Attachment to the CIT return of the year of the capital gain deduction of a certificate of deposit of the investment declaration with the authorities concerned added to a commitment to realise the investment no later than at the expiry of the second year following that of constitution of the reserve.

# Tunisia
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
Tunisian-resident companies are subject to CIT in Tunisia on the basis of profits generated from permanent establishments (PEs) located in Tunisia and those attributable to Tunisia by virtue of a double tax treaty (DTT). Non-Tunisian-resident companies are subject to CIT on the basis of their Tunisian-sourced income.
PEs of non-Tunisian-resident companies are subject to CIT in the same way and under the same conditions as Tunisian-resident companies. However, certain particularities, related mainly to deductions, exist (_see the section_).
CIT is also due by non-resident, non-PE companies on Tunisian-sourced income through withholding taxes (WHTs).
CIT is broadly levied on the total net income resulting from the statutory financial statements of the company, duly adjusted according to the specific tax rules.
Positive/negative items of income are taxed/deducted based on the accrual basis. Income items accruing in a tax period where the above principle is not met are not allowed for tax deduction nor taxed in that tax period. Tax deduction/taxation is correspondingly deferred to the future tax periods where the principle will be met.
Income items have to be certain in their occurrence and objectively determined or determinable in their amount.

CIT rates applicable are as follows (subject to exemptions and tax incentives):
  * 15% as a general rate.

    * Hypermarkets (constructed area exceeding 3,000 m² or sales area exceeding 1,500 m²) as of 1 January 2020.

## Minimum corporate tax
A minimum corporate tax is due at the rate of 0.2% of the local turnover, including value-added tax (VAT), with a minimum of TND 500, in case:
  * the company (subject to CIT at the rate of 20%, 35%, or 15%) realises losses, or
  * the CIT due at the rate of 20%, 15%, or 35% is less than the minimum corporate tax of 0.2% of the local turnover, including VAT.


However, the minimum corporate tax is reduced to 0.1% of the gross turnover for companies subject to CIT at the rate of 10% and companies selling products with regulated prices having a gross margin not exceeding 6%, with a ceiling of TND 300.
The minimum corporate tax is not due by companies benefiting from the whole exemption of profits deriving from operations (e.g. companies established in the regional development zones, companies operating in the agricultural sector) during the period of tax holidays. These latter are fixed by decree.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
### VAT scope and rates
VAT is levied under the Tunisian VAT Code and is due on all transactions taking place in Tunisia.
The sale of goods is considered as taking place in Tunisia, and subject to VAT, if the goods sold are delivered in Tunisia. The sale of services is considered as taking place in Tunisia, and subject to VAT, if the services sold are exploited or used in Tunisia.
The standard rate of VAT is 19%. Lower rates of 13% and 7% apply to specifically designated operations. Note that these rates are effective as of 1 January 2018 (previously 18%, 12%, and 6%, respectively). 
Note that the Finance Law for 2023 increased the VAT rate applicable to fees charged by lawyers, bookkeepers, chartered accounts, tax advisors, consultants and experts, architects, consulting engineers, etc. from 13% to 19% as of 1 January 2023.
Some operations, products, or services are out of the scope of VAT in Tunisia, and some others are expressly exempt from VAT.
Some goods and services may be acquired VAT free, based on a certificate delivered for the purpose by the relevant tax authorities. This exemption is granted mainly to wholly exporting companies (other than international trade companies and service companies, which no longer benefit from the VAT free acquisition of goods as per the Finance Law for 2022), oil and gas companies, their contractors, and their subcontractors.
Registration for VAT purposes may be either obligatory or optional.
Voluntary registration is allowed where persons:
  * carry out activities that are outside the scope of the Tunisian VAT, in which case the option has to be a full option, which means that all the activities carried out by these persons will be subject to VAT, or
  * carry out operations that are exempt from VAT and that are destined for export, or supply products and services that are exempt from VAT to persons liable to VAT, in which case the option may be a partial or a full option.


### Output VAT
Output VAT is calculated on the basis of the amount of the taxable transaction excluding VAT.
### Input VAT
Individuals and companies that are subject to VAT may deduct the input VAT incurred on the purchase of goods and services necessary to carry out activities subject to VAT.
### VAT declaration
VAT is declared and paid on a monthly basis.
### Refunds
If the input VAT exceeds the output VAT, the VAT credit resulting from the difference between the input VAT and the output VAT may be reimbursed on the basis of a written request made to the tax authorities.
The VAT credit is refundable if it arises from:
  * exportation operations of goods and services, sales made to clients allowed to acquire goods and services VAT-free, and WHT made on the remunerations paid to companies that are neither resident nor established in Tunisia (such VAT credit is refundable if it is shown on one monthly tax return)
  * investments destined for the carrying out of new projects under the conditions set out by the Investment Law (such VAT credit is refundable if it is shown on at least three successive monthly tax returns), or
  * other operations (such VAT credit is refundable if it is shown on at least six successive monthly tax returns).


In order to benefit from the refund of VAT credits, the taxpayer has to file supporting documents, such as declarations relating to exportation of goods, documents proving that the service rendered by the Tunisian taxpayer was used or consumed outside Tunisia, authorisations to sell VAT-free, and WHT certificates.
To benefit from the refund of VAT credits, the taxpayer must already have submitted all tax returns and paid all taxes due at the time of submission of the request for the refund.
The VAT credit (other than the one derived from exports, VAT-free sales, and WHT of VAT and from some investments as provided for by article 15 of the VAT Code) subject to six successive monthly tax returns showing a credit, is reimbursable through an advance payment of 15% on request without preceding tax audit. This rate is increased to 50% for companies which financial statements are subject to statutory audit, subject to the certification with no modification affecting the tax basis of the last financial statements due at the date of the refund request. The remaining balance will be reimbursed subject to a tax audit.
For companies that rely from the Big Companies Direction (_Direction des Grandes Entreprises_), the said advance will be increased to 100%, subject to a special report issued by the statutory auditor and relating to the CIT credit to be requested for refund.
The VAT credit derived from exports, VAT-free sales, WHT of VAT, and from investments as provided for by article 3 of the investment law is reimbursable through an advance payment of 100% on request without preceding tax audit.
The refund would be considered as final subject to a tax audit.
### Time limits
The taxpayer may claim the VAT credit within three years starting from the date from which the VAT credit becomes refundable.
## Customs duties/Import tariffs
### Import VAT
Importation of goods and services are subject to import VAT unless:
  * the imported good is expressly exempt, such as for: 
    * fresh milk, uncondensed and unsweetened, whether skimmed or full-fat
    * milk flour
    * devices intended for use by physically disabled persons
    * pure-bred breeding animals
    * equipment with nothing similar manufactured locally, expressly designated, or
    * boats destined to maritime navigation and fishing, and other pleasure boats, or
  * the importer benefits from the acquisition of goods necessary to its activity VAT-free (e.g. oil and gas companies).


### Customs duties
Customs duties are due on importations other than those made from the European Union (EU).
Some equipment expressly designated by the Tunisian domestic law is exempt from customs duties, whether imported from EU countries or not.
Customs duties are not due in cases where the importer is expressly exempt, even if the goods are imported from outside the European Union.
For temporary importation of equipment, the customs duties due are to be calculated in proportion to the period spent in Tunisia. 1/60 of the total customs duties are due per month spent in Tunisia.
As per article 39 of the Finance Law for 2018, subject to fixed customs rates, common customs duties for products and equipment with NGP codes included in chapters 25 to 97 are increased as of 1 January 2018 from 20% to 30% and from 0% to 15% for listed products (listed in appendix 2 to the Finance Law for 2018).
In addition, the Finance Law for 2018, as modified by the Finance Law for 2020, provided for an increase in the customs duties rates applicable to a list of products originated from Turkey for a period of four years as of 1 January 2018. These provisions will be eliminated progressively over a period of three years using equal average annual rates, after the expiry of a period of four years.
The Finance Law for 2024 provided for an increase in the customs duties rates applicable to a list of products originated from Turkey for a period of three years as of 1 January 2024. These provisions will be eliminated progressively over a period of two years using equal average annual rates, after the expiry of a period of three years.
Also, the Finance Law for 2022 has increased customs from 0%, 15%, or 30% to 43% for some products and from 0%, 15%, 30%, or 36% to 50% for others, as follows:
  * Examples of products for which the custom duties will increase to 43%: Cements, paints, perfumes and toilet waters, beauty or make-up products, soaps, transport and packaging articles, tableware, ceramic products, glasses, watches, etc.
  * Examples of products for which the custom duties will increase to 50%: Cheeses, honey, vegetables and fruits, coffee, sausages, bakery and pastry products, fermented drinks, ethyl alcohol, clothing and clothing accessories, shoes, etc.


In addition, the Finance Law for 2022 has decreased customs duties on solar panels from 20% to 10% and provided a decrease of customs duties on some vehicles with a hybrid thermal and electric engine.
The Finance Law for 2024 has increased the customs duties applicable to the import of solar panels from 10% to 30%.
## Excise taxes
There are no provisions for excise taxes in Tunisia.
## Property taxes
A real estate tax (RET) is calculated by the relevant municipalities and is notified annually to the taxpayers at the beginning of the civil year.
For companies subject to the payment of the local authority tax (LAT) (_see below_) and in case the LAT paid over the year is less than the RET notified by the municipalities, then the differential is due and is payable as complementary LAT. In other words, the RET constitutes a minimum of due LAT per year.
## Transfer taxes
The registration of some operations is compulsory. In these cases, the registration fees are expressly determined by the Registration and Stamp Fees Code.
Registration remains optional for certain operations. In case of optional registration, the registration fees due to be paid are equal to TND 30 (as per the Finance Law for 2022) per page and per copy.
In case of compulsory registration, the fees due depend on the nature of the transaction and the goods involved.
Some transactions are subject to proportional registration fees, for example:
  * 5% on the transfer of immovable properties. However, this rate is reduced to 3% for the acquisition of social housing from real estate developers for the portion exceeding TND 500,000 (as per the Finance Law for 2022) with a minimum equal to the fixed fee calculated at TND 30 per page and per copy of the contract subject to registration. An additional registration fee is due at the rate of 2% for the transfer of immovable properties (other than immovable properties used for business purposes and subject to a favourable tax regime) which value ranges between TND 500,000 TND and TND 1 million and 4% for immovable properties which value exceeds TND 1 million.
  * 2.5% for the transfer of goodwill (_fonds de commerce_).


Transactions that are not subject to proportional registration fees, as well as transactions for which registration is optional, are subject to insignificant fixed registration fees (TND 30 per page).
Contracts and agreements (including concessions agreements, marketing, franchise, etc.) should be registered at the rate of 0.5% (based on the gross amount including taxes). In case of agreements with an indefinite duration or for a duration exceeding three years, registration fee is due based on the gross amount related to the first three years.
The Finance Law for 2022 provides that acquisitions of immovable properties made by the government/state are exempt from registration fees. This provision applies to contracts submitted for registration from 1 January 2022, notwithstanding their dates.
## Stamp duties
Stamp duties are due, in general, on certain contracts expressly designated, as well as invoices, unless the customer is expressly exempt.
In general, stamp duties are TND 1 for invoices (the Finance Law for 2023 provides an increase of stamp duties on invoices from TND 0.6 TND to TND 1 per invoice as of 1 January 2023), subject to exemptions provided for by the law, including invoices related to export operations.
Certain documents are expressly exempt from stamp duties, mainly judgments, checks, etc.
Note that the Finance Law for 2022 provides that a stamp duty of 100 millimes per receipt issued to customers is due by:
  * large commercial areas (as defined by the Urban Planning Code) and multi-departments stores that are under the Large Businesses Direction (DGE) or to the Medium-Sized Businesses Direction, and
  * operators of a brand or a foreign commercial sign (as defined by Law 69-2009 of 12/08/2009 relating to distribution trade).
