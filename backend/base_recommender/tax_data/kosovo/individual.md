## Foreign tax relief
The resident taxpayer who receives income from economic activities outside of Kosovo and who pays income tax on that income to any other state shall be allowed a tax credit under the PIT for the amount of income tax paid to such state that is attributable to the income generated from the other state.
The tax credit allowed is limited to the amount of foreign tax paid on the income earned outside Kosovo and shall not exceed the amount of obligatory tax in Kosovo on that same income.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax period for PIT purposes is the calendar year. However, withholding taxes on wages and pension contributions are made on a monthly basis (i.e. upon payment).
## Tax returns
PIT returns are filed annually, and the deadline to submit them is 31 March of the following year. An amendment to the tax return is allowed within three years after the mandatory date when the tax return was submitted.
### Penalties
Submission of the tax return after the deadline is subject to fixed mandatory fines. The understatement of tax presented in the tax return is subject to penalty from 15% to 25%, depending on the under-declared amount.
## Payment of tax
Each employer is responsible for withholding the tax and pension contribution from taxable salaries paid to employees, including payments to non-business individuals, for professional, technical, management, and financial services, payments for service contracts, payment for actors, musicians, athletes, and dependent agents. The salaries shall be paid through the bank.
Employers are required to submit payroll records, together with pension contribution liabilities, and make the respective payment to the Tax Administration of Kosovo (TAK) by the 15th day of the following month. Employers must inform the TAK about a new employee one day before the employee starts work.
### Penalties
Late payment interest is charged on overdue payments if the tax payments are made after the deadline. The amount of interest due to late payment is calculated on a monthly basis, but not more than ten years from the date when the tax became due.The interest rate shall be determined at least once a year, which must be higher than the interest rate of commercial lending by banks in the Republic of Kosovo.
The tax authority may also levy a tax penalty on taxpayers who claimed any tax refunds without eligibility. Penalties in these cases are levied based on the amounts claimed without eligibility.
## Tax audit process
The Kosovo tax system is based on self-assessment. Tax audits include all types of taxes that the individual is subject to. If any discrepancies result from the tax audit, the tax authorities issue an audit report and re-assessment notices, which the taxpayer can appeal to the Appeals Department within the tax authority.
A taxpayer may submit an amended tax declaration if one subsequently discovers an error in a tax declaration that has already been submitted. The deadline for submitting an amended declaration is three years after the due date of the declaration being amended.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations in general circumstances is six years.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
From a PIT perspective, during a tax audit, the main focus of the tax authorities is on areas relating to the calculation of gross income for employees (i.e. allowable and disallowable expenses paid for employees), wages paid in accordance to contracts, primary or secondary employee status, etc.
