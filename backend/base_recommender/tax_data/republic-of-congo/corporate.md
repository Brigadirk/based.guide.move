## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
The Finance Law for the year 2024 promulgated by the President of the Republic introduced changes to the General Tax Code and non-codified texts, the main ones of which are summarised below:
  * Deductibility of provisions set aside in accordance with Central African Banking Commission (COBAC) regulations. Provisions set aside by lending institutions and other legal entities in the same business sector, in accordance with COBAC Regulation R-2018/01, are deductible from their taxable profits for corporate income tax (CIT) purposes.
  * Restoration of the minimum tax (TSS) at the rate of 2%. The minimum tax is now levied at a rate of 2% for taxpayers whose income has remained in deficit for two consecutive years. 
  * Adjustment of the penalty for failure to produce supporting documents during the contradictory phase. Any production, after receipt of the tax assessment letter, of documents, supporting evidence, and other accounting vouchers duly requested during the contradictory phase is null and void.
  * Raising of the threshold for contentious files, copies of which must be sent to the Minister of Finance. The Minister of Finance must be sent a copy of all contentious claims where the amount of taxes contested, in principal and penalties, exceeds 1 billion CFA francs (XAF).
  * Raising of the thresholds for jurisdiction in contentious matters. The Departmental Director of Taxes and Domains is empowered to rule on all contentious claims where the disputed amount, in principal and penalties, does not exceed XAF 50 million. The General Director of Taxes and Domains is empowered to rule on all contentious claims whose disputed amount, in principal and penalties, does not exceed XAF 1 billion. The power to rule in contentious matters is exercised by the Minister of Finance above the threshold of competence of the General Director of Taxes and Domains.
  * Payment of processing fees to the public accountant. Payment of the processing fees is now made to the tax collector of the applicant's tax residence, against a receipt which must be attached to the claim, thus confirming current practice.
  * Clarification on the addressee of the certified cheque for payment of local taxes. The certified cheque has to be made payable to the Treasury.
  * Application of registration duties to independent counter-guarantees and all types of security not provided for under Organisation for the Harmonisation of Business Law in Africa (OHADA) law but accepted in the Congo. Autonomous counter-guarantee agreements and deeds recording all types of security not provided for under OHADA law but allowed in the Republic of Congo are subject to a proportional registration duty of 1%.
  * Application of registration duties to contracts and treaties deemed to be commercial deeds and made under private signature. Contracts and treaties deemed to be commercial deeds by articles 3 and 4 of the OHADA Uniform Act on General Commercial Law and made or entered into under private signature are subject to registration duties at the rate of 1% of the contract estimate made by the parties.
  * Application of registration duties to cash management agreements. Cash management agreements between group companies are subject to registration formality at a fixed rate of XAF 100,000. These deeds must be submitted to registration formality within three months of their date. However, their registration rate is a proportional duty of 1% of the amount of advances received or granted, when these agreements: 
    * are concluded between companies that do not belong to the same group,
    * are submitted late for registration or are not submitted for registration, or
    * do not include the mandatory information required by the law.
  * Application of registration duties to factoring agreements. Factoring agreements are subject to registration duties at the rate of 1% of the amount of the trade receivables or debts transferred to the factor, within three months of their date.
  * Transposition of Directive n°11/22-CEMAC-UEAC-010A-38 of 10 November 2022 on the harmonisation of member states' value-added tax (VAT) legislation. The legislator has transposed the provisions of the new Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC) directive on VAT into domestic law. The main effects of this transposition are as follows: 
    * The application of VAT to services provided in the Congo via e-commerce platforms established in the Congo or abroad, including commissions received by the operators of these platforms.
    * The exclusion of the right to deduct VAT on the purchase of goods distributed free of charge as part of advertising or sales promotion operations.
    * The requirement to regularise VAT deducted on fixed assets that are no longer included in the fixed assets list or have undergone a change in their situation with regard to the right to deduct, either in the event of a change in regulations, loss of taxable status, or a change of use, before the end of the fourth year following the year of acquisition.
    * No adjustment is required for VAT deducted on fixed assets sold before the end of the fourth year following the year of acquisition, provided that such sales were subject to VAT.
    * No requirement to regularise VAT deducted on purchases of goods that have subsequently been accidentally destroyed, scrapped, or stolen.
  * Application of the reduced VAT rate to transactions carried out by developers of special economic zones. Sales and acquisitions of goods and services by developers of special economic zones are subject to the reduced VAT rate (5%).
  * Deadline for declaring and paying the flat-rate tax on telecommunications company masts. The flat rate tax on telecommunications company masts is paid by 31 March of each year at the latest, by spontaneous declaration and payment by the taxpayer to the collector of the local authority where the mast is located.
  * The distribution key for the tax on fund transfer has been amended to introduce a 20% proportion for the remittance certification platform, to be paid to the service provider designated by the funds transfer regulation agency. From now on, all funds transfer agents must connect to this platform.
  * Land acquisitions and disposals are subject to the payment of fees corresponding to 1% of the acquisition or disposal price.
  * Duties, taxes, fees, and charges in the land transport sector. The Finance Law set the rate of the road safety fee at 10% of duties, taxes, and charges in the land transport sector, without however amending the provision that set this fee at XAF 500/passenger, and creates new duties, taxes, and charges and amends certain provisions.
  * Reduction of customs duties and taxes on new private cars and exemption of certificate of conformity. New private cars falling under certain codes are now subject to customs duties and taxes and to VAT at the reduced rate of 5% at the import; the rates of IT fees and community taxes remain unchanged.
  * Exclusion of gambling from the scope of the electronic transactions tax. Gambling has been excluded from the operations covered by the electronic transactions tax.
  * Introduction of the land freight management tax. The legislator has instituted a land freight management tax, payable by intra- and inter-state freight operators. The amount of this tax is set at XAF 60,000 for national freight operators and XAF 106,000 for interstate freight operators.
  * Creation of the Congo commercial real estate infrastructure development zone. The Congo commercial real estate infrastructure development zone aims to promote urban development through the development of state real estate infrastructures, facilitating the operation, upkeep, and maintenance of commercial buildings and related equipment. It includes the construction, rehabilitation, renovation, and completion of commercial real estate infrastructures in the Congo. Congo's commercial real estate infrastructures benefit from a privileged tax and customs regime. A regulatory text will set out the terms and conditions for approval under the tax and customs regime for the Congo's commercial real estate infrastructure development zone.
  * Decategorisation of certain everyday consumer goods. Staple goods, such as refined palm oil, frozen meats and edible offal, frozen sea fish, and powdered milk, have been decategorised as basic necessities and are now subject to 5% import duty and exempt from VAT, with the exception of computer fees and community taxes.
  * Setting export duties for processed wood products. Customs duties on exports of processed wood products are set as follows: 
    * 6% of the current value, which may be updated by regulation in line with market trends, for primary wood products.
    * 3% of the current value, which may be updated by regulation in line with market trends, for secondary wood products.
    * 0% of the free on board (FOB) value for third-process wood products.
  * Recovery of storage and custody fees for goods placed in bonded warehouses. Warehousing duties on goods placed in bonded warehouses are assessed and collected by the customs administration, in accordance with the procedures laid down by order of the Minister of Finance.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
## Taxable period
The taxable period is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Companies subject to the actual tax regime are required to file their tax returns and pay their taxes and duties online. Failure to comply with this obligation is subject to a penalty equal to 10% of the amount to be declared. The year-end tax returns for these companies must be attested and certified by a chartered accountant in the absence of a statutory auditor, failure to which these filings will not be received by the tax authorities.
Taxes, duties, fees, levies, and customs duties shall be paid at the one-stop shop regardless of tax residence. The modalities of organisation and operation of the one-stop shop shall be determined by regulation.
For localities that do not have a one-stop shop, the payment of taxes, duties, fees, and customs duties shall be made according to the common law procedure.
The annual CIT return is a specific form (_Déclaration Statistique et Fiscale_ or DSF) that should be prepared in accordance with OHADA accounting principles. The form cannot be completed electronically.
Companies have to use the CEMAC CIT return form, which has been modified to be compliant with Congolese tax law (new form for the determination of the CIT basis and new tax balances for debts and liabilities).
The books must be maintained in French and in CFA francs. This accounting system must follow the OHADA chart of accounts. All entries have to be booked under OHADA standards throughout the year.
The annual CIT return must be filed on 20 May at the latest (due to COVID-19, the annual CIT return related to FY 2019 can be filed on 25 August at the latest).
## Payment of tax and penalties
Resident companies are required to pay quarterly instalments of tax (20 February, 20 May, 25 August, and 20 November), and these quarterly instalments are generally calculated with reference to the most recent CIT return. Special calculations of instalments apply to new taxpayers.
Based on the self-assessment system, when submitting annual tax returns due by 20 May every year, taxpayers must pay the amount of tax calculated in the annual tax return to the extent this amount exceeds tax instalments paid during the year.
Non-resident companies and individuals shall appoint tax representatives in the Republic of Congo. The Congolese resident shall be considered as tax representative if the non-resident person fails to appoint a tax representative.
Penalties, surcharges, and interest for late payment claimed by the tax authorities shall be paid separately from the relevant principal duties via bank transfer or bank cheques.
Payment of penalties, surcharges, and interest for late payment shall be made in cash for amounts less than XAF 200,000 into the current account of the Public Treasury.
## Tax audit process
Tax audits are usually announced by a letter from the tax authorities to the entity concerned of their intention to audit, while stating the period to be audited and the taxes that will be covered by the audit.
During an audit of accounts or tax review, taxpayers shall, within eight days from receipt of a request list from the tax auditors, make available all requested information. 
Taxpayers whose annual turnover, excluding taxes, exceeds XAF 100 million, shall, from the first day of a general audit, share all internal and external audit reports with the tax auditors. The tax auditors may request any internal or external audit report relating to periods not covered by the accounting audit.
The tax authorities may organise meetings with the taxpayer to inform the taxpayer of the preliminary outcomes of the audit, and the taxpayer has the possibility to make counter remarks.
Thereafter, the tax authorities notify the taxpayer, in writing, of their proposed tax adjustments, and the taxpayer makes counter remarks in writing within 30 days from date of receipt of the tax adjustment notice.
Based on whether the tax authorities find the counter remarks from the taxpayer grounded or not, a letter confirming the tax adjustments or renouncing the proposed tax adjustments shall be sent to the taxpayer, who has the choice to either pay the taxes claimed, negotiate for a reduction of fines, or open up a tax litigation process.
The taxpayer may negotiate the taxes, fines, and the mode of payment of the tax claimed by the tax authorities thereby renouncing one’s right to open up tax litigation.
The taxpayer has the right to request from the Director General of Taxation and Real Estate a transactional mode of payment of fines or payment of tax by friendly settlement. If the taxpayer opts for the transaction, the taxpayer loses the right to object to the outcome of the transaction and is obligated to immediately pay the taxes due (principal and penalties) according to the agreement.
To open up a tax litigation process, the taxpayer will pay a prior deposit of 10% of the sum contested as guarantee (or a banking guarantee as security for litigation) and 5‰ (5 per thousand) of the sum contested for the treatment of the tax claim file and will submit the tax claim file to the Tax Head Office if the amount of the claim does not exceed XAF 1 billion and to the Director of Tax Department if the amount claimed is less than XAF 50 million.
When the amounts challenged by a taxpayer, in the context of a contentious claim, exceed XAF 1 billion, the said taxpayer must file a copy of one’s claim with the Minister in charge of Finance.
The Minister of Finance must be sent a copy of all contentious claims where the amount of taxes contested, in principal and penalties, exceeds XAF 1 billion.
Any production, after receipt of the tax assessment letter, of documents, supporting evidence, and other accounting vouchers duly requested during the contradictory phase is null and void.
The tax authorities will respond to the tax counter claim of the taxpayer, who, if not satisfied, could open a court claim.
## Statute of limitations
Generally, the statute of limitations period for CIT is four years following the year in which the tax was due. However, this rule does not apply in the case of fraudulent acts reported by the tax administration.
The recovery of tax debts from the Public Treasury is time-barred at the end of the tenth year following the year of collection if no act has interrupted the limitation period.
The collection of 3rd party taxes from their legal debtors will not be statute barred.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The tax authorities particularly focus on aspects such as:
  * Compliance of deductible expenses.
  * CIT compliance.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
A company is considered resident in the Republic of Congo if it has its registered office or principal office for all its activities in the Republic of Congo.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The 2020 Finance Act has introduced a definition to the notion of PE, to mean: an economic activity shall be deemed to be carried on in the Congo when such activity is habitually exercised either through a PE or through representatives without independent professional personality or when such activity results in operations that form a complete commercial cycle.


# Congo, Republic of
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
Generally, a deduction is allowed for all expenditures incurred to obtain, collect, and maintain business profits. To be deductible, expenses should be incurred necessarily for the normal purposes of the business and be supported by suitable evidence.
## Depreciation and depletion
In general, all types of fixed assets, except land, are depreciable for tax purposes as long as they can be shown to have been acquired for business purposes of the corporation. Depreciation must be calculated on the original purchase price. The straight-line method is used, and the Congolese General Tax Code sets forth maximum rates of depreciation. Goods costing less than XAF 500,000 per item may be written-off at purchase as expenses.
Depreciation recorded when the company is in a loss position may be carried forward without limitation and deducted from the first available taxable profits, provided it was appropriately disclosed in the annual CIT return.
Recoverable and identifiable packaging is regarded as a fixed asset and is recorded in a fixed asset account at the time of purchase. This packaging is regarded as returnable packaging when the supplier intends to act as the sole owner of the packaging.
Unrecoverable packaging is recorded as an expense and is deductible for tax purposes.
Exceptional accelerated depreciation may be authorised in certain circumstances for heavy equipment with a value of more than XAF 40 million. This special accelerated depreciation does not apply to private vehicles owned by the enterprises.
The following list contains maximum rates of depreciation as set forth in the General Tax Code:
Assets | Rates per year (%)  
---|---  
Construction | 5 to 20  
Fixed devices and equipment | 5 to 25  
Movable equipment | 10 to 100  
Transport materials | 5 to 33.33  
Furniture, fittings, and other equipment | 10 to 33.33  
Fishing equipment | 10 to 20  
Hotels, bars, and restaurants | 10 to 50  
Plastic equipment (moulding) | 10 to 33.33  
Equipment subject to chemical action | 20  
### Exceptional depreciation method
The exceptional depreciation method is an accelerated depreciation method.
Companies may elect the accelerated depreciation method for heavy materials and equipment that:
  * are purchased new for a value higher than XAF 40 million
  * have a useful life of at least three years
  * are used for manufacturing, processing, transport, and handling, and
  * are bound to an intensive use.


The application for the accelerated depreciation method must be submitted to the head office of taxes within three months of the purchase of the assets to be depreciated. The option is granted upon approval of the Ministry of Finances. If the administration fails to respond to the application for accelerated depreciation within three months, the application is tacitly granted.
Under the exceptional depreciation method, a 40% deduction may be taken in the year of acquisition of the previously mentioned assets, increased by the normal rate calculated on the residual value after application of the accelerated depreciation. These assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis thereafter.
## Goodwill
There is no specific provision relating to amortisation of goodwill in the Republic of Congo.
## Start-up expenses
There is no specific provision in the Congolese General Tax Code on the deduction of start-up expenses. Start-up expenses that occurred in the first year of incorporation (N) are deductible in the second year of operation (N+1).
According to the OHADA Uniform Act relating to Accounting Systems and Accountancy, start-up expenses can be amortised either in one year (in such a case, they are booked in the deductible expenses during the first fiscal year) or in two years (50% during the first fiscal year and 50% during the second fiscal year).
## Interest expenses
Interest is deductible, subject to the following conditions:
  * General limit: Regardless of the form under which a legal entity is registered, the deduction is allowed with an interest rate limited to the rate of the advances in current accounts on states funds of the Bank of the States of Central Africa (BEAC) raised by three points, on the condition that the registered capital has been completed paid off. This limit is also applicable to interest paid to financial institutions, companies of the same group, or any other companies.
  * For private limited companies and public limited companies, the deduction is allowed according to the status of control over the management of the enterprise, as follows: 
    * For shareholders who have control over the company _de facto_ or _de jure_ , the deduction is allowed only to the extent that the sums paid do not exceed, for the shareholders as a whole, half of the paid-up capital and are within the limit sets forth in the ‘general limit’.
    * For other shareholders, the ‘general limit’ applies.


## Charitable contributions
Donations and gifts made to beneficiaries in the Republic of Congo are deductible from CIT basis at a limit of 0.5‰. The limit is 0.5% as regards donations and subsidies made for the support and development of sport, natural calamities and accidental disasters. 50% of amounts of donations and payments upon the occurrence of a natural disaster or accidental disaster are deductible.
Total tax exemptions are granted for donations made to the state within the framework of the COVID-19 Solidarity Fund aimed to fight against COVID-19.
## Fines and penalties
Penalties relating to violation of regulations are not deductible.
## Taxes
Taxes, other than income taxes, are usually deductible. Examples of deductible taxes include customs duties, excise duties, payroll taxes, business tax and accessory taxes, registration taxes, and unrecoverable VAT.
CIT itself is not deductible, nor is the special tax on company-owned cars.
Taxes withheld on remuneration, paid to third parties (third parties taxes), and remitted to the tax office by a Congolese enterprise are not deductible.
## Net operating losses
For tax purposes, losses may be carried forward to offset profits earned in the three succeeding fiscal years. Carryback losses are not permissible.
As mentioned above, depreciation recorded when the company is in a loss position may be carried forward without limitation.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Allowable deductions include sums paid abroad to foreign companies for:
  * actual services, notably overhead for the operations made for the benefit of a company based in the Republic of Congo, including costs of studies; technical, financial, and accounting assistance; commissions and fees; and interests, and
  * use of patents, licences, trademarks, drawings, manufacturing processes, patterns, and similar rights to the extent the payer proves they correspond to actual operations, and they are neither abnormal nor excessive.


Subject to the provisions of tax treaties (France, Italy, Mauritius, and CEMAC), the deduction is allowed within a limit of 20% of taxable profits before deduction of the expenses in question. For specific activities, such as, namely, public works business, the limitation of deductibility is capped at 2% of turnover.
Deduction made to non-CEMAC residents for interest paid on interest is subject to respecting the provisions of the CEMAC foreign exchange control regulations. 
Any payments made from a foreign bank currency account within or outside the CEMAC would be deductible if prior authorisation was obtained.
In the event of losses, the rate is applied on the results of the last profit period that is not statutory limited. In the absence of profits during the period out of statutory limitation, the sums paid are not allowed as tax deductions.
When the sums are not allowed, as a whole or in part, in the deductible expenses, they are deemed to be paid benefits and are subject to tax on the dividends at the rate of 15%.
Royalties for the transfer or concession of patents, trademarks, drawings, and other similar titles are deductible to the extent the payer proves they are still valid. When these royalties benefit an enterprise contributing in the management or share capital of an enterprise in the Republic of Congo, they are deemed to be paid benefits and are subject to tax on the dividends at the rate of 15%.
Commission or brokerages relating to goods purchased on behalf of enterprises based in the Republic of Congo are allowable tax deductions at up to 5% of the purchase amount made by the central purchasing office, the head office, or the intermediaries. The reductions shall benefit enterprises based in the Republic of Congo. An original supplier's invoice must be attached to the intermediary's invoice.
The payer shall prove that:
  * the purchases necessitated the interventions of a broker or intermediary
  * the commissions provided better supply conditions compared with the actual situations on the market, and
  * the commissions are not excessive compared with the nature of the services.


In the event of an audit, amounts invoiced by foreign companies that do not respect the arm's-length principle are added back to the taxable basis for the Congolese company.


# Congo, Republic of
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
There is specific group taxation within the CEMAC area.
Where a joint stock company and a private limited company own either registered stock in a joint stock company or shares in a private limited company, the net proceeds of the share in the second company paid to the first during the financial year shall be deducted from the total net profit of the latter, less a percentage for costs and charges. This percentage is fixed at 10% of the total amount of the proceeds. This system shall apply when all of the following conditions are met:
  * The stocks or shares owned by the parent company represent at least 25% of the capital of the subsidiary company.
  * The parent company and subsidiary companies have a registered office in the CEMAC state (Cameroon, Central Africa Republic, Chad, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, and Republic of Congo).
  * The stocks or shares allotted at the time of issue are still registered in the name of the participating company, which undertakes to retain them for at least two consecutive years in registered form.


Another group taxation regime is also available upon option and under certain conditions, wherein the taxable profits of the group’s companies can be consolidated at the level of the holding company, which will pay the tax due.
## Transfer pricing
Companies registered in the Republic of Congo with gross annual turnover net of taxes equal to or exceeding XAF 500 million must keep transfer pricing documentation at the reach of the tax administration so as to justify the transfer pricing policy used in all transactions with legally related entities outside the Republic of Congo.
Targeted companies are required to spontaneously and annually provide to the tax administration a transfer pricing documentation, a light transfer pricing declaration, and a country-by-country (CbC) report within six months from filing their summary financial statements. Companies that fail to comply with this requirement will be fined at XAF 5 million prior to an eight-day formal notice.
The sums invoiced by a foreign company that are considered as not reflecting arm’s-length conditions must be reintegrated in the Congolese company’s financial year’s result, for a third of their amount.
To justify transfer pricing policy, companies shall ensure that the prices of the transactions are in conformity with the five different methods to set up the arm's-length principle (derived from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] recommendations).
During a tax audit, if the amounts invoiced by a foreign company do not reflect the arm's-length principle, these amounts would be completely added back to the tax base of the Congolese company.
The conclusion of advance transfer pricing agreements with the tax authorities is subject to the payment of XAF 10 million.
## Thin capitalisation
There are no specific thin capitalisation rules in the Republic of Congo.
## Holding companies
A taxation regime applies to incorporated holding companies complying with certain conditions.
Within this regime, capital gains on shares are:
  * subject to CIT at standard rate if the shares transferred have been held during less than two years
  * subject to a reduced CIT rate (25% of the standard rate, i.e. 7.5%) if the shares transferred have been held during more than two years, and
  * tax exempted if (i) the shares transferred have been held for more than two years and (ii) the shares held include at least 60% of shares of CEMAC resident companies.


In addition, these companies benefit from other tax advantages, such as a WHT exemption on certain types of interest as well as a reduced WHT on dividends paid (i.e. 50% of applicable rate).
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There is no provision under Congolese tax law related to CFCs.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
The current investment regime in the Republic of Congo was set out by Law No. 6-2003 of 18 January 2003, which established the investment charter. The charter's application, Decree No. 2004-30 of 18 February 2004, established modes of business registration.
  * Scope: The following may be registered under the investment charter: 
    * Businesses wishing to pursue an activity in the Republic of Congo, except for activities such as brokerage, trade, import, and production of arms, and import or processing of toxic waste and by products.
    * Under certain conditions, commercial activities linked to collection, storage, distribution, and export of locally produced products, except alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
    * New activities (as opposed to pre-existing activities).
    * Forestry businesses benefiting from a forestry permit called the forestry development unit.
    * New companies coming from the redemption of a registered company.
  * Conditions of eligibility for the investment charter: To be eligible, a company must satisfy the following conditions:

  * Registration procedure: Entitlement to the benefits prescribed by the charter is subject to obtaining a registration agreement, provided by the National Investment Commission.
  * Fiscal and customs benefits set out by the Investment Charter: These benefits vary according to privileged regimes, motivation measures, and in a general manner.


The goods eligible for the customs incentives from the investment charter are those that have a direct link with the fiscal year of the approved activity.
Any company admitted to one of the authorised derogatory regimes (i.e. the production sharing contract regime or the establishment agreement regime) may no longer, as of 1 January 2021, benefit from another privileged regime.
## Privileged regimes
The charter sets out three privileged regimes:
  * General regime (G).
  * Special regime (S).
  * Preferential development zone regime.


### General regime (G)
The general regime applies to businesses that fulfil the aforementioned general requirements and carry out investments greater than or equal to XAF 100 million.
Special advantages are conferred according to the period of activity of the registered business.
During the set-up period and the first three exploitation tax years, the company receives several benefits, as follows:
  * In customs matters, the company benefits from the provisions of the CEMAC customs code relative to asset improvement mechanisms for export activity and from the suspension of customs duty in the form of temporary admission or franchise for natural resource research activities.
  * In fiscal matters, the company benefits from the 50% reduction of registration fees for business foundation, increases in capital, company mergers, and transfer of company stocks and shares.


For the three first exploitation tax years and from the first year of sale or first service, the following fiscal benefits are added with the aforementioned reduction of registration duties:
  * Total exemption from the tax on company earnings. 
    * Companies that are subject to CIT because of their size or activity will be exempt from CIT.
    * Businesses that are subject to personal income tax (PIT) because of their size or activity will be exempt from PIT.
  * The authorisation to proceed to accelerated depreciation.
  * The authorisation to carry forward losses for the first three tax years.
  * The application of zero-rate VAT on exported products.


### Special regime (S)
The special regime applies to businesses that fulfil the aforementioned general requirements and carry out investments between XAF 30 million and XAF 100 million.
In addition to the advantages of the aforementioned (G) regime, businesses registered under the (S) regime benefit during the set-up period and the first three exploitation tax years from the moderation of registration duties for the incorporation of the business, increases in capital, company mergers, and transfer of company stocks and shares.
This moderation of registration duties is granted exclusively by decree of the Minister in charge of the Economy and Finances upon a decision of the National Investment Commission.
### Preferential development zone regime
All exporting businesses registered under the investment charter are eligible for the preferential development zone system, including free-trade zones.
The institution, organisation, and function of the preferential development zone are fixed by a specific text.
## Incentives to set up in remote areas
All new businesses registered under (G) or (S) regimes that are located in a remote area benefit from a reduction of 50% on the tax on company earnings in the fourth and fifth year following the first three tax years for which the business benefited from total exemption from the tax on earnings or PIT.
The business is considered as belonging to a remote area from the moment its production units are set-up and 90% of the production unit workforce is working in the remote location.
The appraisal of a zone's location results from the exclusive competency of the National Investment Commission.
## Incentives for social and cultural investment
All new businesses registered under (G) or (S) regimes carrying out investments of a social and cultural character may benefit from a fiscal reduction by ministerial decree of the Minister in charge of Finance and the Economy, upon the decision of the National Investment Commission.
These benefits may not, however, be added to those mentioned above and allocated to remote areas, even if the business concerned is set-up in such a location.
## General measures
For the duration of the privileged regime, and subject to current texts, the company shall enjoy fiscal stability in terms of local and state taxes.
Privileged regimes (G) and (S) are allocated only once and are not renewable. The business may receive fiscal and customs advantages pertaining to the set-up period.
Fiscal advantages concerning the exploitation period are applicable only after the set-up period.
The end of the set-up period is certified by decision of the Minister in charge of Finance and the Economy after the adoption of the verification report by the National Investment Commission.
Respect of the aforementioned general requirements set out by the charter is a prerequisite for benefiting from these motivation measures.
## Export incentives
A measure is reserved for businesses that export at least 20% of their production.
The benefits are as follows:
  * The provisions of the CEMAC customs code, relating to asset improvement mechanisms.
  * Exemption from customs duties and taxes on manufactured products, except computing fees and statistic tax.
  * Application of a zero-rate VAT on exported products.


Non-manufactured goods remain subject to the common law export system.
## Incentive to reinvest earnings
A measure is reserved for businesses that carry out new investments of at least one-third of existing assets.

Services rendered by foreign suppliers are subject to a WHT. There are four WHT rates, which include the following:
  * General rate of 20%.
  * Average rate of 10%.
  * Reduced rate of 5.75%.
  * Fixed rate of 5%.


In addition, companies that have no tax residence in the Republic of Congo are subject to a 20% WHT if they earn revenues realised in the Republic of Congo or coming from the Republic of Congo, and which come from works or services of any nature performed or used in the Republic of Congo. This 20% WHT also includes premiums transferred abroad in reinsurance above the ceiling of 50% and collected by companies not domiciled in the CIMA member states (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Republic of Congo, Cote d’Ivoire, Gabon, Guinea Bissau, Equatorial Guinea, Mali, Niger, Central Africa Republic, Senegal, and Togo).
WHT does not apply to resident suppliers of a country that has signed an international tax treaty with the Republic of Congo, provided certain conditions are met.
The 2023 Finance Law introduces a 10% WHT on sums paid by a Congolese resident to a resident in any CEMAC member country for services rendered.
Following the double tax treaty (DTT) signed with China, the following rates are applicable:
  * Dividends: 5% if the beneficial owner is a company directly holding at least 25% of the paying company's capital; otherwise, 10%.
  * Interest: 10%.
  * Royalties: 5%.


### Payments made by building and public work companies to their sub-contractors
WHT is applicable on payments made by building and public work companies to their sub-contractors, including to engineering offices, at the following rates:
  * 3% for sub-contractors taxable on their net profit.
  * 10% for sub-contractors taxable on a deemed profit (_Régime du forfait_).


Non-observances, omissions, or underpayments are sanctioned by an XAF 5 million fine and by the non-deductibility of the amounts so paid. Late payments are sanctioned by a 2% penalty per month or portion of month, with a maximum penalty of 100%.
For the considered sub-contractors, said withholding is considered as an instalment of tax.
### Dividends
Dividends distributed by a Congolese company are subject to a 15% WHT unless a different rate applies under an international tax treaty (e.g. China, France, Italy, Mauritius, CEMAC). The same rate applies for dividends distributed to a resident shareholder.
The Congo-China treaty provides a 5% WHT if the beneficial owner is a company directly holding at least 25% of the paying company's capital; otherwise, 10%.
Under the tax treaties between France and the Republic of Congo and between Italy and the Republic of Congo, the applicable WHT rate is 15%.
Under the tax treaty between Mauritius and the Republic of Congo, the applicable WHT rate is 5%.
There is no specific rate defined in the CEMAC tax treaty.
### Attendance fees
Attendance fees are subject to a 17% WHT.
## Payments to local independent contractors
Payments to local independent contractors (self-employed contractors, i.e. those not registered with the Congolese Trade Registry) are subject to a WHT at the rate of 10% from such payments, to be remitted to the Public Treasury.
Late remittance of the WHT is subject to a late payment penalty of 50% within the first two months and 100% if the late payment exceeds two months.
The application of the 10% WHT also applies to companies regrouping professionals and increases penalties in case of non-payment (200% penalty).
Revenues of legal entities subject to CIT are excluded from the application of the WHT of 10%.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
Congolese-registered companies are taxed on the territoriality principle. As a result, Congolese companies engaged in business outside of the Republic of Congo are not taxed in the Republic of Congo on the related profits.
In the absence of a tax treaty stating otherwise, a non-resident company is liable for corporate income tax (CIT) on income realised in the Republic of Congo or derived from or resulting from work/services of any nature supplied or used in the Republic of Congo.
The standard CIT rate in the Republic of Congo is 28%, with certain exceptions.
A withholding tax (WHT) of 5%, 5.75%, 10%, or 20% is imposed on income sourced in the Republic of Congo that is derived by foreign companies not necessarily engaged in activities in the Republic of Congo (_see the section for more information_).
## Minimum tax
The minimum tax payable is 1% of the annual turnover and cannot be less than XAF 1 million (XAF 500,000 if annual turnover is less than XAF 10 million).
The 1% rate is applied to the sum of gross turnovers, products, and benefits realised by the company in the most recent year in which it earned a profit. The 1% tax is not deductible for CIT purposes. However, in a company's first profit-making year after incurring the losses, half of the 1% tax is deductible.
The minimum tax is 1% of the taxable base, with a minimum amount payable of XAF 1 million, for companies that are totally exempt from CIT during the extension of their Convention of Establishment and/or any specific agreement.
The minimum tax is levied at a rate of 2% for taxpayers whose income has remained in deficit for two consecutive years. The minimum tax must now be paid between 10 March and 20 March of each year.
## Industry specific rates
Companies in the following sectors are exempt from CIT:
  * Agriculture.
  * Agro pastoral.
  * Poultry or fishing.


A CIT rate of 25% applies for microfinance companies and private schools organised as a company.
A CIT rate of 28% applies for mining companies and real estate companies.
A CIT rate of 33% is applied on a deemed profit equal to 22% of the total gross remuneration (i.e. an effective tax rate of 7.26% of the taxable turnover made in the Republic of Congo) derived from services rendered by:
  * Foreign companies that qualify for this simplified tax regime.
  * Local companies and branches that realise more than 70% of their annual turnover with oil companies and oil services companies (in this case, the deemed profit tax is regarded as a final burden).
  * Catering activities performed or delivered on petroleum sites.


Note that these companies revert to the general taxation regime the second year after the turnover realised with oil and gas sector companies becomes less than 70% of their annual turnover.
A substantiated request shall be made to the Director General of Taxation between 10 October and 20 October of the second year, who shall reply, at the latest, by 15 December of the same year.
## Headquarters operations of foreign companies
The headquarters operations of foreign enterprises taxation regime is subject to prior approval by the tax authorities.
If enacted, headquarters operations of foreign enterprises and international groups will be granted a favourable tax status in the Republic of Congo. For those that qualify, CIT is charged on a deemed profit equivalent to a prescribed percentage of headquarters expenses, the percentage of which is currently unknown.
To qualify, the headquarters must be registered under the form of a public limited company or branch and must act solely for the benefit of the group in the area of management, control, or coordination.
## Global flat taxation
The global flat tax is at 5% (of the annual turnover) or 8% (of the annual margin) and applies in lieu of the standard CIT rate. It is calculated on the annual turnover of enterprises taxable under the flat rate regime, whose turnover does not exceed XAF 100 million.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
The Congolese VAT rate is 18%. In addition to VAT, a surtax calculated at the rate of 5% applies to the amount of VAT, which must be invoiced and paid at the same time as the VAT. Therefore, the VAT rate is globally 18.9%. The surtax is not deductible (final cost).
A reduced VAT at the rate of 5% is levied on some listed products, gas oil products, and lubricants imported from border countries by forestry companies registered in the Congo. Since the publication of the Finance Act for 2024, sales and acquisitions of goods and services by developers of special economic zones are also subject to the reduced VAT rate of 5%.
Under the provisions of the VAT Law, all economic activities (including services provided in the Congo via e-commerce platforms established in the Congo or abroad, the same applies to commissions received by the operators of these platforms) conducted in the Republic of Congo are subject to VAT, regardless of their purpose, profitability, or the legal status of the business performing them, and irrespective of whether these activities are habitual, occasional, or originate in the Republic of Congo or from a foreign country. Therefore, any person, natural or legal, engaged in an industrial, commercial, or professional activity is subject to VAT unless specifically exempt by law.
Service is considered as provided in the Republic of Congo when the service is used, exploited, or materially locatable in the Republic of Congo or, for the provision of intangible services, when the recipient is established in the Republic of Congo.
In principle, an entrepreneur is entitled to credit the VAT paid on purchases of goods, equipment, and services for use in business (input VAT) against the total of the tax charges to one's customers for deliveries made and services rendered (output VAT).
Taxpayers not exclusively carrying out transactions giving rise to a VAT deduction shall deduct VAT proportionally on the portion of the income pertaining to taxable transactions.
VAT payers carrying structural VAT credit have the obligation to do inventories in the presence of tax administration representatives for companies in October, failure to which the VAT credit shall be cancelled.
VAT paid on behalf of foreign suppliers is not deductible, provided that the related services have not been subject to income tax in the Republic of Congo.
VAT payers have the obligation to provide an excerpt of their VAT trial balance of each account on VAT in accordance with the accounting system used by the company, failure to which all VAT deductions shall be added back.
Taxpayers without a Tax Identification Number (NIU) and a receipt issued in their name by the collection service, indicating the amount of VAT paid, will lose the right to deduct the VAT on custom clearance duties on goods.
Exporters subject to VAT who realise more than 80% of their sale transactions abroad are obligated to withhold VAT paid on the purchases of goods and services (the list of exporters entitled to withhold VAT will be published by the tax authorities).
VAT resulting from tax assessment is not deductible.
VAT paid in cash in connection with invoices exceeding XAF 200,000 is not deductible.
A VAT return must be filed on a monthly basis before the 20th day of every month.

## Computer royalty
Computer royalty at a varying rate from 0.5% to 2% to cover expenses incurred by the Customs Administration on computer data processing is applicable without exception or exemption to all importation and exportation of goods. The royalty applies on the customs taxable value of any imported or exported goods in the Republic of Congo. Computer royalty at 0% is applicable to transactions relating to donations, projects, and other imports carried out by embassies, international organisations, non-governmental organisations covered by a headquarters agreement, and on the export of crude oil.
