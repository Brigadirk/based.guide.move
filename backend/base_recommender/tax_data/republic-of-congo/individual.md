# Congo, Republic of
## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
The Republic of Congo taxes its residents on their worldwide income and taxes non-residents on their Congolese income.
An individual domiciled in the Republic of Congo, whether of Congolese or foreign nationality, is liable for personal income tax (PIT) on one’s worldwide income. Tax treaties may exempt specific types of foreign-source income from Congolese PIT, but the exempt income is still taken into account in determining the effective rate of Congolese tax payable on the individual's taxable income. Tax is also levied on some capital gains.
An individual who is not domiciled in the Republic of Congo is liable for Congolese tax only on income from Congolese sources (including income attributed to the Republic of Congo by a tax treaty) and on capital gains from the disposal of certain assets.
In the case of dividends, interests, and royalties from Congolese sources, a non-domiciled individual's tax liability is usually settled by withholding taxes (WHTs).
On other income, such as salaries for work performed in the Republic of Congo, profits of a business operating there, and income from Congolese real estate, a non-domiciled individual is liable for PIT at the same graduated rates as a domiciled individual. The non-domiciled individual is regarded as married with no dependent if of French nationality and single with no dependent in other cases.
A non-domiciled individual who is not resident in a country that has a tax treaty with the Republic of Congo may be liable for PIT at the graduated rates on five times the annual rental value of any residence available in the Republic of Congo if this figure exceeds Congolese-source income that would otherwise be taxed at the graduated rates.
Specific rules apply for salaries for duties performed in the Republic of Congo received by foreign employees seconded to work in the Republic of Congo for limited periods.
## Personal income tax rates
PIT rates are fixed at the end of the year to which they relate. The rates are applied progressively in that they increase with the taxpayer's taxable income. The rates for the tax year as reformed in the Finance Act of 2014 are as follows:
Taxable income (XAF*) | Rate applicable to income band (%)  
---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 464,000 | 1  
464,000 | 1,000,000 | 10  
1,000,000 | 3,000,000 | 25  
3,000,000 | 40  
* CFA francs
Generally, the PIT rates are the same for domiciled and non-domiciled individuals. However, a tax rate of 20% is imposed on non-commercial income of a non-domiciled individual.
A tax rate of 20% is also imposed on salaries for duties performed in the Republic of Congo by foreign employees seconded to work in the Republic of Congo for limited periods.
## Global flat taxation
The global flat tax is at the rate of 5% (on annual turnover) or 8% (on annual margin). This taxation regime is applicable to persons with an annual income of not more than 152,449 euros (EUR) who keep minimal cash accounts.

## Taxable period
PIT is assessed on the income earned during a calendar year, except that income derived from carrying on a business is assessed on the results for the accounting year ending within that calendar year.
## Tax returns
Every individual liable for income tax is required to complete a tax return based on the year's income and file it by 1 March following the end of that year.
## Payment of tax
Income tax is generally withheld from salaries under the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system. Income from most other Congolese sources is received after the savings-rate tax has been deducted.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
## Employment expenses
The following items are deductible in computing taxable income from employment:
  * Social security contributions.
  * A standard deduction of 20% of salary income after the above contribution.


## Personal deductions
### Alimony
Alimony payments are allowed as deductions from taxable income.
### Interest expenses
Interest on loans contracted for the construction and purchase of real estate where the owner reserves the possession for one’s self (principal residence of the taxpayer) is deductible. The deduction is limited to the six first annual repayments, up to XAF 1 million _per annum_.
### Annuities
Mandatory and free annuities in arrears are deductible from taxable income.
### Healthcare expenses
Medical fees incurred by the taxpayer and dependants are deductible, with the exception of medical care expenses, prostheses, hospitalisation, and pharmaceutical expenses, at up to 10% of net income and up to XAF 200,000 maximum.
## Income splitting system
Tax relief is given to families by means of the income splitting or unit system rather than by personal deductions or allowances. Under this system, the total taxable income of the family group is divided into a number of units, and the tax applicable to a single unit is multiplied by the total number of units to give the total amount of tax payable.
An unmarried person is counted for one unit, a married couple is counted as two units, and each dependent child is a half unit. A supplementary half is given for the third and each subsequent child, up to 6.5 units.
Since tax rates are progressive, a family normally suffers less tax under the income splitting system than if tax were charged at the rate applicable to its total income. This is because the more units into which the family's total income divides, the lower the percentage rate applicable to each unit will be.
Children cease to be considered dependent when they reach the age of 21. However, they may elect to be treated as dependant up to the age of 25 if full time students. If a taxpayer is a widow or widower with one or more dependent children, the number of units is calculated as if the other spouse were still alive.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
Total taxable income, for the purposes of PIT, is the aggregate of net income (i.e. profits arising from an occupation or business, non-commercial activities, agriculture, securities, real estate, and from capital gains) reduced by various deductions.
## Basis of assessment
PIT is assessed on family groups. Thus, a father's return must normally include any income earned by his wife and dependent children, although a father may elect for the children's income to be taxed separately if this is advantageous. A wife may be taxed separately if she is separated from her husband or if divorce proceedings have begun.
## Employment income
In addition to wages and salaries, employment income includes cost-of-living, housing, education, other allowances, and benefits in kind.
## Business income
In general, business profits for individuals are computed as those for companies.
Non-commercial income comprises income from professional activities and income not falling within any of the other categories.
## Dividend income
Dividends from Congolese resident companies are included in taxable income. However, at the time the dividends are paid, tax is withheld at the rate of 15% by the resident company.
## Interest income
Interest from most sources is taxable and is included in taxable income.
Interest from Congolese resident companies is included in taxable income. However, at the time the interests are paid, tax is withheld at the rate of 20% by the resident company.
## Rents from real estate
Rents received, less related expenses, must be included in taxable income. Expenses allowed include interest for maintenance, construction, repair, and improvements, plus a notional deduction to cover management, insurance, and depreciation of 30% of gross rents.
A tax equal to one-twelfth of the rents due within the year (or in proportion of the rents due till the end of the year for new lease agreements) is deducted by the tenant on behalf of the owner.
