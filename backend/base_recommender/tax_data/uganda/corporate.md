## Taxable period
A normal period of 12 months is known as a year of income. This spans from 1 July to 30 June. On application, a taxpayer may be allowed to use a substituted year of income, which is a 12-month period other than the normal year of income.
## Tax returns
The ITA provides for two provisional returns within a 12-month period (financial year). The first provisional return is due within the first six months of the accounting year while the second is due by the end of the 12th month of the accounting year.
The due date for filing of provisional returns is the date of payment of tax.
The self-assessment return is due by the end of the sixth month after the end of the accounting year.
Electronic filing applies for all tax returns.
## Payment of tax
For all companies, a system of provisional payments on account, based on estimated profits, is in place. The first payment of 50% is due by the end of the sixth month of the accounting period, and the second payment is due by the end of the 12th month. The balance is expected to be paid together with the final self-assessment return by the end of the sixth month after the accounting period.
A person who fails to pay tax due by the due date is subject to interest on late payment of tax at a rate of 2%. Interest is capped to the aggregate of the principal tax and penal tax.
## Tax audit process
In most cases, audits are initiated by the URA, which notifies the taxpayer of the records they need to prepare before commencement of the audit. The URA then reviews the records. This is normally done at the premises of the taxpayer, where the URA can obtain the necessary clarifications from the bookkeepers.
The audit findings are then communicated to the taxpayer subsequent to whom an assessment is raised. If the taxpayer does not agree with the objection decision, they may appeal first to the Tax Appeals Tribunal.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations is three years. However, since the Tax Procedures Code Act provides for a five-year document retention period, in practice a five-year review is applied.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The focus of the URA keeps shifting but is generally based on the risk analysis of the information availed to them. There is continued focus on transfer pricing, international payments, and taxpayer ledger reconciliations.
Additionally, the URA is consistently reminding taxpayers to comply with the electronic fiscal receipting and invoicing solution system.


# Uganda
## Corporate - Corporate residence

A company is resident in Uganda for a year of income if it meets one of the following criteria:
  * Is incorporated or formed under the laws of Uganda.
  * Has its management and control exercised in Uganda at any time during the year of income.
  * Undertakes the majority of its operations in Uganda during a year of income.


## Permanent establishment (PE)
Effectively 1 July 2024, the term ’permanent establishment’ (formerly called ‘a branch’) has been defined to mean a fixed place of business through which the business of the enterprise is wholly or partly carried on and includes: 
  * a place of management
  * a branch
  * an office
  * a factory
  * a workshop
  * a warehouse, in relation to a person providing storage facilities to others

  * substantial equipment or machinery that is operated, or is available for operation, in Uganda for a period of, or periods amounting in aggregate to, 90 days or more in any 12-month period that commences or ends during the year of income.




# Uganda
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
The ITA sets out the following conditions for deductibility of an expense:
  * There must be an expenditure or loss.
  * The expenditure or loss must be incurred by a person during the year of income.
  * The expenditure must be incurred in the production of income included in gross income.


A taxpayer who is accounting for tax purposes on an accrual basis derives income when it is receivable by the taxpayer and incurs expenditure when it is payable by the taxpayer.
An amount is treated as payable by the taxpayer when all the events that determine liability have occurred and the amount of the liability can be determined with reasonable accuracy, but not before economic performance with respect to the amount occurs. Economic performance occurs:
  * with respect to the acquisition of services or property, at the time the services or property are provided
  * with respect to the use of property, at the time the property is used, or
  * in any other case, at the time the taxpayer makes payment in full satisfaction of the liability.


Contingent liabilities are not tax-deductible in Uganda.
## Depreciation
A deduction is allowed for the depreciation of the person’s depreciable assets, other than minor assets, in accordance with the appropriate applicable rates. The ITA allows a taxpayer a deduction for the depreciation of their depreciable assets on a reducing-balance basis. Depreciable assets are classified in three classes as follows:
Class | Assets included | Rate of tax depreciation (%)  
---|---|---  
1 | Computers and data handling equipment. | 40  
2 | Plant and machinery used in farming, manufacturing, and mining. | 30  
3 | Automobiles; buses and minibuses; construction and earth moving equipment; specialised trucks, tractors, trailers, and trailer mounted containers; rail cars, locomotives, and equipment; vessels, barges, tugs, and similar water transportation equipment; aircraft; specialised public utility plant, equipment, and machinery; office furniture, fixtures, and equipment; and any depreciable asset not included in another class. | 20  
### Industrial building allowance
A company is eligible for an industrial building allowance on its industrial and commercial buildings at a tax rate of 5% _per annum_ on a straight-line basis. The industrial building allowance will be granted on the actual cost incurred in constructing the buildings.
An industrial building is defined to mean any building that is wholly or partly used, or held ready for use, by a person in manufacturing operations, research and development into improved or new methods of manufacture, mining operations, an approved hotel business, an approved hospital, or approved commercial buildings.
### Initial allowance
Effective 1 July 2023, the 50% and 20% initial allowances granted to new eligible business assets and industrial buildings have been removed.
## Goodwill
An intangible asset is amortisable over its useful life. To the extent that the useful life of the underlying asset that gives rise to goodwill can be determined, then the goodwill may be deductible over the useful life of the asset.
## Start-up expenses
A company setting up business for the first time or engaged in the initial public offer at the stock market will be entitled to a tax deduction for all its start-up costs that are of capital nature that would otherwise not be tax-deductible under the ordinary tax rules. The start-up costs will be allowed as tax-deductible costs over a period of four years on a straight-line basis at the rate of 25% _per annum_.
## Interest expenses
Interest is deductible if the interest is incurred in respect of a debt obligation by the company in the production of income included in the company’s gross income. Interest arising from non-trade-related debt obligation is not deductible. Deferred interest is deductible when paid.
Interest charged before capital investment is put to use must be capitalised. Interest incurred after capital investment is put to use is allowed as a deduction.
The previous thin capitalisation rules were repealed and replaced by a provision that limits the deductibility of interest by a taxpayer who is a member of a group to 30% of the tax EBITDA. The excess interest can be carried forward for a maximum of three years. This interest limitation does not apply to financial institutions, including micro-finance deposit taking institution, tier 4 micro-finance institutions, or a person carrying on insurance business.
## Bad debt
A deduction is allowed for bad debt only if:
  * the amount was included in the person’s income in the year of income
  * it is in respect of money that was lent in the ordinary course of business by a financial institution in the production of income, or
  * the amount of the debt claim was in respect of a loan granted to any person by a financial institution for the purpose of farming, forestry, fish farming, beekeeping, animal and poultry husbandry, or similar operations.


For the bad debt to be deductible, the taxpayer must demonstrate to the URA that reasonable steps to collect the debt were taken and that the taxpayer failed to recover the debt. In relation to a financial institution, it should be a debt in respect of which a loss reserve held against presently identified losses or potential losses, and which is therefore not available to meet losses that subsequently materialise, has been made.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable donations are deductible if made to amateur sporting associations; religious, charitable, or educational institutions whose object is not for profit; trade unions; and other similar associations that have been issued with a written ruling by the Commissioner currently in force stating that it is an exempt organisation. The donations should not exceed 5% of the person’s chargeable income.
## Meals, refreshments, and entertainment
Expenses for meals, refreshments, and entertainment are deductible only where the value is included in the employment income of the employees or is excluded from employment income owing to the fact that it is provided on equal terms to all workers.
## Pension expenses
Employers are allowed a deduction for the contributions made to pension schemes on behalf of their employees. Employees, on the other hand, do not get a deduction for the contributions they make to pension funds.
## Payment for directors
Directors are treated as employees, so expenses incurred in respect of directors are deductible expenses.
## Bribes, kickbacks, illegal payments
Non-business expenses are not tax-deductible, including those of a private nature.
## Fines and penalties
No deduction is allowed for any fine or similar penalty paid to a government or its sub-division for breach of any law.
## Taxes
No deduction is allowed for income tax payable in Uganda or in a foreign country.
## Other significant items
No deduction is allowed for the following other expenditures:
  * Any expenditure or loss of a domestic or private nature.
  * Any expenditure or loss of a capital nature.
  * Any expenditure or loss recoverable under insurance contract or indemnity.
  * Any contribution or similar payment made to a retirement fund by the employee or for the benefit of any other person (e.g. National Social Security Fund [NSSF] contributions).
  * Any premium or similar payment made in respect of a life insurance policy for the life of the person paying the premium or on the life of some other person.
  * Any income appropriated to a reserve fund or capitalised in any way.
  * The amount of pension paid to any person.
  * Deduction of expenses falling under the new EFRIS will only be allowed if supported by an e-invoice or e-receipt (effective from 1 January 2021).
  * Any expenditure above UGX 5 million in one transaction on goods and services from a supplier who does not have a taxpayer identification number.
  * Expenses of a person who purchases goods or services from a supplier who is designated to use the e-invoicing system unless the expenses are supported by e-invoices or e-receipts.


## Net operating losses
A deduction is allowed for any assessed tax losses carried forward from previous years of income. Such tax losses are carried forward and deducted against future taxable profit of the business in the subsequent years of income. Effective 1 July 2023, the losses can be carried forward for seven years, following which only 50% of the losses is allowed as a deduction. There is also ring-fencing of losses in the following circumstances:
  * Where, during a year of income, there has been a change of 50% or more in the underlying ownership of a company, as compared with its ownership one year previously, the company is not permitted to deduct an assessed loss in the year of income or in subsequent years, unless the company, for a period of two years after the change or until the assessed loss has been exhausted if that occurs within two years after the change,: 
    * continues to carry on the same business after the change as it carried on before the change and
    * does not engage in any new business or investment after the change where the primary purpose of the company or the beneficial owners of the company is to utilise the assessed loss so as to reduce the tax payable on the income arising from the new business or investment.
  * In cases where losses relate to farming, the assessed farming loss can only be deducted from farming income of the taxpayer in the following year and not from any other income.


There is no provision for carryback of losses in Uganda.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments to foreign affiliates are deductible as long as they are charged at an arm's length and incurred in the production of income.


# Uganda
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
There are no specific provisions in the law covering groups, so companies in a group do not get any special treatment for tax purposes in Uganda.
## Transfer pricing
The transfer pricing regulations apply to controlled transactions if a person who is a party to the transactions is located in and is subject to tax in Uganda and the other person who is a party to the transaction is located in or outside Uganda.
The URA Practice Note issued on 14 May 2012 gives details on the transfer pricing documentation to be maintained by the taxpayer. These include company details and transaction details, including agreements and the pricing methodology used in determining the arm's-length price.
In addition, the anti-avoidance provisions contained in Sections 90 and 91 of the ITA require transactions between associates to be at an arm’s-length. These are the provisions that are often applied by the URA in instances where they are of the view that a non-resident person may be transferring profits from Uganda.
The Commissioner may also make adjustments to transactions between persons who are in an employment relationship although the Transfer Pricing Regulations do not apply to transactions between employers and employees.
A penal tax of UGX 50 million is due on the taxpayer for failure to provide records requested by the Commissioner in respect of transfer pricing.
## Thin capitalisation
Uganda no longer has thin capitalisation rules. Interest deductibility is limited based on 30% tax EBITDA.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Uganda does not have a CFC regime.


# Uganda
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Tax is imposed on the income of a non-resident company derived from running a branch in Uganda. The chargeable income of a branch in Uganda is taxed at the corporation tax rate of 30% after deduction of allowable expenses.
In addition to corporation tax, branches are subject to extra tax at a rate of 15% on any repatriated income for a year of income. The repatriated income is calculated using the A + (B - C) - D approach. Where A is the net assets at the beginning of the year, B is the net profit for the year, C is the tax charge for the year, and D is the net assets at the end of the year.
On the other hand, the tax imposed on the income of a non-resident person attributable to activities of a PE includes (i) the income derived from the sales of goods or merchandise in Uganda or similar kind or (ii) the income of other business activities carried on in Uganda that are of the same or similar kind as those carried out through the PE. The gross income of a PE excludes charges by a PE to the head office by way of royalties, commission for specific services performed or for management, or interest on moneys lent to the head office. Similarly, no deduction for such expenses (i.e. royalties, commissions, etc.) is allowed.

# Uganda
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Payments to non-resident persons
According to Section 83(1) of the ITA, a tax is imposed on every non-resident person who derives any dividend, interest, royalty, rent, natural resource payment, or management charge from sources in Uganda. WHT at a rate 15% therefore applies on gross dividend payments, interest, management fees, and royalty payments in respect of non-treaty countries.
Rent for this purpose means a payment for the use of land and buildings. This means that a tenant paying rent to a non-resident landlord in respect of land and buildings in Uganda is required to deduct WHT on the gross payments at a rate of 15%.
However, Section 83(5) exempts interest paid by a resident company in respect of debentures that:
  * were issued by the company outside Uganda for the purpose of raising a loan outside Uganda
  * were widely issued for the purpose of raising funds for use by the company in a business carried on in Uganda or the interest is paid to a bank or a financial institution of a public character, and
  * the interest is paid outside Uganda.


A ‘debenture’ is defined in the ITA as any form of debt, including debenture stock, mortgage stock, loan, loan stock, or any similar instrument acknowledging indebtedness, whether secured or unsecured. The term ‘widely issued’ is also specifically defined.
Also, the rate of WHT on interest derived by a non-resident person from government securities is 20%. However, interest paid on government securities with a maturity period of at least ten years is subject to a 10% WHT.
Payment of re-insurance premiums to non-resident persons is subject to WHT at a rate of 10%. The requirement to withhold tax does not apply to the African Reinsurance Corporation (Africa Re), ZEP -RE (PTA Reinsurance Company), Independent Regulatory Board of the East Africa Power Pool, or Islamic Cooperation for the Development of the Private Sector.

The URA can also facilitate the automatic exchange of information where such is provided for under an international agreement. 
According to Section 88(5) of the ITA, except for a public listed company, where an international agreement provides that income derived from sources in Uganda is exempt from Ugandan tax or the application if the treaty results in a reduction in Uganda tax, the benefit of that exemption or reduction shall not be available to any person who:

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
In arriving at chargeable income (taxable income), one has to go through the process of adjusting profits by taking into account deductions allowed and deductions not allowed.
## Inventory valuation
A taxpayer is allowed a deduction for the cost of trading stock disposed of during the year, which is determined by adding to the opening value of the trading stock the cost of trading stock acquired during the year and subtracting the closing value of stock. The opening value of the stock is the closing value for the previous year or, where the taxpayer commenced business during the year, the market value at the time of commencement of the business of the trading stock acquired prior to commencement. The closing stock valuation method is the lower of cost or market value. Trading stock is allowed to be valued using either the absorption costing or prime cost method. The stock valuation method chosen may not be changed, except with written permission of the Commissioner.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are included in and taxed together with the business income at a rate of 30%. There is no separate capital gains tax. Capital gains arise on disposal of non-depreciable business assets as well as sale of shares.
A change in ownership by 50% or more in a company located in Uganda (with a few exceptions) triggers a deemed realisation of all assets and liabilities for market value (immediately before the change).
Taxpayers selling assets 12 months or more after purchase are allowed to apply a Consumer Price Index (CPI) indexation to the asset cost base when calculating a potential gain or loss on disposal.
## Dividend income
The general rule is that dividend income is taxable as part of business income at a rate of 30%. Dividend income is also subject to WHT at the rate of 15%. The WHT paid in respect of the dividend income is creditable where the income is subject to the corporation tax rate of 30%. The WHT rate for dividend payments to resident persons is 15%. For dividends paid out by companies listed on the stock exchange to individuals, the rate is 10%.
Dividend income is exempt from tax if the recipient company directly or indirectly controls the paying company through ownership of 25% or more of the voting power of the paying company.
## Interest income
The general rule is that interest income is taxable as part of business income at a rate of 30%. Interest income is also subject to WHT at the rate of 15%. The WHT paid in respect of the interest income is creditable where the income is subject to the corporation tax rate of 30%. Also, interest income earned with respect to government securities is subject to tax at 20% as a final tax. However, government securities with a maturity period of at least ten years are subject to WHT at a rate of 10% as a final tax.
## Royalty income
The general rule is that royalty income is taxable as part of business income at a rate of 30%. Royalty income is also subject to WHT at the rate of 15%. The WHT paid in respect of the royalty income is creditable where the income is subject to the corporation tax rate of 30%.
## Rental income
Companies are required to disclose their rental income separately from other business income. Taxable rental income is the net income after allowing for any expenditures and losses in respect of the rental income derived by non-individuals. For companies and other non-individuals (excluding partnerships), the deduction of expenses against rental income is capped at 50% of gross rents. Any excess expenditure is not eligible for carrying forward. Individuals are subject to tax on annual rental income in excess of UGX 2.82 million at a flat tax rate of 12%. Individuals are not entitled to deduct any expenses against their rental income.
The Minister of Finance has powers to prescribe estimates of rent based on the rating of the rental property in a specific location in respect of persons who fail to file a return of rental income or whose return is misleading on the face of it and has been contested by the Commissioner. Further, all rental agreements are required to be executed and effected in Ugandan shillings.
## Foreign income
Foreign income is taxable on resident recipients, and tax suffered in the country where it is sourced (if any) is creditable, subject to the provisions of any double taxation agreements (DTAs). This credit is limited to the amount of Ugandan tax payable on that income.
There are no provisions for deferring tax on income earned abroad by tax residents.


# Uganda
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
A resident company is taxed on its income from all geographical sources. A non-resident company is only subject to Uganda income tax on income derived from sources in Uganda.
The income tax rate applicable to the chargeable income of companies is 30%, with the exception of resident companies whose turnover does not exceed UGX 150 million, to whom presumptive tax applies (_see below_).
Chargeable income is gross income for the year less the total deductions allowed under the Income Tax Act (ITA).
## Resident companies with turnover of less than UGX 150 million
A mix of fixed amounts and rates of turnover is used to determine income tax payable by a resident taxpayer whose turnover is between UGX 50 million and UGX 150 million, subject to availability of accounting records. For taxpayers whose gross turnover is above UGX 10 million but not in excess of UGX 50 million, fixed amounts and varying rates of tax apply, subject to availability of accounting records. 
However, on application to the Commissioner, a resident taxpayer with a turnover of less than UGX 150 million may be taxed at a rate of 30% on chargeable income.
This category excludes resident taxpayers in the business of medical, dental, engineering, and professional services, public entertainment services, public utility services, or construction services.
## Local income taxes
There are no district, municipal, or local corporate income taxes in Uganda.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is governed by the VAT Act and administered by the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA). VAT is charged at the rate of 18% on the supply of most goods and services in the course of business in Uganda. Specified goods and services, as well as exports outside of Uganda, attract a zero rate of tax.
Some supplies are exempt from VAT, the main categories being services to conduct feasibility studies, locally produced raw materials subject to investment thresholds and industry, liquefied petroleum gas, financial services, health and life insurance, agriculture insurance policies, re-insurance services, unimproved land, leases and sale of certain residential properties, betting and gaming, education, medical and health services, imported drugs, medicines and medical sundries, assistive devices for persons with disabilities, oxygen cylinder or oxygen for medical use, social welfare services, pesticides, petroleum products subject to excise duty, and supply of animal feeds and mixed components. Other recent supplies per the 2024 VAT Act include supply of electric vehicle locally manufactured or the frame and body of an electric vehicle locally fabricated, cooking stoves that use fuel ethanol and are assembled in Uganda (up to 30 June 2028), fertilisers, pesticides, hoes, seeds, and seedlings (repealed as zero-rated supplies).
Zero rating is preferable to exemption because the VAT on costs incurred in making a zero-rated supply can be recovered while those incurred in making an exempt supply cannot be recovered.
The zero-rated supplies include the supply of goods and services exported from Uganda; the supply of educational materials, including educational materials manufactured in a partner state of the East African Community; sanitary towels, menstrual cups, tampons, and the inputs for their manufacture; drugs and medicines manufactured in Uganda; and the supply of leased aircraft, aircraft engines, spare engines, spare parts for aircraft, and aircraft maintenance equipment and repair services.
Besides the exempted and zero-rated supplies, there is a deemed VAT regime that applies to the upstream and midstream operations in the oil and gas sector, mining operations, as well as aid-funded projects. The tax payable on a taxable supply made by a supplier to a contractor executing an aid-funded project and by a contractor to a licensee to undertake mining or petroleum operations is deemed to have been paid by the supplier (in the case of the aid-funded projected) or the contractor (in the case of mining and petroleum operations) provided the supply is for use by the contractor solely and exclusively for the aid-funded project or the petroleum/mining operations.
The annual threshold for VAT registration is UGX 150 million. Persons who make supplies that are VATable and whose turnover exceeds UGX 150 million are required to register for VAT with the URA. VAT-registered persons are required to:
  * Charge VAT whenever they make supplies that are VATable.
  * File monthly returns before the 15th day of the month following the reporting month.
  * Only claim a tax credit on expenses supported by e-invoices or e-receipts.
  * Apply for input tax credits within six months from the date of the invoice.
  * Only claim for input VAT against the related business generating a taxable supply.


Also, taxable persons supplying remote services, such as electronic services, to non-taxable persons in Uganda are required to register for VAT and file quarterly VAT returns. The tax due under such a return may be paid in United States dollars.
### Credit for input tax
A person making exempt, zero-rated, and standard supplies can recover all the input VAT if the exempt supplies are less than 5% of the total supplies. However, if the exempt supplies are more than 5% but less than 95%, the person is required to recover only a portion of the VAT input tax corresponding to the percentage of the taxable supplies. If the exempt supplies exceed 95%, the person cannot recover any input VAT.
The following are a few restrictions on input tax claims:
  * A taxable person can only utilise their input tax credit within six months from the date of the invoice.
  * Non-residents providing services that are deemed to take place in Uganda, such as electronic services, are not entitled to claim input VAT credits.
  * Input VAT claim on membership in a club, association, or society is not allowed.
  * Claims for input VAT can only be made against the 'related business generating a taxable supply'.


### Imported services
The VAT Act defines a supply of service to mean any supply that is not a supply of goods or money, including the performance of services for another person.
There is no definition of imported services in the local legislation. However, the tax authorities generally consider an imported service to be one provided by a person normally resident outside Uganda who is not required to register for VAT in Uganda. According to Regulation 14 of the VAT Regulations 1996, any person who imports a service into the country must account for VAT on such a service. The Regulations require the person importing the service to account for the VAT at the time when performance of the service is completed, when payment for the service is made, or when the invoice is received from the foreign supplier, whichever is earliest. 
The tax on imported services is computed at the rate of 18% of the cost of the service. VAT-registered companies are no longer required to prepare self-billed tax invoices, thus they are unable to claim the VAT paid as input tax; however, a contractor or licensee in the petroleum and mining industry is able to claim an input tax credit for the reverse-charge VAT paid on imported services. Also, persons providing business process outsourcing (BPO) services are allowed to claim credit for input tax for VAT paid on imported services. Further, if the importer of the services is not registered for VAT, the importer is required to calculate and pay the VAT to the URA.
Failure to pay VAT on non-exempt imported services is tantamount to lack of compliance with the law, and a penalty of 2% per month, compounded, may apply.
Interest payable on late payment of VAT is capped to a maximum of the aggregate of the principal tax and penal tax.
### VAT representative for non-resident persons
The Tax Procedure Code Act now provides for a role of tax representative for a non-resident person being the individual controlling the person's affairs in Uganda, including a manager of a business of that person or any representative appointed in Uganda.
A tax representative under the Tax Procedure Code Act is responsible for performing any duty obligation imposed by a tax law on the taxpayer, including submission of tax returns and payment of tax.
## Customs duties
Many goods imported into Uganda are subject to customs duties. However, exemptions are available to various classes of plant and machinery imported into Uganda. The rates of duty are provided by the EAC common external tariff code. Certain products imported from the East African Community and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) region enjoy special custom duty rates. Imported items are classified according to the nomenclature established under the international convention on the harmonised commodity description and coding system. Duties range from 0% to 60%, depending on the item imported.

Where the employer fails to withhold tax as required, the employer becomes liable for the taxes but may recover the same from the employees.
Local service tax ranging between UGX 5,000 and UGX 100,000 _per annum_ , subject to an individual’s employment income bracket, is payable to the local municipal councils of the individual’s area of residence. The tax is withheld and paid by the employer.
## Social security contributions
An employer is required to make contributions to the National Social Security Fund for each employee, amounting to 10% of their gross pay. The employee contribution is 5%. However, the National Social Security Fund (Amendment) Act, 2021 allows for voluntary contributions to the fund over and above the standard contributions. It also allows a person who is self-employed to apply for membership and make voluntary contributions to the fund.
