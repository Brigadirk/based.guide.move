# Netherlands
## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Remuneration of board members of a foreign company
As of 1 January 2023, the Dutch tax treatment of foreign remuneration of board members (‘ _directeuren en commissarissen’)_ of foreign-based companies has changed. The approval to avoid international double taxation on executive and supervisory board remuneration by using the exemption method instead of the credit method will expire. This means that the Netherlands will only provide an exemption for this type of income if the exemption method has specifically been agreed in the bilateral tax treaty.
## Employment relationship
The Dutch Supreme Court ruled that all the circumstances of the case must be looked at to determine whether an agreement should be considered an employment contract. If one or more conditions for an employment relationship (i.e. work, salary, authority) are specifically breached in some respects, this is not sufficient to exclude an employment relationship. As of 2025, the Dutch tax authorities will check again more strictly whether an employment relationship exists, in this transitional year normally no fines will be levied. In 2026 a new law will be implemented to clarify if an employment relationship exists. 
## Expat ruling changes: Cap and scale back
As of 1 January 2024, the 30% ruling (expat facility) can be applied to a maximum of the standard under the Standards for Remuneration Act (WNT-norm) (2025: 246,000 EUR). In the case of expats who were already using the 30% ruling in 2022, the cap is only going to take effect as of 1 January 2026. In case the 30% ruling is applied as of 2023, then the income is subject to the cap as of 1 January 2024.
Furthermore, the 30% ruling is scaled back to 27% as of 2027 for the total duration of the expat ruling. A transitional law will apply to employees who have already applied the expat ruling in 2024.
Lastly, the partial non-resident status has been abolished as of 2025. This means that qualifying expats can no longer choose for non-resident taxation for income in box 2 and box 3. 
## Adjustments to box 2 
Two tax brackets have been introduced in box 2 as of 2024: a basic rate of 24.5% for the first EUR 67,804 (2025) of income per person and a rate of 31% (2025) for the remainder. 
## Adjustments to box 3 
While the government is still working on a new box 3 system, which will be implemented as of 1 January 2028 at the earliest, a transitional system has been introduced for the years 2023-2027. This transitional system takes into account the actual asset mix of a taxpayer and divides these assets into three categories: (i) bank deposits (savings); (ii) other assets; and (iii) debts. The value under each category on 1 January will be deemed to yield a fixed percentage. The weighted average yield over all categories will be applied to the total assets above a personal exemption of EUR 57,684 (2025) to determine the taxable benefit that will be subject to tax at a flat rate of 36% (2025). However, recently, the Supreme Court ruled that taxation in box 3 must be based at most on the actual return instead of the transitional system. So it is now up to taxpayers to demonstrate that the actual return achieved is lower than the lump sum calculated.


# Netherlands
## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
The Netherlands taxes its residents on their worldwide income; non-residents are subject to tax only on income derived from specific sources in the Netherlands (mainly income from employment, director’s fees, business income, and income from Dutch immovable property).
## Personal income tax rates
In the Netherlands, worldwide income is divided into three different types of taxable income, and each income type is taxed separately under its own schedule, referred to as a 'box'. Each box has its own tax rate(s). An individual's taxable income is based on the aggregate income in these three boxes.
Box 1 refers to taxable income from work and home ownership, and includes the following:
  * Employment income.
  * Home ownership of a principal residence (deemed income).
  * Periodic receipts and payments.
  * Benefits relating to income provisions.


Box 2 refers to taxable income from a substantial interest.
Box 3 applies to taxable income from savings and investment (_see the_ _section for more information_).
### 2025 rates for box 1 income
Taxable income (EUR) | Tax on column 1 (EUR) | Tax on excess (%)  
---|---|---  
Over (column 1) | Not over  
0 | 38,441* | 8.17  
38,441 |  76,817  | 3,140 | 37.48  
76,817 | 17,523 | 49.50  
* In the first bracket of box 1, national insurance tax is levied at a rate of 27.65%.
Box 2 income is taxed at a rate of 24.5% for the first EUR 67,804 of income in Box 2 and a rate of 31% for the income above. 
Box 3 income (deemed return on savings and investments) is taxed at a flat rate of 36%.
## Local taxes on income
There are no local taxes on income in the Netherlands.


# Netherlands
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Taxable period
The Dutch tax year runs from 1 January through 31 December.
## Tax returns
If both spouses are resident taxpayers, they are taxed separately for their business income, employment income, pension income, and other periodic payments less premiums for life annuities and for certain other periodic payments. Spouses and, under certain conditions, persons living as a joint household automatically qualify as fiscal partners. As such, they can choose to allocate the following types of income/deductions to either or both (in any given proportion):
  * Taxable income from a principal residence.
  * Taxable income from substantial interest (box 2).
  * Taxable income from savings and investments (box 3).
  * Non-business deductions relating to the taxpayers’ personal circumstances.


Tax returns must be filed after each calendar year, in principle, before 1 May.
## Payment of tax
If an employee is on a Dutch payroll, wage tax will be withheld from one’s salary. Generally speaking, if taxpayers have sizable income that is not subject to wage tax withholding, they may be required to make advance payments of estimated additional income tax. When the employee has income tax deductions that are not considered in the Dutch payroll (e.g. [negative] income from a principal residence), it is also possible to file a preliminary tax refund form in order to claim monthly income tax refunds during the calendar year.
## Topics of focus for the Dutch tax authorities
During wage tax audits, the Dutch tax authorities' focus is, in most cases, on the taxation and processing of the remuneration of inbound and outbound employees (if applicable). In these situations, they pay special attention to the following topics:
  * The reimbursement of expenses, both in the Netherlands and overseas.
  * The processing of (foreign) social security contributions and pension premiums paid.
  * The way the expat ruling is included and processed in the Dutch payroll administration on payments and reimbursements made.
  * Situations of salary splits and the allocation of income and benefits and taxation rights in the payroll administration.
  * The treatment and processing of directors' remuneration.
  * The way the company/employer deals with the economic employer concept and the tax implications that may be triggered in the Netherlands for employees seconded to the Netherlands.




# Netherlands
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Employment expenses
In the Netherlands, the number of deductions for tax purposes an individual can claim in one's PIT return are limited. Business expenses may however (in part) qualify for a tax-free reimbursement by the employer, such as moving expenses, telephone expenses, commuter and business travel, school and tuition fees, etc. 
### Extra-territorial costs
The actual costs relating to an assignment to the Netherlands incurred by a foreign employee may be reimbursed tax-free provided that these expenses can be proven. These so-called extra-territorial costs basically include all costs that the employee would not have incurred had the employee not been assigned to the Netherlands. Costs that qualify as extra-territorial costs (not exhaustive) include:
  * double housing
  * language courses, and
  * home leave.


### Expat ruling
If certain conditions are met, a foreign employee working in the Netherlands may be granted the so-called '30% ruling'. Under this ruling, a tax-free reimbursement amounting to 30% of the income from active employment can be paid to the employee. The 30% reimbursement is intended to cover all extra-territorial costs. If the 30% ruling is applied, the actual extra-territorial costs may not be reimbursed tax-free in addition to the 30% reimbursement. If the actual extra-territorial costs are higher than the 30% reimbursement, the higher costs can be reimbursed tax-free. However, there are a lot of developments in view of the Dutch expat ruling and the ruling will change to a 27%-ruling as of 2027.
To qualify for the expat ruling, the foreign employee should have specific expertise that is not available or is scarce in the Dutch labour market.
This is based upon the following salary norm (for 2025):
  * A general (gross) salary norm amounting to EUR 46,660 (i.e. EUR 66,657 including tax-free reimbursement of 30%).
  * A lower (gross) salary norm amounting to EUR 35,468 (i.e. EUR 50,669 including tax-free reimbursement of 30%) applies to individuals with a Master's degree (MSc) who are younger than 30 years of age.
  * No salary norm is applicable for scientific personnel and researchers at educational institutions and (subsidised) research facilities.


Furthermore, the employee should have lived outside a 150 kilometre radius of the Dutch border during more than 2/3 of a 24-month period before taking up Dutch employment in order to qualify for the expat ruling.
For university doctorates hired within a year after obtaining their PhD, a relaxation of the conditions was introduced.
Up to 2025, under the provisions of the expat ruling, employees who are, based on facts and circumstances, considered as resident taxpayers may opt to be treated as partial non-residents.
The expat ruling will end when the conditions are no longer met. Furthermore, the expat ruling lapses at the end of the next wage tax period following the wage tax period in which the Dutch employment/assignment was terminated (usually the end of the next month). The expat ruling cannot be applied on post-departure income (after the settlement period mentioned above). Hence, the expat ruling can, in principle, not be applied on bonuses and equity income that becomes taxable after having left the Netherlands (regardless of whether the right to such benefit already vested during the Dutch employment period).
#### Recent developments and points of attention
  * The expat ruling may apply for a maximum period of 60 months. However, periods of prior stay in the Netherlands will, in principle, be deducted from this maximum duration period. The expat ruling must be applied for within four months of starting the Dutch employment. If not applied for within this time, the ruling, if granted, will not apply retroactively as of the beginning of the Dutch employment, but only as of the month following the month in which the application was filed. The expat ruling may only be applied if the employee is included in a Dutch wage tax administration.
  * As of 1 January 2024, the application of the expat ruling is capped. From that moment onwards, employers can reimburse a maximum of 30% of income up to the ‘WNT norm’, also known as the ‘Balkenende standard’, tax-free. Based on the amount of the 2025 WNT norm (EUR 246,000), the tax-free remuneration amounts to EUR 73,800 per year. If an employee does not work in the Netherlands the entire year, the amount will be calculated pro rata. A transitional regime applies. For employees who benefitted from the 30% ruling during 2022, the cap will apply as of 1 January 2026 instead of 1 January 2024.
  * From 1 January 2023 onwards, a choice has to be made each year whether actual extra-territorial costs are to be reimbursed or if the 30% ruling will be applied. It will not be possible to change the decision during the calendar year, except for the first four months during the first year of arrival. 
  * Further, the percentage of the maximum reimbursement is scaled back from 30% to 27% as of 2027 for the total duration of the expat ruling. Transitional law applies for expats that have already applied the 30% ruling in 2023. 


## Work-related costs scheme
Under the work-related costs scheme, the employer may reimburse expenses tax-free, up to a fixed percentage of the total fiscal wages of one's employees (the work-related costs budget). 
In 2025, for the first EUR 400,000, the work-related costs budget will be 2.00% and 1.18% for the remaining amount of the taxable wage bill. In case the work-related costs budget is exceeded, the employer needs to pay wage tax in the form of a final levy of 80% on the amount in excess of the budget. Under the work-related costs scheme, reimbursements and provisions are broken down into five groups:
### No wage/intermediary costs
Reimbursements of costs that do not form a (taxable) wage benefit for the employee, because they are directly related to the business of the employer. The reimbursement of these costs will not be included in the work-related costs budget. This also includes benefits and provisions that do not qualify as wage based on the wage tax law (_Wet op de loonbelasting 1964_), e.g. employers’ contributions to approved/qualifying employee pension plans.
### Mandatory taxable wage
Benefits or provisions, not included in the work-related costs scheme, that are obligatorily taxed on an employee level, such as the company car and taxable reimbursements.
#### Specific exemptions
The amount of a number of specific reimbursements or provisions will not fall within the work-related costs budget, e.g. travel expenses (up to EUR 0.23 per business kilometre), removal expenses, and extraterritorial expenses. 
Furthermore, a new specific exemption has been added to the work-related costs scheme. As of 1 January 2022, a tax-free allowance of EUR 2 per day worked from home has been introduced (in 2025: EUR 2.40). In other words, this home-working allowance can be provided to the employee tax-free. It should be noted that it is not possible to apply both the exemption for a homework allowance and the exemption for commuting costs (to the fixed place of work) for one and the same working day.
### Nil assessment
These reimbursements and provisions formally fall within the work-related costs budget, but they are assessed to nil. As a result, they do not fill the work-related costs budget.
### Work-related costs
The amount of reimbursements or provisions fall within the work-related costs budget.
In addition, in case an individual is liable to tax in the Netherlands, but does not have a Dutch or foreign employer who withholds Dutch wage tax, one's Dutch taxable income needs to be determined based on Dutch tax rules and would include reimbursements and benefits in kind. As a consequence, a deduction for the work-related costs budget can be applied in one's Dutch PIT return.
## Personal deductions
### Alimony
Residents (as well as partial non-residents and qualifying non-residents) are entitled to claim deductions mainly relating to their personal or family circumstances, including maintenance payments to a former spouse (i.e. alimony).
### Charitable contributions
Residents (as well as partial non-residents and qualifying non-residents) are entitled to claim deductions relating to charitable donations (deductions for certain expenses are capped or subject to thresholds).
### Medical and disability expenses
Residents (as well as partial non-residents and qualifying non-residents) are entitled to claim deductions mainly relating to their personal or family circumstances. These include expenses arising from sickness or disability, and weekend expenses of handicapped close relatives (deductions for certain expenses are capped or subject to thresholds).
### Life insurance premiums
Life annuity premiums are only tax deductible if the taxpayer can prove that one has a lack in the pension rights/pension capital built up to date.
### Mortgage interest expenses
Mortgage interest payments in relation to the financing, renovation, or maintenance of the primary residence may be deducted from box 1 income. In order to qualify for this deduction, the property needs to qualify as the taxpayer’s primary residence. To determine the net amount of the deduction, a deemed income is taken into account. Generally, 0.35% (2025) of the value of the property is taken into account; however, for properties above EUR 1.33 million, a rate of 2.35% applies to the surplus. Under conditions, the former of future primary residence may qualify for the deduction as well. In addition, if there is no or a low amount of mortgage interest payable (i.e. the principal was paid off), the deemed income may be disregarded, which would imply no deduction and no deemed income.
The interest paid on mortgage loans concluded as of 1 January 2013 can only be deducted if the full mortgage loan is paid off. The new conditions can be summarised as follows:
  * The interest on (mortgage) loans will only be deductible if the mortgage is fully repaid within a maximum period of 360 months (contract also required).
  * These loans must be repaid periodically on the basis of an agreed pattern (e.g. linear/annuity). For foreign loans, proof needs to be provided (strict deadlines apply).
  * For loans that do not meet the above-mentioned conditions and where the transitional rules are not applicable, the mortgage interest deduction will no longer be allowed.


As of 1 January 2014, the maximum effective tax rate against which the mortgage interest is deducted is lowered. The result is that in the year 2025 the mortgage interest paid can be deducted against a (maximum) tax rate of 37.48%.
## Personal allowances
Generally speaking, there are no standard personal allowances in the Netherlands. Nonetheless, there are levy rebates that lower the amount of tax due. Different levy rebates may apply, dependent on the taxpayer’s situation (_see Levy rebates in the_ _section for more information_).

## Individual - Other issues
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Immigration rules and formalities
Dutch immigration policy has been aiming to protect the Dutch labour market for decades. Over the past few years, it has introduced a less restrictive admittance policy for highly skilled employees of multinational companies who meet specific criteria.
Immigration procedure(s) apply to foreign nationals who want to work and stay in the Netherlands.
According to the Dutch Foreign Employment Act, an employer needs to be in possession of a work permit for a non-European Economic Area (EEA) national that will perform employment activities in the Netherlands. 
Additionally, most nationalities require a Schengen visa in case the intended stay will be less than three months within six months. Please note that a Schengen visa issued for business does not allow the business visitor to work in the Netherlands. A separate work permit will have to be applied for.
In case the intended stay will exceed three months (within six months), a residence permit is required to legally stay in the Netherlands. Next to that, a long-term entry visa (MVV) may be required before entering the Netherlands.
### Work permit requirement
According to the Dutch Foreign Employment Act, an employer needs to be in possession of a work permit for a foreign national who will perform work activities in the Netherlands. This work permit requirement applies from day 1 of any work activities taking place in the Netherlands. An exception applies to EEA and Swiss nationals, who are allowed to work in the Netherlands without a work permit.
### Entry and stay
Additionally, most nationalities require a Schengen visa in case the intended stay will be less than 90 days in a rolling 180-day period. Please note that a Schengen visa issued for business does not allow the business visitor to work in the Netherlands. A separate work permit will have to be applied for in case the individual will be working in the Netherlands.
In case the intended stay will exceed 90 days in a rolling 180-day period, a residence permit is required to legally stay in the Netherlands. Next to that, a long-term entry visa (MVV) may be required before entering the Netherlands. When the purpose of stay is employment, the employer will generally apply for a combined permit for residence and work. The applicable category depends on the facts and circumstances of the case.
## 60-day facility
Cross-border intercompany employment is subject to a test as to whether the group company in the country of employment qualifies as an economic employer. A Dutch Decree offers a relaxation for assignments to the Netherlands for less than 60 days over a 12-month period in the context of an exchange programme or career development, or in situations where the employee in question has a specific expertise. In these instances it is easier assumed that no employer under a tax convention exists in the country of employment regardless of who is bearing the employment costs. This will alleviate the administrative burden for many group entities. The facility is intended in principle for group entities as referred to in the Dutch Wage Tax Act (one-third equity stake required). Groups that do not satisfy this requirement but present themselves as a group can submit an application to the Dutch tax authorities to request treatment along the lines of the Decree.
## General facility for reversing payroll obligations to a Dutch group entity
When an employee is subject to Dutch wage tax, the foreign, formal employer will in principle be liable to remit wage tax. In other words, the foreign employer will have to register in the Netherlands and operate a Dutch (shadow) payroll. However, from 1 January 2013, there is a general facility included in the legislation for reversing wage tax withholdings from the home country employer to the Dutch (host country) employer in assignment situations. As such, the Dutch employer can take over the withholding obligation from the home country employer. However, a request should be filed with the Dutch tax authorities in this respect; otherwise, the foreign formal employer should still register with the Dutch authorities for the purpose of remittance of Dutch wage tax and employee insurance premiums via a Dutch (shadow) payroll.
Please note, this facility does not apply in all situations, e.g. formal salary splits are not automatically covered. In those situations, e.g. the formal foreign employer(s) may still need to register and operate a separate shadow payroll in addition to the Dutch employer.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
_In the section_ , we explained that, in the Netherlands, personal income is divided into three types of taxable income, which are taxed separately under its own schedule (referred to as ‘box 1’, ‘box 2’, and ‘box 3’). In this section, we further explain the taxation of various kinds of personal income according to the applicable ‘boxes’.
## Employment income
Income from current or past employment is assessed in box 1. Box 1 income is taxed at progressive rates up to a maximum of 49.50% in 2025.
### Reimbursements and benefits in kind
Within an employment relationship, all benefits in kind are, in principle, considered as taxable income. Such benefits include accommodation allowances, private use of the company car, employee stock options, home-leave allowances, and pre- and post-assignment bonuses. Employer-paid reimbursement of relocation costs relating to the acceptance of a new employment and employer contributions toward approved pension schemes are not taxable. Certain other reimbursements and benefits in kind also are not taxable, and the employer has an annual budget for tax-free reimbursements (_see the section for further details_).
### Lucrative investments
The rules regarding ‘excessive’ remuneration brings a so-called lucrative investment (carried interest arrangements) under taxation in box 1. The income from a lucrative investment, both income and capital gains, will, in principle, be considered as ‘income arising from other activities’ and, as such, be taxable at progressive tax rates.
### Non-resident employees
Non-resident employees are taxed on salary earned for employment activities performed inside the Netherlands. If an employment is partially exercised in the Netherlands, the activities are deemed to be fully performed in the Netherlands, unless the employment is fully exercised outside the Netherlands or unless the salary earned in connection with foreign duties is taxed abroad. As a general rule, a statutory director of a Dutch company is subject to Dutch taxation irrespective of the country where the duties relating to the directorship are actually performed. An exception is made only if a double taxation treaty stipulates otherwise. The approval to apply the exemption method instead of the credit method for the avoidance of double taxation over the remuneration of executive or supervisory board members has been revoked. Consequently, in tax treaty situations in which the credit method is prescribed, this method will (again) apply.
## Equity compensation
Income and benefits from equity-based remuneration are assessed in box 1. This type of remuneration is generally taxable at the moment the benefit becomes unconditional (share) or exercised (stock options). The income is pro-rated for the period it is earned (e.g. the vesting period) in case the individual worked in more than one country during this period. The Dutch taxable income is determined based on the net benefit (i.e. gross benefit minus any exercise price paid). Furthermore, a discount applies on the taxable value in case of a holding lock or forced postponed exercise date.
A new amendment to the Dutch employee stock option regime applies as of 1 January 2023. Generally speaking, employee stock options are taxable once exercised. As of 2023, however, in case shares are not tradable after the exercise of the stock options, the taxable moment will be deferred until the shares do become tradable. An employee may, however, elect (in writing) to keep exercise as the taxable moment.
## Business income
Income from self-employment is assessed in box 1.
## Capital gains
For residents and non-residents, capital gains and investment income as such are not taxable, except as detailed for box 2 and box 3 above. Income from lucrative investments will, in principle, be considered as ‘income from other activities’ in box 1 for Dutch tax purposes according to the Dutch State Ministry of Finance. However, it may be possible to have the proceeds from the lucrative investment taxed in box 2. In case you are a non-resident of the Netherlands and are able to make use of the box 2 regime, then under the respective bilateral tax treaty any gains will most likely fall under the ‘dividend’ or ‘capital gains’ articles. In case you do not make use of the box 2 regime, the Netherlands is of the opinion that based on where and to the extent (taxable) activities are performed in the Netherlands, (part of) the lucrative investment should be subject to taxation in the Netherlands. This differs from the interpretation of other countries under the respective bilateral tax treaties. It remains to be seen whether the Netherlands can successfully claim this allocation to the Netherlands and whether double taxation arises.
## Dividend income
Income from savings and investments (e.g. dividends) is, as such, not taxable. However, the assets of an individual valued on 1 January are deemed to generate an annual fixed return on investment. This fixed return is taxed in box 3 at a flat rate of 36%. All net assets that are not intended for daily use and that are not taxed in box 1 or box 2 belong to the box 3 taxable base. For residents and non-residents, part of the taxable base is exempt and several specific deductions can be applicable.
As of 1 January 2023, transitional legislation for box 3 was introduced until the implementation of a new system in 2027, at the earliest. During this period, the actual assets of taxpayers are categorised under one of three categories, namely (i) bank deposits (savings), (ii) other assets, and (iii) debts. The value under each category on 1 January will be deemed to yield a fixed percentage. The weighted average yield over all categories will be applied to the total assets above a personal exemption of EUR 57,684 (2025) in order to determine the taxable benefit that will be subject to tax at a flat rate of 36% (2025).
With regard to dividends, please note that in the Netherlands a dividend withholding tax (WHT) of 15% applies. Resident taxpayers use the withholding as a tax credit on their income tax that is levied in box 3. For non-resident taxpayers, the withholding would be the final levy applied in the Netherlands.
## Interest income
Interest income that does not qualify as income from substantial interest _(see below)_ is taxed in accordance with the rules on the taxation of dividend income, i.e. taxable in box 3. The actual interest income received is thus not taxable.
### Income from substantial interest
A Dutch resident who, alone or together with a spouse or other close relatives, holds at least 5% of the shares or a class of shares of a company or who holds rights to acquire a 5% interest in a company has a so-called substantial interest. The benefits derived from this substantial interest are taxable in box 2. These benefits include dividends and the gain on the sale of one or more of the shares or rights. For non-resident taxpayers, taxation in box 2 will only apply to a non-resident who holds a substantial interest in a Dutch-based company. The highest box 2 tax rate is 31% in 2025.
Taxation in box 2 may apply to the aforementioned lucrative investments and could mean a tax saving. If the lucrative investment is (i) held indirectly (e.g. via a holding company, preferably benefiting from the Dutch participation exemption on capital gains and dividends); (ii) the individual investors holds a substantial interest in the intermediate holding company; and (iii) this company distributes at least 95% of profits realised to its shareholders within the tax year, the individual investors are taxed according to box 2 taxation at the level of their shareholding in the holding company.
## Rental income
Rental income is taxed in accordance with the rules on the taxation of dividend income and interest payment, i.e. taxable in box 3 (_see above_). The actual rental income received is thus not taxable.
Nonetheless, rental income is taxable in case the income is received for services that surpass that of a ‘normal’ investor and these services are viewed as business activities. In that situation, the income is taxable as income arising from other activities in box 1. Furthermore, the property that qualifies as a primary residence is taxed in box 1, which also includes the (deemed) income from this property, which is taken into account to determine the amount of the deduction for the mortgage interest paid.

## Levy rebates
Resident, partial non-resident, and qualifying non-resident taxpayers are entitled to so-called levy rebates. Except for the general levy rebate, several levy rebates, depending on the personal situation of the taxpayer, can be claimed (e.g. work-on levy rebate, elderly tax rebate). The levy rebates cannot be transferred to the taxpayer’s partner. The rebates, which generally decrease with an increase of income, reduce the amount of tax due and can therefore be considered as tax credits. The levy rebates mostly consist of a part relating to and reducing the amount of income tax due, and of a part relating to and reducing the amount of national insurance tax due. The income tax part is granted to taxpayers insofar they were residents of the Netherlands during the tax year (and to some extent to non-resident residing in a country that concluded a tax treaty including a non-discrimination clause) for the general levy rebate, and/or individuals that render employment duties in the Netherlands for the labour levy rebate. The national insurance tax part is, in principle, granted to taxpayers covered under the Dutch social security system during (part of) the year on a pro-rata basis.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
Article 4 of the General Taxation Act prescribes that an individual's residence position is determined based on all (relevant) facts and circumstances. In case of a dispute, the Dutch tax courts will examine the person's durable ties of a personal (and, to a lesser extent, economic) nature with the Netherlands.
Under Dutch tax law, several criteria are used to determine the place of residence. The most important criteria include the following:
  * Where a permanent home is maintained.
  * Where employment duties are performed.
  * Where the individual's family resides.
  * Where the individual is registered with the local authorities.
  * Where bank accounts and other assets are maintained.
  * The intended length of stay in the Netherlands.


An expatriate is generally considered a resident of the Netherlands if:
  * as a married person, their family accompanies them to the Netherlands, or
  * as a single person, they stay in the Netherlands for more than one year.


## Qualifying non-resident taxpayers and option regime
When a non-resident individual qualifies as a qualifying non-resident taxpayer, one is entitled to certain deductions and tax benefits that resident taxpayers are entitled to. Non-resident taxpayers have to fulfil a number of conditions to qualify for this scheme. The main conditions are that 90% or more of the taxpayer’s income should be subject to wage and income tax in the Netherlands and the individual has to reside in a European Union (EU) member state, in Bonaire, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Saba, Sint Eustatius, or Switzerland. A catch-all clause is included for situations in which less than 90% of the income of a non-resident taxpayer is subject to tax in the Netherlands, but where, based on European law, this taxpayer is nevertheless entitled to the application of personal allowances in the Netherlands. In addition, the non-resident taxpayer should also submit a declaration of income from the tax authorities in their country of residence.
## Election to be treated as a partial non-resident
Under the provisions of the so-called '30% ruling', employees who are, based on facts and circumstances, considered as resident taxpayers may opt to be treated as partial non-residents. Partial in this respect implies that they are treated as residents for box 1 and as non-residents for box 2 and 3 purposes while they are entitled to personal deductions and tax credits.
However, this provision is being abolished. This means that they can no longer choose non-resident taxation for income in box 2 and box 3. The abolition will take effect from 2025. There is a transitional arrangement for expats, who were already using or could use this facility before 1 January 2024. They can make use of the partial non-resident taxation until the end of 2026.

## Social security contributions
Employee insurance contributions and national insurance tax are levied on residents and non-residents under a number of different regulations.
### National insurance tax
Under the national insurance tax regulations, contributions are levied on income up to a maximum of EUR 38,441. At present, the contribution is capped at EUR 10,628 _per annum_. From this amount several levy rebates may be deducted. National insurance contributions paid by an employee are not deductible from taxable income. National insurance contributions and income taxes are included as a single tax in the first income tax bracket.
### Employee insurance contribution
Under the employee insurance regulations, contributions are to be paid on income up to a maximum of EUR 75,864. The contribution rate depends on the employer’s industry.
### Dutch Health Insurance Act
It is compulsory for all residents of the Netherlands and all employees who are subject to Dutch wage tax to be covered under the Dutch Health Insurance Act (_Zorgverzekeringswet_) and to have a statutory health insurance policy. For employees the contribution will consist of:
  * a nominal contribution of approximately EUR 1,900 to be paid to the health insurance company, and
  * an income-related contribution (6.51% on income up to a maximum of EUR 75,864 with a maximum of EUR 4,938), to be paid to the Dutch tax authorities by the employer.


## Consumption taxes
Value-added tax (VAT), known in Dutch as _Omzetbelasting_ or BTW, is payable on sales of goods and on services rendered in the Netherlands as well as on the importation of goods and on the ‘intra-European’ acquisition of goods. There are three VAT rates: 21%, 9%, and 0%. 
The main VAT rate is 21%.
The reduced 9% VAT rate is applicable on certain prime necessities (and to certain energy-saving insulation activities on houses).
The special 0% VAT rate is applicable mainly to intra-EU supplies, exports, imports stored in bonded warehouses, services rendered in connection with the above, and certain other services.
Solar panels are also charged with the 0% VAT rate. 
The following are exempt from VAT:
  * The supply of immovable property two years after putting it into use and lease. However, if the lessee’s use of the immovable property is 90% or more for input VAT-deductible purposes, the lessor and lessee may opt to be subject to VAT on rent, in which case the lessor may deduct the VAT charged in respect of the property.
  * Medical, social, and educational services.
  * Services provided by banks and other financial institutions in connection with payment transactions and the granting of credit facilities.
  * Insurance transactions.
  * Transactions in shares.


## Net wealth/worth taxes
In the Netherlands, wealth tax does not exist as such. The actual investment income received is not taxed.However, as part of the income tax system, the deemed income from the investment portfolio (e.g. bank accounts, shares) is taxed under the box 3 system. Non-resident taxpayers and partial non-resident taxpayers are only taxed in box 3 on a limited number of sources. For instance, non-residents are subject to taxation only on the net value of a limited number of Dutch assets, including the following:
  * Dutch real estate not used as the primary residence.
  * Profit rights unrelated to shares or an employment relationship.


As of 1 January 2023, a new transitional legislation over the tax treatment of savings and investments has entered into force until the introduction of new legislation that is announced for 2028.
During the transitional period, a taxpayer’s actual assets will be categorised under one of three categories, namely (i) bank deposits (savings), (ii) other assets, and (iii) debts.
The value under each category on 1 January will be deemed to yield a fixed percentage. The weighted average yield over all categories will be applied to the total assets above a personal exemption of EUR 57,684 (2025) to determine the taxable benefit that will be subject to tax at a flat rate of 36% (2025).
Please refer to the table below for an overview of the fixed percentages for recent years. 
Year | Category 1Bank deposits | Category 2All other assets | Category 3Debts  
---|---|---|---  
2022 | 0.00% | 5.53% | 2.28%  
2023 | 0.92%* | 6.17% | 2.46%*  
2024 |  1.03%* | 6.04% | 2.47%*  
2025 | TBA | 5.88% | TBA  
* provisional figures
These fixed returns will be taxed at a flat rate of 36%.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
An inheritance and gift tax is imposed on the fair market value of the gift or inheritance, less an exempt amount that varies depending on the relationship with the donor. The rate levied on the net gift or inheritance (10% to 40%) also depends on this relationship. The tax is due if:
  * the gift or inheritance is received from a resident of the Netherlands
  * the gift or inheritance is received from a former resident of the Netherlands who is a Dutch national, within ten years of their departure from the Netherlands, or
  * the gift is received from a former resident of the Netherlands within one year after their departure from the Netherlands.


The expanded gift exemption for owner-occupied homes has been scrapped as of 2024.
## Property taxes
A municipal tax applies to the ownership of immovable property. The circumstances at 1 January of a given year are decisive. The tax is payable upon an annual assessment that is based on the value of the property (as determined by the municipality). Non-residents and residents are subject to municipal tax applicable to the ownership of immovable property.
## Luxury and excise taxes
An excise tax is levied on certain consumer goods (e.g. cigarettes, cigars, mineral oils, alcoholic products).
## Transfer tax
The transfer of immovable property or certain rights thereto (e.g. buildings, houses, shares in real estate companies) is subject to 2% transfer tax, payable by the new owner. The 2% transfer tax applies equally to residents and non-residents. As of 2021, young first-time buyers on the housing market are eligible for a transfer tax exemption. Someone will qualify as a first-time buyer if they are 18 years old or older but under the age of 35 when they purchase their first property. The first-time buyer can only use the exemption once. From 1 April 2021, a maximum housing value limit of EUR 400,000 will apply, which will be indexed annually (2025: EUR 525,000). This limit applies to the entire property and not to the value of the part of the dwelling acquired. Only starters who buy a house under EUR 525,000 will receive the exemption, while starters who buy a more expensive house will pay 2% transfer tax on the entire amount of the house, just like other house buyers.
Buyers who don't plan to live in their home (investors) must pay a transfer tax of 10.4%.
## Insurance tax
An insurance tax of 21% is payable on insurance premiums if the insured is a resident of the Netherlands or if the insured object is in the Netherlands. Several exemptions apply; ships and aircraft operated in international traffic, for example, are exempt from the insurance premium tax. In certain situations, an insurer outside the EU may be required to take on a tax representative in the Netherlands.
## Road tax
An individual who owns/uses a car in the Netherlands may become liable to Dutch road tax. The individual who owns the car at the start date of each quarter will be liable to road tax. The amount due depends on the weight of the car and the type of fuel it uses.
