## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
The corporate tax system of the Netherlands contains a number of well-known features providing for an attractive investment climate, such as: the fiscal unity regime with tax consolidation for group companies, a full participation exemption for capital gains and dividends from qualifying participations, and several favourable tax regimes (e.g. for patent income, investment vehicles, and income from ocean shipping activities). As of 2021, a withholding tax on interest and royalties is due in certain situations, namely where the recipient is based in a low-tax jurisdiction or a non-cooperating jurisdiction in respect of information exchange, or in cases of abuse (_see Conditional withholding tax on interest and royalty payments in the section_). As of 2024, this WHT also applies to dividends.
## Pillars One and Pillar Two
The Netherlands implemented Pillar Two as of 1 January 2024, in line with the European Union (EU) Pillar Two Directive. The Dutch legislation l is almost entirely in line with the Directive. Entities established in the Netherlands that are part of a (multinational or large domestic) group with a consolidated group turnover of at least 750 million euros (EUR) will fall within the scope of the new legislation. Certain sectors, such as investment funds and pension funds, are outside the scope of Pillar Two.
Pillar One aims to allocate new taxing rights to market jurisdictions, even in absence of physical presence, via the introduction of a new set of tax rules potentially operating on top of the existing ones. Pillar One will apply to multinational enterprises (MNEs) with profitability above 10% and global turnover initially above EUR 20 billion. In October 2024, the members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (Inclusive Framework) published the text of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Amount A of Pillar One with additional guidance.
Currently, the Netherlands does not levy a digital service tax.
## Conditional source taxation on dividends
The conditional source taxation regarding interest and royalties includes dividends as of 1 January 2024 (_see the_ _section_).
## Fit for 55: EU climate agreement - Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) transition phase applies from October 2023 until December 2025
The European Union aims to reduce its net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels, and reach climate neutrality by 2050. On 14 July 2021, the European Commission presented the Fit for 55 Package with proposals aiming to deliver the 2030 CO₂ reduction target and to pave the way to become the world's first climate-neutral continent by 2050.
A number of key proposals from this package have been adopted, namely Revision of EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), Effort Sharing Regulation, CO₂ emissions standards for cars and vans, LULUCF, Social Climate Fund, Fuel Maritime (Sustainable maritime fuels), Energy Efficiency Directive (EED), Alternative fuels infrastructure Regulation (AFIR), Renewable Energy Directive III (RED III), and ReFuelEU Aviation.
On 1 October 2023, CBAM came into effect. After the transitional phase (October 2023 through 2025), with administrative and reporting obligations, CBAM provides for a levy on the importation of certain greenhouse gas (GHG) intensive goods into the European Union.

## 2025 Tax Plan
The 2025 Tax Plan includes a.o. the following tax measures:
  * Reversal of the abolition of the dividend tax buyback facility;


  * Interest deduction limitation on earnings stripping from 20 per cent to 24.5 per cent;


  * Introduction of the General Anti-Abuse Rule (GAAR) of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD);


  * The earlier announced abolition of reduced VAT rate for cultural goods and services - with the exception of cinemas and daytime recreation (2026) - will be reversed. However, pending on covering the budgetary deficit arising from this decision, it is still uncertain what compensating measures will take be taken;


  * Abolition of reduced VAT rate for accommodation - with the exception of camping sites (2026).


  * Introduction of a specific general housing rate of 8 per cent from 2026. The transfer tax has a general rate of 10.4 per cent. Additionally, there is a reduced rate of 2 percent for homes that serve as the main residence.

## Abolition of 'open cv' as an independent taxpayer 
The distinction between open (= non-transparent) and closed (= transparent) CVs (Limited Partnerships or LPs) is eliminated. All LPs will now be transparent. The aim is to reduce the number of hybrid mismatches in an international context. Read our  for more information. for more information.
According to the Secretary of State, a limited partnership (CV) can still be independently taxable (non-transparent) under the proposed rules if it qualifies as a mutual fund (FGR). 
In some cases where a currently transparent CV or similar foreign entity me be reclassified as a non-transparent FGR as of 1 January 2025, because it meets the criteria for an ‘open’ FGR. A transitional law provision will be introduced, which, under certain conditions, offers some time for the restructuring of an investment fund into an so- called ‘inkoopfonds’, which will then still be transparent. One of these conditions is that the fund already intends in 2024 to meet the conditions of an ‘inkoopfonds’ in the course of 2025.
## Qualification foreign legal forms
The qualification of foreign legal forms will be regulated by law. There are several material changes. The qualification of foreign legal forms that are comparable to Dutch entities will continue to take place using the legal form comparison method. However, for foreign legal forms that are not comparable to Dutch entities, two additional methods are introduced: the 'symmetrical method' and the 'fixed method'. Read more in our  on this subject.
## Amendments to the FBI regime 
Dutch Fiscal Investment Institutions (FBIs) are no longer allowed to directly invest in real estate located in the Netherlands. It remains possible for an FBI to be involved in the management of a real estate entity related to the FBI. It will also remain possible to directly invest in foreign real estate.
## Business in Europe: Framework for Income Taxation (BEFIT)
BEFIT is a Directive proposal by the European Commission issued on 12 September 2023. BEFIT introduces an aggregated common company tax base for the so-called ’BEFIT groups‘ that is distributed among the EU Member States on the basis of a seven-year transitional allocation rule for the further application of domestic corporate income tax (CIT) rules.
If adopted, BEFIT will enact substantial alterations to the corporate tax system across the EU27, impacting both domestic, EU, and non-EU headquartered groups doing business in the European Union. Consensus among all EU Member States is necessary for the adoption of BEFIT. In such a case, BEFIT would apply in parallel with the Pillar Two rules in EU27 and national CIT systems.
The Working Group on the Assessment of New Commission Proposals (BNC) reports that the government supports the European Commission's goals to strengthen the EU’s internal market and competitive position. The government views the proposed harmonised basis on annual accounting standards as a potentially positive step towards this goal and a simplification of tax legislation. However, the Cabinet considers the proposed method of profit allocation to EU Member States disproportionate in its current form. The government would have preferred a proposal limited to a truly harmonised basis. Additionally, the working group emphasises that BEFIT will have significant implementation consequences for the Dutch tax authorities.
_See_ _our EU Gateway publication_ _for more information on BEFIT as well as its parallel application with Pillar Two laws in the European Union_. 
## Transfer Pricing Directive Proposal
On 12 September 2023, the European Commission published a legislative proposal for a Directive on Transfer Pricing. This Directive (if adopted) would incorporate the arm’s-length principle into EU law and EU Member States’ domestic legislation, harmonise key transfer pricing rules, and create the possibility to establish common binding rules in the European Union on specific transfer pricing subjects. The proposal also looks to clarify the role and status of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. 
The proposal will undergo negotiation by the EU Member States with the goal of achieving the required unanimous approval. This is expected to be a challenging process. Limited enthusiasm for the legislative proposal prompted the presidency to explore non-binding solutions, such as a Transfer Pricing Platform. Further efforts are required to move this file forward. If approval is obtained, the Directive will come into force as of 1 January 2026.
The Dutch government understands the problem statement in the Directive proposal, which states that the options and possibilities for interpreting the OECD guidelines can lead to less certainty for companies. However, it questions whether a solution is achieved if limiting options and possibilities for interpretation is only designed within the EU context. In addition, the Netherlands has questions about the implications of the proposal concerning the position of individual EU Member States in the OECD meetings on Transfer Pricing.
_See our EU Gateway publication_. _In this EU Gateway publication, we present the fundamental aspects of the proposed Transfer Pricing Directive and their impact for groups operating in the EU Member States. Each aspect is accompanied by our EU Gateway observations_.
## Head Office Tax system proposal
The Head Office Tax (HOT) system proposal aims to mitigate the compliance challenges that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) face in the European Union. The optional system would allow permanent establishments in the European Union to compute their profits according to the rules of the head office state. Moreover, it would create a one-stop-shop in the head office state for filling, assessment, and collection of tax. 
The Dutch government supports the Commission's aim to assist SMEs but raises concerns about the proposal’s effectiveness and scope, including the sidelining of Dutch policy when the Netherlands is the permanent establishment state. Yet, the proposal for SMEs failed to gain sufficient support. EU Member States suggested exploring alternative approaches to support SMEs beyond the legislative framework.
## Loss relief
An unlimited-in-time loss carry-forward rule is applicable as of 1 January 2022. However, carry-back and carry-forward losses are only deductible up to an amount of EUR 1 million in taxable profit. In the event the taxable profit in one year exceeds EUR 1 million, the losses are only offsetable for up to 50% of that higher taxable profit, minus the amount of EUR 1 million that may always be offset.
The scheme also contains transitional law. For the carry-forward of losses, losses incurred in financial years that started on or after 1 January 2013 fall under the new scheme that came into effect on 1 January 2022.You can read more about the loss relief rules .
The loss-relief scheme led to an unfortunate concurrence in the corporation income tax with the debt cancellation profit exemption. In certain casesthis made it more difficult for a loss-making company to restructure, namely if the claims against that company are waived. A waived claim results in a debt cancellation profit that is (partially) exempted under certain conditions. Due to the current loss relief rules, this debt cancellation profit could still lead to corporation tax being levied despite the exemption. This was not the intention and led to problems. As of 2025 the legislator has decided to solve the undesirable consequences of this concurrence and therefore from 1 January 2025 a separate scheme for write-off profits for corporate income tax purposes will apply. In most cases debt-cancellation profits will now be fully offsetable with losses (however, via quite complicated rules) and/or exempt for corporate income tax purposes, You can read more about the new rules for debt-cancellation profits in our  on this subject.
## Reporting obligations for digital platform operators (DAC7)
Through the DAC7 Directive, the European Union is introducing new measures to increase tax transparency in the digital economy. Digital Platform Operators are targeted to identify, trace, and report on revenues made by sellers on their digital platforms. DAC7 is implemented in national law as of 1 January 2023. Digital Platform Operators are required to report on the year 2023 for the first time in 2024. Digital Platform Operators should already have seller due diligence procedures and controls in place as of 1 January 2023.
## Treaty developments
The Netherlands pursues an active tax treaty policy in order to maintain and extend its wide tax treaty network. Most Dutch bilateral tax treaties are based on the OECD Model Tax Convention. The government has expressed that treaties with developing countries will be based on the United Nations (UN) Model Convention more often than was the case. In addition, in a press release dated 14 March 2024, it was stated that The Netherlands strives to include anti-abuse measures in its tax treaties with developing countries.The Netherlands has concluded bilateral tax treaties for the avoidance of double taxation on income and capital with over 90 countries worldwide. As of 1 July 2019, the multilateral instrument (MLI) has entered into force for the Netherlands. It first had effect on 1 January 2020.
New treaties are concluded regularly: new treatieswere signed with Belgium (2023, Andora (2023), Kyrgyzstan (2023), Moldavia (2023) and Bangladesh (2024) (all are yet to come into effect). Currently double tax treaties are negotiated or renegotiated with 13 countries: Aruba, Benin, Brazil, Ecuador, Germany,Morocco, Mozambique,Portugal, Romania,Suriname, Sweden and Uganda.
As of 8 December 2023, an additional mutual agreement with Belgium is in effect, which provides certainty in situations of cross-border employees who are working a part of their working time from their respective homes for employers that are based in the other country. Negotiations about a final mutual agreement are still ongoing (the 13th treaty that is being (re)negotiated). Currently, discussions are ongoing with Germany about the same topic. This is to result in a new Protocol to the current treaty.

# Netherlands
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Taxable period
Generally, the tax year is equal to the calendar year. However, corporate taxpayers may deviate from this by adopting a different financial year.
## Tax returns
Corporate taxpayers are required to file a tax return annually. The due date is generally five months after the end of the company’s financial year. This filing due date may be extended upon the taxpayer's request.
The Dutch tax authorities generally make a provisional assessment before issuing the final assessment. The final assessment must be issued within three years following the financial year it concerns. This period is prolonged with the time of the extension for filing the tax return. The Dutch tax authorities may issue an additional assessment if it appears that the amount of CIT due (as calculated in the final assessment) is too low.
During the current tax year, a provisional assessment can be issued on the basis of prior years’ taxable income or on an estimation provided by the taxpayer.
### Functional foreign currency regime
As a main rule, the CIT return should be filed in euros. Under certain conditions, however, the CITA allows the corporate taxpayer to file its tax return in a currency other than euros (the so-called 'functional currency regime'). The main conditions of the regime are as follows:
  * A request must be submitted with the tax inspector prior to the year as of which the regime is requested. The decision made by the tax inspector on the request is open to appeal.
  * If the request is granted, the functional foreign currency applies for at least ten years.
  * The foreign currency to be applied for tax purposes is also applied in the commercial accounts of the taxpayer, which currency is justified by the business conducted by the taxpayer or the international position of the group the taxpayer is part of.
  * The foreign currency to be applied is one of the currencies for which a ‘euro foreign exchange rate’ is published by the European Central Bank (ECB).
  * A fiscal unity for Dutch CIT purposes is eligible for the functional foreign currency regime, provided that all of the companies that are part of the fiscal unity have obtained permission to apply that regime.


Under the functional currency regime, the taxable amount is annually converted from functional currency into euros against the average of the exchange rate during the financial year (as published by the ECB). Any conversion result of the foreign currency to euros is no longer recognised under this regime for Dutch tax purposes.
## Payment of tax
The CIT assessed must be paid within six weeks from the date of the provisional or final assessment. Interest is payable on the CIT due. Interest on CIT assessments is calculated from six months following the financial year until the assessment is issued. This interest rate is 9 per cent (2025). Interest for late payment of a CIT assessment (calculated from six weeks after issuance) is 4 per cent (2025). You can find more background on how the interest percentages are calculated .
### Refund of tax unduly levied
If a corporate taxpayer is entitled to a refund of Dutch CIT or dividend WHT because the levy appeared to be in conflict with EU law, the Netherlands might be obligated to repay the unduly paid tax with interest corresponding to the period from the payment of levy to the refund of such levy to the taxpayer.
### Interest on late payment dividend WHT
Interest is calculated on late payments or refunds of Dutch dividend WHT.
## Tax audit process
Corporate taxpayers might be subject to audits by tax inspectors. This forms part of the so-called vertical monitoring tasks of the national tax authorities. In recent years, there has been a tendency towards a more enhanced cooperation between tax authorities and taxpayers in the Netherlands (_see Horizontal monitoring below_).
## Statute of limitations
Under certain conditions, the tax administration can, in case of domestic situations, impose an additional assessment within five years from the year in which the tax debt originated (if the filing due date was extended on request, this period is added). In case of income from abroad, the period for additional assessment is extended to 12 years.
Additional assessments may be imposed if the circumstances give rise to the additional tax assessment and the tax authorities have new knowledge about relevant facts that give rise to the additional tax assessment (a ‘new fact’ or ‘ _nieuw feit_ ’ in Dutch).
## Advance pricing agreement (APA)/Advance tax ruling (ATR)
Taxpayers are able to obtain (legal) certainty concerning their tax positions. They may request the Dutch tax authorities to conclude an APA with respect to the transfer pricing of controlled transactions. Taxpayers may also request the Dutch tax authorities to provide an ATR with respect to the CIT implications of a (contemplated) set of transactions.
In certain situations, no pre-consultation is allowed, namely when:
  * there is no sufficient relevant economic nexus
  * saving of Dutch or foreign tax is the sole or decisive reason for the transaction, or
  * a transaction takes place with a country that is on the Dutch list of low-tax jurisdictions.


Rulings are published in summarised and anonymous form. Situations in which pre-consultation has taken place but where the ruling has not been concluded are also published in summarised form, including an explanation of why the ruling was not concluded.
In principle, the tax authorities will make an effort to conclude APAs bilaterally, provided that a tax treaty has been concluded with the other country and that country is willing to cooperate in this respect.
## Horizontal monitoring
The Netherlands Tax and Customs Administration employs a cooperative compliance program dubbed ‘horizontal monitoring’ ('_horizontaal toezicht_ ' in Dutch). In 2020, a redesign of the program was announced to be effective as of 2023, grandfathering the period until then.
Under the new scheme, three groups of taxpayers are identified: (i) the so-called ‘Top 100’ of largest and/or most influential Dutch taxpayers, (ii) other taxpayers that are denominated by Book 2, Title 9 of the civil code (obliged to publish annual accounts), and (iii) other taxpayers. The first group will be served under a so-called ‘individual compliance approach’. The second group may apply for an individualised approach through covenants. The third group can only use the cooperative compliance program under covenants of Fiscal Service Providers. PwC is one of the qualified service providers. Only taxpayers who are willing to be transparent and cooperative, having a modern approach of tax control, and auditably proving this can enter the new cooperative compliance program.
On 11 September 2023, the Dutch Tax Authorities published the updated ‘Good Practices in Tax Control’. This should be read in conjunction with the previously updated ‘Guidelines on the Supervision on Large Businesses’ (2023, in Dutch). The 'Good Practices' are an answer to the questions that exist in practice regarding the design of tax control through a Tax Control Framework (TCF). The information is useful for organisations that participate in horizontal monitoring, but also for organisations that want more information about the design of a TCF. _For more information, please read more_.
The Dutch tax authorities will adjust the methods and intensity in which they perform their monitoring to the level of tax control of the taxpayer. Moreover, audits performed by the tax authorities may shift from reactive (tax audits over past years) to proactive (providing ‘assurance’ upfront and working with real-time data). Under horizontal monitoring, the company’s relationship with the Dutch tax authorities is based on trust, mutual understanding, and transparency. Horizontal monitoring can be applied to all tax types including, but not limited to, CIT, VAT, customs, wage tax, and social security.
## Anti-abuse provisions
The Dutch Corporate Income Tax Act and Dividend Withholding Tax Act contain several anti-abuse provisions that aim to counter artificial arrangements. In these cases, the taxpayer can prove that the arrangement is not artificial if it meets certain relevant substance requirements. The relevant substance requirements serve as an indication that the arrangement is not artificial, leaving room for other facts and circumstances to play a role in determining whether or not there is abuse. There are similar regulations in the Conditional Source Taxation Act.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The topics of focus for the Dutch tax authorities may vary.


# Netherlands
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
In the Netherlands, corporate residence is determined by each corporation’s facts and circumstances. Management and control are important factors in this respect. Companies incorporated under Dutch law are deemed to be residents of the Netherlands (although not with respect to certain provisions, such as the participation exemption and fiscal unity).
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Non-resident companies are liable to CIT only with respect to Dutch-source income, like profits from a PE or income from real estate located in the Netherlands.
Since 2020, the term ‘permanent establishment’ has been defined in the CIT law (‘Wet Vpb 1969’). This legal concept of the term ‘permanent establishment’ applies mutatis mutandis to personal income tax (‘Wet IB 2001’) and wage tax (‘Wet LB 1964’), and to the unilateral measures to prevent double taxation (‘Bvdb 2001’).
For treaty situations, the definition of the term ‘permanent establishment’ follows the definition in the applicable tax treaty. For non-treaty situations, the definition of the term ‘permanent establishment’ follows the definition of this term in Article 5 of the OECD Model Convention 2017.
The reason why the term 'permanent establishment' is defined in (CIT) law is due to the application of the MLI to Dutch tax law. The MLI, which entered into force in the Netherlands on 1 July 2019 and which applies from 1 January 2020, contains several provisions relating to the term ‘permanent establishment’.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Depreciation and amortisation
Generally, depreciation may be computed by a straight-line or a reducing-balance method or, in accordance with any other sound business practice, based on historical cost. Depreciation starts from the date the asset comes into use. Dutch tax law includes specific rules (_see below_) that potentially either limit or facilitate the depreciation of assets (e.g. immovable property, goodwill, and other fixed assets or environmental investments).
### Limited depreciation of immovable property
There are special provisions for depreciation of immovable property. A distinction is made between immovable property held for investment purposes and buildings used in a trade or business.
Investment property cannot be depreciated to an amount lower than the official property’s fair market value for tax purposes, which is known as _WOZ-waarde_. In other words, a property will not be subject to depreciation unless the carrying amount of the building and the land on which it is located is higher than its value for tax purposes. This value is determined by the municipal tax authorities annually. As this value is based on the assumption that the property is free of lease, the value for tax purposes of commercial real estate may be lower than fair market value.
It should still be possible to devalue immovable property at fair market value if this is demonstrably and lastingly lower than the book value. In addition, anti-abuse measures apply to prevent the division of land and buildings into separate legal entities or to related individuals.
Note that maintenance costs continue to qualify for tax relief and any maintenance-related value increase does not lead to a compulsory upward revaluation of the property. Moreover, a property is not required to be revaluated as its value increases due to market developments.
Depreciation of land is not permitted.
The sale of depreciated assets triggers tax on the difference between the sale price and the depreciated book value unless a reinvestment reserve is set up (_see Capital gains in the_ _section_).
### Limited amortisation of goodwill and depreciation of fixed assets
With regard to goodwill, the amortisation for tax purposes is limited to 10% of the purchase price _per annum_. Furthermore, the tax depreciation of other fixed assets (i.e. inventory, equipment) is limited to 20% of the purchase price or production costs _per annum_.
### Accelerated depreciation
The law provides accelerated depreciation of several specific assets. Accelerated depreciation applies to investments in assets that are in the interest of the protection of the environment in the Netherlands and that appear on the so-called VAMIL (_Vervroegde Afschrijving Milieu-investeringen_) list. The accelerated depreciation facility for investments in environment-improving assets is limited to 75% of the total (investment) costs. 
Accelerated depreciation is also available for certain other designated assets (e.g. investments of starting entrepreneurs).
Investment costs minus residual value of sea-vessels that are operated mainly from the Netherlands may be depreciated straight-line over five years. Instead of accelerated depreciation, these taxpayers may choose immediate taxation (_see Tonnage tax regime in the_ _section_).
## Deductibility limitations regarding interest and loans
Due to existing anti-abuse rules, the deduction for interest paid on intra-group debts relating to certain transactions is disallowed. Transactions that are in scope of these anti-abuse rules are an internal or external acquisition, a dividend payment (distribution of profit), or a capital contribution into an affiliated company (i.e. an interest in the company of at least 1/3). Interest that relates to the financing of such transactions is only deductible if the loan and the underlying transaction are based predominantly on sound business considerations (‘the double business motive test’) or if the interest received is effectively and sufficiently taxed by Dutch standards. As such, under the ‘double business motive test’, it must be substantiated that there are sound business reasons for both the loan and the transaction. When the debt ultimately is financed externally (outside the group) and a direct relationship exists between the internal debt and the ultimate external financing, it can generally be substantiated that there are sound business reasons for the loan. Interest is deemed to be effectively and sufficiently taxed if the interest is effectively subject to a taxation on profits of at least 10% determined according to Dutch standards. The use of tax losses or similar relief claims by the recipient of the inter-company interest affects whether the interest is sufficiently taxed in the hands of the recipient. If the taxpayer makes a reasonable case that the interest is taxable at an effective tax rate of at least 10%, the tax authorities, nevertheless, have the option to substantiate that either the liability or the corresponding transaction is not based on sound business reasons.
Furthermore, interest paid on certain profit participating loans will be qualified as a dividend and will not be tax deductible. Interest received upon these loans may meet the definitions for the participation exemption if the creditor also holds a qualifying participation in the debtor. Intra-group conduits may be denied a credit of foreign WHT with respect to royalties or interest received if no economic risk is deployed.
The Netherlands applies an earnings stripping rule. This rule limits the deduction of the on balance interest cost to 20% (note that the new government announced an increase to 25%) of the taxpayer’s EBITDA, with a threshold of EUR 1 million and a carryforward rule for the (part of the) interest that may not be deductible in a tax year to later tax years without time limitation. The Dutch government has proposed the abolition of the 1 million threshold for real estate companies as effective from 1 January 2025.
For the application of the rules on ‘the deduction of interest on loans that are directly or indirectly granted by a group company in order to finance an acquisition or capital contribution deduction’ and on the ‘deduction of excess interest on debts that are deemed to be related to the financing of participations’, the Dutch legislator has ‘switched off’ the fiscal unity (_see the section_). Please note, however, that the Dutch fiscal unity maintains its normal effect in relation to the earnings stripping rule.
## Provision for bad debt
It is possible to make a provision for future expenses with a cause existing on the balance sheet date (during the financial year) of the tax year in question.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions are deductible if certain conditions are met. The gift must be documented in writing and contributed to a qualifying charity (ANBI or supporting foundation [SBBI]). The deductible amount may not exceed 50% of the taxable profits, with a maximum of EUR 100,000.
Gifts in kind with value of more than EUR 10,000 per calendar year are only eligible for deduction if the value can be substantiated with invoices or valuation reports that meet certain standards. In this respect, the waiver of receivables is also considered as a gift in kind.
Donations to a cultural organisation may be multiplied by 1.5 in respect of the CIT deduction for gifts, subject to a maximum of EUR 2,500. This multiplier may be applied to a maximum of EUR 5,000 for cultural gifts.
A favour or contribution in cash does not qualify for the gift deduction.
## Limited deductibility of costs relating to remuneration by way of shares
Any remuneration by way of shares, profit-sharing certificates, option rights on shares, or similar rights is not deductible.
Costs related to so-called stock appreciation rights for employees that earn an income that exceeds EUR 699,000 (2025 amount) are not deductible.
## Fines and penalties
Most criminal fines and penalties are not tax deductible. This applies, for instance, to fines imposed by a Dutch criminal judge, administrative fines, disciplinary fines, and penalties from a European institution.
## Taxes
Certain taxes, such as the tax on insurance transactions, are deductible. Tax paid on the transfer of immovable property must be included in the cost price and taken into account in the course of normal depreciation. The CIT itself is not deductible.
## Other significant items
Deduction of certain expenses (e.g. costs for food, drink, and entertainment) paid by employers for employees are not deductible, in part. These costs are often referred to as mixed costs. The non-deductible portion is 0.4% of the total taxable wages of all employees but never less than EUR 5,600 per year (2025 amount). Alternatively, the employer may choose to deduct only 73.5% of the actual expenses.
## Net operating losses
From 1 January 2022 onwards, an indefinite loss carryforward applies. Yet, losses (both carryforward and carryback) can only be fully deducted up to an amount of EUR 1 million taxable profit. If the profit in a year exceeds EUR 1 million, the losses are only deductible up to 50% of the higher taxable profit minus an amount of EUR 1 million. For the carryforward of losses, losses incurred in financial years that started on or after 1 January 2013 also fall under the new scheme that comes into effect on 1 January 2022, so these losses will be indefinite.
These rules also apply to start-up losses.
### Liquidation and cessation loss rules
Dutch CIT payers can take foreign liquidation losses (in the case of legal entities) and foreign cessation losses (in the case of PEs) into account, subject to strict limitations.
Losses arising from both EU/EEA and non-EU/EEA interests up to the amount of EUR 5 million will remain deductible. However, the liquidation or cessation loss can only be taken into account if the liquidation or cessation is completed within three years after the activities stopped or after the decision to stop them has been made.
Losses exceeding the EUR 5 million mark are subject to the following limitation:
  * The liquidation loss provision would be applicable only:
    * in EU/EEA situations and
    * with regard to interests giving rise to decisive influence on the participation’s activities (generally in case of ownership of more than 50% of the voting rights).


Cessation losses of PEs (within the so-called 'object exemption') exceeding EUR 5 million are also only deductible in EU/EEA situations.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
A Dutch corporation can generally claim a deduction for royalties, management service fees and most other charges paid to foreign affiliates, to the extent that the amounts are not in excess of what it would pay an unrelated entity (i.e. arm’s-length principle). Dutch companies are obligated to produce transfer pricing documentation describing the calculation of the transfer price and the comparability of the transfer price with third-party prices.
According to Dutch case law payments that are not at arm’s length or the absence of at arm’s length payments in intra-group relations need to be adjusted, meaning that payments have to be imputed or disregarded for the purposes of income determination depending on the situation at hand. If, however, such an adjustment would lead to an additional cost or the recognition of less income deviating from the contractual provisions (an adjustment minus), this minus will only be taken into account if and insofar at the counterpart a corresponding plus is/will be taken into account for profit tax purposes. The burden of proof in this respect lies with the taxpayer. 
### Transfer pricing documentation 
Dutch transfer pricing regulations prescribe that all corporate taxpayers should include transfer pricing documentation in their administrations documenting the arm's length nature of intercompany transactions, even if it is between two Dutch entities. 
For companies part of a larger multinational group additional documentation requirements have been put in place in line with Chapter V of the OECD Transfer Pricing guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations. Besides the basic administration requirement and being able to prepare an overview showing that the transfer pricing was correctly applied and is correctly reflected in the results reported in the financial statements, there are two additional reporting obligations for large, multinational companies.
The first obligation states that taxpayers must submit a country-by-country report to the Dutch tax authorities annually. This obligation only applies to taxpayers part of a multinational group with a consolidated group turnover of at least EUR 750 million (in the prior financial year). In principle, as the report is to be prepared for the total group, a country-by-country report only needs to be filed in the Netherlands (with the Dutch tax authorities) if the ultimate parent company of a multinational group is a Dutch resident company or if a Dutch entity is designated as the so-called surrogate parent entity. If the taxpayer is none of these, it will have to notify the tax authorities which group entity will file the report. 
The second obligation requires taxpayers in the Netherlands who are part of a multinational group with a consolidated group turnover of at least EUR 50 million in the previous financial year, to have a so-called master file and a local file in their administration. The master file must contain an overview of the activities of the multinational group, including a description of the nature of the business activities, the general transfer pricing policy and the worldwide allocation of income and economic activities. The local file is to contain a prescribed list of information and explanations.

## Fiscal unity regime
A Dutch resident parent company and its Dutch resident subsidiaries (if the parent owns at least 95% of the shares) may, under certain conditions, file a tax return as one entity (fiscal unity). The fiscal unity regime is available for companies having their place of effective management in the Netherlands, both for Dutch tax and treaty purposes. It is also possible to form a fiscal unity with a PE of a non-Dutch EU/EEA resident company as the parent of the fiscal unity if this PE holds at least 95% of the shares in a Dutch subsidiary. The opposite is also possible, where a Dutch resident parent forms a fiscal unity with a Dutch PE of a non-Dutch EU/EEA resident company. Moreover, it is possible to form a fiscal unity between two or more Dutch resident ‘sister’ companies if a non-Dutch EU resident holds at least 95% of the shares in both Dutch companies. Finally, it is possible to form a Dutch fiscal unity between Dutch entities that are linked via a non-Dutch resident EU/EEA intermediary holding company. The fiscal unity means that taxation takes place on the basis of full consolidation of assets and liabilities and profits and losses. Therefore, profits of one company can be offset against losses of another company forming part of that fiscal unity. Furthermore, inter-company transactions within the fiscal unity are eliminated.
A cross-border fiscal unity including non-Dutch resident companies, other than Dutch PEs of non-Dutch resident companies, is not possible. The CJEU has decided that this aspect of the Dutch fiscal unity regime does not violate EU law (the freedom of establishment), insofar as it disallows a cross-border fiscal unity (nr. C-337/08).
However, the CJEU has decided that certain effects of the fiscal unity regime, which are beneficial to the taxpayer, should also be granted in cross-border EU/EEA situations if, hypothetically, another EU-resident group company could have been included in a fiscal unity with a Dutch resident company if the EU/EEA-resident group company were a Dutch resident company (nr. C-398/16 and C-399/16). The effects of the fiscal unity are effects other than cross-border loss utilisation, e.g. effects relating to interest deduction limitations, to domestic loss compensation (qualification of the type of losses), and to the application of the participation exemption. These effects together are known as the ‘per element-approach’. _In this respect, we also refer to the_ _and_ _sections_.
In the wake of the 2018 CJEU ruling of the ‘per element approach’ applicable to the Dutch fiscal unity regime, ‘emergency measures’ were retroactively enacted as of 1 January 2018. Based on these ‘emergency measures’, certain provisions in the Dutch Corporate Income Tax Act (CITA) apply as if there was no fiscal unity, despite the presence of a Dutch fiscal unity. These provisions include the application of the rules on ‘the deduction of interest on loans that are directly or indirectly granted by a group company in order to finance an acquisition or capital contribution deduction’. The same holds true for elements of the participation exemption with respect to the portfolio investment participations and the ‘anti-mismatch’ rule, as well as for the limitation of the utilisation of losses after a change of 30% or more of the ultimate control in a company and the effective reduction of dividend WHT payments in case of certain re-distributions of dividends. As of late 2020, the shaping of the future fiscal unity regime is being reconsidered by the Dutch government, with a decision to be made by a next government (formation only completed in December 2021).
## Transfer pricing
Dutch transfer pricing regulations are in line with Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action 13 and besides the basic administration requirement and being able to prepare an overview showing that the transfer pricing was correctly applied and is correctly reflected in the results reported in the financial statements, there are two additional reporting obligations for large, multinational companies.
The first obligation states that taxpayers must submit a country-by-country (CbC) report to the Dutch tax authorities annually. This obligation only applies to multinational groups with a consolidated group turnover of at least EUR 750 million (in the prior financial year). In principle, a CbC report only needs to be filed in the Netherlands (with the Dutch tax authorities) if the ultimate parent company of a multinational group is a Dutch resident company or if a Dutch entity is designated as the surrogate parent. 
The second obligation requires taxpayers in the Netherlands who are part of a multinational group with a consolidated group turnover of at least EUR 50 million in the previous financial year to have a basic file and a local file in their administration. The basic file must contain an overview of the activities of the multinational group, including a description of the nature of the business activities, the general transfer pricing policy, and the worldwide allocation of income and economic activities.
### Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
The Netherlands has implemented the OECD outcomes in the area of CbC reporting. The documentation obligations include the requirement for eligible taxpayers to produce a CbC report, a master file, and a local file.
### Public Country-by-country (CbC) reporting 
The Netherlands has implemented the EU's Public CbCR Directive. A reporting obligation arises for multinational groups with a consolidated net turnover of at least EUR 750 million in each of the last two consecutive financial years if the group’s ultimate parent is either:
a) headquartered in the Netherlands, or
b) headquartered in a third country and operates in the Netherlands through a qualifying subsidiary or branch.
In the second case, the Dutch subsidiary/branch needs to publish the pCbCR report after asking the parent entity and if no report or data is provided, complile such a report at its best effort. 
The pCBCR report, including key financial data that broadly overlaps with the data provided for “private” CbCR purposes, needs to be disclosed at the Dutch business register (KvK - Kamer van Koophandel) and made available on the website of the entity or any affiliated one.The report may be accompanied by a narrative explaining the data. 
The pCBCR obligation in the Netherlands arises for companies with financial years starting on 22 June 2024. This means that for most Dutch companies that follow the calendar year, the 2025 data (corresponding to the FY 2025) becomes relevant and reportable by the end of 2026.

## Thin capitalisation
There are no thin capitalisation rules as such, but the Netherlands has implemented the ATAD I earning stripping rules (_see Deductibility limitations regarding interest and loans in the_ _section_).
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
The CFC-regime aims to target corporate taxpayers that hold a direct or indirect interest, either standalone or with affiliated companies, of more than 50% in a subsidiary or disposes of a PE in either a low-taxed jurisdiction (i.e. a statutory CIT rate of less than 9%) or a non-cooperative jurisdiction that is explicitly listed by the Dutch Ministry of Finance. Under conditions, certain proceeds of the CFC will be included in the taxable base of the taxpayer.
Furthermore, interests of 25% or more in a company of which the assets consist (nearly) exclusively of low-taxed portfolio investments should be annually valued, as an asset, at the fair market value. The participation exemption is not applicable to portfolio investment participations unless these participations are qualifying portfolio investment participations for the participation exemption. A portfolio investment participation can only qualify for the participation exemption if either the intention of holding the participation is not an investment intention or if the participation is, in itself, either subject to sufficient tax or if the participation holds sufficient qualifying assets. This rule prevents shareholders of low-taxed portfolio investment participations from benefiting from the Dutch participation exemption. Dividends not qualifying under the participation exemption are taxable in full at the ordinary CIT rate. Double taxation is avoided by applying the tax credit method, unless the portfolio investment shareholding effectively is not subject to tax at all. For EU shareholdings, it is possible to credit the actual underlying tax.

Rates for Dutch branch (or PE) profits of non-resident companies are the same as for other corporate profits, but no (withholding) tax is withheld on transfers of profits from the branch to the head office. The tax base is, in principle, calculated on the same rules as for Dutch-resident companies.

## Foreign tax credit
_See Foreign income in the section for a description of the foreign tax credit regime_.
## Small investments
There is a system of deductions for small investments, the so-called small scale investment deduction. To calculate this annual deduction, investments of more than EUR 450 each are totalled to determine the percentage of the deduction. The brackets are as follows as of 1 January 2025:
Total of investments (EUR) | Deduction  
---|---  
0 to 2,900 | 0  
2,900 to 70,602 | 28% of the value of the total of small investments  
70,602 to 130,744 | EUR 19,769  
130,744 to 392,230 | EUR 19,769 minus 7.56% of the amount exceeding EUR 130,744  
Above 392,230 | 0  
The application of the small-scale investment deduction works as follows for investments of a taxpayer who is a participant of a partnership. First, the investments for the partnership of all the participants and the non-company investments made by the taxpayer concerned shall be added together (‘total relevant investments’). Consequently, the small-scale investment deduction for the relevant taxpayer shall be the amount of deduction that could be derived from the table above, multiplied by the investment amount made by the taxpayer, and divided by the 'total relevant investments'.
## Investments in energy-efficient assets
For investments in new energy-efficient business assets that meet the Energy List requirements, an additional deduction (EIA) from CIT is available. The minimum investment amount per asset is EUR 2,500. The allowance equals a percentage of the annual amount, with a maximum of 151,000,000 euro (2025), of eligible energy investments. The right to the EIA is declared with the tax return, provided the investment is reported previously in time to the Netherlands Enterprise Agency (www.rvo.nl). An investment can be reported in phases, but the minimum amount for notification is 2,500 euro. In 2025, the allowance amounts to 40 per cent.
## Investments in environmental assets
For investments in certain new environmental improving assets that meet the Environment List requirements, an additional deduction (MIA) from corporate income is available. The minimum investment amount per asset is 2,500 euro. In 2025, the allowance equals 45 per cent, 36 per cent, or 27 per cent (depending on the ministerial classification of the assets) of the annual amount, with a maximum of 50 million euro, of eligible environmental investments. The right to the MIA is declared with the tax return, provided the investment is reported previously in good time to the Netherlands Enterprise Agency (). An investment can be reported in phases, but the minimum amount for notification is 2,500 euro.
## New technology
### Wage costs
Conducting certain R&D activities on applied new technology is subsidised by a reduction of wage tax to be paid on wages of employees engaged in R&D of technologically new products. The subsidy accrues to the employer when the employee is credited for the normal amount of wage tax. The subsidy is based on specific legislation (WBSO).
To obtain the relief under the R&D incentive programme, taxpayers must file an electronic/online application with the Netherlands Enterprise Agency (). The taxpayer will receive an R&D declaration. The budget for this subsidy is fixed, so the amount of the subsidy is dependent on budget availability. Note that self-developed and utilised software falls within the scope of the R&D incentive under certain conditions.
The WBSO application for R&D includes not only salary costs but also other costs and expenses related to R&D. The benefit of the fiscal scheme is awarded in the form of a wage tax reduction. In 2025, the benefit amounts to 36 per cent of the first 380,000 euro of R&D costs and 16 per cent of the excess (both salary and other costs and expenses). For start-ups, this amounts to 50 per cent of the first 380,000 euro of R&D costs. Note that the maximum benefit cannot exceed the total amount of wage tax due. Instead of applying for the real costs and expenses (non-salary costs), the taxpayer may choose to take into account a fixed amount based on R&D hours. The fixed amount is 10 euro per hour for the first 1,800 R&D hours and 4 euros per hour for all R&D hours exceeding the 1,800 R&D hours. Withholding agents are obligated to report the number of hours, costs, and expenses jointly for all R&D statements granted in a calendar year.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## WHT on dividends
Dividends from Dutch resident corporations are generally subject to a 15% Dutch dividend WHT. In general, this does not apply to the Dutch cooperative (i.e. ‘co-op’) in a business-driven structure, a widely used vehicle for holding and financing activities, although anti-abuse rules are applicable. Additionally, dividends may be exempted under Dutch tax law, subject to anti-abuse rules, if:
  * the recipient of the dividends distributed by the Dutch entity is a resident of the European Union, European Economic Area, or another state with which the Netherlands has concluded a tax treaty that includes a dividend article (provided that the company is not regarded as tax resident of another country based on a tax treaty between the state mentioned above and another country), and
  * the recipient of the dividends would have been able to apply the Dutch participation exemption or the participation credit to the dividends if it would have been a resident of the Netherlands.


_For more detail on anti-abuse rules applicable to Dutch WHTs, please see Anti-abuse provisions in the section_.
## Conditional WHT on interest, royalty, and dividend payments
The Netherlands applies a conditional withholding tax (WHT) on dividend, interest, and royalty payments (the Conditional Source Taxation Act). This tax is only levied on interest, royalty and dividend payments to affiliated companies in designated low-tax jurisdictions and in certain (tax abuse) situations. In principle, the tax is withheld from the company that makes the payment, but levied from the recipient. However, if the withholding tax has not been applied correctly, the tax inspector may also issue an additional tax assessment to the recipient of the payment or even the director of the paying company. The withholding tax applies to payments made to companies in designated low-tax jurisdictions (i.e. jurisdictions with a statutory CIT rate of less than 9 per cent) or are on the EU list for non-cooperative jurisdictions. A Dutch list of low-taxed and non-cooperative jurisdictions is updated annually on the 1st of October, and becomes applicable the following year.Currently Listed Countries (both Dutch and EU and applicable as of 2025) are American Samoa,Anguilla, Bahamas, Bahrein, Barbados, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Fiji, Guam, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey, Palau, Panama, Russia, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkmenistan, Turks and Caicos Islands, US Virgin Islands, Vanuatu.
The conditional WHT will only be levied on payments between affiliated companies. For purposes of the conditional WHT, companies are affiliated if there is a controlling relationship, whether or not directly held or through other affiliated entities. There may also be affiliation for conditional WHT purposes if there is a certain collaboration between one or more entities that jointly have a controlling interest. Apart from direct payments made to affiliated companies in Listed Countries, the WHT may also apply to abusive situations (situations where artificial structures are put in place with the main purpose or one of the main purposes to avoid the Dutch WHT).
The WHT tax is levied at a rate equal to the highest rate of Dutch CIT in the current tax year. For 2025, this rate is 25.8%. The WHT rate may, however, be reduced by a tax treaty. The table below sets out the rates of WHT applicable to the most common payments of dividends under Dutch domestic law where such a liability arises and the reduced rates that may be available under an applicable tax treaty. For interest and royalty payments, we included the levies under the relevant treaty, but keep in mind that the tax is conditional and may not be applicable in your specific situation.
## Multilateral instrument
The Multilateral Instrument (MLI) may have effect on Dutch tax treaties from 1 January 2020 onwards. The MLI allows countries to quickly and efficiently amend their tax treaties to combat tax avoidance, without the need for renegotiation and has a fundamental impact on how taxpayers access any tax treaty that both contracting states have opted to be covered by the MLI, subject to the options and reservations both have made in relation to a range of matters (including the date on which it will take effect for particular taxes). 
To prevent treaty abuse, countries can choose to apply the Limitations On Benefits (LOB) provision or the Principal Purpose Test (PPT). The Netherlands has opted to apply the PPT (art. 7 paragraph 1 of the MLI). This means that the benefits of a covered tax treaty will not be attributed for a component of income if obtaining that treaty benefit was one of the principal reasons for an arrangement or transaction that resulted in that benefit, unless it is established that granting that benefit is consistent with the object and purpose of the relevant treaty provision.
## Overview of WHT rates for domestic corporations
The table below provides an overview of the taxes that domestic corporations are required to withhold. The effect of the MLI has been included for the tax treaties of which Australia, Bosnia Herzegovina, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Georgia, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Kazakhstan, Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, New Zealand, Norway, Qatar, Serbia, Singapore, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom) In these texts, the concrete consequences of the MLI are presented in a legible manner in the continuous text of the treaty.

However, dividend WHT may be levied on certain profit participating loans. The 25.8% percent rate is levied if the conditional withholding tax is applicable.
  2. The lowest rate applies if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership and/or with limited liability / a capital divided into shares) that directly holds at least 25% of the capital of the Dutch company paying the dividends. For the treaty with Morocco, there is also an anti-abuse rule applicable. For Serbia, the Slovak Republic, as well as Israel and France, an additional 365 day holding period applies (under the MLI).
  3. The 5% rate is applicable if the foreign company directly owns 10% of the capital of the Dutch company. The 0% rate is applicable if the dividend originates from ordinary taxed profits and the dividend is tax exempt in the hands of the recipient.

Also, treaties with Colombia and Curacao are in the final stages of becoming effective.
  6. Indicates that this country is a member state of the European Union. The EU Parent/Subsidiary Directive has been in effect since from 1 January 1992. According to the Directive, dividends paid by a Dutch company (BV or NV) to a qualifying parent company resident in another EU member state must be exempt from Dutch WHT, provided certain conditions are met. Among other things, the EU parent company must hold at least 10% of the Dutch dividend-paying company’s capital (or, in certain cases, voting rights) for a continuous period of at least one year. Please note that the Dutch tax legislation is more lenient with respect to the minimum holding; it only requires a holding of 5% at the moment of distribution. A provisional exemption from dividend WHT will apply from the start of the one-year holding period. The exemption will be cancelled retroactively if, following the dividend distribution, the one-year holding requirement is not actually met. The Dutch dividend-distributing company must provide to the Dutch tax authorities a satisfactory guarantee for the payment of dividend WHT that, but for the provisional exemption, would be due. The exemption is also applicable if the parent company is a resident of an EU member state and owns at least 10% of the (voting) shares in the Dutch company but only on the basis of reciprocity (Finland, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, Spain, and United Kingdom).

The CRS is implemented in Netherland’s domestic law as of 1 January 2016. The same holds true for the amended EU Directive on Administrative Cooperation.
Based on this domestic law, financial service companies in the Netherlands must comply with certain administrative obligations and report information on foreign account holders to the Dutch tax authorities. This information may include account numbers and the balance on a bank account of foreign account holders.
## Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS)
According to the Netherlands, the BEPS issues should be addressed through international cooperation. As a member of the OECD, the Netherlands is an active participant in the BEPS project of the OECD and supports its goals. As a consequence, the Netherlands will enact legislation when agreement is reached within the OECD on the BEPS project and all parties agreed to implement. The tax treaty related outcomes of the BEPS project are considered part of the Netherlands’ tax treaty policy.
The Netherlands has signed the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (Multilateral Instrument or MLI) to implement the tax treaty related outcomes of BEPS. The Netherlands has brought nearly all of its bilateral tax treaties within the scope of the MLI.
## EU state aid
The European Commission has been investigating for several years whether certain schemes/regimes, as well as individual tax rulings, between companies and local authorities are in breach of EU state aid rules. In some of these cases, the European Commission has already issued final decisions concluding that these schemes and tax rulings constitute unlawful state aid. One of these final state aid decisions concerns a Dutch tax ruling. The Dutch government has appealed this decision with the General Court (i.e. the court of first instance within the European Union). In its judgement, the General Court annulled the decision of the European Commission because, in the Court’s view, the European Commission did not demonstrate the existence of an economic advantage within the meaning of EU state aid rules.
The Dutch government has taken the position that the Dutch tax ruling practice, in general, does not allow for state aid, considering that Dutch tax rulings do not deviate from Dutch tax law as the goal of Dutch tax rulings is to obtain certainty in advance.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Inventory valuation
In general, stock/inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost may be determined on the basis of first in first out (FIFO), last in first out (LIFO), base stock, or average cost. The LIFO system may be used for commercial/financial and tax purposes.
There is no requirement of conformity between commercial/financial and tax reporting.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are taxed as ordinary income. However, capital gains realised on disposal of shares qualifying for the participation exemption are tax exempt (_see Dividend income below_).
The gain on disposal of depreciable assets may be carried over to a special tax deferral reinvestment reserve but must then be deducted from the acquisition cost of the later acquired assets. Except in special circumstances, the reserve cannot be maintained for more than three consecutive years. If the reserve has not been fully applied after three years, the remainder will be added to the taxable profit.
Capital losses are deductible unless attributable to the disposal of a shareholding qualifying for the participation exemption.
## Dividend income
Subject to meeting the conditions for the participation exemption, a Dutch company or branch of a foreign company is fully exempt from Dutch tax on all benefits connected with a qualifying shareholding, including cash dividends, dividends in kind, bonus shares, hidden profit distributions, capital gains, and currency exchange results. As of 1 January 2022, there are rules to prevent mismatches that may occur from applying the arm’s-length principle in international groups.
### Participation exemption
The participation exemption will apply to a shareholding in a Dutch company if the holding is at least 5% of the investee’s capital, provided the conditions are met.
As a general rule, the participation exemption is applicable as long as the participation is not held as a portfolio investment. The intention of the parent company, which can be based on the particular facts and circumstances, is decisive. Regardless of the company’s intention, the participation exemption is also applicable if the sufficient tax test (i.e. the income is subject to a real profit tax of at least 10%) or the asset test (i.e. the subsidiary's assets do not usually consist of more than 50% of portfolio investments) is met.
### Tax credit method for non-qualifying participations
For portfolio investment participations not qualifying for the participation exemption, double taxation will be avoided by applying the tax credit method, unless the portfolio investment shareholding effectively is not subject to tax at all. For EU shareholdings, it is optional to credit the actual underlying tax. Note that the provisions regarding portfolio investments (both domestic and foreign) also apply within a Dutch corporate tax fiscal unity. Due to the amendments to the EU’s Parent-Subsidiary Directive, a corporate taxpayer is not eligible for the participation exemption or participation credit for received distributed profits to the extent that such distributed profits are deductible by the subsidiary ('anti-mismatch rule'). Similar rules apply throughout the European Union. 
Dividends not qualifying under the participation exemption regime for an exemption or credit are taxable in full at the ordinary CIT rate.
Interests of 25% or more in a company of which the assets consist (nearly) exclusively of portfolio investments should be annually valued, as an asset, at the fair market value.
Costs related to the acquisition and disposal of a participation (e.g. legal fees, compensations, notary fees) are not deductible for CIT purposes.
In certain circumstances, losses arising from the liquidation of a (foreign) subsidiary could be deductible for CIT purposes (_see Net operating losses in the section_).
A taxpayer who derives income from a participation that first qualified but at a certain point in time no longer qualifies for the participation exemption, or _vice versa_ , must attribute the income to the taxable and the tax-exempt period accordingly (‘compartmentalisation rules’). The compartmentalisation rules apply to all changes in the application of the participation exemption regime irrespective of whether caused by a change in facts and circumstances or a change in legislation. It applies to both capital gains and dividend distributions.
### Stock dividends
For the purposes of income determination in respect of dividend WHT, stock dividends are taxed as dividend income to the extent that they are paid out of earned surplus. They are not taxable if paid out of share premium (‘ _agio_ ’), provided the share premium account was not created pursuant to a share-for-share merger, in which only Dutch companies were involved. In the case of a share-for-share merger, in which shares in foreign subsidiaries were contributed to a Dutch company, the Dutch company can distribute the difference between the fair market value and the paid-in capital of the subsidiaries being contributed as a stock dividend without triggering Dutch dividend WHT (step-up in basis), provided certain requirements are met.
Whether a stock dividend is regarded as a taxable profit for CIT purposes depends on the specific circumstances at hand. Dividend WHT can be credited against the CIT payable. However, in a year this cannot lead to a refund of dividend WHT/CIT: both in domestic (Dutch) and in foreign situations the set-off of dividend WHT (and gambling tax) against CIT is limited to the amount of CIT due before the set off. Effectively this means that companies are no longer entitled to refunds of dividend WHT (and gambling tax). Taxes that cannot be set off in a year are carried forward to future years without time limitation.
## Interest income
Interest income is taxed as ordinary income against the regular CIT rate. Note there is a conditional source taxation on interest income (_see the section_).
## Royalty income
Royalty income is taxed as ordinary income against the regular CIT rate. Note there is a conditional source taxation on interest income (_see the section_).
## Work in progress
Profits with regard to work in progress should be accounted before actual completion, to the extent that the work is completed (percentage of completion). All project costs should be recognised in the year the costs were incurred.
## Foreign income
In general, a Dutch resident company is subject to CIT on its worldwide income. However, certain income is exempt (e.g. due to the application of the participation exemption described above) or excluded from the tax base.
Certain foreign-sourced income (foreign branch income, real estate income, and other income) is ‘excluded’ from the Dutch taxable base. The so-called ‘object exemption’ or ‘base exemption’, a method to provide relief for international juridical double taxation in situations of Dutch companies with a PE abroad, is designed as a tax base adjustment instead of a real exemption. Consequently, losses of foreign PEs can no longer be offset against profits of the Dutch head office (except for final losses), but currency exchange results are still included in the tax base. Also, if the foreign activities cease and certain requirements are met, losses upon ‘liquidation’ can be deducted. For certain low-taxed passive PEs, the object exemption is replaced by a credit system.
Double taxation of foreign dividends, interest, and royalties is relieved by a (full or partial) tax credit for foreign paid tax at the source (most often a WHT) provided by Dutch tax treaties or unilaterally if the payer of the income streams is a resident of a developing country designated by Ministerial Order. If no treaty or unilateral relief applies, a deduction of the foreign tax paid as a cost is allowed in computing the net taxable income.
However, relief by exemption is given for dividends from foreign investments qualifying for the participation exemption, _as discussed under Dividend income above_. In that case, there is no Dutch tax available to credit for taxes withheld at the source in the subsidiary’s country of residence.
In most circumstances, the foreign dividend is exempt from Dutch CIT under the participation exemption, as previously discussed. As a consequence, foreign WHT cannot be credited, and the WHT constitutes a real cost for the companies concerned. A credit of the foreign WHT is granted against Dutch dividend WHT due on the distribution to foreign parents of the Dutch company. The credit amounts to a maximum of 3% of the gross dividend paid, to the extent that it can be paid out of foreign-source dividends received that have been subject to a WHT rate of at least 5% and the foreign company is liable to CIT. This tax credit does not result in taxable income for CIT purposes.
The offsetting of dividend tax and gambling tax against CIT is limited to the annual amount of CIT due. WHTs that cannot be set off will be carried forward for offsetting in the next year.


# Netherlands
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
In general, a Dutch resident company is subject to CIT on its worldwide income. However, certain income can be exempted or excluded from the tax base. Non-resident entities only have a limited tax liability with regard to income from Dutch sources.
## Standard corporate income tax (CIT) rate
The standard CIT rate is 25.8%. There are two taxable income brackets. A lower rate of 19% applies to the first income bracket of EUR 200,000. The standard rate applies to the excess of the taxable income.
## Fiscal investment fund regime
In general terms, under the existing fiscal investment fund regime, the CIT rate for fiscal investment funds is 0%, provided that their profit is made available to the shareholders and holders of certificates of participation no later than eight months after year-end.
As mentioned in the , as of 1 January 2025, a measure will become effective on the basis of which fiscal investment funds are no longer able to invest directly in Dutch real estate (real estate measure). The real estate measure is intended to ensure that profits earned from Dutch real estate can, in all cases, be taxed with CIT and that an effective levy is guaranteed, including, for example, in all cases in which foreign investors invest in Dutch real estate. No change will be made for fiscal investment funds investing in securities.
_Read more on this topic in our._
## Exempt investment fund regime
The exempt investment fund regime exists next to the fiscal investment fund regime described above. In order to be eligible for the exempt investment fund regime, the investment fund has to fulfil the definition of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (_Wet op het financieel toezicht_), which means that its investments are limited to financial instruments such as shares, bonds, options, and futures traded on qualifying stock markets (e.g. Euronext, FTSE, Nasdaq, Dow Jones). Apart from the exempt status for CIT purposes, the exempt investment fund is not required to withhold dividend WHT with regard to profit distributions to its shareholders. Please note that from 1 January 2025, access to the exempt investment fund regime is only open to regulated institutions within the framework of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act.
## Innovation box regime
Taxpayers are eligible to apply the innovation box to qualifying income from qualifying self-developed intangible assets. These intangible assets qualify in case they are developed by the taxpayer in the course of an S&O-project (i.e. Dutch wage tax incentive for research and development [R&D] activities). The qualifying R&D income is effectively subject to a tax rate of 9%. This lower tax rate only applies to positive income.
The innovation box has two entry tickets, namely:
  1. The possession of an intangible asset that has resulted from activities for which a so-called ‘R&D certificate’ (WBSO) has been issued.
  2. The possession of a so-called ’legal access ticket‘, such as a patent or plant breeder right.


Smaller companies only have to meet the first entry ticket. Larger companies that are part of a group with a consolidated turnover of at least EUR 50 million or a gross income from innovations of at least EUR 7.5 million in that current year and the four preceding years must adhere to both entry tickets.
Application of the innovation box introduces more extensive administration obligations. One requirement is that the taxpayer must report information detailing which technical innovation have been produced, as well as a specification of expenditure per innovation and how the benefits for each intangible asset or group of related intangible assets are determined (‘tracking and tracing‘). The fact that more detailed tracking and tracing needs to take place as mentioned above also means that attention is required on ensuring the correct determination per technical innovation or group of related innovations (‘aggregation levels’). This effectively means analysing which intangible asset originates from which R&D-project and links to which product group. Next to that, for large taxpayers, a legal access ticket should be linked to the product.
The innovation box is only applicable to ’qualifying benefits‘, as it can only be applied on activities with adequate substance. In this regard, only self-developed innovations (designated with a more technical term as ‘intangible assets’) can qualify for the innovation box. Therefore, purchased intangible assets do not qualify for use of the innovation box. Also, subcontracted development activities (not self-development) are subject to the nexus fraction. A 30% uplift is allowed to subcontract development activities. After exceeding this uplift, the applicability of the innovation box decreases due to the effects of the nexus fraction.
The Dutch innovation box regime is aligned with the modified nexus approach as described in the OECD report on Action 5 and is considered as non-harmful by the EU Code of Conduct Group.
_For more information on the innovation box, see_.
## Tonnage tax regime
In order to stimulate entrepreneurs engaged in ocean shipping, a favourable regime (known as the Dutch tonnage tax regime) may be available to certain shipping companies. Under this regime, the taxable profit of a sea-going vessel is based on its registered net tonnage multiplied by a fixed amount of deemed profit per ton instead of the actual profits from the exploitation. The regime only applies to the calculation of the profit related to the qualifying shipping activities. These activities include operating vessels in international traffic (including transportation for the purpose of the exploitation of natural resources at sea), cable and pipe-laying activities at the bottom of the sea, and towing and dredging and connected activities. The profits from the qualifying activities are taxed at a deemed tonnage profit according to a five bracket regressive scale system. The tonnage tax regime applies upon request and for a fixed period of ten years or multiples of the ten-year period.
_Please read more on tonnage tax._
## Local income taxes
There are no provincial or municipal corporate income taxes in the Netherlands.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT, known in Dutch as the _Belasting over de Toegevoegde Waarde_ or BTW, is payable on the supply of goods and services rendered in the Netherlands as well as on the importation of goods and on the ‘intra-European’ acquisition of goods. There are three VAT rates, which are 21%, 9%, and 0%.
The standard VAT rate is 21%.
The reduced 9% VAT rate is applicable on certain prime necessities, on certain energy-saving insulation activities on houses, and on certain e-publications.
The special 0% VAT rate is applicable mainly to intra-EU supplies, supplies of goods exported outside the European Union, supplies of goods placed in bonded warehouses, services rendered in connection with the above, and certain international services. 
The following domestic transactions are exempt from VAT:
  * The supply of immovable property two years after putting it into use and lease. However, if the lessee’s use of the immovable property is 90% or more for input VAT-deductible purposes, the lessor and lessee may opt to be subject to VAT on rent, in which case the lessee may deduct the VAT charged in respect of the property.
  * Medical, cultural, social, and educational services.
  * Services provided by banks and other financial institutions in connection with payment transactions and the granting of credit facilities.
  * Insurance transactions.
  * Certain transactions in shares by controlling active parent companies and transactions by commercial share dealers.


Effective 1 January 2020, the Netherlands implemented the ‘EU four quick fixes’ aiming to improve the day-to-day functioning of the VAT system for EU cross-border business-to-business (B2B) trade. These quick fixes concern the use of the VAT identification number, call-off stock, proof of transport, and chain transactions. The changes have consequences for the administrative systems, VAT registrations, contracts, (electronic) documents, and invoices of entrepreneurs.
Effective 1 July 2021, the Netherlands implemented the EU VAT rules applicable to cross-border business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce activities.
As of 2023, the 0% VAT rate applies to the supply and installation of solar panels and solar panels used as roofing materials. The 0% VAT rate only applies if the solar panels are intended to be installed on or in the immediate vicinity of private dwellings or housing.
### Holding / financing companies 
Special attention needs to be given to the VAT position of holding and/or financing companies. The exact VAT status (VAT entrepreneur or not) and VAT deduction position depends on several aspects and might be complicated. 
### Fiscal unity / VAT group 
The Netherlands allows legally independent businesses that are closely bound to one another by financial, economic, and organisational links to be treated as a single taxable person. 
#### Transactions between head office and branch in scope of VAT in case of VAT group 
As of 1 January 2024, the Decree of the State Secretary of Finance on VAT fixed establishments will be amended. Cross-border services between a head office or VAT fixed establishment that is part of a VAT group and a VAT fixed establishment or head office established outside that EU member state will be subject to VAT. 
The change to the Dutch VAT group regime as per 1 January 2024 could have a significant (financial) impact. This applies both to the impact for establishments in the Netherlands as to establishments in other member states. Since the services will become VATable, reverse charge VAT may be due in the Netherlands for charges of (a) foreign establishment(s) to Dutch establishment(s). Furthermore, the change may affect the right to deduct input VAT in case Dutch establishment(s) charge amounts to other fixed establishment(s) outside of the Netherlands. The fact that services between establishments will be in scope of VAT as of 2024 does not mean that all charges will result in VAT consequences. It, for instance, needs to be determined if for all transactions there is a remuneration for a service for VAT purposes and/or if it may be possible to apply a VAT exemption on (part of) the transactions.
### **ESOP for Payment Service Providers**
As of 1 January 2024, based on EU law, additional administrative obligations will apply to a broad group of European payment service providers. With 25 or more cross-border payments per beneficiary per quarter, the payment service provider is obliged to keep payment data in registers with sufficient accuracy and to share these registers with tax authorities of the relevant Member State. The tax authorities of the Member States exchange this data in the context of the fight against fraud via the newly established database Central Electronic System of Payment Information (CESOP). 
There are rules that determine per transaction to which country the CESOP obligations apply. For example, if the beneficiary of a payment engages a Dutch payment service provider and the payer/consumer engages a payment service provider in another EU country, the Netherlands is the country where the CESOP registration must take place. The Dutch VAT Act regulates which data must be included in the registers of the payment service providers. 
## Customs and excise tax
Many goods imported to the Netherlands from outside the European Union are subject to customs and excise duties. The tariffs and rates that apply to the different goods vary widely and change regularly.
An excise tax is levied on certain consumer goods (e.g. cigarettes, cigars, mineral oils, alcoholic products). If the goods are used solely as raw materials, no excise tax is levied. The excise tax is refundable if the article is exported.
### Extension of the reduced tax on unleaded petrol, diesel and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)
As of 1 April 2022, the government reduced the tax on unleaded petrol, diesel, and LPG in order to mitigate the increase in energy prices. The envisaged termination of the tax reduction is postponed until the end of 2025.
### Reduced energy tax rate for charging stations**up to and including 2024**
The owner of a charging station with a connection to the power grid (almost without exception, charging stations in public) pays a lower energy tax rate on the electricity supplied. This reduction is primarily intended to make the installation of charging stations financially more attractive but will also indirectly contribute to more supply and lower rates.
### Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)
As of October 2023, every importer of CBAM goods with a value of more than EUR 150 per shipment will need to report the embedded emissions of goods imported into the European Union on a quarterly basis. This report is submitted to the European Commission through the CBAM Transitional Registry.
#### Transitional phase
From October 2023 to January 2026, CBAM is in its transitional phase. In this phase, importers of goods in the scope of CBAM will only have to report greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions embedded in their imports (direct and indirect emissions).
CBAM initially applies to imports of certain goods and selected precursors whose production is carbon intensive and at the most significant risk of carbon leakage: cement, iron and steel, aluminium, fertilisers, electricity, and hydrogen.
## CO2 levy for industry
A Dutch national CO₂ levy is in place as of 1 January 2021 for certain industrial production and waste incineration. This levy is introduced alongside the existing system for the pricing of CO₂ at EU level (EU-ETS). Companies will be eligible for an exemption of the CO₂-levy (which will decrease over time) on part of their emissions (dispensation rights and ETS-discount) so that they can change their operations in order to reduce their CO₂ emissions. There are possibilities for using a surplus of dispensation rights for transfer purposes.
Due to the high price for allowances for ETS installations in 2024, the Dutch levy payable for 2024 will be EUR 0 for installations covered by the EU ETS.
### CO₂ minimum price for industry 
As of 2023, a CO₂ minimum price is in force for the emissions of industrial companies that are covered by dispensation rights. 
The CO₂ minimum price has been set at the same amount as the minimum CO₂ price for electricity generation and will increase on a linear basis. The CO₂ minimum price is only applicable if the relevant EU ETS forward rate is lower than the CO₂ minimum price, which is not the case for 2024.
### Mining Act
The rate of the special levy that oil and gas operators pay, will be temporarily increased. The levy will be 65% for 2023 and 2024 on the turnover insofar as realised with the sale of natural gas at an average price higher than EUR 0.50 per m3. The tax-free base and regular rates will remain the same, so that the position of licence holders will not deteriorate, and the infringement of property rights (ECHR) will be limited.
## Immovable property tax
Municipalities impose an annual immovable property tax on the owners of immovable property. The rates depend on the municipality. The taxable basis is the market value of the immovable property. Please note that the (assessment of the) value is also of importance for CIT, as depreciation might be limited based on this value (_see Limited depreciation of immovable property in the_ _section_).
## Transfer tax on immovable property
Acquisition of economic or legal ownership of immovable property in the Netherlands is subject to a transfer tax over its market value. The general tax rate of the transfer tax is 10.4% as of 1 January 2022. It is relevant whether the buyer will actually live in the property on a long-term basis (so no holiday homes or buy-to-let properties) to be eligible for the lower tax rate of 2% or the tax exemption for starters under 35. Otherwise, the general transfer tax rate of 10.4% will be applicable. Note, per 2026, residential properties that are not their owners main place of residence (e.g. a second home or holiday home), will be subject to a transfer tax rate of 8 per cent.
Young first-time buyers on the housing market are eligible for a transfer tax exemption once. Someone will qualify as a first-time buyer if they are at least 18 years old but under the age of 35 when they purchase their first house. Buyers aged 35 and over, and buyers younger than 35 who already used the exemption once, will pay the transfer tax at the reduced rate of 2% when buying a home. There is a maximum housing value limit of EUR 510,000 (2024) for the one-off exemption. This limit applies to the entire dwelling and not to the value of the part of the dwelling acquired. Starters who buy a more expensive house pay 2% transfer tax on the entire amount of the property just like other home buyers.
### Transfer tax on acquisition of shares in a real estate entity
The acquisition of shares in an entity that owns real estate may also be subject to transfer tax if that entity is characterised as a so-called real estate entity. The threshold for qualifying as a real estate entity is met if more than 50% of the assets of the entity consist of real estate and at least 30% consist of Dutch immovable property.
### VAT/transfer tax concurrence scheme share transactions involving real estate entities
The transfer tax concurrence exemption changes in 2024 in order to create a level playing field between share transactions and 'bricks and mortar' transactions. This relates to situations in which a company owns newly developed real estate and whereby the shares are transferred rather than the real estate itself (the ‘bricks and mortar'). In such instances, currently neither VAT nor transfer tax is payable. If the real estate in the corporation is used less than 90% for VATable services (such as the rental of residential properties or real estate in the education or healthcare sector), from 2024 the acquisition of the shares is subject to a 4% real estate transfer tax.
## Stamp duty
There are no stamp duties in the Netherlands.
## Capital tax
The Netherlands do not levy capital tax on capital transactions (e.g. issue or increase of capital).
## Payroll taxes
Employers must withhold wage tax from the employee’s gross salary and transfer the amount to the tax authorities. Employees treat the withheld wage tax as an advance levy of income tax. The income tax due is settled with the withheld wage tax. _The tax tables applicable to individuals are provided in the section of the Netherlands Individual tax summary_.
## Social security contributions
Employers must withhold national insurance contributions from the employee’s salary at an aggregate rate of 27.65% calculated on the first EUR 38,098 (2024) of each employee’s gross salary and transfer the amount to the tax authorities. The employer bears the burden of the employee’s insurance contributions, which are also calculated by reference to the employee’s salary. Under circumstances, it may be required to pay or withhold a contribution based on the Health Care Insurance Act.
## Insurance tax
An insurance tax is payable on insurance premiums if the insured is a resident of the Netherlands or if the insured object is in the Netherlands. The insurance tax rate is 21% (2023). Several exemptions are available (e.g. insurances of ships and aircraft operated in international traffic are exempt from insurance tax). In certain situations, an insurer outside the European Union may be required to take on a tax representative in the Netherlands.
## Waste management contribution
Companies annually bringing 50,000 or more kilograms of packing material on the market must pay a ‘waste management contribution’ (_Afvalbeheersbijdrage_). The amount payable varies according to the total weight and type of packaging. The contribution aims to cover the costs of recycling package materials. Companies that are not resident in the Netherlands but sell to Dutch consumers, are also liable to the waste management contribution, subject to the threshold of 50,000 or more kilograms.
Producers and importers of packaging expecting to exceed the threshold must register with the Packaging Waste Fund (_Afvalfonds Verpakkingen_) upfront. In the current year, they must file an estimation of the expected total volume of packing material. The contribution is then provisionally calculated. Before 1 April of the next calendar year, the actual amount and type of packaging must be reported. The actual contribution payable is recalculated accordingly.
The legal concept of producer or importer covers (since 2023) any natural or legal person established in the Netherlands who:
  * markets products in a packaging
  * professionally imports products in a packaging
  * professionally instructs another party to provide the packaging of products with one’s name, logo, or mark, or
  * markets packaging intended to be added to it when products are made available to the user,


as well as any natural or legal person established abroad who directly sells products in packaging to consumers in the Netherlands through distance contracts.
This means that, for instance, supermarkets and private-label holders will be responsible for declaring the packaging of their private labels.
If a trademark holder is not established in the Netherlands, or if there are imports outside the trademark holder, the responsibility remains with the importer established in the Netherlands.
Under strict conditions, parties can, through a tailor-made agreement, shift the contribution obligation back to the manufacturer. The situation as applicable until 1 January 2023 will thus be restored.
## Aviation Tax Act 
As of 1 January 2021, a national aviation tax has been introduced. In the case of passenger flights departing from the Netherlands, a levy of EUR 29.05 (2024) per departing passenger is due. The levy will not be imposed on transit passengers and children under the age of two years old.
For the (private) aircraft, it applies that it has a take-off weight of more than 4,000 kilograms and departs from a number of designated airports.
