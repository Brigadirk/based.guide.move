Paraguay achieved a significant economic expansion in Latin America in recent years. After an economic contraction of 1.2% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012, the Paraguayan economy showed a recovery between 2013 and 2019, mainly due to record agricultural production and the recovery of international markets for the export of beef, mainly.
Regarding the 2020 period (affected by the COVID-19 pandemic), a GDP contraction of 1% is estimated according to data published by the Central Bank of Paraguay. The sectors affected being industry and services, mainly the latter. Due to the participation of the agricultural sector in GDP, Paraguay became one of the countries with the lowest GDP contraction in the region.

Paraguay has achieved an important participation in the capital gains markets with the placement of national bonds, due to the macroeconomic stability achieved over the years that mainly includes sustained economic growth, fiscal discipline, and accumulation of international reserves, among others.
