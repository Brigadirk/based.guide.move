## Taxable period
The taxable period is the calendar year, which may end either on 30 June (for legal persons or legal entities keeping double entry books) or 31 December. The taxable year should not, in any case, exceed 12 months.
The exceptional case of closing the accounting period, for income tax purposes, at a date other than the 31 December or 30 June is limited only to Greek legal entities/other entities that are directly or indirectly owned at a percentage exceeding 50% by foreign legal entities/other entities.
## Tax returns
CIT returns of Greek SAs, limited liability companies (LLCs), and branches of foreign companies are filed on a special form between 15 March and 15 July following the end of the tax year.
Tax returns are required to be submitted electronically.
The CIT return constitutes the basis for the direct assessment of tax, which arises without a further action by the tax administration, simultaneously with the submission of the tax return by the taxpayer.
The taxpayer also has the right to amend the tax return by paying the respective difference in tax or by establishing one’s rights for a refund of tax paid in excess according to the amended tax return.
Moreover, the taxpayer may request the issuance of a corrective tax assessment act in case of filing an amending tax return for which an administrative assessment tax act has been issued, and the tax administration is obligated to issue such corrective tax assessment if the amending tax return is accepted.
## Payment of tax
As of 1 January 2021, an 80% prepayment of the current year’s CIT is withheld at source, based on the tax return, and is paid in eight (8) equal monthly instalments.
CIT and tax prepayment based on the tax return are paid in six equal monthly instalments, the first of which should be paid until the last day of the seventh month following the end of the tax year and the remaining five until the last day of each consecutive month, which, however, may not extend beyond the same tax year.
For newly established companies, the prepayment is reduced by 50% for the first three years of operations.
## Tax audit process
### Tax audit procedures
The tax audit commences with the issuance of an audit order for open tax years, usually not more than five. The order concerns the audit of all tax issues (CIT, VAT, WHT, capital gain tax, etc.). The duration of the audit may vary from a few weeks to a few months, in certain cases.
The tax administration performs a tax audit from its offices on the basis of the financial statements, tax returns, and other documents that are submitted by the taxpayer, as well as the documents and information in its possession.
The performance of a complete on-site tax audit must be notified to the taxpayer by a previous written notification. A complete on-site tax audit is performed without prior notification in cases where indications of tax avoidance exist.
The tax administration may have access to the books and records and to other documents of the taxpayers, as well as to the receipt of copies thereof. The tax administration has the same rights with regard to books and records that are kept electronically. It is noted that the legal entity subject to keeping books and records must maintain these books and records for at least five years.
An extension of the on-site tax audit may be granted once for six months, as well as for another six months in extraordinary cases.
The right for a new audit of a tax period already audited is provided only in case new data arises that affects the calculation of the tax liability. ‘New data’ is defined as all data that could not have been known to the tax administration upon the commencement of the original tax audit.
The election of the cases subject to audit will be made on the basis of risk analysis criteria. Exceptionally, cases may be elected on the basis of other criteria, according to a decision of the General Secretary of Public Revenue. It should be noted that, based on Law 4389/2016, the General Secretarial for Public Revenue is abolished and a new Independent Authority for Public Revenue is formed aiming to the determination, the assessment, and the collection of tax, customs, and others public revenues.
The tax administration may use the following audit techniques for the indirect determination of the taxable basis:
  * The proportionality principle.
  * The analysis of the liquidity of the taxpayer.
  * The net position of the relation between the sales price to the total turnover.
  * The amount of bank deposits and expenses in cash.


The procedure of notification of the taxpayer of the results of the tax audit is provided. More specifically, a temporary corrective assessment of tax is issued in case a differentiation of tax arises on the basis of the tax returns of the taxpayer and the results of the audit.
Following the submission of such decisions and within 20 days from the receipt of the notification thereof, the taxpayer may submit its views in writing, whilst after that point a final corrective assessment of tax sheet is issued, which is notified to the taxpayer, within a month from the end of the deadline for submitting the taxpayer’s views in writing.
### Audit Centre for Taxpayers with Great Wealth
The special audit authority ‘Audit Centre for Taxpayers with Great Wealth’, competent for the whole Greek territory, performs provisional, temporary, and ordinary tax audits, as well as the audit of real estate property and of the annual expenses of individuals. The audit of foreign real estate companies not disclosing their ultimate beneficiary individuals and of Greek real estate companies in which a foreign legal entity participates without disclosing the ultimate beneficiary individuals are also assigned to the Audit Centre for Taxpayers with Great Wealth. Moreover, the Audit Centre for Taxpayers with Great Wealth is also competent for the certification and enforced collection of revenue of taxpayers with great wealth.
### Audit Centre for Large Enterprises
The ‘Audit Centre for Large Enterprises’ is responsible for the performance of ordinary audits of taxpayers with annual gross income exceeding EUR 25 million for the fiscal year closing within 2009, of affiliated enterprises drafting consolidated financial statements irrespective of their gross income on the condition that the gross income of at least one of the affiliated enterprises exceeds EUR 25 million for the fiscal year closing within 2009, and unaudited cases prior to any business restructuring effected until 2011, irrespective of the gross revenues and the competent tax authority responsible for the taxation of their income, on the condition that the company or any of the companies resulting from the business restructuring falls within the ambit of the Audit Centre for Large Enterprises. The Audit Centre for Large Enterprises is also competent for the enforced collection of revenue of large enterprises located in the whole Greek territory.
Following the audit and the notification of tax audit findings, the company may in turn:
  * File a mandatory administrative recourse within the framework of the special administrative procedure (out-of-court settlement procedure) before the Directorate for Dispute Resolution with the claim of reviewing any act of the tax authorities (including the tax assessment act), in case the content of the tax assessment act is questioned within a deadline of 30 days for Greek tax residents and 60 days for foreign tax residents from the notification of the act or the realisation of the failure. The direct filing of a recourse before the competent administrative courts against acts of the tax administration is inadmissible.
  * Take the case to court (filing of a recourse) against the explicit/tacit negative reply of the Dispute Resolution Directorate. For tax/customs cases exceeding EUR 150,000, the competent court is the Court of Appeal (of first and last instance, which could normally issue a decision within six to 12 months; said timeframe may be longer, taking up to one to two years in case the competent court is the Court of First Instance [i.e. for disputes of an amount less than EUR 150,000]). The Supreme Administrative Court may take up to three to four years.
  * Criminal sanctions are also imposed on the company’s legal representative under certain conditions.


Moreover, based on the provisions of Law 4438/2016, which was enacted on 28 November 2016, a Mutual Agreement Procedure is introduced in the Code of Tax Procedures, designated to cover the cases of elimination of double taxation in connection with the adjustment of transfers of profits between associated enterprises. Based on these provisions, the taxpayer may file a claim for the initiation of a Mutual Agreement Procedure by application of the Double Tax Conventions as well as the European Convention on the elimination of double taxation in connection with the adjustment of transfers of profits between associated undertakings. The details of application of this new procedure are determined by virtue of a Ministerial Circular issued by the Independent Authority for Public Revenue.
The Ministerial Circular issued by the Independent Authority for Public Revenue provides guidelines as regards the procedure for claiming the initiation of a Mutual Agreement Procedure, the content, the competent authorities for examining the relevant claims, the process for achievement of a Mutual Agreement, the notification of the outcome of the Mutual Agreement Procedure to the taxpayer, and the procedure for accepting such Agreement, as well as any relevant issue with respect to the above.
### Tax auditors’ practice
In the past, complexity of the Greek tax legislation and the vagueness of its requirements enabled the tax auditors to dispute either the company’s results reflected in its accounting records or to disallow expenses. This is true in all tax audits and, in spite of companies’ endeavours to comply with the tax requirements, tax audits have always resulted in assessment of additional taxes and penalties.
The amount of additional taxes depends mainly on the following:
  * Company’s vulnerability because of nature of business and transactions.
  * Taxes already paid on the basis of the company’s income tax returns.
  * Profits declared by competitors.
  * Weaknesses and shortcomings that the tax auditors might reveal if a full audit is carried out.


In respect of deductible expenses, the legislation prescribes, among other requirements, that such expenses must be realised for the benefit of the company or in its ordinary course of normal business activity to represent, a valid transaction at a value that is not over or under the market value based on the data available by the tax administration, properly recorded in the company’s books in the respective period to which they relate, and can be evidenced by appropriate documentation, without defining what a business expense is. Consequently, the tax auditors dispute the deductibility of various items arguing that, in their opinion, they are not contributing to the company’s business income.
Greek SAs and LLCs whose annual financial statements are subject to a statutory audit by individual Certified Auditors and audit firms may optionally obtain an 'annual tax certificate' from their certified auditors upon the completion of a tax audit conducted, confirming compliance with Greek tax legislation. The tax audit is conducted on specific tax areas as defined by a special audit program issued by the Ministry of Finance in cooperation with the Committee of Accounting Standardization and Auditing (ELTE). The audit program is updated annually and is in accordance with the provisions of International Standard on Non-Audit Assurance Engagements 3000.
## Statute of limitations
The tax administration may issue an administrative, estimated, or corrective tax assessment within five years from the end of the year in which the deadline for filing the respective tax return lapsed.
This five-year prescription period may be extended for one year if:
  * the taxpayer files an initial or amending tax return within the fifth year of the prescription period or in case any information becomes available to the tax administration in the last year of the five-year period for a case that has been subject to full audit or in any other case that information, based on which a tax liability arises, comes to the attention of the tax administration from any source and solely for the matter to which it relates
  * an application for the granting of information from a foreign state has been filed and commences from the date of the receipt of the respective information by the tax authority
  * a mandatory administrative recourse has been filed and commences from the issuance of a decision that is not subject to recourse
  * a Mutual Agreement Procedure is initiated, pursuant to the application of DTTs and the Arbitration Convention, or
  * the taxpayer files an application for cancellation or amendment of the direct tax assessment, tax assessment sheet, or penalty imposition sheet, or in case of such cancellation or amendment without an application by the taxpayer.


For tax years, periods, and cases as of 1 January 2018 onwards, the statute of limitation period may be extended to ten years from the end of the year within which the deadline for filing the (last) return expires if no tax return has been filed within the five-year period. The same also applies if any new or not possibly known information within the five-year period comes to the attention of any tax administration service, based on which it appears that the actual tax liability exceeds the one determined by a previous tax assessment and solely for the matter to which it relates.
Especially, for cases of tax evasion pertaining to years 2012 to 2017, an extended statute of limitation period of ten years from the end of the year within which the deadline for filing a tax return expires, applies.
In case of a corrective tax assessment resulting in an amendment of the tax assessment act for a year for which the prescription period of the state’s right to audit has lapsed, the adaptation is made to the last year for which said right has not been prescribed.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
A legal entity or other entity is considered as tax resident in Greece if one of the following conditions is met:
  * It has been incorporated or established according to the Greek legislation.
  * It has its registered seat in Greece.
  * The place of effective management is located in Greece.


The determination by the tax authorities that the effective management of a legal entity is exercised in Greece is made on the basis of the actual facts and circumstances of each case and by taking into account mainly the place of exercising the day-to-day management, the place of making strategic decisions, the place where the annual general meeting of shareholders or partners is held, the place where the books and records are kept, the place where the meeting of the members of the BoD or other executive management board takes place, and the residence of the members of the BoD or other executive management board. 
For determining a legal entity as being tax resident in Greece, the exercise of effective management in Greece for any period during the tax year is sufficient.
Companies that are established and operate according to Law 27/1975 ‘on the taxation of vessels [etc.]’ and L.D. 2687/1953 ‘on the investment and protection of foreign capital’ are explicitly excluded from the application of these provisions on tax residence.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The definition of a PE of foreign legal entities in Greece following the principles stipulated in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Tax Convention and its Commentary, as explicitly mentioned in the Explanatory Report of the Greek Corporate Income Tax Code, is 'a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on'.
The term ‘permanent establishment’ includes especially:
  * A place of management.
  * A branch.
  * An office.
  * A factory.
  * A workshop.
  * A mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry, or any other place of extraction of natural resources.


In order for a construction site in Greece to constitute a PE, a time period of at least three months is required, instead of the time period of 12 months provided in the OECD Model Convention.
A distinction applies between the cases of maintaining a PE through a dependent agent and not maintaining a PE when performing activities through an independent agent (e.g. broker, general commission agent).
Greece has also reserved the right to not apply the provisions of the OECD Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (Multilateral Instrument or MLI) concerning the artificial avoidance of PE status.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Depreciation
Mandatory depreciation on a fixed annual basis applies by using fixed depreciation rates stipulated in the law. The transfer of depreciated amounts between fiscal years is not permitted.
The rates of depreciation are determined on the basis of the following table:
Category of assets of the enterprise | Rate of depreciation per tax year (%)  
---|---  
Buildings, installations, facilities, industrial and special installations, non-building facilities, warehouses, and stations, including their annexes (and special loading and unloading vehicles) | 4  
Constructions and installations for charging of vehicles of zero or low emissions up to 50 g CO2/Km | 100  
Plots of land used for mining and quarries, unless used for ancillary mining activities | 5  
Public means of transportation, including airplanes, trains, vessels, and ships | 5  
Machinery and equipment (aside from personal computers and software) | 10  
Means of transportation of individuals apart from zero or low-emission means up to 50 g CO2/Km | 16  
Zero-emission means of transportation of individuals | 50  
Low-emission means of transportation of individuals up to 50 g CO2/Km | 25  
Means of transportation of goods apart from zero or low-emission means up to 50 g CO2/Km | 12  
Zero-emission means of transportation of goods | 50  
Low-emission means of transportation of goods up to 50 g CO2/Km | 25  
Zero-emission means of mass transportation of individuals | 50  
Low-emission means of mass transportation of individuals up to 50 g CO2/Km | 25  
Intangible assets, royalties, and expenses of multiannual depreciation | 10  
Personal computer equipment, principal and ancillary and software | 20  
Other fixed assets of the enterprise | 10  
Equipment and instruments used for the purposes of performing scientific and technological research | 40  
Specifically for intangible assets and royalties, the rate may be adapted on the basis of the lifetime of the right.
Depreciation expenses are deductible by the owner of the assets, and the lessee in the case of finance leasing. For the definition of finance leasing, the Greek Tax Code refers to the provisions of the Greek Accounting Standards (L.4308/2014). However, as of 1 January 2020, the definition is supplemented, so that it is determined based either on the meaning of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union pursuant to Regulation 1606/2002, or that of the Greek Accounting Standards, depending on the accounting framework followed by each entity.
## Goodwill
There are some court cases that support the deductibility of goodwill as a start-up expense, but the specifics of each case must be carefully considered.
## Organisational and start-up expenses
Based on the provisions of Law 4308/2014 (Greek Accounting Standards), any amount of start-up expenses shall be, under conditions, tax deductible within the year that they have been incurred, to the extent that they do not fall within a category of assets (including tangibles and intangibles).
Any expenses incurred for the acquisition of an asset that are directly related to the latter asset and are necessary for its use are included in the acquisition cost of said asset (e.g. concerning real estate property the real estate transfer tax, notary fees, registration fees, etc.).
## Interest expenses
Interest deductibility restrictions apply.
Non-deductible expenses include interest expenses on loans undertaken by the enterprise from third parties, to the extent that they exceed the interest that would arise if the interest rate was equal to the interest rate of loans on open deposit/withdrawal accounts provided to non-financial enterprises, as indicated in a Statistical Bulletin of the Central Bank of Greece at the prior time period closest to the date such loan was undertaken.
The above interest deductibility restrictions do not apply to bank loans, inter-bank loans, inter-company loans, and bond loans issued by SAs.
## Bad debt
The amounts of bad debt provisions and the write-off thereof are deductible, as follows:
  * For uncollected due debt up to the amount of EUR 1,000 for a time period exceeding 12 months, the taxpayer may form a provision at a percentage of 100% of the said claim.
  * For uncollected due debt exceeding the amount of EUR 1,000 for a time period exceeding 12 months, the taxpayer may form a provision according to the following table:  Duration of late payment (in months) | Provision (%)  
---|---  
Greater than 12 | 50  
Greater than 18 | 75  
Greater than 24 | 100  


The condition for the deduction of the provision for the aforementioned two cases is that the appropriate actions have been taken to ensure the right of collecting the said claim.
The formation of provisions of bad debt is prohibited in the following cases:
  * For due debt of shareholders or partners of the enterprise with a minimum participation percentage of 10% and the subsidiary companies of the enterprise with a minimum participation percentage of 10%, unless the claim of such debt is pending before court or court of arbitration, or if the debtor has filed an application for bankruptcy or for a procedure of rationalisation or an enforcement procedure has commenced against the debtor.
  * For due debt that are covered by insurance or any guarantee or other contractual or _in rem_ security or for debts of the state or local authorities or for those that have been provided with a guarantee granted by those bodies.


It is provided that a claim may be written off, provided that the following conditions are cumulatively met:
  * An amount corresponding to the debt has been previously recorded as income.
  * It has been previously written off from the books of the taxpayer.
  * All legal actions for the collection of the debt have been exhausted.


For tax years beginning on 1 January 2020 onwards, bad debts, the total amount of which does not exceed EUR 300 per counterparty, including VAT, may be written off under conditions, without needing though to fulfil the above stricter requirements.
Moreover, it is possible to write off bad debts under a mutual agreement or judicial settlement, regardless of whether a provision has been accounted and without requiring that all legal actions to recover the claim have been taken.
Banks may deduct provisions of bad debt at a percentage of 1% on the amount of the annual average of real grants, as indicated by their monthly accounting statements. Aside from the aforementioned deductibility percentage, banks may deduct from their income additional special provisions regarding their clients, for which the settlement of interest has ceased. Moreover, specific provisions on leasing and factoring companies are included.
## Charitable contributions
The tax deductibility of donations is not expressly regulated in the respective Greek tax legislation (in contrast to the previously applicable Greek ITC providing for the tax deductibility of specifically enumerated donations, up to a certain amount). Thus, the deductibility of charitable contributions shall be examined in light of the generally applicable deductibility criteria, focusing on the productivity of such expenses on a case-by-case basis.
For tax years beginning on or after 1 January 2020, expenses relating to corporate social responsibility actions are considered as incurred to the interest of a company or within its ordinary course of business and will be deductible in the tax year in which they were incurred. However, this will only be possible if the company’s accounting result is profitable, unless such actions are carried out at the request of the state.
## Fines and penalties
Fees from activities constituting a criminal offence, fees from penal clauses, fines, and penalties are not recognised as deductible expenses.
## Taxes
Taxes, other than income tax, extraordinary contributions, and VAT corresponding to non-deductible expenses that are not deductible as input VAT, are recognised as deductible expenses.
## Other significant items
A general rule on the deductibility of all real and evidenced business expenses realised for the benefit or in the frame of the usual transactions of the company, the value of which is not deemed as higher or lower than the market value, and duly registered in accordance with the rules of recording of transactions is established, with the exception of the restrictively enumerated expenses that are not deductible.
The non-deductible expenses include:
  * Some cases of loan interest (_see Interest expenses above_).
  * Every kind of expense concerning the acquisition of goods or receipt of services of a value exceeding EUR 500, provided that the partial or total payment was not made through a means of bank payment.
  * Unpaid insurance contributions.
  * Provisions, with the exception of the explicitly regulated bad debt provisions (_see Bad debt above_).
  * Fees and penalties, including additional payments.
  * Provision or receipt of services in cash or in kind that constitute a criminal offence.
  * The income tax, including the freelancers’ duty and extraordinary contributions, as well as the VAT corresponding to non-deductible expenses, provided that it is not deductible as input VAT.
  * Deemed income in case of self-use of property, to the extent that the latter exceeds a percentage of 3% of the objective value of the property.
  * Expenses for the organisation and conducting of informative conferences and meetings concerning the hospitality (meals and stay) of clients or employees if exceeding the amount of EUR 300 per participant and to the extent that the total annual expense exceeds a percentage of 0.5% of the annual gross income of the enterprise.
  * Entertainment expenses, with the exception of such expenses realised by taxpayers having as a main object the provision of entertainment services.
  * Private consumer expenses.
  * Total of expenses that are paid to tax residents in non-cooperative states or states with a preferential tax regime, unless the taxpayer proves that these expenses refer to real and usual transactions that do not have as their objective the transfer of profits or income or capital with the purpose of tax avoidance or evasion.
  * Expenses relating to tax-exempt dividends.
  * Any kind of salary payments, provided that the partial or total payment was not made through a means of electronic payment.
  * For tax years beginning on or after 1 January 2020, rental expenses, provided that their payment was not made by electronic means or through a payment service provider.


A super deduction by an additional 100% of specific expenses related to green economy, energy, and digitalisation is available for small and medium-sized businesses.
## Net operating and capital losses
Losses can be carried forward five years. Carrybacks are not permitted.
Pursuant to a rule on the abuse of provisions on the transfer and setoff of losses, in cases where the direct or indirect ownership or voting rights of an enterprise are changed at a percentage exceeding 33% and, in the same or the following year from such change of ownership or voting rights, the activity of the legal person/entity changes at a percentage exceeding 50% of its turnover in relation to the immediately preceding tax year from the change of shareholding structure or voting rights, the carryforward of tax losses ceases to apply.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Royalties, interest, and service fees paid to foreign affiliates are deductible expenses under certain requirements and conditions.
## Special restrictions on transactions with non-cooperative states and states with preferential tax treatment
Greek tax law has established rules in relation to non-cooperating states and states with preferential tax treatment.
As of the tax year 2018, jurisdictions shall be considered as non-cooperative if they are non-EU member states, their position regarding transparency and exchange of information in tax matters has been assessed by the OECD and has not been rated as ‘highly compliant’, and which:
  * have not concluded and do not implement a mutual agreement for administrative assistance in tax matters with Greece or have not signed the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in tax matters concluded by the Council of Europe and OECD, and
  * have not committed to automatic exchange of financial account information, by 2018 the latest.


Non-cooperative states are determined by a Ministerial Decision published annually, which takes into account changes as regards execution and implementation of mutual agreements for administrative assistance in tax matters by relevant jurisdictions.
Pursuant to a Decision issued in December 2024, the jurisdictions considered as non-cooperative for 2023 are specified as follows:
Algeria | Gabon | Palau  
---|---|---  
Angola | Ghana | Panama  
Anguilla | Guatemala | Papua New Guinea (1)  
Antigua and Barbuda | Guinea | Philippines  
Belarus | Guyana | Rwanda  
Benin (1) | Haiti | Sint Maarteen  
Botswana | Honduras | Seychelles  
British Virgin Islands | Kazakhstan | Tanzania  
Burkina Faso (1)  | Lesotho (Kingdom of) | Thailand  
Cambodia | Liberia | Togo  
Chad | Madagascar | Trinidad and Tobago  
Cote d' Ivoire | Mali | Vanuatu  
Congo (Republic of) | Niger | Vietnam (1)  
Dominica  | Nicaragua | Zambia  
Djibouti | Sierra Leone | Zimbabue  
Figi  
NOTE
(1) _**Based on Ministerial Decision A. 1198/2024,** the countries Benin, Burkina Faso, Vietnam, and Papua New Guinea are considered non-cooperative states for only part of 2023 (not for the entire year). Specifically, Vietnam and Papua New Guinea are non-cooperative states until December 1, 2023, Burkina Faso is a non-cooperative state until April 1, 2023, and Benin is a non-cooperative state until May 1, 2023_
A legal entity, irrespective of its legal form, is considered located in a preferential tax regime, even if its residence of registered office is located in an EU member state, in cases where it is not subject to taxation in this state or is de facto not subject to taxation, or is subject to tax on income or capital at an amount that is equal to or lower than 60% of the tax that would have been due, in accordance with Greek tax legislation, if such entity were resident or were maintaining a PE in Greece.
Preferential tax regimes are determined by a Ministerial Decision published annually, which takes into account the above criteria.
Pursuant to a Decision issued in December 2023, the states with preferential tax treatment for 2022 are specified as follows:
Albania | Gibraltar | Mongolia  
---|---|---  
Andorra | Guernsey | Montenegro  
Anguilla | Hungary | North Macedonia   
Bahamas | Ireland | Paraguay  
Bahrain | Isle of Man | Qatar  
Barbados | Jersey | Saba  
Belize | Kosovo | Saudi Arabia  
Bermuda | Kyrgyzstan | St. Eustatius  
Bonaire | Liechtenstein | Timor-Leste  
Bosnia and Herzegovina | Macau | Tokelau  
British Virgin Islands | Republic of Maldives | Turkmenistan  
Bulgaria | Marshall Islands | Turks and Caicos Islands  
Cayman Islands | Republic of Moldova | United Arab Emirates  
Cyprus | Monaco | Vanuatu

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
Group taxation is not permitted in Greece.
## Transfer pricing
Related entities are obligated to document the prices of their inter-company transactions by preparing the relevant transfer pricing documentation material.
An exemption from maintaining a transfer pricing documentation file is provided if:
  * the above transactions or transfer of operations amount to up to EUR 100,000 annually and the total turnover of the liable party does not exceed EUR 5 million annually, or
  * the above transactions or transfer of operations amount to up to EUR 200,000 annually and the total turnover of the liable party exceeds EUR 5 million annually.
  * Entities that are exempt from income tax obligations are not required to comply with transfer pricing documentation requirements.


If the local taxpayers meet or exceeds the relevant criterial, they are required to prepare both the Master File and the Local File to document its transfer pricing practices. Greek taxpayers qualifying as subject to documentation thresholds need to document all transactions irrespective of value.
The transfer pricing documentation file is accompanied by the ‘Summary Information Table for the inter-company transactions’, which is submitted electronically to the tax administration within the deadline for the submission of the annual income tax return.
The delayed submission of the Summary Information Table for the inter-company transactions incurs a penalty calculated at a percentage 0.1% of inter-company transactions subject to documentation requirements (not below EUR 500 and not exceeding EUR 2,000). In the event of filing an amended Summary Information Table, a penalty applies only to the extent that the declared amounts are amended and such amendments exceed the amount of EUR 200,000. In the event that the amended amounts exceed EUR 200,000, the penalty is calculated at 0.1% on the value of the transactions subject to documentation requirements (minimum penalty of EUR 500 and maximum penalty of EUR 2,000).
The penalty for inaccurate submission of the Summary Information Table for the inter-company transactions is calculated at a percentage 0.1% of the inter-company transactions (not below EUR 500 and not exceeding EUR 2,000), to the extent that the inaccuracy is higher than 10% of the transactions.
The penalty for the non-submission of the Summary Information Table for the inter-company transactions is calculated at a percentage 0.1% of the inter-company transactions (not below EUR 2,500 and not exceeding EUR 10,000).
The transfer pricing documentation file is kept at the registered seat of the liable party for the whole time period that the books and records are required to be kept and should be provided to the tax administration within 30 days from the receipt of the relevant request.
The obligation of updating the respective transfer pricing file is annual on the premise that the documentation thresholds are met.
The penalty for the non-submission of the transfer pricing documentation file (imposed upon the expiration of the one-month deadline) is EUR 5,000, which is increased to EUR 10,000 if transfer pricing documentation is provided after 60 days, and to EUR 20,000 if it is provided after 90 days or not provided at all.
A repetition within five years of the first infringement incurs double the initial penalty, whereas a second repetition within five years from the first infringement incurs quadruple the initial penalty.
The option of obtaining an Advance Pricing Arrangement (APA) of the methodology of specific future intra-group transactions with related parties is integrated in the Code of Tax Procedures. The object of the APA constitutes the total of the criteria used for the determination of the prices of intra-group transactions during a specific time period, which include mainly the transfer pricing methodology used, comparable or reference data, and the respective adjustments, as well as the critical assumptions on future developments. The object of the APA may constitute every other specialised matter concerning the pricing of transactions with related parties.
The validity of the APA decision cannot exceed four years. The possibility of implementing the APA decisions to previous tax years covers only cases of bilateral or multilateral agreements, explicitly excluding unilateral ones. The issuance of the APA decision does not impede the subsequent application of a mutual settlement procedure according to the applicable double tax treaty (DTT).
The APA decision may be renewed, revoked, or cancelled by a decision of the tax administration, provided that the legal conditions are met.
The Greek tax legislative framework provides for the possibility of roll-back implementation for bilateral/multilateral APAs, on the grounds that the following conditions are cumulatively met:
  * The facts and circumstances of the taxpayers' operations for the years for which a roll-back is requested are identical with those of the years to be covered by the APA.
  * The possibility of a tax audit must not have expired at the time of application for a roll-back clause for those tax years.
  * The taxpayer must not have received a tax audit order.


As of September 2022, it is provided that if, following a tax audit, additional profits relating to inter-company domestic transactions are taxed at the level of a taxpayer in Greece, the related party that is also subject to tax is entitled to perform a corresponding adjustment to its taxable profits accordingly. This is performed through the submission of an amending income tax return (accompanied by the tax audit report), which should be submitted within three months from the delivery of the tax audit report.
Condition for the refund or the offsetting of taxes, at the level of the taxpayer, is the payment from the related party of any taxes imposed due to the correction of profits of their inter-company transactions. If the tax assessment note is challenged by the taxpayer and an administrative or a legal decision is issued, the tax administration proceeds with the corresponding adjustment of profits to the related party.
These types of transfer pricing adjustments, known as corresponding adjustments, are met in various DTTs and have as primary objective the consistent allocation of profits by the two jurisdictions and the relief from double taxation. Through this provision, related parties could also obtain relief from double taxation resulting from transfer pricing adjustments in domestic transactions.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting regime
The CbC reporting requirements are applicable to Greek ultimate parent entities controlling a multinational group of entities (MNEs) with annual total consolidated group revenues exceeding EUR 750 million. The said requirements largely follow the guidance on CbC reporting provided under Action 13 of the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiatives. In order to enable the Greek tax authorities to analyse potential transfer pricing risks, said requirements provide for the preparation and filing of a CbC report.
The ultimate parent entity (UPE) established in Greece should file the relevant CBC reports with the Greek tax authorities. In exceptional cases, Greek entities belonging to MNEs without a Greek resident ultimate parent company may also be obligated to file a CbC report.
The relevant provisions also provide for notification requirements regarding the entity liable to file the CbC report.
The penalty for late/inaccurate filing of the CbC report stands at EUR 10,000, while the penalty for the non-filing of the CbC report amounts to EUR 20,000.
## Thin capitalisation
The thin capitalisation (more precisely 'interest limitation') rules are determined in connection to the taxable profits before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (ΕBITDA). More specifically, interest expenses are not deductible to the extent that the surplus of interest expenses compared to interest income exceeds a percentage of 30% of ΕΒΙΤDΑ.
By way of derogation, the taxpayer may deduct exceeding borrowing costs up to EUR 3 million.
Any excess amount of non-deductible interest expenses may be carried forward indefinitely to future years and will be deductible in future years to the extent that these future years indicate an uncovered EBITDA amount.
The aforementioned rules do not apply to credit institutions, insurance and reinsurance companies, and pension institutions.
Moreover, pursuant to a recently introduced exemption, additional interest expense may be deducted if the company is part of a consolidated group and to the extent that certain figures (e.g. share capital to assets ratio) do not vary from the respective figures of the consolidated group.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
The taxable income of a taxpayer with tax residence in Greece shall be increased by the undistributed income of a legal person or legal entity or PE with tax residence in another country, under the following conditions:
  * The taxpayer, alone or together with affiliated persons, directly or indirectly owns shares, voting rights, or equity in excess of 50% or is entitled to receive more than 50% of the profits of that legal person or legal entity.
  * The actual tax paid abroad by the foreign legal person or legal entity or PE is less than half of the tax that would be payable in Greece, based on the Greek Income Tax Code provisions, regardless of the country of establishment.
  * More than 30% of the net income before taxes earned by a legal person or legal entity falls into at least one of the categories of income derived either from interest, dividends, capital gains, royalties, from financial leasing, from invoicing companies that earn sales and services income from goods and services purchased from and sold to associated enterprises adding no or little economic value, or income from insurance, banking, or other financial activities.


The above do not apply to legal persons or legal entities with tax residence in the European Union or residence in a country that is an EEA member to the extent that they carry on a substantive economic activity that is supported by staff, equipment, assets, and premises, as evidenced by relevant facts and circumstances.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Foreign tax credit
Tax paid abroad for income taxable in Greece is credited but is limited to the amount of Greek tax due.
## Deferred taxation
The concept of deferred taxation applies on the basis of the IFRS to entities supervised by the Bank of Greece (namely banks and leasing companies, as well as factoring companies). In this respect, said entities may convert tax assets into tax credits in return for shares issued to the Greek state. Specific rules and conditions apply.
## Incentives for job enhancement
Under certain conditions, an increase of tax deductibility by 50% and up to 14 times the minimum wage of an unmarried employee over 25 years old per employment of the employers’ contributions is provided.
## Scientific and technological research expenses
The expenses of scientific and technological research, including the depreciation of equipment and instruments used for these purposes, are deducted from the gross income of companies at the time of their realisation, increased by 100%.
Under the November 2024 amendment (L.5162/2024), effective from fiscal year 2025, this tax deduction is increased to 150% for expenses related to collaborations with companies in the National Startup Registry, recognized research centers, universities unaffiliated with the service recipient, as well as for depreciating research equipment. Moreover, subject to specific conditions, this benefit can be further increased to 215% for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
The criteria for the characterisation of the above expenses are determined by a joint decision of the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Development and Investments, which is issued after a suggestion of the Governor of the IAPR. In the event that losses occur after deduction of the above percentage, they shall be carried forward for up to five years, in accordance with Article 27 of the Greek ITC. 
With effect from September 2022, according to Article 12 of L. 4965/2022, for R&D projects greater than EUR 60,000, certification of scientific and technological research expenses by a certified auditor or audit firm is mandatory.
## Patent incentives
According to the provisions of Article 71A of the Greek ITC, the profits of a company arising from the exploitation of an internationally recognised patent in its name and developed by itself are exempt from income tax for up to three consecutive years, starting from the year in which these profits were realised for the first time. The exemption is granted on the condition that there is a connection with the research and development (R&D) expenses incurred by the company for the development of the patent.
Moreover, the amount of the above-mentioned exemption is calculated as follows:
Eligible R&D expenses / Total R&D expenses x Profits from the exploitation of the patent = Exemption amount
The numerator may be increased up to 30%, on condition that it does not exceed the total amount of R&D expenses. 
Additionally, the amount of the exemption, which is calculated as above, is depicted in a special reserve account and is subject to taxation in accordance with the general provisions of the Greek ITC when distributed or capitalised (i.e. upon use).
This exemption is granted provided that there is R&D expense that was carried out by the patent development company. 
According to the new law 5162/2024, which will take effect from fiscal year 2025, the following modifications have been made:
1. **Extended Exemption Period** : Businesses that have developed and hold internationally recognized patents are entitled to an income tax exemption for profits from these patents for up to three consecutive tax years. Additionally, for the following seven years, there is a 10% exemption from the income tax payable on the company's profits from the exploitation of the patent.
2. **Calculation of Exemption:** The method for calculating the exemption remains the same, but the new law emphasizes the connection between the patent and the R&D expenses incurred by the company for its development.
These changes aim to further incentivize innovation and the development of patents by providing extended tax benefits.
## Other tax incentives
### Strategic Investment Law
The framework of strategic investments is used to support large-scale investments that, due to their strategic importance for the national or local economy, can strengthen employment, productive reconstruction, and the promotion of the natural and cultural environment of the country, according to the principles of socially just, inclusive, balanced, and sustainable development, with the main characteristics being the attraction of investment funds, extroversion and export activity, innovation, competitiveness, integrated planning, saving natural resources in the perspective of the circular economy, and high added value, especially in areas of economic activity of internationally tradable products or services. Specific rules apply for green projects.
We anticipate changes in the framework, which will broaden the range of eligible investments (emblematic). These changes are expected to enhance support for critical raw materials, the circular economy, the shipbuilding industry, and the green economy. The goal is to align with principles of sustainable development, innovation, and high added value, particularly in sectors involving internationally tradable products or services.
Investment plans are classified based on investment size, FTEs, and industry sectors in four categories: Strategic Investments 1, Strategic Investments 2, Emblematic Investments, and Fast-track licensed Strategic Investments. Types of aid vary depending on the kind of investment but typically include (i) spatial planning, (ii) income tax rate stabilisation, (iii) fast track licensing, (iv) tax exemption, (v) cash grants for capex/opex (only for emblematic investments, and (vi) cash grants for R&D or recruiting disabled. It should be noted that tax exemption can be used for a period of 15 years.
Aid intensity is calculated on 651/2014 (GBER) provisions and are subject to absolute maximums. In particular, regional aid is calculated based on the region of the investment (regional aid map) and company size, and R&D is calculated based on type of research and company size.
Important notes:
  * The requirement for emblematic investments claiming tax incentives and cash grants to be completed by must have completed by December 2025 is expected to change. This amendment adjusts the investment completion timeline, replacing the fixed deadline of 31st December 2025 with a flexible schedule tied to the conditions and timelines of the respective funding mechanisms. These mechanisms include the Resilience & Recovery Fund (RRF), ESPA 2021–2027, other financing mechanisms, and the National Development Program.
  * Projects and investments funded through the Strategic Investment Law cannot additionally be funded by any other incentive (for the same expenses).
  * Aid claim shall be submitted before start of works.


### Development Law - Greece Strong Development
On 4 February 2022, Law 4887/2022, 'Development Law - Greece Strong Development’, has been voted by the Greek Parliament. The new Development Law provides a general framework, specified for each aid scheme foreseen through ministerial decisions issued. In essence, the provisions of the new Law start to apply following the issuance of the relevant ministerial decisions. Up to date, the Ministry of Development and Investments has solely proceeded with the issuance of ministerial decision for the following aid schemes: 'Manufacturing - Supply chain', 'Enhancement of Tourism Investments', 'Agri food - primary production and processing of agricultural products - fisheries and aquaculture', and ‘Entrepreneurship 360°’.
Under the Law, an explicit reference to the provisions of the General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER) of the European Commission (651/17.07.2014, Law 187/1/26.06.2014) is made.
A threshold is being provided for the types of aid available to individuals’ investment projects, as well as to companies and groups of companies, in order to achieve dispersion of the beneficiaries of state aid.
Special categories of aid are being determined, either (i) on the basis of the performance of the companies (extroversion, mergers, employment increase, sectors, high added value), or (ii) on territorial basis (highland, border areas and areas with increased migration burden, industrial areas, innovations zones). Companies that fall under special categories may be reinforced through capital aids, in case the latter are not provided, or by additional capital aids, in case the latter are provided.
### General Section
The General Section of the new Law regulates the beneficiaries of aids provided, the terms and prerequisites for participation, the covered investment projects, the eligible expenses, the types of aids, the procedure regarding the filing of applications and evaluation of investments projects, as well as the issues regarding the implementation and completion of investments projects.
Beneficiaries of the aid schemes are commercial companies, cooperatives, social cooperative companies of Law 4019/2011, groups of producers, organisations of producers, agricultural partnerships of Law 4384/2016, urban cooperatives, companies under formation or under merger (on the condition that they have been incorporated or merged before the commencement of the project), public and municipal enterprises and their subsidiaries (under specific conditions), joint ventures provided that they have been registered with General Commercial Registry (GEMI), and individual companies with a maximum eligible investment project cost of EUR 200,000 and solely for the aid scheme 'agri food - primary production and processing of agricultural products - fisheries and aquaculture'.
As regards the terms and prerequisites for participation, it is provided that the compulsory nature of own participation is abolished. The participation of the beneficiary in the cost of the investment project can take place either through own equity or through external financing. The main prerequisite is that 25% of the total investment cost does not contain state aid, support, or subsidy.
The minimum investment amount ranges from EUR 50,000 (for social cooperative companies, agricultural partnerships, groups of producers, organisations of producers, urban cooperatives, and agricultural partnerships) to EUR 1 million (for large companies). Moreover, for medium-sized companies, the investment amount is set at EUR 500,000, for small companies at EUR 250,000, and for very small companies at EUR 100,000.
The investment projects that fall under the aid schemes should have the character of initial investment (buildings, machinery, intangible) and meet certain conditions (indicatively, creation of new plants, extension of existing plants’ capacity, etc.).
The investment projects that are covered by the Law relate, in principle, to all economic sectors, subject to certain exceptions (sector of steel, coal, synthetic fibres, shipbuilding, etc.). Under certain conditions, the covered investment projects could also relate to:
  * Production or co-production and distribution of heat from renewable energy sources and production of electricity by small hydroelectric projects.
  * Tourism.
  * Logistics services.


In respect of the eligible expenses, these are divided into: (i) eligible expenses of regional state aid nature based on the Regional State Aid Map (capital expenditure in tangible and intangible assets, employment cost of new employees) and (ii) eligible expenses of non-regional state aid, which aim to broaden and enrich the investment options towards new qualitative directions. The maximum amounts and percentages of regional state aids and non-regional state aids are also being determined. Based on the general framework, the maximum amounts and percentages of each individual aid scheme are being specified, in accordance with the provisions of the Special Section of the new Law.
Further, with regard to the types of aid, the following types are provided:
  * Tax exemption (exemption from the payment of CIT on profits, before taxes, generated from the total business activity of the company, following the deduction of the CIT that corresponds to the profits distributed to the company’s shareholders).
  * Subsidy of funds in order to cover part of the eligible expenses of the investment project.
  * Subsidy of leasing for the acquisition of new machinery and other equipment (which cannot exceed the period of seven years).
  * Subsidy of employment cost (which cannot be enhanced with any other state aid).
  * Business risk financing only for new entrepreneurship aid scheme.


All types of aids can be provided either separately or in combination thereof and are all taken into account for the determination of the total aid amount of each investment project. The types of aid are granted (and, respectively, the benefit starts to apply), following a relevant certification, either in lump sum (following the issuance of the decision certifying the completion and the commencement of the productive operation of the project) or gradually (according to the specific requirements per each type of aid granted).
Moreover, as regards the support and implementation of the Law (filing of applications, documentation file, evaluation, etc.), all procedural issues will be carried out through (i) the Development Planning Directorates of the Regions of the country (for the investment plans of an eligible amount up to EUR 1 million, which are implemented within the boundaries of each region), (ii) the Private Investment Directorate of the Ministry of Interior, Macedonia - Thrace Sector (for the investment plans of an eligible amount of more than EUR 1 million and up to EUR 3 million implemented in the Regions of Western and Central Macedonia and Eastern Macedonia and Thrace), and (iii) the State Aid Information System of the Ministry of Development and Investments (for the remaining investment plans).
The evaluation process includes the stage of completion and legality control and the evaluation stage and is carried out either through the method of comparative evaluation or through the method of direct evaluation. Investment projects that fall under the aid schemes are audited at any time and at any stage of implementation of the investment project or at any stage of fulfilling their long-term liabilities.
### Special Section
#### Aid schemes
In the Special Section of the Law, the following aid schemes are being prescribed:

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
WHT rates are as follows:
Type of income | WHT rate (%)  
---|---  
Dividends | 5  
Interest | 15  
Royalties and other payments | 20  
Fees for technical projects, management fees, and consultancy and other related services | 20  
By exception, fees received by contractors of every kind of technical projects and lessors of public, municipal, association, or port proceeds | 3% on the value of the project under construction or lease payment  
Legal entities tax resident in Greece are not subject to WHT in relation to royalties, fees received for the provision of consultancy and other related services, and management fees, unless provided to general government bodies.
Legal entities that are not tax resident in Greece and do not maintain a PE in Greece are not subject to Greek WHT in relation to technical services, consultancy services, or other related services and management fees.
By virtue of the provisions of the Ministerial Circular 1007/2017, it is clarified that the fees for technical services, management fees, fees for consulting services, and the remuneration for similar services received by an EU legal entity through its PE in Greece are not subject to WHT.
The above exemption does not include the fees received by EU legal entities from the services provided to the general government bodies, as well as the fees for technical services received by the EU legal entities.
Conversely, non-EU foreign legal entities that maintain a PE in Greece are subject to Greek WHT in relation to the provision of the aforementioned services.
Legal entities that are tax resident in Greece or foreign legal entities that maintain a PE in Greece are not subject to WHT in relation to royalty payments.
The exemption from the obligation of WHT for payments of dividends, interest, and royalties by a Greek subsidiary to its parent company includes payments of dividends, interest, and royalties to Greek parent companies.
For the exemption from dividend WHT, the following conditions apply:
  * The receiving legal entity should own shares, parts, or a participation of at least 10%, on the basis of the value or number, in the share capital, right to profits, or voting rights of the distributing taxpayer.
  * The minimum holding percentage of shares or parts or participations should be held for at least 24 months (subject to providing a bank guarantee, the exemption may apply prior to completing the 24-month holding period).
  * The receiving legal entity should be: 
    * included in the forms enumerated in Annex I Part A of Directive 2011/96/EU, as in force
    * tax resident in an EU member state according to the legislation of such state and not be considered as tax resident in a third country in application of the terms of the DTT concluded with such third country, and
    * subject, without the option or exemption, to one of the taxes mentioned in Annex I Part B of Directive 2011/96/EU, or to any other tax that may in the future replace one of those taxes.


A general anti-abuse rule is applicable by virtue of which the tax exemption in case of collection and payment of dividends is lifted in case it is considered that a ‘non-genuine arrangement’ exists. A ‘non-genuine arrangement’ is an arrangement that has not been put into place for valid commercial reasons reflecting the economic reality.
For the exemption from WHT for interest and royalty payments, the following conditions apply:
  * The receiving legal entity should directly own shares, parts, or a participation of at least 25%, on the basis of the value or number, in the share capital, right to profits, or voting rights of the paying taxpayer; the paying taxpayer directly owns shares, parts, or a participation of at least 25% in the share capital of the receiving entity; or a third legal entity directly owns shares, parts, or a participation of at least 25% in the share capital of the receiving entity and the paying legal entity.
  * The minimum holding percentage of shares or parts or participations should be held for at least 24 months (subject to providing a bank guarantee, the exemption may apply prior to completing the 24-month holding period).
  * The receiving legal entity should be: 
    * included in the forms enumerated in Annex I Part A of Directive 2003/49/EU, as in force
    * tax resident in an EU member state according to the legislation of such state and not be considered as tax resident in a third country in application of the terms of the DTT concluded with such third country, and

Payments of interest of bank loans (excluding bond loans), including default interest, as well as interest of intra-bank deposits, are exempt from WHT.
Interest received from Greek government bonds and treasury bills, as well as from listed corporate bonds, by legal entities that are not tax resident in Greece and that do not maintain a PE in Greece are not subject to WHT.
The following table provides a summary of the WHTs applicable under the respective DTTs entered into by Greece:

By virtue of L. 4378/2017 and L. 4474/2017, Greece proceeded on 30 September 2017 to the exchange of information on accounts held by financial institutions. The exchange of information will take place in September of each respective year, and the deadline for the submission of the information to the tax authorities by the financial institutions is set in June of each year.
## Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS)
Greece adheres, in general, to the BEPS guidelines.
On 7 June 2017, Greece signed the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting ('Multilateral Instrument' or 'MLI'). On 26 January 2021, the Greek Government Officially published Law 4768/2021 to ratify the MLI. On 30 March 2021 Greece deposited its instrument of ratification for the MLI with the OECD.
In 2019, Greece transposed the Directive laying down rules against tax avoidance practices (ATAD) and more precisely the CFC rules, the General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR), and the interest deduction limitation rules, which are in the spirit of BEPS guidelines.
Furthermore, on 31 July 2020, Greece completed the transposition of the exit taxation and the hybrid mismatch rules laid down in the Directive (EU) 2016/1164, as amended by Directive (EU) 2017/952. Said provisions apply as of 1 January 2020.
## EU Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC6)
On 31 July 2020, the law implementing the Council Directive (EU) 2018/822 of 25 May 2018 into the local legislation was published in the Government Gazette. The law overall follows the scope of the Directive, and no major deviations are identified.
The rules of DAC6 introduce mandatory disclosure requirements for certain cross-border tax arrangements, provided the main benefit of such arrangements is the expectation of a lower tax burden and/or of other specific characteristics (hallmarks) defined in the Directive. The reporting obligation lies primarily with the intermediary business consultants of taxpayers and, in certain instances, with the taxpayers themselves.
The DAC6 provisions have a retroactive effect, and the reporting obligation captures transactions implemented from 25 June 2018 onwards.
The first reporting of information on reportable cross-border arrangements, which was implemented between 25 June 2018 and 31 January 2021, took place on 28 February 2021. The first automatic exchange of information between the tax authorities of the member states took place on 30 April 2021.
For transactions that have been designed or implemented as of 1 February 2021, there is a period of 30 days for filing relevant information by intermediaries and relevant taxpayers in accordance with the provisions of DAC6 legislation.
No or late filing triggers penalties for the intermediaries or the taxpayers.
## Choice of business entity
The main differences between a subsidiary (i.e. _Société Anonyme_[SA] or limited liability company [LLC]) and a branch of a company, from a corporate establishment perspective, are the following:
  * A subsidiary is a separate legal entity from its parent company, whereas a branch does not form a separate legal entity, does not have its own shareholders, and, consequently, the funds needed for its operation are transferred from the overseas parent company.
  * The parent company of a branch must be either the equivalent of a Greek SA or an LLC, whereas there is no such restriction for subsidiaries.
  * The day-to-day management of a branch is exercised by the legal representative, a person appointed by the parent company, whereas an SA is represented by its BoD and an LLC is administered and directed by the administrator(s).
  * No minimum capital is required for the establishment of a branch or LLC; nevertheless, if the parent company has the legal form of an SA, the share capital of the parent company should be, in principle, aligned with the minimum share capital requirements of a Greek established SA (i.e. EUR 25,000).
  * An SA appears to be a more popular type of company than a branch and an LLC. In particular, certain investors still tend to opt for the establishment of an SA company, particularly if they would like to participate in public tenders, etc.


The main legal differences between an SA and an LLC in Greece from a company law/establishment perspective are the following:
  * An SA is managed by a BoD consisting of at least three members, whereas an LLC can be managed by only one individual, the administrator (legal entities are permitted to be appointed as BoD members or administrators). Following the recent reform of the Law on SA’s, small and very small entities may elect instead to appoint a single-member management body. Such appointment is contingent to a relevant statutory provision included in the company’s articles of association.
  * Both BoD members and administrators have to acquire a Greek tax registration number and a Greek residence permit (if applicable) prior to the establishment of the relevant companies. It should also be noted that the acquisition of a residence permit for non-EU citizens is a time-consuming procedure.
  * The shareholders of an SA, as well as the partners of an LLC, are also required to be registered with the Greek tax authorities.
  * Establishment/incorporation of an SA is, in principle, performed through the so-called One Stop Shop Authority (i.e. Notary Public). Any appropriate documents (applications, declarations, certificates, etc.) required for establishment process should be produced and submitted to the Notary Public by the founders of the SA, as said persons are defined in the Articles of Association (AoA) of the SA under establishment, or their representatives appointed by virtue of an (duly legalised as to the signature of the founders) authorisation. After the submission of the necessary documentation to the competent One Stop Shop Authority, the said authority accomplishes all the necessary steps for the establishment of the Greek SA, including the granting of the Greek tax registration number. Depending on the particular activity of the SA under establishment, the satisfaction of particular regulatory requirements, such as the acquisition of certain licences, might be required.
  * As of 1 January 2019, incorporation of an SA by way of a private agreement is introduced. This is conditional to adopting without deviation the template of L.4441/2016, i.e. the Model Articles of Association for SA’s and that the capital contribution does not require execution by way of notarial deed (e.g. contribution of real estate assets).
  * Establishment/incorporation of an LLC is performed through the One Stop Shop Authority (i.e. Notary Public). Any appropriate documents (applications, declarations certificates, etc.) required for the establishment process should be produced and submitted to the Notary Public by the founders of the LLC, or their representatives appointed by virtue of written authorisation (duly legalised as to the signature of the founders). After the submission of the necessary documentation to the competent One Stop Shop Authority, the said authority accomplishes all the necessary steps for the establishment of the Greek LLC, including the granting of the Greek tax registration number. Depending on the particular activity of the Greek LLC under establishment, the satisfaction of particular regulatory requirements, such as the acquisition of certain licences, might be required. 
  * The recent amendment of the Law on Limited Liability Companies introduced significant changes to the incorporation of entities of said legal form. In particular, further to incorporation by way of a notarial deed, the incorporation of an LLC may also be executed by way of a private agreement, provided that the exclusive content of the template/model incorporation statutes of Law 4441/2016 for LLC’s are adhered to, without any deviation.
  * LLC’s are mandatorily incorporated for a specific duration.


### The 'Private Company' (PC)
  * The PC constitutes a legal entity and is commercial in nature, even if its object is not _per se_ commercial. The capital of the PC can be freely determined by the partners and can amount to zero, whilst its partners participate in the PC by means of capital, non-capital, and guarantee contributions.
  * The PC is not entitled to acquire, either directly or indirectly, its own capital parts.
  * The PC has its registered seat in the municipality referred to in its AoA, while the transfer of the registered seat of the PC in another country of the European Economic Area does not necessarily result in the dissolution of the PC, provided that the recipient country recognises the transfer and the continuity of legal personality. The PC is not obligated to have its actual seat in Greece, whilst the PC is capable of establishing various types of secondary establishments either in Greece or abroad.
  * The term of the PC is definite; if not otherwise stipulated in the AoA of the PC, the PC has a term of 12 years following its establishment.
  * The PC is administered and represented by one or more administrators.
  * The administrator represents the PC and conducts in its name all actions pertaining to the administration of the PC, the management of its assets, and, in general, the pursuit of its objects.
  * The establishment of the PC is effected by means of its registration with the Greek General Commercial Registry (GEMI).
  * The PC is dissolved: (i) at any time following a resolution of the partners, (ii) when its definite term has expired, unless the term of the PC is extended by virtue of a resolution of the partners, (iii) if the PC defaults, and (iv) in all other circumstances contemplated by the law or the AoA.




# Greece
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Inventory valuation
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (replacement) value. The Greek tax system recognises various valuation methods, such as first in first out (FIFO), weighted average, etc.
## Capital gains
In general, capital gains are included in the taxable profits of Greek companies.
The income derived from the goodwill arising upon the transfer of Greek government bonds or Greek treasury bills that are acquired by legal entities that do not qualify as Greek tax residents and do not maintain a PE in Greece is tax exempt.
### Capital gains tax on sale of listed shares
Capital gains derived from the sale of listed and non-listed shares are considered business income taxable at the standard CIT rate.
Capital gains derived from the sale of listed and non-listed shares by foreign legal entities that are tax resident abroad shall be taxable in Greece only if they maintain a PE in Greece.
The sale of listed shares is also subject to a transaction duty at a rate of 0.1%.
### Participation exemption on capital gains
As of 1 January 2020, capital gains derived from the sale of shares in an EU subsidiary are tax exempt in case the participation is greater than 10% and has been maintained for at least 24 months. 
The above-mentioned income is not further taxed neither at the distribution nor at the capitalisation of these profits, while no possibility of deducting the business costs associated with this participation is provided. 
Exceptionally, any losses resulting from the above transfer of shares may be recognised for deduction after 1 January 2020, provided that they have been valuated by 31 December 2019 and recorded in the books or included in the audited financial statements of the company. However, the deduction of such losses will only be recognised if they become final by 31 December 2024 and will also be limited to either the amount of the evaluation or that of the definitive loss, whichever is smaller.
The income resulting from the capital gain on the transfer of shares to a legal entity established outside the EU, received by a legal entity that is a tax resident of Greece, is exempt from tax, if the legal entity whose shares are transferred meets the following cumulative conditions:
  * has the legal form of a capital company under the law of its state of establishment,
  * is not established in a non-cooperative state,
  * is subject, without the possibility of option or exemption, to corporate income tax or other similar tax,
  * the transferring legal entity holds a minimum participation percentage of at least ten percent (10%) of the value or number of the share capital or share capital or voting rights of the legal entity whose shares are transferred and
  * the minimum participation percentage is held for at least twenty-four (24) months.
  * the entity whose shares are being transferred must not be established in a non-cooperative state.


Exceptionally, any losses resulting from the transfer of shares may be recognized for deduction after 1 January 2025, provided that they have been valuated by 31 December 2023 and recorded in the company's books or are reflected in the audited financial statements of the company. However, the deduction of such losses will only be recognized if they become final by 31 December 2026 and will also be limited to either the amount of the evaluation or that of the definitive loss, whichever is smaller.
## Dividend income
Dividend income is generally taxable. For subsidiaries established in third countries, any dividend WHT that may have been paid is credited against the Greek CIT payable (up to the amount of tax that would arise in Greece).
However, a tax exemption of intra-group dividends received by Greek tax resident legal entities or PEs of foreign legal entities in Greece applies, provided that:
  * the legal entity distributing the profits is included in the forms enumerated in Annex I, Part A of Directive 2011/96/EE, as in force
  * the legal entity distributing the profits is tax resident in an EU member state and is not considered as tax resident in a third country in application of the provisions of a DTT concluded with such third country
  * the legal entity distributing the profits is subject to one of the taxes listed in Annex I, Part II of Directive 2011/96/EE or any other tax substituting one of those taxes
  * the recipient taxpayer holds at least a minimum participation of 10% of the value or the quantity of the share or principal capital or voting rights of the distributing legal entity
  * the minimum participation percentage is held for at least 24 months (although the exemption may be provided prior to the completion of 24 months secured by a guarantee), and
  * the respective dividends have not been deducted at the level of the entity distributing the dividends.


In case of further distribution of the reserve formed by tax-exempt dividends received from Greek or foreign subsidiaries established in an EU member state, said amount shall not be included in the taxable income of the legal entity proceeding to said distribution, but may be subject to dividend WHT.
Based on the general anti-abuse rule introduced, the tax exemption in the case of collection and payment of dividends is lifted in case it is considered that a ‘non-genuine arrangement’ exists (i.e. an arrangement that has not been put into place for valid commercial reasons reflecting the economic reality).
Should the aforementioned tax exemption of intra-group dividends not apply, any underlying CIT and dividend WHT that may have been paid by a Greek or foreign subsidiary established in an EU member state are credited against the Greek CIT payable (up to the amount of tax that would arise in Greece). In such a case, the tax corresponding, and not the tax paid, on such dividends can be deducted from the Greek tax due.
Intra-group dividends received by a legal entity that is a tax resident of Greece, from a legal entity established outside the EU, are exempt from tax, if the legal entity making the distribution, cumulatively:
  * has the legal form of a capital company based on the law of its state of establishment,
  * is not established in a non-cooperative state,
  * is subject, without the possibility of option or exemption, to corporate income tax or other similar tax,
  * the recipient taxpayer holds a minimum participation percentage of at least ten percent (10%) of the value or number of the share or share capital or voting rights of the legal entity that distributes and
  * the minimum participation percentage is held for at least twenty-four (24) months. This also applies to intra-group dividends from permanent establishments of companies from countries outside the European Union located in Greece and originating from their subsidiaries in another country


### Stock dividends
Stock dividends are treated as cash dividends for CIT purposes.
## Interest income
Interest income is generally taxable.
## Partnership income
Both general partnerships (_Omorrythmi Etairia_ or OE) and limited partnerships (_Eterrorythmi Etairia_ or EE) are not tax transparent. They are subject to tax based on general rules (i.e. at a CIT rate of 22% plus a 5% WHT on distributions). Business income generated by partnerships that maintain single entry accounting books is taxed at a unified tax rate of 22%. In addition, any subsequent distribution of profits is not subject to dividend taxation.
## Rents/royalties income
Income derived from rents and royalties is taxed as ordinary income.
## Foreign income
Resident corporations are taxed on their worldwide income. Foreign income received by a domestic corporation is taxed together with other income. If related income tax is paid or withheld abroad, a tax credit is generally available up to the amount of the applicable Greek income tax.
Losses from foreign sources may not be set off against profits generated in Greece. Exceptionally, losses from EU and European Economic Area (EEA) member states may be set off with profits arising in those EU or EEA member states, provided that they are not exempt on the basis of the DTT concluded and applied by Greece.


# Greece
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
Resident corporations are taxed on their worldwide income. Non-resident corporations are taxed in Greece on any Greek-source income they derive therein.
For the tax year 2021 onwards, the corporate income tax (CIT) rate of legal entities, with the exemption of credit institutions, has been reduced to 22%.
Furthermore, credit institutions are taxed at a rate of 29% only if and for those tax years that they are subject to the specific provisions of Art. 27A of the Income Tax Code (ITC) regarding deferred taxation.
## Shipping companies
The Greek tonnage tax regime model intends to tax shipping activity and applies to Greek or foreign ship-owning companies with vessels flying a Greek flag and foreign ship-owning companies with vessels flying a foreign flag that maintain a ship management company in Greece that is exclusively engaged in ship management activities. The Greek tonnage tax regime applies to vessels of ‘A’ and ‘B’ category that are either flying a Greek or foreign flag. In the case of vessels flying a foreign flag, the foreign ship-owning company should maintain a ship management office in Greece. Category ‘A' vessels include cargo vessels, tankers, steel hull vessels for dry or liquid cargo that fly to/between foreign ports, passenger vessels, drilling platforms, etc. Category ‘B' vessels include small boats and any other motor vessels not listed under category ‘A’.
Based on Law 4336/2015, the tonnage tax levied on certain categories of vessels flying a Greek flag (i.e. professional vessels, leisure yachts, ferries, etc.) has been expanded to vessels flying flags of the European Union or EU area member states, with exhaustion of the income tax liability of the ship owners on income earned from the related activity.
Said provision aligns the regime applying to said category of vessels following the European Commission’s accusation of discriminatory treatment of foreign-flag vessels compared to Greek-flag ones.
The gross tonnage is calculated by multiplying coefficient rates by each scale of gross registered tonnage. This taxable tonnage is then multiplied by an age-corrected rate.
Various exemptions/reductions of the tonnage tax apply, such as:
  * Vessels built in shipyards in Greece, under a Greek flag, are exempt from tax for the first six years.
  * 50% reduction for vessels operating regular routes between Greek/foreign ports or solely between foreign ports.


The tonnage tax exhausts the tax liability of the owner, and, if the owner is a company, this extends to its shareholders. Tonnage tax also exhausts the tax liability in relation to operating profits and capital gains arising out of the sale of the vessel flying the Greek flag. Tonnage tax also exhausts the tax liability of the foreign ship-owning company flying a vessel under a foreign flag managed by a ship management company in Greece, as well as of the shareholders thereof. No CIT or dividend withholding tax (WHT) is levied on shipping profits.
This tax burdens the ship owners or ship-owning companies, while the ship management companies are jointly and severally liable for the payment thereof.
An obligation of the liable parties for submitting before the Ministry of Mercantile Marine an annual statement indicating the name, flag, total tonnage, and age of the vessel under the foreign flag is established.
For calculating the tonnage tax (tax rates and tax brackets, criteria) and the special tax return and payment of tax, the provisions on the tonnage tax payable for Greek-flagged vessels apply in analogy. A credit for the tonnage tax paid abroad is provided.
As of 1 January 2020, the application of the tonnage tax regime is extended beyond ship owning companies and their shareholders and partners, also to bareboat charterers and lessees in case of ship leasing arrangements, and their shareholders and partners up to the level of Ultimate Beneficial Owners.
### Annual contribution imposed on ship management companies
An annual contribution is imposed on offices or branches of foreign enterprises that have been established in Greece by virtue of Article 25 of Law 27/1975 and that are engaged in the chartering, insurance, average (damage) settlements, purchase, chartering or shipbuilding brokerage, or chartering of insurance of ships under Greek or foreign flag of total tonnage over 500 shipping tons, as well as the representation of ship owner companies or undertakings, whose object is identical to the above-mentioned activities. Said contribution is also imposed (referring only to years 2019 onwards) on Greek legal entities operating in Greece in accordance with article 25 of Law 27/1975, which are engaged to activities similar to those stated above.
Greek and foreign companies of Law 27/1975 that are engaged in the management of vessels flying a Greek or foreign flag (that are subject to tonnage tax), as well as in other activities approved by the license of operation, are exempt. Passenger coastal ships or merchant vessels that perform internal routes are exempt.
This contribution is imposed on the total amount of imported foreign exchange and, for the years 2018 onwards, the tax scale is as follows:
Bracket of annual total foreign exchange (USD) | Rate (%) | Tax per bracket (USD) | Total foreign exchange (USD) | Total tax (USD)  
---|---|---|---|---  
200,000 | 7 | 14,000 | 200,000 | 14,000  
Excess amount | 6  
For the years 2016 through 2018, the contribution was calculated on a minimum 50,000 United States dollars (USD), while for the years 2019 and 2020 a minimum contribution of USD 5,000 was imposed on an annual basis. It is increased to USD 6,000 from 2021 onwards.
A special tax return for calculating the contribution on the basis of the imported foreign exchange of the previous year should be filed within March of each year. The contribution is paid in two instalments (April and September).
The distribution of profits by a foreign ship management company maintaining an office or branch in Greece by virtue of Article 25 of Law 27/1975 that is exclusively engaged in the chartering, insurance, brokerage, etc. of vessels to Greek individual tax residents was subject to tax at a rate of 10% up to 2022 and of 5% from 2023. From 2019 onwards, the said provision applies equally to Greek companies.
This tax applies to dividends paid or credited and shall be rendered to the Greek state by the beneficiary of the dividend.
Nevertheless, the 10% tax rate remained the same with regards to cases of distributions of profits by the above-mentioned companies in the form of extraordinary fees and percentages (bonus) to Board of Directors (BoD) members, directors, and officials, in addition to the regular remuneration, exhausting the tax liability of the beneficiaries for said income. From 2019 onwards, the application of the said provision is expanded to all BoD members, directors, and any other employee of both chartering and ship management companies, regardless of whether they are Greek or foreign entities.
The compatibility of the Greek tonnage tax regime with the EU State Aid rules has been investigated by the European Commission and found, in principle, compatible with the EU Maritime Guidelines.
## Local income taxes
No municipal or local taxes on income are paid at a local level.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate is 24% (applicable to all goods and services that are not subject to the reduced or super-reduced VAT rate, which are explicitly enumerated in the law).
A reduced VAT rate of 13% applies,  _inter alia_ , to ready to eat fresh food, non-alcoholic beverages (without the addition of alcohol in any proportion) and aerated waters, basic types of foodstuff (e.g. oil, coffee, sugars) along with food services supplied by restaurants (with the exemption of alcoholic beverages in any proportion and non-alcoholic beverages, which are subject to the 24% rate. From 1 July 2024, the provision of coffee, cocoa, tea, chamomile, and other infusions, only for take away or delivery is subject to the 13% rate), infant and child nutrition products packaged for retail sale, bicyclist helmets, items for the safety and protection of infants (absorbent diapers for infants and child car seats), home care services for children, the elderly, patients, and the disabled, accommodation in hotels or similar establishments (including provision of holiday accommodation and letting of places in camping or caravan sites and short-term leases if the lessor is a legal entity or an individual who has at least three properties for short term lease), the transport of persons and their baggage, supply of services by fitness centres and dance schools, tickets to zoos, the import of works of art, collections, or antiquities, and the supply of works of art by their creator or one's successors in title.
A super-reduced rate of 6% is applicable to medicines of CN3003 and 3004 and vaccines of CN3002 intended for human medicine. The aforementioned rate is also applicable, _inter alia_ , to the supply of electricity, gas, and district heating, tickets to theatres, cinemas, concerts, books and children’s books, colouring and drawing books, music books, newspapers, magazines, and e-books, and prepared foods for animals (excluding dog or cat food).
A rate of 4% is applicable to the execution of work intended exclusively for the overcoming or removal of architectural elements and other fixed and non-fixed obstacles limiting the mobility of persons with disabilities, in public or private buildings.
The above VAT rates are reduced by 30% (i.e. they are 17%, 9%, 4%, and 3% respectively) in the Aegean islands of Chios, Kos, Lesvos, Leros, and Samos, under certain conditions.
In addition, COVID-19 vaccines, which have been approved by the European Commission or by other member-states, are subject to 0% VAT.
Supplies of goods and services to VAT-registered persons established in EU countries (intra-Community supplies) are not subject to VAT (zero rated). Exports of goods and services connected to exports to non-EU countries are VAT exempt (zero rated).
Real estate leases are generally exempt from VAT. However, commercial leases and lease contracts for shopping centres and logistics centres may be subject to VAT on the condition that the lessor opts for the taxation of the lease under VAT either prior to or after the commencement of the lease by filing a relevant application. 
Furthermore, VAT will be suspended until 31 December 2025 and real estate transfer tax will be levied on all unsold real estate with a construction permit issued (or revised) from 1 January 2006 onwards, upon relevant application by taxable persons.
As of July 2021, new VAT rules were introduced in relation to the new One-Stop Shop (OSS) scheme and the Import One-Stop Shop (IOSS).
The main changes are the following:
Online sellers, including online marketplaces/platforms can register in one EU member state and this will be valid for the declaration and payment of VAT on all distance sales of goods and cross-border supplies of services to customers within the European Union.
The existing thresholds for distance sales of goods within the European Union were abolished and replaced by a new EU-wide threshold of EUR 10,000. Below this EUR 10,000 threshold, the supplies of telecommunications, broadcasting and electronic (TBE) services and distance sales of goods within the European Union may remain subject to VAT in the member state where the taxable person is established.
Special provisions are introduced whereby online marketplaces/platforms facilitating supplies of goods are deemed for VAT purposes to have received and supplied the goods themselves ('deemed supplier').
In addition, new record keeping requirements are introduced for online marketplaces/platforms facilitating supplies of goods and services, including where such online marketplaces/platform are not a deemed supplier.
The VAT exemption at importation of small consignments of a value up to EUR 22 has been removed. This means all goods imported in the European Union will now be subject to VAT.
A new special scheme for distance sales of low goods imported from third territories or third countries has been created. The IOSS has been created to simplify the declaration and payment of VAT. 
Finally, simplification measures for distance sales of imported goods in consignments not exceeding EUR 150 has been introduced, in case the IOSS is not used (special arrangements).
## Customs duties
Many goods imported into Greece from outside the European Union are subject to customs duties. The rates of duty are provided by the EU’s Common Customs Tariff.
## Excise taxes
Excise taxes are imposed on energy and electricity products (e.g. petrol, natural gas, electricity), manufactured tobacco, alcoholic products, coffee, liquids used in electronic cigarettes, and the tobacco contained in electrically heated tobacco products. The tax rates vary depending on the category of products.
In addition, consumption tax has been introduced on the following products: (i) the substrate or container of nicotine or nicotine and other substances, or other substances without nicotine, in solid form contained in electrically heated non-tobacco products and (ii) the substrate of nicotine or nicotine and other substances in solid form contained in ’nicotine pouches‘.
## Environmental taxes
A special plastic bag duty is imposed on consumers per piece of thin plastic bag they use (except for biodegradable bags, which are not subject to this duty). The rate of the duty is 7 cents per plastic carrier bag.
Furthermore, the application of a uniform call rate, at 80 cents per kilogram, to the weight of plastic packaging waste that is generated in each member state and is not recycled was introduced through Council Decision (EU, Euratom) 2020/2053 of 14 December 2020, which was implemented in Greece by L. 4783/2021.
An environmental protection levy of 4 cents (per product) is imposed on the plastic products that are available as packaging of food and beverages during their sale by mass catering companies or by retail companies. In plastic products, the plastic cover or lid is considered as a distinct product, for which the levy is imposed separately.
Moreover, a recycling duty was introduced by virtue of Art. 80 of L. 4819/2021, imposing on consumers as of 1 June 2022 a duty of 8 cents per piece the packaging of which contains polyvinyl chloride (PVC).
These special levies are imposed on consumers at purchase and collected and rendered to the state by every trader who is selling these products. They are subject to VAT. 
Lastly, following Law 5162/2024 (the new Tax law) the climate resilience fee has been increased ranging from 0.50 to 5.00 Euros on the hospitality services sector (i.e. main hotel accommodation, rented furnished rooms, properties made available through short-term rentals, in case of self-catering accommodation - tourist furnished villas), which is levied per day of use and per room or apartment. 
## Uniform Tax on the Ownership of Real Estate Property (ENFIA)
The ownership of real estate property/property rights in Greece is subject to the ENFIA, which consists of a principal tax imposed on each real estate property and a supplementary tax imposed on the total value of the property rights on real estate property of the taxpayer subject to tax.
More specifically, said tax is not imposed on the objective value of real estate property, but is determined on the basis of various factors, according to the final registration of the property at the land registry or ownership title.
The principal tax on buildings is calculated by multiplying the square metres of the building by the principal tax ranging from EUR 2 to EUR 16.20 per square metre and other coefficients affecting the value of the property (e.g. location, use).
The principal tax on land is calculated by multiplying the square metres of the land by the principal tax ranging from EUR 0.0037 to EUR 9.2500 per square metre and other coefficients affecting the value of the property (e.g. location, use).
The supplementary tax is imposed on the total value of the rights to property at a rate of 5.5‰. Self-used real estate is taxed at the reduced rate of 1‰.
Pursuant the provisions of the new tax Law 5162/2024, starting from the year 2025, the Unified Property Tax (ENFIA) for insuredindividuals' residences will be reduced by 20%, provided that the taxable value of the property does not exceed 500,000 euros. If the property's value exceeds this threshold, the reduction remains at 10%. To qualify for this exemption, the insurance must cover the previous year andhave a minimum duration of three months. If the insurance duration is less than one year, the real estate tax reduction will be applied proportionally. 
## Real estate transfer tax
Each transfer of real estate, which is not subject to VAT, is subject to real estate transfer tax. The real estate transfer tax is imposed at a rate of 3% on the taxable value of the property (increased by a municipality surcharge to a total rate of 3.09%).
## Abolition of Stamp taxes-Introduction of Digital Transaction Duty
Law 5135/2024 abolishes the Stamp Duty and introduces the Digital Transaction Duty into Greek tax legislation, which will be imposed on transactions and contracts from December 1, 2024, onwards.
The Digital Transaction Duty is imposed on loan agreements at a rate of 2.4%, with a cap of €150,000 per loan. It is clarified that the Digital Transaction Duty is not imposed, among others, on loan interest, bond loans under Law 4548/2018, and bank loans.
Rentals of non-residential properties are subject to 3.6% digital transaction duty (with the exception of shopping centres and logistics centres subject to VAT).
Other digital transaction duties may apply in certain limited cases.
## Capital accumulation tax following incorporation
Capital accumulation tax applies on any capital accumulation transactions, at a rate that has been recently reduced to 0.2% as regards transactions for which the tax liability arises from 11 December 2023 onwards. In particular, said tax is imposed on capital accumulation (share capital increase) by:
  * commercial companies and joint ventures
