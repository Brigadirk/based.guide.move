## Foreign tax relief
Income tax paid abroad is deductible from Greek tax only under the conditions that:
  * the taxpayer files a Greek tax return as a Greek tax resident
  * the taxpayer submits to the tax office the original supporting documentation (i.e. foreign income tax return and tax payment notice) for this transaction bearing the seal of Apostille per Hague Convention and being officially translated into Greek, and
  * the foreign country has the right to apply tax on the income.


Said deduction, however, cannot exceed the part of income tax that would be attributable had this income (i.e. foreign income) been earned by Greek sources.

## Taxable period
No taxable years other than the calendar year are permitted.
## Tax returns
The filing of tax returns of natural persons is effected only electronically (via the Internet).
During the marriage or civil-partnership, spouses are required to file a joint tax return starting from the tax year in which the marriage or civil-partnership occurs, covering the income of that year. Onespouseisdesignatedtosubmit the jointtax return and isresponsible for reporting the income of bothparties. Taxes, fees, and contributionsarecalculatedseparately for eachspouse'sincome, witheachspouseindividuallyresponsible for theirrespectivepayments.»
However, the taxable income of one spouse from a business that is financially dependent on the other spouse is added to the taxable income of the other spouse. Taxable income of dependent children is added, with certain exceptions, to the parent who declares the higher total income. 
The income tax return may be submitted separately if at least one spouse opts to do so by filing a income tax return by February 28 of the submission year. This choice is binding for the other spouse, irrevocable for the first applicable year, and remains in effect for each subsequent tax year unless revoked by February 28 of the respective year. In the event of separate filings, the provisions related to taxable income of dependent children apply accordingly for the parent who reports the higher income.
For the purposes of the income tax return filing (single or joint), it is mandatory that the taxpayer(s) has obtained a Greek tax registration number. Non-Greek tax residents are required to file an annual income tax return only with the Greek tax office applicable for foreign residents. In this respect, they appoint against the Greek tax authorities, on a basis of a proxy document, a Greek tax resident as their representative. Legal entities are not allowed to be appointed as representatives.
The submission of the Greek income tax returns takes place from March 15 to July 15 for each tax year.
## Payment of tax
Income tax and special solidarity contribution are withheld from salaries and remitted to the tax office by the employer.
The WHT on salaries, wages, and pensions is calculated on the amount of monthly salary after being reduced by the employee’s share of social security contributions, multiplied by 14 (12 monthly salaries, plus one monthly salary for Christmas bonus, one-half monthly salary for Easter bonus, and one-half monthly salary for vacation bonus). This amount constitutes the employee’s annual net salary before income tax. The annual WHT is calculated on the basis of the personal income tax rates (_see the section_), taking into consideration the number of dependent children (_see the section_).
The employer must withhold 1/14 of this amount each month from the employee’s salary. The same amount of tax must be withheld from the Christmas bonus, while 1/2 (i.e. 1/28 of the annual tax) is the amount of tax that must be withheld from both the Easter and the vacation bonus. Overtime pay, bonuses, allowances, , as well as retroactive income, are subject to WHT at the rate of 20%. The final tax is computed with the year-end payroll clearance.
Annual income tax withholding on salaries, wages, and pensions is set off against the final income tax assessed on the basis of the individual income tax return. Any amounts withheld in excess of the annual income tax assessed are refunded.
If the taxpayer has income not subject to tax withholding at source (e.g. income from immovable property, freelance professions, or business/commercial activities), a tax prepayment of 55% on the current year’s income tax is assessed by the tax authorities and is paid together with the balance, if any, of the previous year. Only for the first year of tax return filing is such a tax advance payment reduced to 50%.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Standard deductions
The income tax is reduced based on certain expenditures for annual personal living.
More specifically, as of 1 January 2020, the maximum amount of tax reduction (applicable to salaried and pension income) is EUR 777 for income up to the maximum of EUR 12,000 for a single person or for a married person with no dependents.
Furthermore, the tax reduction amounts to nine hundred (900) euros for a taxpayer with one (1) dependent child, one thousand one hundred and twenty (1,120) euros for two (2) dependent children, one thousand three hundred and forty (1,340) euros for three (3) dependent children, one thousand five hundred and eighty (1,580) euros for four (4) dependent children, and one thousand seven hundred and eighty (1,780) euros for five (5) dependent children. For each additional dependent child beyond the fifth, the tax reduction increases by two hundred and twenty (220) euros for each subsequent child. If the amount of tax is less than these amounts, the tax reduction is limited to the amount of the applicable tax.
For salaried and pension income above EUR 12,000, the amount of tax deduction is reduced by EUR 20 for every EUR 1,000 of income.
With effect from 1 January 2020, the amount of expenditure required to be paid by electronic means is amended, and, instead of the applicable progressive computation, it should be equal to 30% of the actual income from salaried employment, pensions, and business. The amount of the annual expenditure is limited to EUR 20,000.
In the event that expenses incurred, which pertain to payments of personal income tax and ENFIA, loan obligations to financial institutions, and rent, exceed sixty percent (60%) of the actual income the required percentage of expenses is reduced to twenty percent (20%).
Note that the purchases of goods and receipt of services may include the majority of categories of goods and services, such as accommodation, food, clothing, car expenses, telecommunications, education, etc. In addition, said expenses should be incurred either in the Greek territory or in any European Union (EU) territory.
## Personal deductions
Certain expenses are deducted from the gross income to reach taxable income. These deductible expenses, provided for by specific provisions of the Greek ITC, mainly include the following:
  * Social security contributions mandatory by law.
  * Donations and grants of specific instances and to restrictively listed bodies and organisations. The income tax reduction amounts to 20% of the value of donations to the extent that the total amount of donations during a tax year exceeds EUR 100,00 and do not exceed 5% of the taxable income.


Foreign taxpayers who qualify as non-Greek tax residents may enjoy the tax reliefs of Greek tax residents provided that they maintain their residence in an EU or European Economic Area (EEA) country and (i) generate at least 90% of their worldwide income in Greece or (ii) are able to prove that their taxable income is so low that they would be entitled to tax relief in their country.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Employment income
Greek tax residents are taxed on their worldwide income irrespective of the country where such income has been generated, paid, or remitted.
Non-resident aliens are taxed on salary earned for work performed in Greece, regardless of where payment is made and regardless of where it is remitted. They are not taxed to the extent their compensation relates to services performed outside of Greece.
All fringe benefits are normally considered taxable income for the employee and hence treated as such.
Board of Directors fees/remunerations paid to Board Members are considered as salaried income and are taxed based on the respective income tax scale for salaried services.
## Equity compensation
### New provisions for stock option plans (SOPs) and free shares
Benefit arising from SOPs shall be exempt from salaried income taxation and will be taxed at the time of their sale as capital gains at a rate of 15%, provided they are held for at least 24 months. Should the SOPs not be held for at least 24 months, the relative income will continue to be taxed as salary income. In case SOPs relate to small start-up entities, they are taxed at a rate of 5%, provided that they are held for at least 36 months, under conditions. 
Moreover, the favourable tax treatment with the taxation of 15% applies for free shares granted to employees under incentives programs (e.g.Restricted Stock Units (RSUs),performance shares or performance units,restricted shares plan,matching shares or employee stock purchase plan, deferred stock, etc.) to the extent that are inextricably linked with the achievement of specific required performance milestones or the occurrence of an event (e.g. completion of a specific employment period). According to the new Law, the taxable event arises at the time the free shares are actually sold and not at the time of their acquisition as happened before. In addition, for free shares there is no retention period.
## Notional income
The cost of acquiring or maintaining certain assets (e.g. ownership or occupation of residence, purchase or occupation of private cars, recreation boats, construction/use/ownership of houses or swimming pools, tuition/private school fees, housekeepers [exceeding two]) give rise to deemed income, which forms the basis of taxation if this is higher than the actual declared income.
## Business income
The separate taxation of income from freelancers and sole proprietorships is abolished (_see the section_). Instead, a unified tax scale applicable to employment income, pensions, and business profits is introduced.
## Capital gains
Transfer of non-listed shares is subject to capital gain tax at the rate of 15%. Transfer of listed shares is again taxed at 15% unless specific conditions/exemptions apply, if an individual holds at least 0.5% of the share capital of the listed entity.
A transfer duty of 2‰ is imposed on the gross sale proceeds of listed shares.
## Dividend income
Dividends distributed within taxable periods commencing after 1 January 2020 including participations in profits of personal companies as well as distributions of profits from any type of legal entity are taxed via corporate withholding taxation at the flat rate of 5%.
## Interest income
Interest on deposits with banks operating in Greece and interest from Greek bonds and treasury bills are subject to income tax at the rate of 15%, and this tax is withheld at source with exhaustion of any further income tax liability. Non-residents are exempt from the WHT where the deposit is kept in foreign currency.
## Rental income
Income from real estate property is taxed at separate rates (_see the section_).

## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Non-dom regime for investors
The non-dom regime provides for an alternative way of taxing income derived abroad for individuals transferring their tax residence to Greece (non-dom), porvided that cumulatively:
  * The taxpayers were not Greek tax residents for the previous seven (7) out of the eight (8) years prior to transferring their tax residence to Greece, and
  * it can be evidenced that they invest at least EUR 500,000 in real estate, businesses, or transferable securities or shares in legal entities based in Greece, either themselves or their relatives (i.e. spouses and those in the ascending or descending line), or through a legal entity in which they hold the majority of the shares. The investment must be completed within three (3) years from the date of submission of the relevant application. 


Under this regime, individuals will pay a lump-sum tax of EUR 100,000 per tax year, irrespective of the amount of income earned abroad, for a maximum of 15 fiscal years. Moreover, it is possible to extend the regime to any of their relatives by paying an additional tax equal to EUR 20,000 per person per tax year. In such cases, the provisions of inheritance, gift, and parental grant tax will not apply.
It is noted that any tax paid abroad on income covered by the alternative taxation regime will not be offset against the tax liability of the above persons in Greece.
Furthermore, in case the persons who have opted for the non-dom regime earn taxable income that arises in Greece, this will be taxed in accordance with the general provisions of the ITC. In addition, in the event of non-payment of the full amount of the lump-sum tax, the special regime will be abolished, and these persons will be taxed for their worldwide income in accordance with the general provisions as of the tax year in question onwards.
It should be noted that taxpayers opting for the regime are not required to declare any income earned abroad. Furthermore, they will be able to justify the imputed income calculated based on deemed expenses and assets acquisition by importing funds from abroad.
The relevant application for the transfer of tax residence and for obtaining the non-dom status has to be submitted by individuals by 31 March of each tax year. Furthermore, it will be possible to apply for revocation of the non-dom status in any tax year during the 15-year period.
## Non-dom regime for pensioners
The non-dom regime provides for an alternative way of taxing income, for individuals entitled to a pension that arises abroad. The application of this regime does not affect the validity of the applicable DTTs.
Every tax year, individuals will pay tax at a rate of 7% on their foreign-sourced income, with exhaustion of the tax liability for this income. The tax is paid each tax year in one instalment until the last working day of July and cannot be offset against other tax liabilities or any credit balances.
To be eligible for this new regime, individuals must, cumulatively:
  * not have been Greek tax residents for the previous five of the six years prior to the transfer of their tax residence to Greece, and
  * transfer their tax residence from a state with which an agreement on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation with Greece is in force.


The application for the tax residence transfer and submission to this regime is submitted by the pensioner until 31 March of the respective tax year.
Pensioners subject to this regime are required to declare their income earned both in Greece and abroad. Furthermore, non-payment of the entire amount of tax due in one tax year results in the application of the general provisions of the ITC for the taxation of their global income from the relevant tax year onwards.
## Alternative taxation regime for relocated employees
A new regime for the alternative way of taxing income from salaried employment, as well as from business activity arising in Greece, for individuals transferring their tax residence to Greece has been introduced as of the year 2020.
For inclusion in this regime, and exclusively for the filling of new jobs, the individual transferring their tax residence to Greece is subject to favourable taxation for the income from salaried employment obtained in Greece, if cumulatively:
  * was not a Greek tax resident for the previous five of the six years prior to the transfer of one's tax residence to Greece
  * transfers one's tax residence from an EU member state or EEA country or from a country with which an administrative cooperation agreement in the field of taxation with Greece is in force
  * provides services in Greece in the context of an employment relationship with a Greek legal entity or with a permanent establishment (PE) of a foreign company in Greece, and
  * declares that one will remain in Greece for at least two years.


A similar application is envisaged for individuals who transfer their tax residence to Greece in order to carry out individual business activity in Greece.
If the taxpayer's application is accepted, an exemption from income tax is provided for 50% of one's employment income / income from individual business activity earned in Greece during the tax year. Furthermore, for individuals subject to the alternative taxation provisions, the annual deemed income will not apply to the amount resulting from the residence or passenger car.
The application for the transfer of the tax residence and the inclusion in the new regime is filed to the Tax Administration by the individual as follows:
  * For the commencement of service/business activities that takes place by 2 July of the year in question, the application shall be submitted by the end of that year and shall be considered for said year. If the taxpayer applies within the year following the assumption of service or commencement of operations, the application shall be considered for the taxpayer's inclusion in the special tax regime for the year following the assumption of service.
  * For an assumption of service or commencement of operations that takes place after 2 July of the year of relocation, the application shall be submitted by the end of the following year and shall be considered for the taxpayer's inclusion for that year.


The provisions on alternative taxation shall apply to the income of the tax year for which the individual files one's application and expires after a total of seven tax years, with no possibility of further extension.
## Tax incentives to angel investors
Starting from the tax year 2025, new tax incentives are introduced for individuals (angel investors) investing capital in duly registered start-up companies or in Closed Ended Funds (AKES), with the maximum investment limit being raised from 300,000 euros to 900,000 euros, allocated to amaximum of three (3) different startups or Funds and up tothe amount of EUR 300 000 per startup. To qualify as an angel investor, an individual must be tax resident of Greece or abroad and holds a Greek Tax Identification Number. The startupsreceiving the investmentmustberegisteredwith the "ElevateGreece" platform.
The said incentive consists in the deduction from taxable income of up to 50% of the investment proportionally per income category for the tax year in which the investment was made. 
The capital contribution is mandatorily executed though a bank deposit.
If after an audit it is proved that the capital contribution has been made to obtain a tax advantage that defeats the purpose of the provision (i.e. the provision of investment funds and support during the early stages of operation of a start-up in order to increase investment activity), a fine, equal to the amount of the tax benefit sought, will be imposed.
## New start-up investor residence permit
The new provisions enable citizens from non-EU countries to obtain a special residence permit by investing in Greek startup companies.
Starting January 1, 2025, individuals who invest a minimum of 250,000 euros in a startup listed in the National Startup Registry will be eligible forthis permit. The investment can be made through the acquisition of shares during a capital increase or bonds upon issue of a bond loan.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
The general rule considered for the determination of an individual’s tax residence status is one’s physical presence in Greece in any 12-month period.
Apart from the actual number of days the taxpayer and/or family spends in Greece, the other crucial factor that can be used for the determination of an individual's tax residence is the centre of one’s ‘vital interests’.
The provisions of a Circular issued by the Independent Authority for Public Revenues (AADE) in Greece, offers guidance on the interpretation of ‘vital interests’ concerning tax residency. The Circular clarifies that elements such as permanent residence, habitual abode, and the individual's overall personal and economic connections are considered when determining their tax residency status. Furthermore, it specifies that the 'centre of vital interests' is assessed by evaluating all personal and economic relationships that connect an individual to a particular location,considering the specific circumstances of each case comprehensively.
Notwithstanding the above, an individual’s tax residence status is also determined on the basis of the provisions of a bilateral Double Tax Treaty (DTT) concluded between the contracting states (i.e. country of origin/home and Greece) where applicable.

## Social security contributions
Social security contributions are due on salary and benefits in cash or in kind granted by an employer to its employees, with the exception of specifically enumerated extraordinary benefits of social character (e.g. marriage gifts, birth gifts). More specifically,as per the benefits in kind, said benefits might only be exempted from social security contributions,as lond as they are offered:
i) voluntarily by the employer and for the better serving of the employer's operational need, also contributing to the increase of the employees' productivity and the better quality of the employee's workplace,or
ii) they constitute a measure adopted for the hygiene and safety of the employees, as well as 
iii) they are offered personally to the employees and not in cash.
The imposition of social security contributions depends on the social security fund in which the employee is registered.
As of 01.01.2025,the social security contributions will amount to 13.37% at the level of the employee and contributed at 21.79% at the level of the employer,i.e. totally 35.16%. The monthly social security contribution cap for EFKA is set at 7,572.62 from 1 January 2025.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The VAT rate is 24%. The reduced rate on basic necessities is 13%. A super reduced rate of 6% is also available for certain items. _See the section in the Corporate tax summary for more information_.
## Uniform Tax on the Ownership of Real Estate Property (ENFIA)
The ENFIA applies to all types of real estate rights, including full ownership, usufruct, occupancy and surface rights on all real estate properties in Greece (principal tax). The supplementary tax on individuals was abolished by the provisions of L. 4916/2022 for the year 2022 onwards and replaced by an increase of the principal tax ranging from 5% to 20% according to the total value of the immovable property if it exceeds EUR 500,000.
Specifically, ENFIA is determined based on the data of real estate property of the previous year and respective changes occured, as indicated on the 1st January of the next year of the Real Estate Property Declaration (Specific Form E9).
The principal tax on buildings is calculated by multiplying the square metres of the building by the principal tax ranging from EUR 2 to EUR 16.20 per square metre and other coefficients affecting the value of the property (e.g. location, use).
The principal tax on land is calculated by multiplying the square metres of the land by the principal tax ranging from EUR 0.0037 to EUR 9.2500 per square metre and other coefficients affecting the value of the property (e.g. location, use).
Pursuant the provisions of the new tax law 5162/2024, starting from the year 2025, the Unified Property Tax (ENFIA) for insured individuals' residences will be reduced by 20%, provided that the taxable value of the property does not exceed 500,000 euros. If the property's value exceeds this threshold, the reduction remains at 10%. To qualify for this exemption, the insurance must cover the previous year and have a minimum duration of three months. If the insurance duration is less than one year, the real estate tax reduction will be applied proportionally. 
## Inheritance Tax
Pursuant to the Greek tax legislation, Inheritance Tax is assessed on the current value of the property inherited. The said property includes any kind of movable and immovable property located in Greece, regardless of the descendant’s nationality. The taxable value of real estate property inherited is the 'objective value' (it is calculated on the basis of certain predetermined factors set by the Ministry of Finance) on the day of death of the deceased. Immovable assets located abroad are not subject to Greek Inheritance Tax, regardless of nationality and residency.
The tax rates are graduated and vary considerably, depending on the relationship between the deceased (inherited person) and the heir. Tax rates are based on a progressive scale. Relevant rates depend on the parties’ relationship (grade of relation, etc., and certain other factors - e.g. disabilities of the beneficiary); such rates range from 1% to 40%, while there is a tax-free amount (which depends on the proximity of the relationship). As a general rule, the closer the relationship the lower the tax rate. For example, in case of inheritance realised by individuals to their spouses or children (i.e. subject to A' category of the progressive scale), the respective rates range from 1% to 10%, while the tax-free amount is up to EUR 150,000.
Indicatively, the above mentioned tax category Α’ includes spouses, children, grandchildren, parents, and grandparents, category Β’ includes children from a spouse’s former marriage, parents-in-law, brothers, uncles, nephews etc., and category C’ includes distant relatives and non-relatives (blood or affinity relatives other than those referred to in the above-mentioned categories A’ and B’) as well as third parties.
Value (EUR) | Tax rate (%) | Tax (EUR) | Total value (EUR) | Total tax (EUR)  
---|---|---|---|---  
**Category A'**(a. the spouse, b. the children, c. the grandchildren, d. the parents, etc.)

Above | 40  
## Donation tax and parental grant
Donation tax and parental grant (i.e. transfer of assets while the transferor is alive) are assessed on the current value of the property donated. Taxable property includes any kind of movable and immovable property located in Greece. The tax rates are graduated and vary considerably, depending on the relationship between donor and donee. In general, tax liabilities arise upon receipt of gifts and are paid by the donee. The acquisition of real estate property through donation is subject to the same tax scale as inheritance tax. The respective tax return should be submitted to the competent Greek tax office before the signing of the contract.
In case of parental grants (i.e. donation between each parent and each child), the respective tax is imposed on the basis of the same tax progressive scale for category A’ (ranging from 1% to 10%), whereas a tax free amount of EUR 800,000 is provided by law.
## Real estate transfer tax (Law 1587/1950)
Each transfer of real estate, which is not subject to VAT, is subject to real estate transfer tax. The real estate transfer tax is imposed at a rate of 3% on the taxable value of the property. Moreover, on the amount of main transfer tax is imposed an extra tax of 3% in favour of municipalities and communities.
## Other duties
### Municipality Duty (called Telos Akinitis Periousias or TAP)
The real estate ownership is subject to a Municipality Duty. The said duty is levied and collected annually through the electricity bill in favour of municipalities and communities at a currently calculated rate ranging between 0.25‰ and 0.35‰ on the real estate’s objective value (i.e. multiplying the real estate’s square metres by the specific value per square metre, depending on the area where the real estate property is situated [i.e. determined by the Ministry of Finance], and further multiplied by the rate deriving from the building age).
### Duty for the provision of cleaning and lighting services
A duty in compensation for the collection of garbage and waste and for the lighting of the streets, collected by the electricity bill, is due from the user of real estate. According to the relevant law provisions, these duties are calculated by multiplying the real estate’s square metres by a certain rate determined by the municipal council.
## Tax on electrified spaces
The Municipal Council may levy a tax on real estate connected to the grid, the collection of which is effected through the electricity bill. The tax is calculated by multiplying the real estate’s square metres by a rate determined by the municipal or community council ranging between EUR 0.018 and EUR 0.073. The said rate can be increased every year up to 20%.
