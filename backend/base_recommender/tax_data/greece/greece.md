# Greece
## Overview
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
Greece is a parliamentary republic along the Mediterranean Sea in Southeastern Europe. It is bordered by Bulgaria, the Republic of North Macedonia, and Albania to the north; the Ionian Sea to the west; the Mediterranean Sea to the south; and the Aegean Sea and Turkey to the east. The capital of Greece is Athens, the official language is Greek, and the currency is the euro (EUR).
Greece achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1829. During the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, it gradually added neighbouring islands and territories, most with Greek-speaking populations. Since the 'Kallikratis' programme reform entered into effect on 1 January 2011, Greece consists of 13 peripheries subdivided into a total of 332 municipalities. The implementation of the programme realised the administrative restructuring of the country. Moreover, the systems of controlling the legality of the actions of the local government authorities, as well as the public financial control of local governments, were further enhanced.
Greece joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1952. In 1981, Greece joined the European Community (EC) (now the European Union or EU). It became the 12th member of the European Economic and Monetary Union in 2001.
