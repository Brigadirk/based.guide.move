## **VAT exemption on certain e-commerce financial transaction services**
The General Department of Taxation (GDT) issued letter No. 29613 to confirm to the Associations of Banks and Microfinance that certain e-commerce financial transaction services are considered non-taxable supplies. They are summarised as follows:
  1. Expenses on education, training, relevant study documents and educational documents in electronic form (e.g. electronic documents, books, videos) supplied by educational institutions officially recognised by the countries where the institutions are established.


  1. Overseas lawyer service fee expenses supplied by law firms.
  2. Independent director fee expenses.
  3. Expenses on risk rating assessment services provided by Moody, S&P or Fitch, the agencies recognised by the National Bank of Cambodia.
  4. Monthly fees, bank charges and TT fees and charges related to money settlement transactions, money transfers or inward remittance services for customers or the bank itself from overseas banks.
  5. Expenses on overseas transfers for customers.
  6. Expenses on transactions to obtain overseas loans (e.g. interest and other charges by the lenders).
  7. Direct expenses incurred for money transfers charged by SWIFT or BOTTOMLINE. Annual fees for system usage, license, royalty or system maintenance paid to SWIFT or BOTTOMLINE are subject to VAT on e-commerce transactions.
  8. Direct expenses incurred for settlement transactions via credit or debit card and cash withdrawal services from ATM charged by Visa, Mastercard, Union Pay, UPI, AMEX or JCB company. Annual fees for system usage, license, royalty or system maintenance paid to Visa, Mastercard, Union Pay, UPI, AMEX, or JCB companies are subject to VAT on e-commerce transactions.


  1. Customer’s expense for staying at VIP lounge in airports in other countries is not non-taxable supply and not subject to VAT on E-commerce transactions.


The above confirmation is not retroactive for tax amounts already paid.
## **Clarification of 1) tax relief for a rent-free period during construction, improvements or reparation and 2) claimable input VAT credit on mobile phone service charges used for business purposes**
At the GDT and Private Sector Tax Working Group meeting on 4 July 2024, the private sector raised various points for discussion, including the following.
  * Rent-free period provided by landlord


During the rent-free period provided by the landlords for the lessees to prepare for construction, improvements or reparation, the GDT agreed that the relevant taxes, including income tax, VAT or withholding tax, are not applicable as long as those period and purposes are stated clearly in the lease contracts. Income or expenses were recognised by the relevant parties during that period. The GDT will prepare regulations to clarify further.
  * VAT input credit for mobile phone charges


The GDT agreed that VAT charges on mobile phone services are allowed to claim the input VAT credit as long as the charges are used for business purposes and there is sufficient evidence (e.g. records of the mobile phones as the company’s assets) to support it. The GDT will prepare regulations to clarify further.
## **Some other tax incentive measures**
On 22 August 2024, Prime Minister Samdech Thipadei made a special announcement (statement) to continue providing support, including tax incentives for certain business sectors. We summarise the key tax incentives as follows:
  1. Extension of capital gains tax (CGT) exemption for real estate business until the end of 2025. At this stage, it is still unclear whether the extension applies to capital gains arising from other investments (e.g. share disposals).
  2. Exempt penalty and interest for voluntarily filing amended tax returns until the end of June 2025.
  3. Extensions of other tax incentives for specific sectors such as tourism in Siem Reap province, agriculture, and education.


The relevant regulations will be issued later. 
## **Establishment of special tax audit unit under the General Department of Taxation (GDT) of the Ministry of Economy and Finance**
The Cambodian Government issued a sub-decree to establish a special tax audit unit under the supervision of the GDT of the Ministry of Economy and Finance on 16 July 2024. The unit’s rank is equal to the GDT’s department level. The purpose of the newly established unit is to advance and speed up resolutions to taxpayers’ problems with tax audits, to improve the business and investment environment in Cambodia.
The key roles and responsibilities of the unit include:
  * managing and performing tax audit work in accordance with existing laws and the standard operating procedures for tax audits
  * verifying documents and performing risk analyses for one-time comprehensive tax audits without going through desk audits or limited audits
  * preparing annual tax audit planning
  * performing tax audits upon taxpayers’ requests, and
  * informing enterprises of the reasons they’re selected for a comprehensive tax audit.


The special tax audit unit can ask the Director General of the GDT to review and resolve outstanding issues in the tax audits of the enterprises it oversees, working together with other GDT units. 
Enterprises that may be transferred under the supervision of this special tax audit unit include those that have received a Gold Tax Compliance Certificate and other enterprises determined by a committee to be established by the GDT.
## Reduction of withholding tax (WHT) and specific tax (SPT) rates for airline companies
The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) issued Instruction 009 to provide the following instructions for implementing WHT and SPT to relieve airline companies’ tax burden on the lease of aircrafts from foreign companies and the burden of people travelling by air.
  * The WHT rate will change from 14% to 10% on the aircraft lease from foreign companies by domestic airline companies.
  * The SPT rate will change from 10% to 5% on air transport service of passengers, regardless of the service provided by domestic or foreign airline companies.
  * These reductions will last for three years, from 1 June 2024 to 31 May 2027.


## Standard operating procedures for tax audits (SOP for tax audits)
The Cambodian tax authorities have issued a tax audit SOP to guide tax officers in managing the tax audit process. This SOP aims to prevent different departments from creating duplicate tax audits.
## Income tax incentives for the expansion of qualified investment projects (QIPs)
The MEF issued Prakas 313 dated 10 May 2024 to provide further guidelines for income tax incentives for the expansion of QIPs as stated in Article 16 of Sub-Decree 139 on Implementation of the Investment Law in Cambodia.
The income tax exemption is provided for the below expansion of QIPs:
  * Expansion of existing production.
  * Expansion through product line diversification within the same lines.
  * Expansion through equipping new technologies for improvement of productivity and environment protection.
  * Other expansion activities to be approved by the government.


The expansion of the QIP is entitled to a specific period of income tax exemption in line with initial investment activities, which ranges from three to nine years depending on the sectors and investment activities as stated in the annex of Sub-Decree 139.
The qualified expansion is limited only to additional investment capital paid each year and used for construction materials and new production equipment (excluding the value of land and working capital).
## Tax for public lighting (TPL)
The Royal Government of Cambodia has issued a Sub-Decree to determine the TPL rate for the supply of alcoholic or tobacco products in Cambodia.
Effective from 1 April 2024, the TPL rate for the supply of alcoholic or tobacco products will be 5%.
Detailed rules and procedures for managing the TPL collection will be determined by a Prakas of the MEF.​
## Amendment to SPT rates for domestically produced non-alcoholic drinks
Effective from 1 September 2023, the SPT rates for domestically produced and supplied non-alcoholic drinks will be as follows:
  * 1) 15% SPT rate for all types of energy drinks.
  * 2) 5% SPT rate for certain non-alcoholic drinks, including: 
    * flavoured UHT milk-based drinks
    * soya milk drinks
    * coconut water-based drinks
    * coffee-based drinks or coffee flavoured drinks, and
    * non-aerated beverages ready for immediate consumption without dilution.
  * 3) 10% SPT rate for all other non-alcoholic drinks not mentioned above.


The SPT calculation base will follow Prakas 012 MEF.BrK dated 14 January 2020 on the amendment to the SPT base for certain locally produced goods.
## Implementation of value-added tax (VAT) on imported cigarettes 
With the Samdech Prime Minister’s endorsement, the MEF issued Instruction 017 on the implementation of VAT on imported cigarettes. It stipulates the following: 
  * For all cigarettes imported for sales or redistribution in the domestic Cambodian market, enterprises must collect 10% VAT on them. Input VAT paid at the time of import or on local cigarette purchases is allowed as a VAT credit that can be offset against output VAT.
  * For cigarettes imported for export purposes, enterprises must only pay VAT once at the time of importation.
  * Enterprises must submit tax returns and pay taxes in accordance with laws and regulations in force.


This Instruction will be effective from 1 August 2023.
## Instruction on advance income tax payments on dividend distributions
The instruction sets out the following guidelines:
### Tax base for advance income tax payments on dividend distributions
In the current taxable year, if an enterprise distributes dividends derived from different sources of income that are subject to different annual income tax rates, the enterprise must comply with the following rules:
  * For a QIP: 
    * Dividends must be paid out of the retained earnings that have been subject to annual income tax at 0%.
    * Dividends must be paid out of the retained earnings that have been subject to the following progressive income tax exemption rates: 
      * 25% for the first two years.
      * 50% for the next two years.
      * 75% for the last two years.
    * Dividends must be paid out of the retained earnings that have been subject to the annual income tax rates of 20% or 30%.
    * Dividends must be paid out of the company’s income earned in the current tax year that hasn’t been subject to annual income tax yet.
  * For non-QIPs that are subject to 20% or 30% income tax:
    * Dividends must be paid out of the retained earnings that have been subject to annual income tax payment at the rates of 20% or 30%.
    * Dividends must be paid out of the income earned during the current tax year that hasn’t been subject to annual income tax yet.


### Advance income tax payments on dividend distributions
Advance income tax payments on dividend distributions are determined as follows:
  * If an enterprise needs to distribute dividends to local or foreign shareholders, the enterprise must pay income tax in advance if it hasn’t paid annual income tax yet. The tax amount will be equal to the multiple of grossed-up dividends according to their annual income tax rates. The tax paid can be an income tax credit and offset against the annual income tax when it’s due for filing. If the tax credit amount exceeds the annual income tax due, the exceeded amount can be carried forward and offset against income tax liabilities in following years.
  * Advance income tax payments on dividend distributions are not applicable to QIPs during the income tax holiday period. This includes the accumulated retained earnings earned during tax holidays before 2020.
  * After the tax holidays, QIPs that are still entitled to tax incentives to pay income tax on a progressive basis and distribute dividends out of income that hasn’t been subject to annual income tax, income tax must be paid in advance based on these income tax portions: 25% for the first two years, 50% for the next two years, and 75% for the last two years.


## Updated VAT instruction on eCommerce
The General Department of Taxation (GDT) has issued Instruction No. 2520, dated 24 January 2023, on the reverse-VAT charge. This replaces Instruction No. 20522, dated 8 December 2021. The contents of both instructions are largely the same, except for these changes that may have an impact on your company:
  * Non-resident parent companies or head offices that only supply digital goods/services, or carry out eCommerce transactions for subsidiaries or branches in Cambodia, don't need to register for the simplified VAT system with the GDT. However, their local subsidiaries or branches need to notify the GDT of their supplies.
  * Non-resident suppliers who are registered under the simplified VAT system must file VAT returns and disclose their customers' TIN numbers, entity names, and bank account numbers in Cambodia. In the previous instruction, customers needed to make payments from their bank accounts for these to be considered business-to-business (B2B) transactions. This requirement has been removed.
  * For B2B transactions, a credit note issued by a non-resident supplier is allowed to adjust the taxable amount.
  * The instruction will be effective 60 days after its issue date stated above. 


## Insurance technical reserves
The MEF has issued Prakas No. 063 to provide guidelines on calculating the technical reserves of companies in the insurance industry in Cambodia. These guidelines are to be used for income tax computation purposes. Failure to maintain sufficient insurance technical reserves, to submit a quarterly technical reserve report, as well as prepare an annual report on insurance premium computing recommendations by the stipulated deadlines, will result in penalties based on this Prakas and current tax laws and regulations.
For 12 months from the date of this Prakas, the previous calculation method for technical reserves can still be used by insurance companies.
## Use of official exchange rates for taxpayers under the self-declaration regime
The GDT has revised the use of the official exchange rates as follows:
### The daily official exchange rate
Taxpayers shall use the official exchange rate issued daily by the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) or a market exchange rate, but it must not be lower than the NBC’s official daily exchange rate for Cambodian riel for the total price of the invoice. If there are specific days or other times that the NBC doesn’t issue its official exchange rate, taxpayers will use the official exchange rate that the NBC issued one day prior.
Non-resident taxpayers who register for simplified VAT are not required to use Cambodian riel for the total price of the invoice.​ For preparing tax returns in Cambodian riel and calculating VAT to be paid, non-resident taxpayers shall use monthly official exchange rates (_see below_).
### Official exchange rate for tax on salary
Taxpayers will use the official exchange rate issued by the NBC on the 15th day of each month when calculating salary tax. If the 15th day of each month falls on a day the NBC doesn’t issue its official exchange rate, taxpayers will use the NBC’s official exchange rate issued one day prior.
### Monthly official exchange rate
Taxpayers will use the official exchange rate issued by the NBC on the last day of each month to calculate monthly tax payments for supplies by non-resident taxpayers who have registered for simplified VAT or any transaction without Cambodian riel on an invoice, such as transactions supplied by a person not under the self-declaration regime or a non-resident.
### Annual official exchange rate
Taxpayers will use the official exchange rate issued by the NBC on the last day of December of each year for which the annual tax returns are prepared and annual tax payments are calculated.
This new Instruction will be effective from the date of its signature. Instruction No. 10362 GDT, dated 17 May 2022, on using official exchange rates for taxpayers under the self-declaration regime will be abrogated.
## VAT state-charge for basic daily food items
The MEF issued Prakas 009 to determine that VAT on certain basic food items for the people’s daily living shall be borne by the state for the next two years.
Under this Prakas, ‘basic food’ refers to certain food necessary for the daily living, such as the following:
  * Meat from domesticated animals: cattle, buffalos, goats, sheep, pigs, chickens, and ducks, whether the meat is fresh, cured, or smoked.
  * Eggs from all kinds of domesticated animals, whether the eggs are fresh, cured, or smoked.
  * All kinds of freshwater and marine (saltwater) fish, lobsters, shrimps, prawns, crabs, and all kinds of molluscs, whether fresh, cured, or smoked.
  * All kinds of sugar, which are not characterised as candy.
  * All kinds of salt.
  * All kinds of fish sauce and soy sauce.


The VAT on domestic supplies of these basic foods will be considered as a state-charge for the two years from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2023.
Under this Prakas, food supplied by restaurants shall be excluded from the above.
## E-document submission system
The GDT has cancelled the E-document facility from 10 January 2023.
## Capital gains tax
The MEF issued Prakas No. 346 to implement capital gains tax on sale or transfer of immovable property, leases, investment assets, goodwill, intellectual property (IP), and foreign currencies. The tax rate on capital gains is flat at 20%.
### Calculation of the capital gains tax
For immovable property, the tax authorities provide a choice where the taxpayer can claim a standard tax deduction of 80% of the taxable income or actual expenses with supporting documents. For capital gain from sale or transfer of other assets, taxpayers must claim tax deduction based on actual expenses incurred.
Taxpayers must submit tax returns and pay capital gains tax to the GDT within three months after realising the capital gain. 
Under this Prakas, the capital gains tax would have been effective from 1 July 2020. However, the RGC has announced the delay of implementation of the capital gains tax until the end of 2025.


# Cambodia
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 19 September 2024
## Taxable period
The standard tax year is the calendar year, although different accounting year-ends may be granted upon application.
## Tax returns
The return for annual taxes (i.e. CIT or MT) is to be filed annually, within three months of tax year-end.
Returns for monthly taxes (e.g. 1% prepayments of CIT, WHT, ToS or ToFB, SPT, and accommodation tax) are to be filed monthly, within 20 days of the following month. The deadline will be extended to the next working day if the 20th day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or public holiday.
## Payment of tax
CIT or MT is due for payment three months after tax year-end. The CIT or MT liability can be reduced by prepayment of CIT payments.
Monthly taxes are due for payment by the 20th day of the succeeding month. The deadline will be extended to the next working day if the 20th day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or public holiday.
### Prepayment of CIT
A prepayment of CIT equal to 1% of monthly turnover inclusive of all taxes, except VAT, is required to be paid on a monthly basis. The prepayment can be offset against the annual CIT liability and the MT.
Where a taxpayer is in the period of CIT holiday, the taxpayer is also exempted from the prepayment obligations. However, a nil monthly return will need to be lodged.
Where a taxpayer is not subject to MT, a monthly prepayment of CIT must still be made. However, unutilised prepayments from a prior year can be used to offset the current amount due, and no physical payment may be required.
## Tax audit process
There are two types of tax audit in Cambodia (i.e. limited and comprehensive tax audits). Initially, the tax authorities will send a notification letter to the taxpayer informing them of a tax audit. During the tax audit process, tax auditors visit the taxpayers’ office to review the documents and discuss any potential tax issues with the taxpayers and may request supporting evidence. After the visit to the taxpayer’s office, the tax auditors issue a notice of tax reassessment (NoTR), which indicates the reassessed tax liabilities and the basis of their tax reassessment. If the taxpayers agree with the reassessed tax liabilities, they can proceed with the payment. If not, the taxpayers have to submit an objection letter to the tax authorities within 30 days of the receipt of the NoTR.
### **Standard operating procedures for tax audits (SOP for tax audits)**
The Cambodian tax authorities have issued a tax audit SOP to guide tax officers in managing the tax audit process. This SOP aims to prevent different departments from creating duplicate tax audits.
## Statute of limitations
The tax audit period (i.e. the limitation of the period within which the tax authorities can perform tax audits) is as follows:
  * Within three or five years of the date of submission of the tax returns.
  * More than five years with prior approval from the Minister of Economy and Finance.
  * Any time with the written consent of the taxpayers.


## Topics of focus for tax authorities
In practice, the tax authorities focus the tax reassessment on various matters, including payment to third parties overseas, fringe benefits provided to employees, and related party transactions (e.g. payment of management fee to head office, loans from shareholders).


# Cambodia
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 19 September 2024
Resident taxpayers include companies organised, managed, or having their principal place of business in Cambodia.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
A non-resident company may be deemed to have a PE in Cambodia if (i) there is a permanent place or entity through which the non-resident persons carry on their business, (ii) there is an exercise of the authority to conclude a contract on behalf of a foreign entity, or (iii) business activities exceed certain time periods in Cambodia.
A person may be considered as a PE of a foreign entity if the person has and regularly exercises the authority to conclude contracts in Cambodia on behalf of a foreign enterprise or facilitate to have a contract signed.
Factors to be considered in determining a PE include a place of management, an agent or office, a warehouse or factory, a workshop, any place of extraction of natural resources, a plantation, etc. Carrying out projects (e.g. supervisory activities of a construction project, provision of services) exceeding a time period of six months in any 12-month period may also be considered as having a PE.


# Cambodia
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 19 September 2024
## Depreciation and amortisation
Property should be depreciated at rates according to four classes of assets as specified in the tax legislation. Land is not considered a depreciable asset. The straight-line or the declining-balance method is specifically required to be used for each class of assets.
Assets | Method | Rate (%)  
---|---|---  
Building and structures | Straight line | 5  
Computers, electronic information systems, and data handling equipment | Declining balance | 50  
Automobiles, trucks, office furniture, and equipment | Declining balance | 25  
All other tangible property | Declining balance | 20  
Expenditures on intangible property are amortisable over the life of the property or at 10% _per annum_.
### Special depreciation
A Qualified Investment Project (QIP) will be entitled to a 40% special depreciation in the first year of purchase or, if later, the first year the assets are used. However, the special depreciation will only apply to assets used in 'manufacturing and processing' (still to be defined) and only if the taxpayer has elected not to use a tax holiday. A clawback provision exists for assets held for less than four years.
## Goodwill
Purchased goodwill is a depreciable intangible fixed asset for CIT purposes. If the useful life of the intangible fixed assets can be determined, the annual depreciation charges shall be calculated on the useful life by using the straight-line method. If the useful life cannot be determined, the annual depreciation rate of 10% shall be used.
## Start-up expenses
Preliminary and formation expenses are allowed to be fully deducted in the period in which the expenses arise, or they can be amortised over two years.
## Interest expenses
Interest deductibility in any year is limited to the amount of interest income plus 50% of the net profits excluding interest income and interest expense. The excess non-deductible interest expense can be carried forward to the following tax years indefinitely.
Based on the GDT’s instruction, the tax authorities set maximum interest rates for loans from third parties (i.e. 120% of the market interest rate at the time of obtaining the loan) and loans from related persons (i.e. the market interest rate at the time of obtaining the loan). If the interest rate is higher than the maximum interest rate, the surplus interest expense is not deductible.
## Bad debt
A loss on a claim (i.e. bad debt) is deductible where the impossibility to recover the loss can be clearly shown and that claim has been written off from the accounting books, except where the giving up of the claim is an ‘abnormal act of management’ (still to be defined).
## Charitable contributions
The charitable contribution expense is deductible to the extent the amount does not exceed 5% of taxable income. The taxpayer must have proper evidence supporting the payments.
## Fines and penalties
Additional tax, late tax payment interest, and fines of all types incurred for the violation of various legal provisions are not deductible.
## Taxes
Taxes that are not a charge to the enterprise (e.g. WHT, ToS, ToFB, CIT, and additional CIT on dividend distribution) are not deductible.
## Loss between related parties
No deduction is available for certain losses incurred on dealings between 51% commonly owned parties.
## Net operating losses
Taxpayers may carry forward their losses for five years. The carryback of losses is not permitted. There is no provision for any form of consolidated filing or group loss relief.
To be eligible to carry forward tax losses, a taxpayer must not change its business activities.
If a taxpayer received a unilateral tax reassessment from the GDT, a taxpayer will not be able to utilise the tax losses brought forward in the year of reassessment.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
An expense payable to a related party that is not paid within 180 days of the year-end will not be deductible. A deduction can be claimed in the year in which the payments are made. This rule is not applicable for an outlay or expense for inventory, capital property, and depreciable property.


# Cambodia
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 19 September 2024
There is no specific provision for group taxation in Cambodia.
## Transfer pricing
On 10 October 2017, the MEF issued Prakas No. 986 to provide ‘rules and procedures on income and expense allocation among related parties’ (known as the ‘Local Transfer Pricing Rules’), which is effective immediately.
The Prakas defines the transfer price as ‘the price of goods, services, or property charged between related parties’. Transfer pricing refers to setting the value of transactions (e.g. the sale or purchase of goods or services, royalties, or interest) between related parties using the most appropriate transfer pricing methodology. If the transactions aren’t at arm’s length, the tax authority may adjust the value and impose taxes accordingly.
The purpose of transfer pricing rules is typically to make sure related entities compensate each other appropriately in an amount that is commensurate with the value of property transferred or services provided and to prevent entities from manipulating profits between related parties to minimise tax exposure.
We’ve summarised key information from the Prakas, including the definition of related party, acceptable transfer pricing methodologies, and the required documentation, below.
### Related party definition
The Prakas defines ‘related party’ as a relative of the taxpayer or an enterprise that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the taxpayer. The term ‘control’ means ownership of 20% or more of the equity interest in the enterprise or voting power of the board of directors.
### Transfer pricing methodologies
The acceptable methodologies for determining arm’s-length pricing under the Prakas are those endorsed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in the Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations. The five methodologies are described below:
Transfer pricing method | How it works | When to use it  
---|---|---  
Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP) | The CUP method compares the price charged for goods or services transferred in a controlled transaction to the price charged for property or services transferred in a comparable uncontrolled transaction. | The CUP method is generally the most direct and reliable way to measure an arm’s-length result for the same property in substantially the same circumstances as the controlled transaction. But it can be difficult to find a transaction that is similar enough that no differences have a material effect on the price.  
Resale Price (RP) | The RP method determines the arm’s-length price by deducting an appropriate gross margin for the activities of the reseller from the actual resale price. | RP is the easiest method to use if the distributors do not add significant value to the product transferred.  
Cost Plus (CP) | The arm’s length price is determined by adding an appropriate mark-up to the cost of the product or service. | The CP method is most useful for sales of semi-finished goods, joint facility agreements, long-term buy-and-supply arrangements, and the provision of services.  
Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM) | The TNMM compares the net profit margin relative to an appropriate base (e.g. costs, sales, or assets) that a taxpayer realises from a controlled transaction to an appropriate base. It is similar to the CP and RP methods but at the net profit margin level. | The TNMM applies to cases where one of the parties contributes unique intangibles, while the other party does not make any unique contribution.  
Profit Split Method (PSM) | The PSM establishes transfer pricing by dividing the profits of a multinational company in a way that would be expected of independent companies in a joint-venture relationship. Independent companies would split the combined profit in proportion to the value of their respective contributions to the generation of profit in the transaction. | The PSM is the most appropriate method in cases where both parties to a transaction make unique and valuable contributions to the transactions.  
### Transfer pricing documentation
Entities that transact with related parties must prepare and maintain transfer pricing documentation setting out related-party transactions and the transfer pricing methodologies used to justify an arm’s-length value. Documents related to the transactions, such as invoices, must also be kept for ten years from the tax year end.
Entities must also disclose related-party transactions when filing their annual CIT return and provide relevant transfer pricing documents if required by the tax authority.
## Thin capitalisation
There is no provision for thin capitalisation in Cambodia. However, there are various rules and restrictiosn for tax deductions of interest expenses (_see the section_).
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There is no provision for CFCs in Cambodia.


# Cambodia
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 19 September 2024

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 19 September 2024
## Foreign tax credit
Residents earning foreign-sourced income can receive credits for foreign taxes paid.
## Inbound investment
The Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC) can be approached for a one-stop service to register a project and obtain approval for a QIP status. CDC licensing is, however, not mandatory (except for certain large, politically sensitive projects) and is applicable to those projects that do not fall within the 'negative list'. There are detailed criteria of the 'negative list', which are generally small-size investment in agriculture, service, industrial, and infrastructure sectors. 
The current investment incentives that are applicable to the QIP registered with the CDC include a CIT exemption period from three to nine years based on investment activity categories, or special depreciation (_see Special depreciation in the section_) and import duty exemptions. Not all QIPs will be entitled to all incentives.
In addition, after the expiry of the full income tax exemption, a QIP is still entitled to a partial income tax exemption for the next six years, including:
  * Payment of only 25% of total income tax liabilities for the first two years after the expiry of a full income tax exemption period.
  * Payment of only 50% of total income tax liabilities for the second two years.
  * Payment of only 75% of total income tax liabilities for the third two years.


Investment projects are required to submit a half-year and annual report to the CDC / the Provincial/Municipal Investment Sub-committee (PMIS) within 20 days after the closing date of tax return submission to guarantee its investment incentives. After receiving the half-year and annual report from the investors, the CDC/PMIS will issue a Certificate of Compliance (CoC) to the investors. The CoC is intended to provide confirmation that the QIP has acted in compliance with the relevant tax regulations.
## Tax incentives in the securities sector
The Royal Government of Cambodia issued this new Sub-Decree to grant tax incentives to companies/enterprises listed on the Cambodian Stock Exchange (CSX) for the first time, and to public investors (residents and non-residents) who hold or trade in government, equity, or debt securities on the securities market.
Under the Sub-Decree, the tax incentives include:
  1. A 50% reduction of the annual CIT liability for the first three years or for any period approved by the MEF.
  2. Tax liability waivers: Initially, listed companies/enterprises are entitled to tax liability waivers of full CIT, WHT, VAT, specific tax on certain merchandise and services, accommodation tax, and public lighting tax (liabilities for a certain number of years before being initially listed on the CSX).
  3. WHT incentives: Public investors are entitled to a 50% reduction of the WHT payable on interest and/or dividend received from holding and/or trading in government, equity, or debt securities within three years, starting from the effective date of this Sub-Decree.


Annual tax liability reduction or waivers in points (i) and (ii) above are not applied to Qualified Investment Project (QIP) companies during the tax holiday. Other companies/enterprises that have already been listed on the CSX, but haven’t received tax incentives yet, are also entitled to tax incentives such as in point (i) above.
There are some conditions (i.e. where companies/enterprises fail to file annual and monthly tax returns and pay taxes on time, do not allow tax authorities to audit accounting records or other documents, or do not pay taxes, additional tax, and interest) that mean the GDT can ask the MEF to forfeit the tax incentives that were initially granted to those listed companies/enterprises.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 19 September 2024
WHT needs to be withheld on payments made by residents (and it seems only to those who fall under the self-declaration regime). The withheld tax constitutes a final tax when withheld in respect of resident and non-residents.
The types of payments caught are as follows.
## WHT on payment to residents
  * Interest: 15% (except payment to a Cambodian-registered bank or financial institution).
  * Royalties: 15%.
  * Rental: 10%.
  * Services: 15% (except payments to a registered taxpayer and supported by a valid VAT invoice).


## WHT on payment to non-residents
Under the Law on Financial Management 2017, which is effective from 1 January 2017 onwards, any resident taxpayer carrying on a business, including a PE of a non-resident person, who pays any Cambodian-source income as defined under Article 33 of the Law on Taxation to a non-resident taxpayer must withhold tax at 14% of the amount paid. WHT does not apply to property or risk reinsurance premiums in Cambodia.
According to Article 33 of the Law on Taxation, Cambodian-source income includes:
  * Interest paid by a resident enterprise, resident pass-through, or a governmental institution of Cambodia.
  * Dividends distributed by a resident enterprise.
  * Income from services performed in Cambodia.
  * Compensation for management and technical services paid by a resident person.
  * Income from movable or immovable property, if the property is situated in Cambodia.
  * Royalties from the use, or right to use, intangible property paid by a resident person or paid by a non-resident person through a PE maintained in Cambodia.
  * Gain from the sale of immovable property located in Cambodia or from the transfer of any interest in immovable property situated in Cambodia.
  * Premiums from the insurance or reinsurance of risks in Cambodia.
  * Gain from the sale of movable property that is part of a PE’s business property maintained by a non-resident taxpayer in Cambodia.
  * Income from business activities conducted by a non-resident through a PE in Cambodia.


WHT is due when the amount is paid. An expense is considered 'paid' when it is recorded in the accounting records.
Except WHT on the rental of movable and immovable properties as stated in Article 25 and 26 of the Law on Taxation, small taxpayers are exempted from being the WHT agents for other WHT implications.

## Statutory financial audit requirement
All enterprises (whether physical or legal persons) that meet two of the following criteria are required to have their financial statements audited by an independent external auditor registered with the Kampuchea Institute of Certified Public Accountants and Auditors (KICPAA):
  * Annual turnover above KHR 4 billion.
  * Total assets above KHR 3 billion.
  * More than 100 employees.


QIPs registered with the CDC are required to have their financial statements audited by independent external auditors registered with the KICPAA.
The law does not state the deadline for the enterprises to submit their audited financial statements. However, the deadline for audited financial statements to be completed is six months after the accounting year-end (i.e. for the financial year ended 31 December 2024, the deadline will be 30 June 2025).
## United States (US) Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
The intergovernmental agreement (IGA) between the United States and Cambodia regarding the US FATCA was signed on 14 September 2015. This agreement shall enter into force on the date of Cambodia’s written notification to the United States that Cambodia has completed its necessary internal procedures for entry into force of this agreement.

## Inventory valuation
Inventory can be valued at weighted-average cost, first in first out (FIFO), or current value at the close of the period, where this value is lower than the purchase price or production cost. Work-in-progress should be valued at production costs.
## Capital gain
Capital gains form part of taxable income.
## Dividend income
Dividend income forms part of taxable income.
Inter-company dividends between residents are exempt from CIT (_see the section for more information_).
Gross dividend income received by a resident company from a non-resident enterprise is subject to CIT. A foreign tax credit for taxes paid on these dividends is allowed for deduction from the CIT. The maximum amount of the foreign tax credit is the CIT liability with respect to that dividend income.
## Passive income
Designated passive income (such as interest, royalties, and rent) forms part of taxable income.
## Foreign income
Resident entities are taxed on their worldwide income, and tax credits are available for foreign taxes incurred. Foreign income is taxable in the period it is earned; there is no provision allowing tax to be deferred on the income earned overseas.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 19 September 2024
Cambodia’s taxation rules vary according to the taxpayer’s regime, the classification of taxpayers under different tax collection and control procedures of the GDT. The self-declaration regime is the only tax regime in Cambodia. Under the self-declaration regime, taxpayers are classified into three categories (e.g. large, medium, and small taxpayers) based on their sectoral turnover, legal form, and other criteria (_see table below_).
Type of taxpayer | Criteria   
---|---  
Small | Sole proprietorship or partnership: 
  * annual turnover from 250 million to 1 billion Cambodian riel (KHR) for agricultural, service and commercial sectors
  * annual turnover from KHR 250 million to KHR 1.6 billion for the industrial sector
  * total turnover for any three consecutive months in calendar year from KHR 60 million
  * total expected turnover for next three consecutive months from KHR 60 million, or
  * participating in bidding, price consultation, or surveys for the supply of goods or services.

  
Medium | 
  * annual turnover from KHR 1 billion to KHR 4 billion for the agricultural sector
  * annual turnover from KHR 1 billion to KHR 6 billion for service and commercial sectors
  * annual turnover from KHR 1.6 billion to KHR 8 billion for the industrial sector
  * registered as a legal person or representative office
  * national or sub-national state institutions, associations, or non-government organisations (NGOs), or projects under these institutions, or
  * foreign diplomatic and consular missions, international organisations, and technical cooperation agencies of other governments.

  
Large | 
  * annual turnover above KHR 4 billion for the agricultural sector
  * annual turnover above KHR 6 billion for service and commercial sectors
  * annual turnover above KHR 8 billion for the industrial sector
  * subsidiary of multi-national company, branch of a foreign company, or
  * Qualified Investment Projects (QIPs).

  
If the declared turnover does not reflect actual turnover, the GDT will have the authority to re-determine the classification of a taxpayer based on the value of their assets used in the enterprise’s business.
Resident taxpayers are subject to tax on worldwide income while non-residents are taxed on Cambodian-sourced income only. A permanent establishment (PE) is taxable on its Cambodian-source income only.
## Corporate tax rate
The standard rate of corporate income tax (CIT), previously known as tax on profit, for companies who are classified as medium and large taxpayers and PEs is 20%.
For companies who are classified as small taxpayers, the CIT rates are progressive rates from 0% to 20%.
## Industry-specific tax rates
Oil and gas and certain mineral exploitation activities are subject to CIT at the rate of 30%.
Insurance companies are taxable at a rate of 5% on the gross premium income and at the rate of 20% on other income derived from non-insurance/reinsurance activities. Net interest income of insurance companies received after 4% or 6% WHT is not taxable income.
The small taxpayer is subject to CIT at the progressive rates as stated in Article 20 of the Law on Taxation.
## Minimum tax (MT)
Self-declaration regime taxpayers are subject to a separate MT. The MT is an annual tax with a liability equal to 1% of annual turnover inclusive of all taxes except VAT.
As a separate tax to the CIT, the MT is due irrespective of the taxpayer's profit or loss position (i.e. the MT will be liable if the 1% of total annual turnover exceeds the 20% CIT liability).
According to the Law on Financial Management 2017, the MT is no longer applicable to enterprises that maintain proper accounting records from 1 January 2017. However, there is still no definition of what constitutes ‘maintaining proper accounting records’.
## Local income taxes
Provincial and local income taxes are not applicable in Cambodia.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is applicable to self-declaration regime entities and is charged at 10% on the value of the supply of most goods and services.
Exported goods and services rendered outside Cambodia are zero-rated. In addition, 0% VAT applies to the supporting industries or contractors who directly supply goods (including milled rice) or services (including milled rice production services) to export-oriented garment, textile, footwear, bag, handbag, and headwear manufacturers, milled rice exporters, and domestic supplies of paddy rice.
Some supplies are VAT exempt, the main categories being public postal services, medical and dental services, electricity, water, transportation of passengers by wholly state-owned public transport systems, insurance services, primary financial services, and land. Some are exempt supplies under the Law on Financial Management 2017.
VAT returns and payments are due within 20 days of the following month. Note that strict record-keeping requirements do exist.
## Import and export duties
Import duties are levied on a wide range of products. Rates vary from 0% to 35%. Following Cambodia’s entry into the Association of South-East Asia Nations (ASEAN) during 1999, the government is required to reduce import duties in accordance with the Common Effective Preferential Tariffs programme.
Export duties are levied on a limited number of items, such as timber and certain animal products (including most seafood).
## Specific tax (SPT)
SPT is a form of excise tax that applies to the importation or domestic production and supply of certain goods and services. SPT on domestically produced goods is generally applied to the SPT base, which is 90% of the invoice price before VAT and SPT itself. For imported goods, SPT is due on the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) value inclusive of customs duty. For hotel and telecommunication services, SPT is payable based on the invoice prices.
For local and international air transportation of passengers, SPT is 10%, payable based on the air ticket value issued in Cambodia for travel within and outside Cambodia. The SPT base is inclusive of all taxes other than SPT and VAT. For example, for return air tickets from Phnom Penh to Singapore costing 2 million Cambodian riel (KHR), exclusive of airport tax, the SPT payable is KHR 181,818 (KHR 2 million/1.1 x 10%).
## Accommodation tax
Accommodation tax is calculated at 2% of the accommodation fee, inclusive of all taxes and other services except accommodation tax and VAT.
## Tax for public lighting (TPL)
TPL is imposed on the distribution in Cambodia of both foreign made and locally produced alcoholic and tobacco products.
The TPL base for calculation of 5% shall be determined as follows:
  * For producers and importers, the TPL base is the price recorded on the invoice inclusive of all taxes, except VAT and TPL itself.
  * For further supply of the products to distributors/consumers, the TPL base is equal to 20% of the price recorded on the invoice inclusive of all taxes, except VAT and TPL itself.


## Tax on immovable property (ToIP)
ToIP is levied at 0.1% per annum of the ToIP base. The tax base on which ToIP is calculated is based on the immovable property’s value determined by the Immovable Property Assessment Committee less the threshold of KHR100 million (approx. USD25,000). The immovable property valued below the threshold is not subject to ToIP. The Prakas also determines that ToIP is collected on immovable properties located in municipalities and provinces of the Kingdom of Cambodia.
Immovable property is defined to include land, houses, buildings, co-owned buildings, and other constructions. Certain exemptions exist for government-owned property, agricultural land, property owned and used for charitable and religious purposes, property of foreign embassies and NGOs, house or building or construction less than 80% constructed and not in use, property in the special economic zones, etc.
The possessors, occupants, or final beneficiaries of immovable property are required to register and obtain a Tax Identification Number for each immovable property valued above the threshold from the tax administration where the immovable property is located. Any changes in relation to the registered immovable property (e.g. a change of title) are also required to be reported.
The possessors, occupants or final beneficiaries hold responsibility for calculating ToIP, preparing and filing a ToIP return, as well as remitting the ToIP liability to the tax administration once per year by 30 September. The tax administration will have its authority to perform a tax audit on ToIP in the subsequent years.
This new Prakas 576 will be effective from 1 January 2025 and not be retroactive for tax amounts, additional tax, and interest already paid. Any provisions contrary to this Prakas will be abrogated.
## Tax on unused land
Land in towns and other specified areas without any construction, or with construction that is not in use, and even certain built-upon land, is subject to the tax on unused land. The tax is calculated at 2% of the market value of the land per square metre as determined by the Commission for Valuation of Unused Land on 30 June each year. The owner of the land is required to pay the tax on 30 September each year. The tax is paid by the owner on land that doesn’t fall under the scope of ToIP.
## Stamp tax
### Property
The transfer of title in certain assets (e.g. land, building, vehicles) and transfer of company shares (whether partial or full) are subject to stamp tax. The tax is imposed on the transfer values at the following rates:
  * Transfer of assets: 4%.
  * Transfer of shares: 0.1%.


The tax base for stamp tax on the soft and hard title transfer of immovable property (i.e. land) is the higher of:
  * the property's value set by the appendix of the MEF's Prakas No. 962, or
  * the property's value stated in a title transfer contract or other related legal documents if the transferred value is equal to or higher than the value set by the appendix of the Prakas.


### Government contract
Stamp tax is imposed at the rate of 0.1% on the contract value of the public procurement contract for goods or services.
### Document/signage
Stamp tax is to be paid on certain documents relating to the establishment, dissolution, or merger of a business, other official documents (perhaps more importantly for foreign investors), and certain advertising postings and signage. Amounts vary according to such factors as the type of documents, the location of the signage, illumination, and nationality of any scripted words. For certain documents, the tax amount is fixed up to KHR 1 million.
### Cigarettes
Domestic producers or importers of cigarettes have the obligation to buy and affix tax stamps on packets of cigarettes. No person is allowed to sell or display packaged cigarettes for sale without a tax stamp.
## Patent tax
Registered businesses must pay a (relatively nominal) patent tax on initial business registration and annually thereafter. Patent tax is levied with reference to turnover or estimated turnover.
Type of taxpayers | Patent tax   
---|---  
Small | KHR 400,000 per year.  
Medium | KHR 1.2 million per year.  
Large | 
  * KHR 3 million.
  * KHR 5 million for turnover of over KHR 10 billion.
  * Additional tax of KHR 3 million if the taxpayer has a principal place of business, enterprise’s office, branch, warehouse, factory, or workshop for a business activity in a different city or province.

  
The annual patent tax return and payment are to be filed annually, within three months of calendar year-end.
## Tax on means of transportation
The tax on means of transportation imposes a number of statutory fees on the registration of certain vehicles, including trucks, buses, and ships.
## Tax on Salary (ToS) and Tax on Fringe Benefits (ToFB)
Cambodia’s ToS rules follow internationally familiar residency and source principles. A Cambodian resident taxpayer’s worldwide salary will be subject to Cambodian ToS. For non-residents, only the Cambodian-sourced salary will be subject to ToS. The place of salary payment is not considered relevant in determining source.
A distinction is made between cash and fringe benefit salary components. Different tax scales also apply.
ToS or ToFB is a tax on employees’ income, but employers are held liable to these taxes if the employers fail to withhold.
_The tax tables applicable to individuals (e.g. ToS, ToFB) are provided in the section of Cambodia’s Individual tax summary._
## Social security contributions
Employers are currently required to make the Occupational Risks Contribution (ORC), payment for healthcare, and payment for pension to the National Social Security Fund (NSSF).
### Payment for ORC
An employer with at least eight employees must register itself and all its employees with the NSSF.
The employer is required to contribute ORC equal to 0.8% of the monthly average wage of an employee to the NSSF’s designated bank account.
### Payment for healthcare
In addition to the NSSF payment for ORC, the employer is also required to contribute, collect, and remit the contributions for healthcare and pension to the NSSF on a monthly basis. According to Sub-Decree No. 140, dated 26 August 2017, from 1 January 2018, the obligation to pay the contribution of healthcare is the full burden (100%) of the employer at 2.6% of the monthly average wage of employees. Previously, the healthcare contribution was required from both employers and employees, each equal to 1.3% of the monthly average wage of employees.
### Payment for pension
#### Old-age pension (OP)
First stage: In the first five years, the pension contribution rate is 4% of the contributory wage of the worker/employee. The employer contributes 2%, while the other 2% comes from the worker/employee.
Second stage: In the next five years (i.e. the sixth to tenth years), the contribution rate is 8% of the contributory wage.
Third stage: The contribution rate will increase 2.75% in the 11th to 20th years, with subsequent increases of 2.75% every ten years.
Workers/employees who are NSSF members are entitled to receive an OP if they fulfil the following conditions:
  1. Have registered for a pension scheme.
  2. Are at least 60 years old.
  3. Have paid contributions to the pension scheme for at least 12 months.


If condition 3 is not met, they will receive an old-age allowance instead.
