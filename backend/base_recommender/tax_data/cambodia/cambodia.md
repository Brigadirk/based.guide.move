Cambodia, a country located in Southeast Asia, is bordered by the Lao People's Democratic Republic to the northeast, Thailand to the northwest, Vietnam to the east, and the Gulf of Thailand to the southwest. Cambodia gained its independence in 1953 and is a member of the Association of South-East Asia Nations (ASEAN). Cambodia has a multiparty democracy under a constitutional monarchy, with Phnom Penh as the capital. Cambodia’s official language is Khmer, and the currency is the riel (KHR).
According to the Royal Government’s circular, Cambodia’s economy growth is expected to improve marginally to 6.3% in 2025, up from 6% in 2024, and should further strengthen by 6.6% in 2026 and 2027 as revival in industrial, service and agricultural sectors (garment subsector, non-garment manufacturing sector, continuation of the movement of hospitality subsector, food service and other supporting tourism service, and growth of animal feeding, plant (farming) and fishing subsectors).
