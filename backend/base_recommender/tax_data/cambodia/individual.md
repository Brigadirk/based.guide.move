## Foreign tax relief
Taxes paid by resident taxpayers on foreign-source salary will be allowed as a credit against Cambodian salary tax on presentation of documentation confirming payment. The credit allowed is the amount of foreign tax paid or the proportion of salary tax on salary from all sources attributable to the foreign-source income, whichever is lower.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 19 September 2024
There is no personal income tax, _per se_ , in Cambodia. Instead, a monthly salary tax is imposed on individuals who derive income from employment. General consulting income is excluded from salary tax but is subject to tax on income (_see the section in the Corporate tax summary for more information on CIT_), although rules exist that may deem certain consultants as employees.
A Cambodian resident's worldwide salary is subject to Cambodia salary tax, while non-residents are taxed on Cambodian-sourced salary.

## Social security contributions
Employers are required to make Occupational Risks Contribution (ORC), payment for healthcare, and pension contribution to the National Social Security Fund (NSSF).
With regard to ORC, an employer with at least eight employees must register itself and all its employees with the NSSF. The employer is required to contribute ORC equal to 0.8% of the monthly average wage of an employee to the NSSF’s designated bank account.
In addition to the NSSF contribution payment for occupational risks, the employer is also required to contribute, collect, and remit the contributions for healthcare and pension to the NSSF on a monthly basis. The healthcare contribution is required from both employers and employees at 1.3% (each) of the monthly average wage of employees. However, from 1 January 2018, the obligation to pay the contribution of healthcare as stated in the above paragraph shall be the full burden (100%) of the employer.
For the pension contribution, it is required from both employers and employees as follows:
### Old-age pension (OP)
First stage: In the first five years, the pension contribution rate is 4% of the contributory wage of the worker/employee. The employer contributes 2%, while the other 2% comes from the worker/employee.
Second stage: In the next five years (i.e. the sixth to tenth years), the contribution rate is 8% of the contributory wage.
Third stage: The contribution rate will increase 2.75% in the 11th to 20th years, with subsequent increases of 2.75% every ten years.
Workers/employees who are NSSF members are entitled to receive an OP if they fulfil the following conditions:
  1. Have registered for a pension scheme.
  2. Are at least 60 years old.
  3. Have paid contributions to the pension scheme for at least 12 months.


If condition 3 is not met, they will receive an old-age allowance instead.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is charged at 10% on the value of the supply of most goods and services.
