## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 09 February 2025
## Taxable period
The tax period for CIT is a calendar year, and the reporting period is a quarter.
## Tax returns
CIT is reported quarterly before the 20th day of the month following the reporting quarter both by Uzbek legal entities and PEs. The annual tax return is due by 1 March following the reporting year.
## Payment of tax
Legal entities are required to make payments of their tax liability not later than the filing deadline for the respective reporting quarter.
Legal entities with annual income for the previous tax period exceeding UZS 10 billion are required to make advance payments on a monthly basis.
Monthly advance payments should be made by the 23rd day of each month.
Possible excess of advanced payments can be deferred to the future periods, set-off against liabilities on other taxes, or refunded by the tax authorities within 15 days after filing an application for refund.
## Tax audit process
A new mechanism of tax control has been introduced, which prescribes that tax audits will be appointed based on the results of risk analysis. Specifically, taxpayers will be divided into three risk groups: high risk (red), average risk (yellow), and low risk (green). It is expected that taxpayers in the green group will not be audited, while taxpayers in the red group may be audited each year.
Risk analysis will be performed based on the following:
  * Tax and financial reports on taxpayer.
  * Information on taxpayer received from other state bodies.
  * Tax risk criteria and segments. 


A desktop tax audit consists of the inspection of the taxpayer's reports to the tax authority and their comparison with the data of state authorities, after which the taxpayer should make changes to the tax reports or provide reasonable arguments. After a desktop tax audit, financial sanctions will not be applied, but penalties may be accrued. As of 1 January 2022, the new ‘pre-desktop audit’ analysis concept was introduced into the Tax Code. This analysis shall be performed by special information systems of tax authorities based on tax reports filed by taxpayers. 
An on-site tax audit is carried out to collect information on the calculation and payment of taxes and fees, as well as other obligations. Following the results of an on-site tax audit, additional taxes will not be charged.
A tax audit is a full-fledged study of compliance with tax legislation by a taxpayer who has a high degree of risk with significant turnover. Tax audits are conducted for taxpayers selected based on the results of the analysis of risk factors for non-payment of taxes. After a tax audit, additional taxes and financial sanctions may be applied.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations for tax purposes in Uzbekistan is set to three years.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
There are no officially announced areas of focus during tax audits. In practice, the tax authorities usually focus on currency control, cash discipline, deductibility of expenses for CIT purposes, and taxes on resources (e.g. excess profits tax, subsurface use tax).


# Uzbekistan, Republic of
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 09 February 2025
For Uzbek tax purposes, corporations are classified as resident or non-resident. The new edition of the Tax Code introduced amendments into the definition of tax residency.
A resident corporation includes the following legal entities:
  * Uzbek legal entities (i.e. passed state registration in Uzbekistan).
  * Foreign legal entities recognised as Uzbekistan tax resident under international agreements.
  * Foreign legal entities with effective place of management in Uzbekistan.


Other legal entities are regarded as non-resident corporations for tax purposes.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
PE is defined by the Tax Code as a “fixed place, through which the foreign legal entity carries out, in full or partially, entrepreneurial activity in the Republic of Uzbekistan”. The Tax Code further provides that a PE is also existent where (i) building site, installation or assembly object, or related activities exist/last for more than 183 days in any consecutive 12-month period, or (ii) service, including consulting services, is provided by a non-resident if they last (for one or more related projects or related entities) for not less than 183 days in any consecutive 12-month period.


# Uzbekistan, Republic of
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 09 February 2025
The tax base for CIT purposes varies significantly from the computation of taxable profits in most Western jurisdictions.
There are additional costs that cannot be deducted by PEs of foreign legal entities, such as interest on head office loans; commission fees charged by the head office; and royalty, administrative, and management expenses of the head office incurred outside Uzbekistan. However, PEs are eligible to deduct expenses incurred outside of Uzbekistan if they directly relate to their business in Uzbekistan.
## Depreciation and amortisation
For tax purposes, depreciation/amortisation is calculated with application of rates defined by the Tax Code. If depreciation for accounting purposes is charged at higher rates (compared with the Tax Code rates), the difference is treated as a temporary difference for CIT purposes (i.e. deducted in future periods).
Depreciation is calculated from the date on which the asset was put into use until it is fully depreciated, disposed of, or written off. The maximum annual depreciation rates applicable to different types of fixed assets are outlined in the table below.
Depreciable item | Rate (%)  
---|---  
Buildings | 5  
Constructions (e.g. bridges, oil-wells, landing strips, dams, greenhouses) | 10  
Pipelines, power supply lines, and communication lines | 15  
Machines and equipment except for transport vehicles | 20  
Railway, river, and air transport vehicles | 10  
Cars, trailers, lorries, buses, and other transport vehicles | 20  
Computers and other related devices | 40  
Depreciable assets not mentioned above | 15  
For statutory accounting purposes, fixed assets can be depreciated using one of the following methods:
  * Straight-line method.
  * Production method.
  * Double-declining-balance method.
  * Sum-of-the-years’ (cumulative) method.


For tax purposes, depreciation is calculated based on the straight-line method using the above marginal rates. 
Intangible assets, including leases and other property rights, are amortised over the shorter of an asset's useful life or the period of activity of the enterprise. Where an asset's useful life cannot be determined, the asset can be amortised over five years.
Expenses related to geological exploration and developmental works necessary for the extraction of natural resources are deductible for CIT purposes through depreciation at the rate of 15% _per annum_.
The taxpayer has the right to apply investment deductions for depreciable assets subject to depreciation for up to (i) 20% from the cost of a new technological equipment and (ii) 10% for the expansion of production in the form of a new construction.
## Goodwill
For tax purposes, expenses incurred for acquisition of goodwill should be deductible through monthly amortisation charges at norms calculated by the taxpayers based on historical cost of goodwill and its useful life.
## Start-up expenses
Current legislation does not provide specific guidance on tax treatment of start-up expenses. However, as per Uzbek accounting legislation, certain types of start-up expenses (e.g. expenses for acquisition of right for production, right for rendering services and carrying out works, right to use economic or other privileges) can be considered as expenses for procurement of intangible assets and, respectively, can be deducted through monthly depreciation charges.
## Interest on short-term loans
Interest is deductible, except for interest on overdue/delayed loans (i.e. ‘penalty interest’).
## Bad debt
Bad debts related to the receipt of taxable income in the previous reporting periods are deductible for tax purposes in cases where they are written off and recognised in accordance with Uzbek accounting legislation. Otherwise, such expenses should be considered as non-deductible. According to the current Uzbek legislation, arrears are recognised as bad debts upon expiration of three-years from their due date.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions are generally treated as non-deductible expenses and added-back to the taxable base.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are considered as non-deductible expenses.
## Taxes
Generally, taxes are deductible for CIT purposes.
## Other tax losses
Production wastes and defects within statutory norms, and losses resulting in force-majeure circumstances, are generally deductible.
Losses from the disposal of fixed assets also may be deducted.
## Net operating losses
Tax losses can be carried forward indefinitely, thus reducing the taxable profit of the respective year. Loss carrybacks are not permitted.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
There are no special tax provisions regarding deductibility of payments to foreign affiliates for services provided. They may be deducted in full if the general deductibility criteria are met (_see Transfer pricing in the_ _section_). However, there are some limitations on deductibility of the expenses of a PE of non-residents paid to a head company (e.g. royalties, remuneration on loans, expenses not related to the PE, management and general administrative expenses not related to the PE).


# Uzbekistan, Republic of
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 09 February 2025
New legislation provides the opportunity to form a consolidated group of taxpayers, which may comprise of two or more Uzbek legal entities. The taxpayers should meet the ‘ownership’ criteria, i.e. participation share of one legal entity in the charter capital of other legal entity(ies) should comprise at least 90%. However, legal entities should not be undergoing liquidation or bankruptcy processes, and their net assets should be higher than the charter capital.
Moreover, all legal entities forming a consolidated group of taxpayers shall satisfy other criteria related to turnover, taxes paid, and assets value. The advantages of applying this regime may include, without limitation, ability of filing one set of reports for the group and offsetting profits of one group company against losses of another group company.
The legislation of consolidated groups of taxpayers is enforced from 1 January 2022.
## Transfer pricing
The Tax Code introduces elaborate transfer pricing provisions, including definition of related parties, controlled transactions, pricing methods, documentation and reporting requirements, pricing agreements, etc. There are five methods of transfer pricing, similar to those used in the international transfer pricing practise (i.e. based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations) to analyse the arm’s-length nature of the controlled transactions.
Taxpayers qualified as ‘large taxpayers’ are eligible to apply to tax authorities for an ‘advance pricing agreement’ (APA). APAs may be valid for the period of up to three years and may be extended for an additional two years upon taxpayer’s request.
Transfer pricing rules have been enforced as of 1 January 2022.
## Thin capitalisation
The Tax Code introduced regulations on deductibility of taxpayer's interest expense on controllable debt from a foreign participant. Controllable liability is defined as liability owed to a:
  * foreign legal entity or individual that is not considered as Uzbek tax resident with a direct/indirect ownership of 25% of shares in the charter capital of the taxpayer
  * other related entity of this foreign participant, or
  * other persons for which the above-mentioned persons act as guarantors or otherwise undertake responsibility to ensure the repayment of this taxpayer's debt.


The deductibility limitations apply if the amount of debt exceeds the amount of equity by 3 times (13 times for banks and leasing companies). There is a specific mechanism for determining the deductibility limits.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Generally, CFC rules are applicable to individuals and legal entities, Uzbekistan tax residents, owning or controlling foreign legal entities and/or structures. The main purpose of the new CFC rules is to tax undistributed profits of foreign companies and structures like trusts, foundations, etc.
Rules of CFCs are enforced from 1 January 2022.


# Uzbekistan, Republic of
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 09 February 2025
The Civil Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan provides that enterprises can establish and operate branches. However, the by-laws governing procedures for establishing entities with foreign investments do not provide sufficient guidance on establishing branches of foreign legal entities, creating a practical problem with registering of branches of foreign legal entities. Instead, such entities use a PE registration to perform business activities without establishing an Uzbek company.
Generally, taxation of a PE’s income is similar to that of an Uzbek legal entity (i.e. the income of a PE is subject to CIT at the rate of 15%). As of 1 January 2022, net profits (i.e. a PE's taxable income less CIT) are subject to taxation at a tax rate of 10%, which aligns the PE taxation with Uzbek legal entities that pay a 10% dividends WHT. Starting from 1 January 2023, the rate of net profits tax may be reduced if provisions of the DTT between Uzbekistan and the jurisdiction of a non-resident’s tax residency provides for a reduced WHT rate on dividend income.


# Uzbekistan, Republic of
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 09 February 2025

5 million to 15 million | 5  
15 million and more | 10

## Tax incentives for foreign direct investments
As per the Tax Code, enterprises attracting direct foreign investments may be exempt from payment of property tax, land tax, and water usage tax, subject to certain criteria, including share of foreign participation, type of activity (as per the pre-approved list), location of the enterprise, etc.
Entities attracting foreign direct investments are granted tax exemptions for specific periods, which vary depending on investment amount.
The above tax incentives are granted if the following conditions are met (without limitation):

Until 1 January 2027, the rates of the CIT and property tax for enterprises of the electrical industry are reduced by 50%.

# Uzbekistan, Republic of
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 09 February 2025
WHT is to be withheld and remitted to the state budget by entities paying income to non-residents if these entities qualify under a tax agent definition (i.e. by [i] Uzbek legal entities and [ii] non-residents operating in Uzbekistan via PE).
Income of non-residents subject to WHT (including income in the form of dividends, interest, and royalties) is to be paid without withholding of WHT at source or with application of a reduced WHT rate as provided by the tax treaty (with certain exemptions), provided that there is a duly formalised tax certificate issued by a competent authority confirming that non-residents are registered for tax purposes in the state with which Uzbekistan has the effective tax treaty.
The domestic WHT rates are as follows:
Payment | WHT (%)  
---|---  
Dividends and interest to residents | 5  
Dividends and interest to non-residents | 10  
Insurance and reinsurance payments | 10  
Freight | 6  
Royalties, services (including management, consulting services), rents, other income | 20  
## Double taxation treaty (DTT) relief
Foreign legal entities that do not carry on activities in Uzbekistan through a PE are subject to WHT on income from sources in Uzbekistan, subject to the terms of a relevant DTT. Uzbekistan has enforced DTTs with 55 countries.
DTTs in force establish WHT rates as follows:
Recipient | WHT (%)  
---|---  
Dividends | Interest | Royalties  
Austria | 5 (2b)/15 | 0 (7c, 7e, 7f)/10 | 5  
Azerbaijan | 10 | 10 | 10  
Bahrain | 8 | 8 | 8

## Intergovernmental agreement (IGA) on the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
On 3 April 2015, a Model 1 IGA between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Uzbekistan to Improve International Tax Compliance and to Implement FATCA was signed. Uzbekistan approved the IGA as of 5 July 2017, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Uzbekistan was ordered to notify on completion of domestic procedures. The IGA is in force starting 7 July 2017.
More than 110 countries around the world have concluded IGAs on FATCA with the United States, while, as per a statement by the US Embassy in Uzbekistan, Uzbekistan is the first country in Central Asia to sign an IGA on FATCA with the United States.
The IGA will ensure compliance with US tax laws for US citizens working in Uzbekistan. According to the FATCA regulations, foreign financial institutions (FFIs) (i.e. all financial institutions outside of the United States) are faced with disclosure requirements regarding their account holders who are US persons. This means that FFIs in Uzbekistan are obligated to periodically transmit information on financial accounts held by US persons to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or face a 30% WHT on payments made from the United States. In order to fulfil this obligation, FFIs should implement procedures to ensure information collecting systems are in place and required information in respect to US investors is duly reported to the US IRS.
## Uzbekistan joins OECD plan on base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS)
On 9 June 2023 Uzbekistan joined the OECD/G-20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS.
Through its decision, Uzbekistan has committed to address tax challenges arising from digitalisation of the economy and joined the two-pillar plan to reform the international taxation rules. Collaborating with all other members of the Inclusive Framework, Uzbekistan will participate in implementation of the BEPS package of 15 measures (actions) to improve coherence of international tax rules and ensure a more transparent tax environment.
It is worthwhile noting that among the potential measures to be implemented are the prevention of tax treaty abuse and country-by-country (CbC) reporting.


# Uzbekistan, Republic of
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 09 February 2025
## Inventory valuation
Uzbek legislation permits the application of the weighted average cost method (AVECO) and the first in first out (FIFO) method for the valuation of inventory for tax purposes.
## Capital gains
A capital gain is, generally, the difference between the sale price or amount realised for a business asset and its acquisition price, reduced by the incidental costs of sale and acquisition and depreciation costs. That said, there is no specific definition of capital gains in Uzbek tax legislation. The capital gain/loss is included in taxable profits by Uzbek legal entities and PEs of foreign legal entities.
In the context of a non-resident with no PE in Uzbekistan, the gain/income received from sale of property within Uzbekistan is calculated by deducting the acquisition price of the property from its selling price, as confirmed by an official document. Capital gains of non-resident companies are subject to WHT at 20% as 'other' income. The obligation to withhold and pay the tax on income of a non-resident of the Republic of Uzbekistan is levied on the buyer of the property, a tax agent. In the absence of the documents supporting the acquisition price, WHT on capital gains from the sale of property shall be assessed based on the sales price.
## Dividend income
Dividends paid by a domestic subsidiary to: (i) a non-resident are subject to 10% WHT and (ii) a resident are subject to 5% WHT at the source. The net dividends received by its domestic parent company are then excluded from the parent’s CIT base. Such net dividends received by a foreign parent company are taxed in accordance with the respective country’s internal legislation or DTT provisions (if Uzbekistan has a DTT with this country).
Income of non-residents subject to WHT (including income in the form of dividends, interest, and royalties) is to be paid without withholding of WHT at source or with application of a reduced WHT rate as provided by a tax treaty, provided that there is a tax certificate confirming that non-residents are registered for tax purposes in the state with which Uzbekistan has the effective tax treaty (with certain exemptions).
For Uzbek legal entities paying out dividends, a new mechanism of tax credit was introduced to avoid cascade taxation of dividends.
Until 31 December 2028:
  * Income of individuals, both residents and non-residents of Uzbekistan, in the form of dividends from shares they own, is exempt from PIT.
  * For non-resident legal entities, income in the form of dividends from shares they own is subject to a CIT rate of 5%.


_See the section for a list of countries with which Uzbekistan has an applicable tax treaty_.
## Interest income
Interest income paid to non-residents is subject to WHT at the source at the rate of 10%. Such net interest income received by foreign companies is taxed in accordance with the respective country’s internal legislation or DTT provisions (if Uzbekistan has a DTT with this country). Similar to other types of income of non-residents subject to WHT (including income in the form of dividends and royalties), interest income is to be paid without withholding of WHT at source or with application of a reduced WHT rate by automatic application of a DTT, provided that there is a relevant residence certificate.
As per the Tax Code, as of 1 January 2020, interest paid to residents (except payments to non-profit and budget organisations) is not subject to taxation at source and should be included in the income of the recipients and is subject to taxation in the manner specified by the Tax Code.
Interest income of legal entities (both residents and non-residents) on corporate bonds is exempt from CIT.
Until 31 December 2028, income of individuals and legal entities, both residents and non-residents of Uzbekistan, in the form of interest on corporate bonds, is exempt from PIT and CIT.
_See the_ _section for a list of countries with which Uzbekistan has an applicable tax treaty_.
## Royalty income
Royalty income includes payments for:
  * copyrights to works of science, literature, and art, including copyrights to software and databases, drawings, design or model, plan, secret formula, technology or process, audio-visual works, and objects of adjacent rights, including performances and phonograms
  * patents, trademarks, or other similar types of rights, and
  * information regarding industrial, commercial, or scientific experience (know-how).


Royalty income of Uzbek legal entities and PEs of foreign legal entities is included in taxable profits.
Royalties paid to non-resident companies with no PE are subject to WHT at 20% as 'other' income. The obligation to withhold and pay the tax on income of a non-resident of the Republic of Uzbekistan is levied on the payer of the royalty, a tax agent.
## Foreign income
Gross foreign income of a resident corporation (e.g. income from its foreign branch) should be included in its aggregate income on an accrual basis, regardless of remittance date. Expenses incurred abroad in relation to such foreign income can be deducted, subject to provisions of the Uzbek Tax Code. Foreign income tax paid on such income should be credited against the Uzbek CIT only if this branch is registered in a country with which Uzbekistan has a DTT. There are no deferrals for foreign income to be recognised for Uzbek tax purposes.


# Uzbekistan, Republic of
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 09 February 2025
Resident corporations pay CIT on their worldwide income, whereas non-residents (i.e. foreign legal entities that have a PE in Uzbekistan or have income from sources in Uzbekistan not associated with a PE) pay CIT on income resulting from activities/sources in Uzbekistan.
Non-resident corporations are taxed directly at the level of their Uzbek PE, if there is one, or via withholding tax (WHT) at the source of payment of the Uzbek-source income.
CIT is charged on taxable profit calculated as a difference between gross income and deductible expenses reduced by applicable incentives granted by the Tax Code, other laws, or presidential decrees.
The CIT rate is set in the Tax Code (previously, annually by presidential decree). Enterprises (i.e. legal entities) are generally subject to CIT at the rate of 15%. Commercial banks, producers of cement (clinker) and polyethylene granules, mobile services providers, and markets/shopping malls are subject to CIT at the rate of 20%.
0% CIT rate for the export of goods (services) is abolished, income from exports will be included in the tax base for turnover tax from January 1, 2025.
The rate of CIT applicable to the following categories of the taxpayers may be reduced by 50%:
  * Payers of turnover tax switching to CIT for the first time after 1 September 2022, for the tax period in which they switched to CIT, provided that their turnover does not exceed UZS 10 billion during that tax period.
  * CIT payers whose revenue generated throughout any tax period after 1 September 2022 exceeds UZS 10 billion for the first time, for the tax period in which this threshold is exceeded and for the tax period following it, provided that the revenue generated throughout the tax period in which the reduced rate is applied does not exceed UZS 100 billion.


From February 1, 2025 to January 1, 2030, foreign companies that are not tax residents of countries with which Uzbekistan has a double taxation agreement are exempt from CIT if their annual volume of export IT services to residents of the IT park (including services for which royalties are paid) exceeds 10 million dollars.
_See the_ _section for WHT rates applicable in Uzbekistan_.
## Simplified tax regime (i.e. turnover tax)
An optional simplified tax regime is available for all legal entities with annual turnover less than UZS 1 billion and individual entrepreneurs with turnover ranging from UZS 100 million to UZS 1 billion. Under this regime, turnover tax replaces CIT and VAT.
Turnover taxpayers whose revenue exceeds UZS 1 during the year will, however, become subject to the general income tax regime from the month following the month in which the annual revenue threshold was exceeded.
The reporting period for turnover tax has been set to a month (instead of a quarter previously).
Legal entities that provide intermediary services under a commission agreement, instructions, and other intermediary services agreements, including individual entrepreneurs providing intermediary services to telecom operators, calculate revenue from sale of goods/services on the basis of the transaction amount.
Certain taxpayers are not eligible for application of turnover tax (e.g. importers, producers of excise-liable goods, legal entities engaged into subsurface extraction, sale of petrol, diesel/gas fuel).
The general turnover tax rate is 4% but may vary from 1 to 25% depending on type of entity and services provided.
From January 1, 2025, 1% turnover tax is no longer available to legal entities located in established touristic zones.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
Legal entities are subject to VAT, which is applied to the turnover of goods and services. The taxable base is determined as the sale price of supplied goods/services.
Foreign legal entities carrying out activities in Uzbekistan via PE become VAT payers. Moreover, certain categories of taxpayers, including agricultural producers and law firms, may also be subject to VAT.
Foreign legal entities that supply e-services to individuals whereby the place of supply is considered Uzbekistan are subject to VAT in Uzbekistan. In such a case, the foreign service provider is liable for registering for VAT purposes in Uzbekistan. The taxable base shall comprise the actual sales price of such services inclusive of VAT.
The rate for taxable turnover is 12%. This rate also applies to taxable imports, for which the tax base is determined as the customs value plus import duties and excise tax (on excise-liable goods). Export of goods is generally zero-rated. Insurance and most types of financial services are exempt from VAT.
From 16 November 2023 till 1 January 2028, sales turnover, as well as the import of goods (services) purchased within the framework of projects financed through loans from the International Financial Institutions and foreign governmental financial organisations (except those refinanced through banks of Uzbekistan), attracted by state organisations and entities with a state share of 50% and above are exempt from VAT.
All entities with turnover exceeding UZS 1 billion, as well as PEs of foreign legal entities, are considered as VAT payers. Legal entities selling gas, diesel fuel, and gas through gas stations to end consumers and all business entities that are importers of goods and products are considered as VAT payers regardless of the amount of their annual turnover.
Reporting and tax payments are made on a monthly basis.
As of 1 April 2024, the following VAT incentives have been abolished:

Starting from January 1, 2025, VAT exemptions for the turnover from the sale of goods and services by legal entities, whose sole founder is an association of persons with disabilities, are abolished.
## Customs duties
Import of certain goods to Uzbekistan is subject to customs duties. The taxable base is determined as the customs value of imported goods. Rates of customs duties vary from 5% to 70%, depending on the type of imported goods. Fixed rates are also set for certain goods as a minimum (e.g. the rate for coconuts is 20% but cannot be less than 0.2 United States dollars [USD] per kg). 
From 1 January 2021, customs clearance fees were revised and should be calculated at the rates nominated in Base Calculation Units (BCUs), depending on range of the customs value of the goods. For example, the customs clearance fee for goods valued USD 100,000 to USD 200,000 should comprise 15 BCU (approximately USD 430).
A number of goods (per government approved list) imported for construction, renovation, and equipping of hotels, business centres, and retail stores will be exempt from customs duties between 1 March 2024 and 1 March 2026 (e.g. special equipment, appliances, raw materials, components, furniture, construction materials).
Until 1 January 2027, there will be an exemption from customs duties on imported raw materials and other materials, components, and spare parts necessary for the production of textile products and not produced in the republic, according to the list.
Starting from January 1, 2025, customs authorities are required to provide tax authorities with:
  * real-time information on import operations, information on export operations after crossing the customs border of goods, as well as information on the movement of goods, including those carried out in the form of e-commerce, across the customs border of the Republic of Uzbekistan;
  * monthly information on the storage of goods by non-residents of the Republic of Uzbekistan in customs warehouses of the Republic of Uzbekistan.


## Excise taxes
Due to the expiration of the Protocol on the Application of the Agreement on the Free Trade Area of the CIS Member States with Uzbekistan (dated 31 May 2013), Uzbekistan has cancelled excise tax for 73 product lines from 1 January 2021.
Legal entities producing or importing excise-able goods (e.g. cigarettes, petrol, alcohol drinks) are subject to excise tax.

The tax is computed annually, based on the net book value of the immovable property and the value of overdue construction and idle equipment/construction. Along with reduction of the property tax rate, the minimum taxable base for each square metre of immovable property was introduced. The amount of such a taxable base depends on the location of the immovable property and varies from UZS 1 million to UZS 2.5 million.

## Land tax
Enterprises, including foreign legal entities operating in Uzbekistan via a PE, owning land plots or rights of their use are subject to land tax or land lease payment annually. Land tax is charged at fees that are set in absolute values with precise amounts determined by the Law on State Budget of the Republic of Uzbekistan that vary depending on the quality, location, and level of water supply of each land plot.

From January 1, 2025 to January 1, 2028, companies that hire low-income employees with salaries above 1.5 minimum wage will pay a social tax rate of 1%.From September 1, 2024 to September 1, 2027, the social tax for companies that employ students from schools, colleges and technical schools under the age of 30 for vocational training is paid a 1% social tax on income paid to them in the form of wages.
Companies that hire foreign teachers are exempt from social tax until January 1 2030.
From 1 January 2025, an ST rate of 1% previously applied to businesses engaged in retail, catering, hospitality, passengers and freight transportation by vehicle, repair and maintenance of vehicles, computer services, repair of household appliances, agro- and veterinary services, and services provided in entertainment centres was not extended and considered abolished.
## Payroll taxes
In addition to ST, employers are responsible for withholding PIT and pension fund contributions from salaries and remitting them to the state budget.
The following types of income are exempt from PIT:
  * Amounts invested in shares during an IPO in the framework of employee share plan programs, within the limits of an employee’s monthly salary and equivalent payments.
  * Salaries and other income of taxpayers in the amount of up to 100 minimum wages allocated to an individual’s investment account for purchase of securities on the local stock market under certain conditions and limitations.


## Water-use tax
Enterprises (including PEs) using water in their production are subject to water-use tax. The tax rate is set by the Tax Code and depends on the source of water consumption (i.e. surface or underground). Water-use tax is calculated based on the volume of the water consumed. Water-use tax is reported annually.
Since January 1, 2025 tax rates for the use of water resources have been increased by 10% for water users, including power plants, utilities, producers of soft drinks and alcoholic beverages, except beer and wine, and industrial enterprises. In accordance with the Presidential Decree No. 107 dated April 1, 2023, water tax rates for other sectors will be gradually unified with industrial tariffs.
## Taxes of subsurface users
In addition to standard taxes, subsurface users (i.e. legal entities and individuals exploring and extracting natural resource) are subject to subsurface users’ specific taxes, as listed below:
### Subsurface use tax (royalty)
Subsurface use tax is charged on the volume of produced (extracted) natural resources that are ready for sale or transfer (including free of charge) and consumption for internal purposes. The taxable base is determined as the average weighted sales price.
Starting from January 1, 2025, separate tax rates for the use of mineral resources for marble, granite, natural facing stone, sand and gravel mixtures (including construction sand and sandstones) have been established, given that the share of tax in relation to their purchase price is very low.
Some examples of the tax rates are:
Business activity | Tax rate examples  
---|---  
Extraction of natural resources (tax rates effective from 1 January 2023) | natural gas 10%, oil and gas 10%, gold and copper 7%, silver 7%  
Utilisation of by-products received during the extraction of natural resources | 50% of tax rate applicable to main natural resources extracted  
Subsurface use tax is reported monthly by legal entities and annually by individuals.
### Mineral extraction rent tax
Starting from 1 January 2022, legal entities extracting precious, non-ferrous, and radioactive metals, rare and rare-earth elements, as well as hydrocarbons (natural gas, gas condensate, and oil), will be subject to a new rent tax. The taxable base comprises the amount of rent income, which is defined as the difference between the revenue from sales of respective products (net of VAT and excise tax) and expenses directly related to their extraction. If there is a rent loss, the taxable base shall be nil. The taxable base is calculated separately for each licensed subsoil plot (group of licensed plots).
Rent tax will not apply to rent income connected with extraction of natural resources on subsoil fields where the extraction started between 1 January 2024 and 31 December 2025. This exemption will apply for the entire period of extraction works.
Enterprises with foreign investments engaged in extraction of metals and hydrocarbons may determine the taxable base in US dollars based on the accrual method. In such a case, the taxable base indicated in foreign currency is converted into national currency at the exchange rate of the Central Bank of Uzbekistan established as at the date of tax filing. If a loss is incurred after the first tax period, the taxpayer is allowed to account for it in a separate account in US dollars and apply an uplift each year at the rate equal to the Uzbekistan sovereign bonds yield with maturity in ten years increased by two percentage points. Expenses of the first tax period may include historical costs.
The minimum tax rate comprises 25% of the taxable base. During a competitive bidding (tender) for the right to use a subsoil plot for geological exploration or extraction, the organiser or participants have a right to propose a higher rent tax rate to be paid.
The tax period for rent tax is a calendar year. The reporting period is a quarter. Rent tax is paid quarterly not later than the 20th day of the next month, and, for annual payments, not later than 1 March of the year following the reporting one.
### Excess profits tax
Excess profits tax is abolished from 1 January 2020.
### Subscription and commercial discovery bonuses
Subscription and commercial discovery bonuses are one-off payments to the state budget. The subscription bonus is payable for the right to engage in exploration and extraction of natural resources and range from 50 to 5,000 times the BCU, depending on the type of minerals. The commercial discovery bonus is paid for each field where a subsurface user discovers the natural resources and comprises 0.1% from the cost of the proved reserve volume.
Starting from 1 January 2022, a special procedure is introduced for tendering of subsoil rights for geological exploration and/or production in respect of previously explored fields having significant commercial potential (i.e. hydrocarbons, precious metals, non-ferrous, rare, and radioactive metals, and other types of minerals). At this, the cost of subsoil rights acquired replaces commercial discovery and subscription bonuses, which are abolished.
### Licence fee
Starting from 1 January 2022, an annual licence fee is introduced for the use of subsoil for geological exploration. It is calculated based on the allotted area and types of minerals, in the amounts established by legislation.
