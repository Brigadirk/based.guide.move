## Budget, Consultations, and Autumn Statement
The United Kingdom (UK) Chancellor delivered her Autumn Budget on 30 October 2024 and Finance Bill 2024-25 was subsequently published. The Bill is currently progressing through Parliament and will be enacted in Spring 2025.
## Changes that have taken effect in the past year
Reforms that took effect in the past year include:
  * Legislation was enacted in the United Kingdom that introduced the following elements of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD’s) Pillar Two rules:
    * An Income Inclusion Rule (IIR), known locally as the ’multinational top-up tax‘ (MTT), which requires large UK-headquartered multinational groups to pay a top-up tax where their foreign operations have an effective rate of less than 15%.
    * A domestic minimum top-up tax (DMTT), intended to be a qualified domestic top-up tax (QDMTT), which requires large groups (including those operating exclusively in the United Kingdom) to pay a top-up tax where their UK operations have an effective rate of less than 15%.


Both were enacted as part of Finance (No. 2) Act 2023 and apply for accounting periods beginning on or after 31 December 2023.
The United Kingdom has also introduced legislation in Finance Bill 2024-5 which, when enacted, will introduce an Under Taxed Profits Rule (UTPR) in the United Kingdom which will take effect for accounting periods beginning on or after 31 December 2024.
  * Finance (No. 2) Act 2024 included amendments to the Energy (Oil and Gas) Profits Levy Act 2022 to include the new Energy Security Investment Mechanism (ESIM). This new mechanism has an impact on the application of the Energy Profits Levy (EPL). 
  * From 1 April 2024, the scope of Tonnage Tax was extended to include elections into the regime by companies that manage qualifying ships, and the capital allowance limit for persons who lease ships to companies within Tonnage Tax was increased. 
  * An Enhanced R&D Intensive Support (ERIS) regime was introduced for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 April 2024, requiring 30% of total group expenditure to be on qualifying R&D to enable a loss-making company to benefit from the regime. 
  * A new merged R&D scheme was enacted in Finance Act 2024. The merged scheme applies to accounting periods commencing on or after 1 April 2024. This includes new rules regarding subcontracting and the eligibility of overseas costs.


  * From 1 April 2023, the annual investment allowance (AIA) for capital expenditure became permanent at a rate of 1 million pounds sterling (GBP). 
  * In Finance Act 2024, the 2026 end date for full expensing is removed, resulting in full expensing becoming permanent. The full expensing First Year Allowance (FYA) is available for capital expenditure incurred by companies . Full expensing provides a 100% FYA in year 1 for main pool plant and machinery qualifying expenditure (with certain exclusions). Additionally, expenditure qualifying for special rate pool plant and machinery allowances could now benefit from a 50% FYA in year 1 under full expensing. 
  * The first year allowance (FYA) for qualifying expenditure on zero-emission cars and the 100% FYA for qualifying expenditure on plant or machinery for electric vehicle charge points, will be extended to 31 March 2026 for corporation tax purposes and 5 April 2026 for income tax purposes.
  * For accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2023 for corporate tax purposes, or 6 April 2024 for income tax purposes, new transfer pricing records rules apply. UK entities are in scope of the new rules if they are part of a multinational enterprise (MNE) group that meets the ‘MNE country-by-country (CbC) reporting threshold’, which is global consolidated turnover greater than 750 million euros (EUR) in a given financial year (guidance is given for determining whether the CbC reporting threshold is breached where the UK entity and MNE group have non-coterminous year-ends). Those UK entities that meet the MNE CbC reporting threshold in a given accounting period are required to keep specific transfer pricing records for that same accounting period, including a Master File and Local File, as per the 2022 OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, in relation to ‘material controlled transactions’ (subject to certain exemptions).
  * On 4 July 2023, His Majesty’s (HM) Treasury made the Taxes (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) (Country-by-Country Reporting) (Amendment) Regulations 2023 (SI 2023/752), and this was laid before Parliament on 5 July 2023. The effect of these changes is broadly the removal of the annual year-end CbC reporting notification obligations in the United Kingdom for many MNE groups, albeit there still remain some specific scenarios where a UK notification may still be required (e.g. where a surrogate of the MNE group is filing a CbC report [e.g. to avail itself of Exception B under the legislation]). 
  * The value-added tax (VAT) registration threshold has increased from GBP 85,000 to GBP 90,000, effective from 1 April 2024.
  * Following the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union (EU), the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Act was enacted in 2023. This act makes provision for significant changes to the status and operation of retained European law. In order to prevent the repeal of several EU derived UK VAT and excise provisions as a result of this act, Finance Act 2024 included specific provisions for retained EU law relating to VAT, excise, and customs duty. As a consequence, UK VAT and excise law that was in force prior to 1 January 2021 (EU exit day) will continue to be interpreted in line with EU law principles.


## Forthcoming changes
Forthcoming changes include:
  * As noted above, legislation was introduced in Finance Bill 2024-5 which, when enacted, will implement an UTPR in the United Kingdom. The UTPR will take effect for accounting periods beginning on or after 31 December 2024 and will supplement the IIR and DMTT that were enacted in Finance (No.2) Act 2023 and took effect for accounting periods beginning on or after 31 December 2023.
  * Legislation has been introduced in Finance Bill 2024-5 which, when enacted, will abolish the Offshore Receipts in respect of Intangible Property (ORIP) rules in respect of income arising from 31 December 2024. The repeal of the ORIP rules will take place alongside the introduction of the UTPR, which the government considers will more comprehensively discourage the multinational tax-planning arrangements that ORIP sought to counter.


## Consultations and proposals - ongoing
The most significant proposals, which include announced proposals and those in draft legislation, and those subject to consultations include:
### **Measures focused on domestic matters**
  * A range of specific and narrow anti-avoidance rules.
  * Further reforms regarding collection of taxes, application of penalties, and related issues focused on tax evasion.
  * The Office of Tax Simplification (OTS) has undertaken a capital gains tax review. Its first report outlining their proposals for the simplification of capital gains tax was published in November 2020. It is not clear when the government will make any decisions in respect of this. A second report on simplifying key practical, technical, and administrative capital gains tax issues was published in May 2021. Following this report, some small changes have been made.
  * On 30 November 2021, following a consultation process, the government announced its response to the review of large businesses’ experiences of UK tax administration.
  * A consultation was also launched on 30 November 2021 on the proposed replacement of the existing EU Mandatory Disclosure Rules (MDR) with regulations that broadly follow the OECD model:
    * On 24 November 2022, HMRC published a summary of the responses it received.
    * On 17 January 2023, the International Tax Enforcement (Disclosable Arrangements) Regulations 2023 were laid before the House of Commons. These regulations implement the OECD MDR and came into force on 28 March 2023; the regulations implementing EU MDR were also repealed on this date.
    * The consultation document had proposed that pre-existing arrangements entered into since 29 October 2014 would be reportable under OECD MDR. However, HMRC has now confirmed that reporting of pre-existing arrangements will only be required from 25 June 2018 (the date of commencement of EU MDR) and that any arrangements reported under EU MDR will not be reportable under OECD MDR. Any reports will have to be made online using XML software; there will not be a manual reporting system.
  * On 27 April 2023, as part of its response to a review of the UK funds regime, the government published a consultation on a new unauthorised UK contractual scheme that would be open to certain investors. The proposed new scheme is the ‘Reserved Investor Fund’ (RIF) and is likely to be particularly relevant in relation to investment in UK real estate. Draft regulations intended to implement the RIF were published for consultation in April 2024. The process is currently on hold following the General Election in July 2024, although the Labour Government did in the Autumn Budget state their intention to proceed with the proposals.
  * On 27 April 2023, HMRC published a consultation on ‘Stamp Taxes on Shares modernisation’. It is widely accepted that the current stamp taxes system is very outdated, and HMRC have set out their proposals for how the Stamp Taxes on Shares framework should be modernised.
  * Finance Bill 2024-25 contains measures to increase the rate of Energy Profits Levy (EPL) by 3% to 38% with effect for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 November 2024; to abolish the levy’s 29% investment allowance from 1 November 2024 and to cut the rate of the decarbonisation allowance from 80% to 66% from the same date. In addition, the EPL is proposed to continue until 31 March 2030. 


  * The government continues to review the UK oil and gas fiscal regime and engage with the energy sector on future changes. The outcome from the most recent call for evidence was confirmation from the government of the core principles that will direct future policy decisions.
  * A consultation has taken place for the introduction of a UK Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) from 1 January 2027. The UK CBAM is intended to place a carbon price on certain industrial goods imported to the United Kingdom, including from the aluminium, cement, ceramics, fertiliser, glass, hydrogen, iron, and steel sectors. The aim of the UK CBAM is to mitigate the risk of carbon leakage, which occurs when production shifts to jurisdictions with lower or no carbon pricing, and to support the UK's transition to net zero emissions by 2050.The consultation sets out the government's proposals for the design, implementation, and administration of the CBAM and invites views from stakeholders, including importers, domestic producers, overseas exporters, trade bodies, and other interested parties. The consultation covers the following aspects of the CBAM:
    * The sectoral and product scope, which will include aluminium, cement, ceramics, fertilisers, glass, hydrogen, iron, and steel. 
    * The calculation of the CBAM liability, including emissions reporting, default values, the UK’s carbon price, and adjustments for carbon prices applicable overseas.
    * The administration, payment, and compliance of the UK CBAM, including the CBAM tax point, registration thresholds, reporting, payment, and other compliance requirements for liable persons and their agents.
  * HM Treasury and HMRC continue to consult on whether broader changes could be made to simplify the existing capital allowances legislation. This exercise has been limited to the plant and machinery part of the Capital Allowances Act 2001. The consultation does not seek to increase or alter the types of expenditure/assets that fall within the scope of plant and machinery allowances. 
  * The Autumn Budget 2024 confirmed that there is a continued consideration of extending full expensing to assets that are bought for leasing or hiring when fiscal conditions permit such a move. As part of a consultation exercise in 2024, HM Treasury began exploring and identifying solutions that support the leasing sector to access the benefits of full expensing (as enjoyed by other companies), whilst managing the risks of abuse and error.
  * Following Gunfleet Sands Ltd and others vs. HMRC (2023) decision on predevelopment costs a consultation will be published in late 2024 or early 2025, with impacted stakeholders, to understand the impact of the case and tax legislation and explore the options for change. This will be with the intention to encourage investment in large development projects. 


  * Land remediation relief provides a 150% tax deduction for companies remediating and making safe previously contaminated or derelict land (where various conditions are met). A consultation will be published to review the effectiveness of Land Remediation Relief in Spring 2025. 


  * A consultation on widening the use of advance clearances in the R&D reliefs will be launched in 2025. This is a welcome announcement for many businesses who anticipate challenges in applying the complex changes within the merged regime, particularly around the contracting rules. 
  * In the Autumn Budget 2024 the Government published a Corporate Tax Roadmap which aims to provide predictability, stability and certainty to businesses and investors. Its key features include capping the main rate of corporation tax at 25% for the duration of the Parliament whilst ensuring that the UK’s regime remains competitive.The small profits rate and marginal relief will be maintained at their current rates and thresholds. A consultation on corporate tax administration will be launched in Spring 2025, to develop a process through which investors in major projects can obtain increased tax certainty in advance.


Measures focused on international matters
  * Following a consultation, the UK government announced in April 2022 that it intends to introduce a re-domiciliation regime, which will make it possible for companies incorporated outside the United Kingdom to move their domicile to and relocate to the United Kingdom whilst retaining their legal personality. An expert panel was subsequently convened to explore the options and advise the government on how best to establish a UK corporate re-domiciliation framework and the panel published its report on 14 October 2024. The report suggests how various components of the regime could work and, most notably, strongly supports the introduction of a two-way re-domiciliation regime to allow UK companies to re-domicile outside the UK as well as those registered outside the UK to become a UK company. Whilst the panel has made quite detailed proposals, it recommended that there should be further consultation once the Government has decided on more detailed proposals.
  * The government consulted on changes to the existing tax exemptions available to sovereign immune bodies but concluded that no changes should be made. 
  * Following the introduction of the new transfer pricing documentation requirements, HMRC decided not to implement the Summary Audit Trail (SAT), but the final regulations provide HMRC with the power to introduce such a requirement at a later date. A public consultation on this requirement was expected to take place, however, given the areas of further consultation announced in the Autumn Budget 2024 (see below) this is now not expected in the near future. _This are discussed in Transfer pricing documentation in the_ _section_.
  * On 19 June 2023, the government published a consultation document asking for views on proposed reforms to transfer pricing, permanent establishment (PE), and Diverted Profits Tax (DPT) to ensure that the application of these rules is clear and the outcome of their application remains consistent with the policy intention, international standards, and the UK’s tax treaties. The consultation closed on 14 August 2023, and on 16 January 2024 HMRC published a summary of responses received.  _These are discussed in the_ _, , and sections, respectively._ Following the 2023 consultation, the Autumn Budget 2024 contained updates on a number of transfer pricing matters on which further consultation is expected in 2025:
  * The potential removal of medium-sized groups from the current transfer pricing SME exemption. .
  * The potential removal of UK-UK transactions from the UK transfer pricing legislation. .
  * The potential introduction of a new annual reporting requirement, the International Dealing Schedule (IDS). .
  * A review of the transfer pricing treatment of cost contribution arrangements, where the costs and benefits of developing intellectual property are shared by group companies, will be undertaken to ensure the rules are certain and do not act as a deterrent to investment.




# United Kingdom
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 15 December 2024
## Taxable period
Companies are assessed by reference to tax accounting periods. Normally, the accounting period is the period for which the company makes up its statutory accounts. However, a tax accounting period for corporation tax purposes cannot exceed 12 months, so companies preparing statutory accounts for longer than 12 months need to prepare more than one corporation tax return. Note that the maximum period that statutory accounts can be made up for is 18 months.
For non-resident companies subject to corporation tax on capital gains in respect of certain direct or indirect disposals of UK immovable property, where the company is not otherwise within the charge to UK tax, there may be a one-day accounting period and special rules apply (including the tax payment date).
## Tax returns
Companies must file their corporation tax return within one year from the end of the accounting period; the return must include a self-assessment of the tax payable, eliminating the need for assessment by HMRC (though HMRC retains assessing powers for certain cases where it is not satisfied with the return, or where the company fails to make a return).
### **Electronic filing requirements**
Returns must be filed online, and such returns must be filed in a specified format that is machine readable by the tax authorities. The accompanying accounts must also be in iXBRL format.
## Payment of tax
For smaller companies, corporation tax is payable nine months and one day after the end of the accounting period to which it relates (i.e. before the return must be filed). For larger companies and groups, a system of quarterly payments on account (based on estimated profits) is in place, with the first payment being due in the seventh month of the accounting period concerned. A company will generally be considered large for this purpose in any accounting period in which it has taxable profits in excess of GBP 1.5 million (that limit being reduced by reference to the number of companies under common control, where relevant).
For accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2019, the companies with profits over GBP 20 million (that limit being reduced by reference to the number of companies under common control, where relevant) will have earlier quarterly payments dates, with tax due in the third, sixth, ninth, and 12th months of the period concerned.
### **Penalties**
The UK tax system can impose numerous penalties for failing to adhere to the self-assessment system. These include penalties for late filing of returns, failing to maintain appropriate records, submitting an incorrect return, making errors in certain documents sent to HMRC, unreasonably failing to report errors in assessments by HMRC, and failing to respond to a formal notice of information requested from the tax authorities within the specified time limit.
New provisions were introduced by Finance Act 2022 for 'electronic sales suppression' (ESS) to create new penalties for the possession, making, supplying, or promotion of tools that facilitate ESS. There are also new ESS-specific information powers. ESS is where businesses manipulate electronic records of sales data, either during or after the point of sale, in order to hide or reduce the value of individual transactions. This is done to reduce the recorded turnover of the business and corresponding tax liabilities, whilst providing what appears to be a credible and compliant audit trail.
## Other filing requirements
The filing member of a group that is within the scope of the MTT or DTT must register with HMRC within six months of the end of the first accounting period in which they will be in scope.
The filing member will later be required to submit a self assessment return and GloBE Information Return (GIR) for each accounting period in which the group qualifies for MTT and/or DTT. If an Information Return has already been submitted to a qualifying authority outside the UK, then an overseas return notification can be submitted instead of the GIR. These returns must be submitted within 15 months of the end of the accounting period to which they relate, or within 18 months in the case of the first in-scope period. A penalty is payable if the filing entity fails to submit the necessary returns by the deadline, unless the filing entity satisfies HMRC that it has a reasonable excuse for the failure. 
In-scope businesses will have reporting obligations even if there is no tax liability.
Those groups with a liability to MTT and/or DTT must pay the amount due within 15 months of the end of the accounting period concerned, or within 18 months of that time where the payment relates to the first accounting period in relation to which a group is in-scope. Interest will accrue on amounts payable if not paid within the deadline.
Large companies or groups (those with aggregated UK turnover greater than GBP 200 million or balance sheet assets over GBP 2 billion) are required to notify HMRC of the identity of their ‘Senior Accounting Officer’ (SAO), who then must certify annually that the accounting systems are adequate for the purposes of accurate tax reporting. Penalties are chargeable on the officer and the company for careless or deliberate failure to meet these obligations, and on a failure to notify HMRC who is the SAO. Large companies () and groups within CbC reporting must also publish online annually a statement of their UK tax strategy. Again, penalties are chargeable on the responsible company for failure to meet these obligations.
Certain tax planning and structuring transactions and arrangements must be disclosed to HMRC either before or on implementation of the transaction under the Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes (DOTAS) regime or the Disclosure of Avoidance Schemes for VAT and Other Indirect Taxes (DASVOIT) regime. These schemes cover most taxes and are reporting systems only, with responsibility placed on taxpayers, advisors, or promoters to report. HMRC are not required to respond to the reporting, and this is not an advance clearance or approval process. It is a reporting mechanism only, and, on occasions, new legislation has been introduced to block specific arrangements reported.
Under the EU Mandatory Disclosure Regime (EU MDR), from 25 June 2018, certain cross-border transactions need to be reported to HMRC. The Directive broadly relates to all direct taxes, and specifically excludes most indirect taxes. The rules require all arrangements that meet certain conditions to be reported. Following the agreement of the EU/UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement in December 2020, the obligation to report an arrangement to HMRC has been limited to cross-border arrangements meeting the Category D hallmarks. These hallmarks relate to arrangements that may have the effect of undermining reporting obligations under the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) or which involve ownership structures where the beneficial owners are made unidentifiable, and are consistent with the OECD’s model MDR rules. Penalties will be imposed for failure to comply with the reporting obligation. These penalties can range from GBP 5,000 to GBP 1 million or more depending on the circumstances and conduct of the intermediary or taxpayer.
As noted above, a consultation was launched on 30 November 2021 on the proposed replacement of EU MDR with regulations that broadly follow the OECD model. On 24 November 2022, HMRC published a summary of the responses received and confirmed that regulations implementing OECD MDR will come into force in the first half of 2023 and regulations implementing EU MDR will be repealed. The consultation document had proposed that pre-existing arrangements entered into since 29 October 2014 would be reportable under OECD MDR. However, HMRC has now confirmed that reporting of pre-existing arrangements will only be required from 25 June 2018 (the date of commencement of EU MDR) and that any arrangements reported under EU MDR will not be reportable under OECD MDR. Any reports will have to be made online, and there will not be a manual reporting system.
Starting from 1 April 2022, large businesses (corporates and partnerships) need to disclose to HMRC ‘uncertain tax treatments' (UTTs) in partnership, corporation tax, VAT, and PAYE returns due to be filed on or after this date. The stated objective of the new rules is to reduce the legal interpretation portion of the annual ‘tax gap’ estimated by the government between taxes the government says are due and taxes collected. The UTT regime works by the business flagging, at an early stage, particular uncertain areas that may not be apparent from tax returns, such as where there is an accounting provision or where the tax treatment applied is not HMRC’s known position on the particular point. The rule applies where the tax amount involved is more than GBP 5 million, subject to a number of exemptions.
## Tax audit process and governance
The UK corporation tax process is one of self-assessment. Following filing of the tax return, HMRC has a period of (usually) 12 months in which to raise formal enquiries. These can range from simple information requests to detailed technical challenges over treatments adopted in the tax return.
These enquiries are often settled between the taxpayer company and HMRC by exchange of information and correspondence. Where agreement cannot be reached, arbitration or litigation may be necessary.
HMRC has certain powers to demand information and, in some circumstances, to enter premises to obtain documents, etc. These powers are rarely used, and there are no routine visits by HMRC officials to taxpayer premises.
### **Corporate criminal offences (CCOs)**
The CCOs were introduced in September 2017. This legislation outlines the failure to prevent the facilitation of tax evasion, with the rules applying to all companies and partnerships in the United Kingdom and also foreign entities with a UK nexus.
The offences can only be committed by a 'relevant body', which means only incorporated bodies and partnerships. The offences cannot be committed by natural persons. ‘Associated persons’ under the legislation are those acting for or on behalf of the organisation and can include employees, agents, or third-party service providers, as well as other group companies. The consequences of committing an offence under this legislation could include criminal prosecution, an unlimited financial penalty, ancillary or confiscation orders, and severe reputational damage.
### **Senior Accounting Officer (SAO) and tax strategy publication**
Large companies (those with aggregated turnover greater than GBP 200 million or balance sheet assets over GBP 2 billion) are required to notify HMRC of the identity of their SAO. Each year, the SAO must personally certify to HMRC that there are ‘appropriate tax accounting arrangements’ in place as part of their main duty to ensure the accuracy of those arrangements. Penalties of GBP 5,000 each are chargeable on the officer and the company for careless or deliberate failure to meet these obligations, including failure to meet the main duty requirement. 
Large companies and groups must also publish online a statement of their UK tax strategy, which should be reviewed and updated annually. Penalties are chargeable on the responsible company for failure to meet these obligations. In addition to the thresholds for SAO above, a UK company or group that is part of an MNE group that meets the OECD’s CbC reporting framework threshold of global turnover over EUR 750 million also needs to publish a tax strategy. 
The recent Transfer Pricing Records Regulations 2023 and HMRC’s guidance indicate that maintaining the specified transfer pricing records is part of the SAO responsibilities. _See 'Transfer pricing documentation' in the section_ _for further details_.
### Notification of uncertain tax treatments (UTTs)
With effect from April 2022, large businesses (), including partnerships, must comply with a new requirement to disclose to HMRC UTTs () in corporation tax, VAT, and PAYE returns due to be filed on or after 1 April 2022. 
A notification is required where there is an uncertain tax treatment that has a tax advantage of more than GBP 5 million for each relevant period. The penalty amount varies according to whether it is:
  * a first failure, resulting in a penalty of GBP 5,000, where the company or partnership has not, in any of the preceding three financial years, been assessed to a notification penalty in respect of the same relevant tax
  * a second failure, resulting in a penalty of GBP 25,000, where the company or partnership has been assessed to a first failure notification penalty and not already incurred a second penalty in the preceding three financial years in respect of the same relevant tax, or
  * a further failure, resulting in a penalty of GBP 50,000, where the company or partnership has been assessed to a second penalty or further failure penalty in the preceding three financial years in respect of the same relevant tax.


The stated objective of the new rules is to reduce the legal interpretation portion of the tax gap by flagging, at an early stage, uncertain areas that may not be apparent from tax returns. HMRC estimates that GBP 3.2 billion of the estimated GBP 5.8 billion of the 2019/20 tax gap is attributable to large businesses.
### **Tackling promoters of tax avoidance**
On 25 February 2022, further measures to clamp down on 'promoters' of tax avoidance were introduced by the Finance Act 2022. The legislation grants HMRC various new powers to tackle tax avoidance, including: (i) ability to freeze a promoter’s assets so that the penalties they are liable for are paid, (ii) deter offshore promoters by introducing a new penalty on the UK entities that support them, (iii) provide for the closing down of companies and partnerships that promote tax avoidance schemes, and (iv) support taxpayers to steer clear of avoidance schemes or exit avoidance quickly by sharing more information on promoters and their schemes.
## General anti-abuse rule (GAAR)
The GAAR applies to income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax, petroleum revenue tax, diverted profits tax, apprenticeship levy, inheritance tax (IHT), SDLT, and ATED, but not VAT. It is targeted at changing behaviour of taxpayers who enter what might be considered to be abusive tax avoidance arrangements. The process includes a quasi-judicial review of the arrangements, the outcome of which must be used as evidence in any related tax litigation.
The government has stressed that the GAAR is only intended to apply to abusive tax avoidance arrangements, which are measured by reference to various indicators, some of which are subjective.
## Statute of limitations
For companies that are members of medium or large groups, there is generally a period of one year after the statutory filing dates for the tax authorities to start an enquiry into any aspect of the return. For other companies, enquiries can be started up to 12 months after the date of actual filing. These periods are extended for returns submitted after the filing deadline, that are amended by the taxpayer, or where an issue is subsequently discovered that was not sufficiently disclosed within the standard period. Longer periods apply in the event of inadequate disclosure or deliberate misfiling.
## Large businesses tax administration
Following a consultation process, on 30 November 2021, the government announced its response to the review of large businesses’ experiences of UK tax administration, including the degree to which it provides businesses with early certainty where appropriate, ensures the efficient resolution of disputes in accordance with the law, and promotes a collaborative and constructive approach to compliance with the law. The review explored current challenges and areas for improvement, with a particular focus on tax risk and certainty, compliance, enquiries and disputes, and the co-operative compliance and customer compliance manager (CCM) model. As a result of this review, the government announced some actions to improve tax administration for large businesses and make the United Kingdom an easier place to do business in three main areas: (i) mitigating uncertainty through new guidelines for compliance and improved guidance, (ii) changes to help address long-running enquiries with reference made to particular challenges faced in transfer pricing enquiries, and (iii) improving the co-operative compliance experience. In 2022, HMRC launched workstreams in these three areas in order to address these issues.


# United Kingdom
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 15 December 2024
UK incorporated companies are generally treated as UK tax resident. The exception to that general rule is that companies resident in the United Kingdom under domestic law but treated as solely resident in a different country under that country's DTT with the United Kingdom are not treated as UK tax resident for the purposes of UK domestic tax law.
Additionally, subject to the above exception, companies incorporated overseas are also treated as UK tax resident if their central management and control is situated in the United Kingdom. This means if the place of the highest form of control and direction over a company's affairs, as opposed to decisions on the day-to-day running of the business, is in the United Kingdom.
As noted above, following a consultation, the UK government announced in April 2022 that it intends to introduce a re-domiciliation regime, which will make it possible for companies incorporated outside the United Kingdom to move their domicile to and relocate to the United Kingdom whilst retaining their legal personality. The expert panel that was subsequently convened to explore the options and advise the government on how best to establish a UK corporate re-domiciliation framework published its report on 14 October 2024. The report suggests how various components of the regime could work and, most notably, strongly supports the introduction of a two-way re-domiciliation regime to allow UK companies to re-domicile outside the UK as well as those registered outside the UK to become a UK company. Whilst the panel has made quite detailed proposals, it recommended that there should be further consultation once the Government has decided on more detailed proposals.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
For non-resident companies, the liability to corporation tax generally depends on the existence of any kind of PE through which a trade is carried on. However, there are a number of exceptions to this general rule that apply to income and gains arising on UK property. A non-UK resident company will be subject to UK tax on the following types of profit even if there is no UK trading PE:
  * Trading profits attributable to a trade of dealing in or developing UK land.
  * Gains that arise on the direct, and certain indirect, disposals of UK immovable property.
  * Profits of a UK property rental business.


The meaning of PE for UK tax purposes is set out in statute; it is largely based on the OECD Model Tax Convention definition, but it is not identical in all respects. Subject to the terms of the relevant DTT, a non-resident company will have a PE in the United Kingdom if:
  * it has a fixed place of business in the United Kingdom through which the business of the company is wholly or partly carried on, or
  * an agent acting on behalf of the company has and habitually exercises authority to do business on behalf of the company in the United Kingdom.


A fixed place of business includes (but is not limited to) a place of management; a branch; an office; a factory; a workshop; an installation or structure for the exploration of natural resources; a mine, oil or gas well, quarry, or other place of extraction of natural resources; or a building, construction, or installation project. However, a company is not regarded as having a UK PE if the activities for which the fixed place of business is maintained or which the agent carries on are only of a preparatory or auxiliary nature (also defined in the statute). From 1 January 2019, this will not be the case where the non-resident has artificially fragmented their business operations to avoid coming within the charge to corporation tax.
The OECD, under Action 7 of its BEPS Action Plan, recommended a widening of the scope of the PE definition in Article 5 of the OECD Model Tax Convention, with the intention that the amended definition would be incorporated into bilateral double taxation conventions via the multilateral instrument (MLI). The United Kingdom ratified the MLI in 2018, and it is now effective in relation to covered DTTs; however, the United Kingdom has only adopted limited elements of the PE articles in the MLI.
As part of the consultation HMRC launched in relation to the UK PE legislation (as well as other international tax matters) back in June 2023, HMRC focused on what the reference point should be for the definition of a PE in domestic legislation and the determination of the profits attributable to it. The options under consideration were:
  * To define a UK PE and attribute profits by direct reference in domestic legislation to the PE and Business Profits Articles (usually Articles 5 and 7) in the relevant DTT, subject to certain restrictions. Where no treaty is in place, Articles 5 and 7 of the 2017 OECD Model could be used.
  * To define a UK PE by reference to Article 5 and align PE attribution with Article 7, respectively, of the current OECD Model, which would be subject to the relevant DTT.


One particular consequence of the second option would be the extension of the domestic definition of a PE for the first time as a result of the amended 2017 OECD Model wording in relation to 'dependent agent' PEs, whereby:
  * Such PEs would include someone who “habitually plays the principal role leading to the conclusion of contracts that are routinely concluded without material modification by the enterprise”, without the need for them to actually conclude the contracts.
  * The 'independent agent' exemption from PE status would not apply where “a person acts exclusively or almost exclusively on behalf of one or more enterprises to which it is closely related”.


Although the United Kingdom signed up to the Multilateral Instrument (MLI), which implemented a range of tax treaty measures coming out of the BEPS project, it did not adopt the MLI measures in relation to dependent agent PEs, which would otherwise have incorporated the above amendments into a number of the UK’s treaties, depending on the treaty partner position in each case. At this stage, we are not aware that the UK intends to change its positions regarding the MLI; consequently, the impact might be limited to situations where there is no DTT or where a new treaty is negotiated to include the expanded definition, but the above changes would enable such a change in MLI policy to be implemented very quickly were this MLI policy position to change in the future.
Special rules exist to explain how the PE's profits should be evaluated for UK tax purposes (_see the section for more information_).
As noted above, the Government has announced that it will further consult on reforms to the UK PE legislation in Spring 2025.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 15 December 2024
_As noted in the section_ , the UK tax system requires taxable profits to be calculated by aggregating (i) the company's net income from each source and (ii) the company's net chargeable gains arising from the sale of capital assets. This approach gives rise to a particularly complicated regime so far as deductions are concerned. Expenses are usually allocated to the source of income (or occasionally by reference to income generally) or to the particular gain to which they relate. The rules governing their deductibility differ according to whether the expense relates to a capital gain or to income, and, indeed, according to the particular source of income concerned. For example, there is a considerable difference in the manner in which tax relief is given for expenses incurred by companies trading in property as compared to those that invest in property. The regime also has a large number of specific rules dealing with particular types of deductions that take priority over the more general rules for each type of income.
We have therefore set out the general rule for trading expenses, being the most common category, and, following that analysis, considered some specific common exceptions.
## General rules for trading expenses
A trading company is generally permitted to deduct expenses that are incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the company's trade, provided those costs are not capital in nature and are charged to the profit and loss account. There is a significant amount of case law surrounding whether expenses have been incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of a company's trade and whether they are capital or not.
Relief is generally given in the period the expenses are accrued in the accounts, subject to some specific exceptions. In particular, contributions to a registered pension scheme are only allowed on a 'paid' basis, with some further provisions under which some contributions may be spread over a number of years; and if bonuses and other staff costs are paid out more than nine months after the end of the accounting period in which they are accrued, they are only allowed on a paid basis.
The general rule is made subject to a range of specific statutory provisions, some of which allow deductions and others of which limit them; some of the more important of these are discussed below, but there are many others. One example is that the costs of business entertainment cannot generally be deducted.
The United Kingdom has introduced rules dealing with hybrid mismatches, broadly intended to implement the recommendations in Action 2 of the OECD’s BEPS project, which took effect on 1 January 2017. They are complex, may apply to a broad spectrum of situations, and require careful consideration. At a high level, they effectively seek to address the situations where there is either: (i) a mismatch between the deduction that arises and the income that is taxed or (ii) a deduction taken into account in two jurisdictions. This could arise in situations involving a hybrid entity (such as a US company for which the check-the-box election has been made), a hybrid instrument (e.g. one that is treated as debt for one party but equity for the other), or dual resident companies, etc. Where a mismatch is caught by these rules, a disallowance may be required in the computation.
## Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation of fixed assets (other than certain assets within the intangible fixed asset regime, ) is not allowable as a deduction from any source of income. However, traders, and most non-traders, are instead allowed specified rates of annual deduction in respect of specified classes of assets, together referred to as 'capital allowances', that are deducted in calculating trading income for traders and (broadly) against income derived from the use of the fixed assets for non-traders.
There are several different categories of capital allowances, each attracting a unique rate of tax relief, and fixed asset expenditure is allocated to one of these as follows:
  * Main pool plant and machinery: 18% writing down allowances  on the reducing-balance basis on certain equipment, plant, and machinery acquired for use in a trade or property rental business. Note that a temporary super deduction regime (providing up to a 130% deduction) existed from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2023; this was replaced by the full expensing First Year Allowance (FYA) () providing a 100% first year deduction for relevant main pool plant and machinery (at the increased corporation tax rate of 25%). Full expensing was made permanent in Finance Act 2024.
  * Special rate pool plant and machinery: 6% writing down allowances on integral features in building (e.g. heating and ventilation), thermal insulation, expenditure incurred after 1 April 2018 on cars with carbon dioxide emissions that exceed 110 grams per kilometre driven, and long-life assets (over 25 years). Note that from 1 April 2021, a 50% FYA regime has existed (in different forms) for relevant special rate pool expenditure (exclusions include cars). This measure was made permanent in Finance Act 2024.
  * R&D allowances: 100% FYA in respect of assets, including buildings, used to carry out qualifying R&D.
  * Structures and buildings allowances (SBAs): 3%  on a straight-line basis on structures and buildings not used in a residential capacity. 
  * Cars: 100%, 18%, or 6%, depending on the CO2 emissions of the car.


No income tax relief is available on non-qualifying assets and expenditure, which includes almost all expenditure on land.
Generous temporary reliefs were introduced in the 2021 Budget in respect of main pool and special rate pool expenditure, as follows: 
  * The super-deduction provides up to 130% FYA for expenditure that qualifies for main pool plant and machinery (this percentage pro-rates down to 100% as the tax rate increases, giving a continuous effective tax rate saving of approximately 25%).
  * A 50% FYA is available for expenditure incurred on assets qualifying for the special rate pool (normally at 6%).
  * There are a number of restrictions to the expenditure that qualify for the super-deduction and 50% FYA, including plant and machinery used for leasing (excluding background plant and machinery). The above applies to new expenditure incurred from 1 April 2021 through to 31 March 2023 only where contracts for the expenditure were entered into on or after 3 March 2021.
  * An enhanced 10% rate of SBA for constructing or renovating non-residential structures and buildings within Freeport tax sites or Investment zones. An enhanced capital allowance of 100% for companies investing in any plant and machinery for use in Freeport/Investment tax sites.


The above temporary reliefs were replaced by an accelerated UK tax relief for capital expenditure incurred by companies from 1 April 2023, essentially continuing the effective approximately 25% rate of tax relief offered by the existing super-deduction regime. Whilst originally expected to run until 31 March 2026, at the 2023 Autumn Statement, the government has since made this relief permanent.
Full expensing provides a 100% FYA in year 1 for main pool (MP) plant and machinery qualifying expenditure incurred by a company (with certain exclusions) as opposed to the prevailing 18% MP writing down allowance .
Additionally, expenditure incurred by companies qualifying for special rate pool (SRP) plant and machinery allowances, ordinarily receiving 6% SRP writing down allowance , now benefits from a 50% FYA in year 1 under full expensing; note that this regime operates in a slightly different way to the 50% SR allowance that accompanied the super-deduction.
As an FYA, full expensing on expenditure incurred in a given period must be claimed in the respective UK tax return. Claims must therefore be prepared on a timely basis and cannot be deferred to future periods.
There is no definitive list of assets that qualify for tax relief through capital allowances, and it is important to consider tax legislation, case law, and HMRC guidance when identifying qualifying expenditure.
Most businesses, regardless of size, can claim an annual investment allowance (AIA) of 100% on the first GBP 1 million per year of most qualifying expenditure. This is restricted to a single allowance for groups of companies or associated businesses. SBAs apply to qualifying expenditure incurred on or after 29 October 2018. In brief, relief is given at a 3% flat rate and is available for new commercial structures and buildings, including costs for new conversions or renovations, where a contract is entered into and works commence on or after 29 October 2018.
Capital allowances may also be available in respect of the cost of the acquisition of mineral assets and extraction, generally at the rates of 10% and 25%.
Excess capital allowances are generally recaptured on disposal. The recapture is calculated on a 'pool' basis for most machinery and equipment, in which case there is no recapture unless the sale proceeds exceeds the total tax written down value of the pooled assets or on cessation of a qualifying activity. Where claims for the super-deduction, full expensing, R&D allowances (RDAs), or either of the 50% FYAs have been made, there will typically be a full clawback of the disposal proceeds in the period of disposal, resulting in a tax charge arising at that point.
Where assets are leased, capital allowances are generally not available to the lessor and can sometimes be available to the lessee. The rate of capital allowance of most plant or machinery leased to non-residents businesses is generally restricted to 10%, but in some cases to nil.
### **Intangible fixed assets**
A special regime applies to intangible assets, such as patent rights, know-how, trademarks, and goodwill. Royalties are generally deductible on an accounts basis, and, except in relation to 'grandfathered' assets owned by the group on 31 March 2002, the accounts' amortisation of intangible assets is also deductible (with an option to take a flat 4% deduction even if not amortised in the accounts). Traders will take the deductions in computing trading income; non-traders will create a 'non-trading loss on intangible fixed assets' that can be relieved as a loss against any profits of the year or carried forward indefinitely.
With effect for acquisition of goodwill and customer-related intangibles on or after 8 July 2015, amortisation, impairment, and certain other charges are not deductible for tax. Subsequent profits and losses on disposals of such goodwill remain taxable/deductible. However, from April 2019, there is relief for the cost of certain goodwill and customer-related intangibles when acquiring businesses with eligible IP.
Tax relief for expenditure on software that is capitalised as an intangible fixed asset can usually be received in line with the amortisation of the expenditure. Where such expenditure is capital in nature, it is possible to exclude the expenditure from the intangibles regime and for it to be treated as qualifying for plant and machinery allowances under the capital allowances regime. In certain circumstances, where such an election is made, the expenditure may qualify for the super-deduction or full expensing. Expenditure that would be considered revenue for tax purposes is not eligible for such an election.
Income costs relating to R&D are normally deductible in any event, but there is a special incentive connected with R&D that generally allows additional tax relief (_see the section for more information_).
## Management expenses
Holding companies and companies with investment business can deduct expenses if they are expenses of managing the company's investment business and are not capital in nature. Such costs would typically include audit fees, directors' costs, rent, local rates, and office costs. These costs can be set against any sources of profit the company may have, including gains and financing income.
If the company has inadequate income, excess expenses can be surrendered as group relief or carried forward to set against future income, with no time limit.
## Employee share schemes
The actual and deemed costs of an employing company for the deemed cost of providing shares or options to employees is usually deductible, depending on the nature of the share plan and the accounting. This will generally allow a deduction to a subsidiary company whose employees receive shares or options in the parent company.
## Funding costs
Funding costs (primarily fees and interest) are broadly deductible on an accounts basis, even if capital in nature, but subject to transfer pricing and thin capitalisation constraints (with no explicit safe harbours), hybrid mismatch rules (), and the corporate interest restriction (CIR) rules (). Some of these rules apply to foreign exchange deductions relating to debts owed and receivable.
Traders will generally take the deductions in computing trading income (which is also accounts based). Deductions relating to loans not used for trading purposes will give rise to 'non-trading deficits' that, if not group relieved, can be offset against profits of that year generally, carried back one year (against that year's funding profits), or carried forward indefinitely against non-trading profits (where the deficit arose before 1 April 2017) or against total profits (where the deficit arose on or after 1 April 2017).
There are complex and specific rules dealing with financial instruments, derivatives, cross-border transactions, etc.
From 1 April 2017, and subject to a GBP 2 million , the CIR rules impose a fixed ratio limiting corporation tax deductions for net interest expense to the higher of 30% of UK earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (UK EBITDA) and the group ratio (for highly geared groups). In addition, the net interest deduction of the UK group cannot exceed the net interest shown in the worldwide group’s consolidated financial statements. These rules replace the previous worldwide debt cap rules and will often operate to reduce the amount of tax deductions achieved by UK taxpayers.
## Bad debts, provisions, and reserves
Provisions for future costs can be deducted for tax purposes if they:
  * are in respect of allowable revenue expenditure
  * are made in accordance with acceptable accounting practice
  * do not conflict with any statutory rule governing the timing of relief (e.g. in relation to payment of staff costs), and
  * are estimated with sufficient accuracy.


This rule extends to bad debts on trading account. Generally, however, bad debts are dealt with under the 'loan relationships' rules for financing costs and financing income. The rules there, however, are broadly the same; if the bad debt can be identified specifically enough to allow a bad debt provision that satisfies UK accounting standards, it should be deductible.
## Charitable donations
Most donations to charities by companies are deductible.
## Fines, penalties, and bribes
Any payments that constitute a criminal offence (e.g. a bribe) are not deductible for tax. Fines and penalties imposed for breaking the law are also not deductible, although a deduction is usually available for legal costs incurred in defending such an action. Usually, there is no deduction for civil penalties, interest, and similar surcharges (e.g. relating to VAT). Fines for regulatory breaches are not allowed for tax, but the costs of compensating customers, etc. are usually deductible.
Damages that are compensatory rather than punitive (e.g. damages for defamation payable by a newspaper company) are often deductible, as are payments for breach of contract. Payments to employees for wrongful dismissal, etc. are usually deductible.
## Taxes
Local municipal taxes (business rates) may be deducted from taxable income.
## Net operating and capital losses
_See Income losses in the section for a description of the treatment of income losses and capital losses._
## Payments to foreign affiliates
There are no special rules for payments to foreign affiliates, so their tax treatment follows the basic rules for deductions set out above. The transfer pricing rules will impose an arm's-length price if the actual price is not arm’s length, provided that the resulting adjustment increases UK taxable profits or reduces UK taxable losses.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 15 December 2024
Each individual corporate group member is required to submit their own tax return on a stand-alone basis, with the exception of the election available with respect to VAT (). However, there are a variety of ways in which a company's relationship with fellow group members is recognised in the UK tax system for the purposes of corporation tax, VAT, SDLT, and stamp duty.
### **Corporation tax**
The corporation tax system includes a number of measures that advantage UK members of qualifying groups, all of which are subject to anti-avoidance measures.
Operating taxable profits and losses arising in the same period can usually be offset between UK resident 75% affiliates within a worldwide group (known as 'group relief') and certain non-UK resident 75% affiliates within the charge to UK corporation tax. There are some restrictions, primarily where one of the two companies is not an economic 75% subsidiary of the group or is subject to arrangements under which it might leave the group.
In very limited circumstances, a UK PE of a non-UK resident group member may also be able to surrender losses for group relief. However, the conditions that need to be satisfied in order to do so are very restrictive. Not only must the losses be attributable to activities of the PE that are within the charge to UK corporation tax and not exempt from tax under a DTT, but it is also necessary that no part of the loss may be relieved against the non-UK profits of any person in any period. This last condition means that the UK losses of a UK PE may only be surrendered for UK group relief where there is no possibility of relief for any part of those losses (or amounts corresponding to or representing them) in any foreign jurisdiction at any point in time. Prior to 27 October 2021, this last condition was relaxed for the UK PEs of European Economic Area (EEA) resident companies. However, following Brexit, this is no longer the case.
Until recently, group relief was also available for non-UK losses of EEA-resident group companies, subject to certain conditions. Following Brexit, such group relief for non-UK losses arising in accounting periods beginning on or after 26 October 2021 is no longer available (subject to special provisions where there are straddling accounting periods).
Losses arising on or after 1 April 2017 that cannot be used by the company or group relieved in the year are carried forward and can, subject to restrictions, be surrendered as group relief in a later year.
Intra-group transfers of capital assets between UK companies, including UK PEs (and non-UK companies within the charge to UK tax on gains in respect of UK immovable property or assets that derive at least 75% of their value from UK land where the company has a substantial indirect interest in that land) are normally tax-free, though the definition of group for these purposes is slightly different than the definition of group relief for losses. This treatment is also extended to intra-group transfers of loan relationships, derivatives, and intangibles. There is generally a 'degrouping' charge if the transferee company leaves the group within six years.
There is no automatic offset of capital gains and losses where these arise in different group companies, but it is normally possible for offset to be arranged either by actual transfer of the asset prior to disposal or by election.
In addition, the corporation tax system also has a number of measures that seek to prohibit groups unfairly manipulating the tax system by shifting profits between group members (either internationally or within the United Kingdom) in a way that is considered unacceptable, including the application of transfer pricing rules to transactions between UK entities.
The net interest deduction of a UK group is restricted to 30% of UK tax-EBITDA (or the group ratio for highly leveraged groups) and, in any case, cannot exceed the net interest shown in the worldwide group’s consolidated financial statements. _This is discussed under Funding costs in the section._
### **VAT**
Group companies can, subject to certain requirements, elect to account for VAT as if they were one taxable person; where this is done, no VAT is charged on intra-group supplies of goods or services. The registration is made in the name of the representative member, who is responsible for completing and rendering the single return on behalf of the group. All the companies are jointly and severally liable for any VAT debts. VAT grouping is subject to detailed anti-avoidance provisions.
### **Stamp duty and SDLT**
Transfers of shares or real estate within worldwide 75% groups are generally exempt from stamp duty or SDLT, respectively, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. For SDLT, the relief can be retrospectively withdrawn in certain circumstances, primarily where the transferee leaves the group within three years of the transfer.
## Transfer pricing and thin capitalisation
The United Kingdom has widely drafted transfer pricing rules that are intended to apply to almost any kind of transaction or series of transactions made or imposed between related parties that gives rise to:
  * a provision that differs from one that would have been made between third parties and
  * a UK tax advantage (potential or actual) to one or more of the parties.


These rules apply to both cross-border transactions and UK-to-UK transactions. A tax advantage is one that reduces UK taxable profits or increases UK taxable loss compared to the arm’s-length position. The United Kingdom follows the guidance provided by the OECD in relation to transfer pricing.
Parties are considered related for the purpose of transfer pricing rules where either one controls the other or both are under common control. Control here is not confined to situations in which one party is the majority shareholder in the other. Effectively, control exists where one party has the power to ensure that the affairs of another party are conducted in accordance with the first party's wishes. The controlling party can include companies, partnerships, and, in certain circumstances, individuals. The controlled party can be a company or a partnership.
The concept of control is also subject to the following two important extensions:
  * The rules can apply to joint venture companies where two parties each have an interest of at least 40%.
  * There are attribution rules to trace control relationships through a number of levels in determining whether parties are controlled for the purposes of the transfer pricing rules.


The regime applies not only to arrangements involving products, services, and intangible property but also to finance arrangements, including both the rate of return charged and the amount of loan principal (or equivalent) made available. It is therefore the mechanism by which the UK's revenue authorities address the issue of thin capitalisation. Unlike many other territories, the United Kingdom does not have any 'safe harbour' rules in relation to the amount of debt or interest (or equivalents), and the question of whether a UK company or group is thinly capitalised needs to be addressed on a fact specific, case-by-case basis. However, a separate UK interest deductibility rule was introduced, effective from April 2017._This is discussed under Funding costs in the section_.
In addition to the general related party control rules, the regime restricts interest deductions to an arm's-length amount where a number of persons who would collectively control a company or a partnership have 'acted together' in relation to the financing arrangements of that company or partnership. An independent financier (usually a bank) can then be taken as related to the company or partnership for financing, despite the absence of any other type of participation in control, and the loan becomes subject to transfer pricing limitations.
There are a number of exemptions that essentially exclude SMEs and dormant companies from the regime, subject to certain qualifications.
The effect of the transfer pricing rules is to require an arm's-length provision to be substituted in for the actual one, thereby increasing the party's UK tax liability and cancelling out the UK tax advantage that would otherwise have arisen.
Where both parties to the transaction are UK taxpayers, the disadvantaged party will generally be entitled to claim a 'compensating adjustment' (except where the transaction falls within the transfer pricing regime because of the 'acting together' provisions), but only after the UK adjustment has been made by the advantaged entity. The legislation also provides that parties may make balancing payments to each other in such circumstances, of any amount up to the gross transfer pricing adjustment (and not just the tax impact), which will neither be taxable for the recipient nor tax deductible for the payer.
Where the disadvantaged party is outside the UK tax net, they can pursue a claim for relief under the relevant DTT if it provides a mechanism for such relief; where the adjustment in the United Kingdom is to reduce a deduction for an amount paid under deduction of UK tax, the compensating adjustment rules should allow the overseas party to reclaim any WHT paid on the disallowed amount, subject to time limits and other criteria.
Where the disadvantaged party to a cross-border transaction is subject to UK tax and an adjustment is made by the overseas tax authority to increase the overseas counterparty’s profits, the entity may similarly be able to apply for a “corresponding adjustment” under the MAP of the relevant DTT. HMRC may also consider providing relief on a unilateral basis, subject to the specific facts and circumstances. 
UK taxpayers are required to self-assess their compliance with the arm's-length principle. The taxpayer must therefore identify and make transfer pricing adjustments when submitting their tax returns. An important implication of this approach is the application of interest and the potential for substantial penalties if the position taken in the return is subsequently held to be wrong. Transfer pricing is an area of focus for enquiries, including DPT enquiries and submissions under the Profit Diversion Compliance Facility. HMRC expects taxpayers to be able to produce often extensive evidence that supports the conclusion that the self-assessment return reflects arm’s-length pricing and recently legislated (effective 1 April 2023) a specific requirement for large groups to prepare and maintain transfer pricing documentation. Where a transfer pricing inaccuracy is found in a tax return and the taxpayer has not kept or preserved the specified transfer pricing records, the behaviours associated with that inaccuracy will be presumed to be careless unless the taxpayer can demonstrate that they took reasonable care to avoid the inaccuracy. 
The United Kingdom has an Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) programme that, subject to the acceptance of an application and agreement being reached between the relevant tax authorities, can provide a high degree of transfer pricing certainty on a prospective basis. A specific form of APA agreement, an Advance Thin Capitalisation Agreement, may also be agreed in relation to certain financing arrangements.
As part of the consultation HMRC launched in relation to the UK transfer pricing legislation (as well as other international tax matters) back in June 2023, HMRC sought views on the following transfer pricing matters:
  * Alignment of the United Kingdom’s use of the term ’provision‘ with the OECD’s use of ’conditions‘ when assessing the consistency of arrangements within a multinational enterprise (MNE) with the arrangements that would exist between independent parties.
  * Reframing the concept and definition of the relationship between counterparties that would impose the requirement to consider whether arm’s-length pricing has been applied, with a potential expansion of the definition to take into account ’excessive influence‘, for example, by a major creditor.
  * Clarifying the general purpose and application of the ’one-way street‘, which requires, on a provision-by-provision basis, an upwards adjustment to UK taxable profits where necessary to comply with the arm’s-length principle, but prohibits a downwards adjustment.
  * Targeted relaxation of the general requirement to apply transfer pricing UK-UK where a non-arm’s-length provision does not provide an overall UK tax advantage.
  * Amending the specific UK rules that apply to transactions involving loans and guarantees to align them with updates to the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines (Chapter X) in this area.
  * Provide a simpler and more certain alternative to the current compensating adjustment mechanism to enable UK borrowing capacity as a whole to be taken into consideration.
  * Placing greater emphasis and clarity on HMRC’s internal governance framework in ensuring consistency of treatment and outcome.


Additionally, HMRC sought views on the interaction and consistency (or otherwise) between the transfer pricing rules and other legislation, including legislation that governs loan relationships and related issues, and the approach to related party transactions involving intangibles and the associated valuation methodologies.
Following this, the Autumn Budget 2024 contained updates on a number of transfer pricing matters on which further consultation is expected in 2025:
  * The potential removal of medium-sized groups from the current transfer pricing SME exemption. Under the current rules, SMEs are exempt from the transfer pricing rules in the UK, other than for transactions with non-approved treaty countries. However, HMRC does have the power to direct to disapply the exemption from Medium sized groups where they deem it appropriate. 
  * The potential removal of UK-UK transactions from the UK transfer pricing legislation. At present the UK transfer pricing legislation applies equally to domestic (UK-UK) and to cross border intercompany transactions. The proposal, already aired in the 2023 consultation, is to remove the UK-UK requirement (other than where there is a mismatch).
  * The potential introduction of a new annual reporting requirement, the International Dealing Schedule (IDS). This proposal appears to revisit the previously consulted upon IDS which would require groups to report their intercompany transactions to HMRC on an annual basis. The size threshold for this potential new requirement is not currently known.


## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
In line with the OECD recommendations coming out of BEPs Action 13, 'private' CbC reporting (i.e. MNEs submitting CbC reports to tax authorities) is required for all MNEs with annual consolidated group revenue over 750 million euros (EUR) (or equivalent). It requires the preparation of a summary report setting out the jurisdictions in which the group has operations and, for each jurisdiction, the aggregate revenue, profit, income tax, plus additional data, such as number of employees, accumulated earnings, assets, etc.
This report has to be filed with HMRC where the MNE’s ultimate parent is in the United Kingdom, or, in some circumstances, where the MNE operates in the United Kingdom, in addition to the tax return for the period in question. HMRC then makes the report available to other jurisdictions included within the relevant report automatically in line with/subject to the specific CbC information sharing provisions entered into between the United Kingdom and the relevant tax jurisdictions.
In some quarters, stakeholders have been asking for CbC data to be made public. The Global Reporting Initiative released a new tax standard (GRI 207 - Tax) that contains public CbC reporting as a voluntary standard. 
In the United Kingdom, legislation provides for the government to bring in regulations to require publication of CbC information for UK MNEs; however, it remains to be seen what approach the UK government will take in light of international developments.
On 4 July 2023, HM Treasury made the Taxes (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) (Country-by-Country Reporting) (Amendment) Regulations 2023 (SI 2023/752), and this was laid before Parliament on 5 July 2023. The effect of these changes is broadly the removal of the annual year-end CbC reporting notification obligations in the United Kingdom for many MNE groups, albeit there still remain some specific scenarios where a UK notification may still be required.
## Transfer pricing documentation
The UK’s transfer pricing documentation rules have in the past relied on the generic legal requirement to keep sufficient records to deliver correct and complete returns, and there has historically been limited guidance on the form and content of the documentation. In terms of best practice, this has already been commonly understood to mean OECD-compliant documentation in most cases. 
Following public consultations, the government decided to legislate to require larger businesses (where the taxpayer group meets the CbC reporting consolidated revenue threshold of EUR 750 million) to maintain OECD-format 'Master File' and 'Local File' documentation (subject to certain exemptions). The new rules are effective for corporation tax purposes for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2023 and for income tax purposes from 6 April 2024. 
Primary legislation was included in Finance (No.2) Bill 2023, which was published on 23 March 2023. The Spring Finance Bill 2023 received royal assent in July to become Finance (No.2) Act 2023. The Finance (No.2) Act 2023 is legislation that enables HMRC to specify specific transfer pricing record keeping requirements, the details of which are provided in a separate Statutory Instrument, The Transfer Pricing Records Regulations 2023. The Finance (No.2) Act 2023 also sets out, amongst other things, the consequences for taxpayers of failing to comply with the new rules, including increased risk of substantial penalties, and additional powers for HMRC in relation to access to transfer pricing records and information. Simultaneously with the release of The Transfer Pricing Records Regulations 2023, HMRC issued accompanying material within the transfer pricing sections of their International Manual, which provides guidance to HMRC officers and taxpayers on the UK’s application and interpretation of the aforementioned legislation and regulations. 
Where a UK entity is part of an MNE group that does not meet the CbC reporting consolidated revenue threshold, HMRC has emphasised that it is still a requirement to keep appropriate books and records to file a correct and complete tax return. Additionally, while legally such UK entities are not formally required to prepare a prescribed Master File and Local File, HMRC is of the view that such formats provide an appropriate way to demonstrate adherence to the arm’s-length principle and the requirement to prepare and retain adequate books and records to substantiate this. This is also aligned with the position and expectation for the periods prior to the enactment of the new legislation.
In addition, the primary legislation makes some significant changes to information powers and penalties for transfer pricing. The most material potential impact where a taxpayer fails to do the work necessary to maintain or to produce relevant records on request would be on the assessment of behaviours should HMRC later identify an inaccuracy in a return that relates to transfer pricing (i.e. where an enquiry results in an adjustment). Where a tax return is submitted that contains an inaccuracy and the specific records required by law (including the transfer pricing documentation report) have not been kept and/or the processes for managing the taxpayers transfer pricing positions, including setting and implementing transfer prices, are inadequate, it will be presumed ’careless‘ behaviour. Similarly, careless behaviour will be assumed if HMRC makes a discovery of an underassessment of tax relating to transfer pricing and the specified records have not been kept or preserved. This will have ramifications for penalties geared to the amount of any transfer pricing adjustment and on how far back HMRC can issue assessments in the event of a discovery.
There is a new right for HMRC to request specified transfer pricing documents outside of a transfer pricing enquiry; and the requirement for specified documents to be in the 'power and possession' of a UK entity when they are in the 'power or possession' of another group entity has been removed.
As noted above, further consultation is expected in 2025 regarding the potential introduction of a new annual reporting requirement, the IDS. 
HMRC was previously considering an additional requirement, a 'summary audit trail' (SAT), with the aforementioned regulations providing HMRC with the power to introduce such a requirement. The SAT would summarise the work undertaken by the taxpayer in arriving at the conclusions in their transfer pricing documentation. It has been described as requiring businesses to complete a questionnaire detailing the main actions they have taken in preparing the Local File. A public consultation on this requirement was expected to take place, however, given the areas of further consultation announced in the Autumn Budget 2024 (including the IDS as above) this is now not expected in the near future.
The newly specified documents would not need to be filed with HMRC as a matter of course but would be required to be provided within 30 days of an HMRC request. Penalties would be available to HMRC for failure to comply with the new requirements.
Maintaining the specified transfer pricing records is part of the Senior Accounting Officer (SAO) responsibilities. _See Senior Accounting Officer and tax strategy publication in the_ _section_ _for further details_.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Under the CFC regime, a UK resident company may be taxed on a proportion of the profits of certain UK-controlled, non-resident companies in which the resident company has an interest. The overall intention is to tax profits that have been artificially diverted from the United Kingdom.
Broadly, profits of a non-UK resident CFC will be taxed, using normal corporation tax rates and rules, on the persons controlling the CFC if (i) the profits pass through the CFC ‘gateway’ and (ii) are not exempt.
The ‘gateways’ are a series of tests that identify profits that are, broadly, artificially diverted from the United Kingdom. For example, where profits are attributable to UK significant people functions (SPFs), those profits will be taxed in the United Kingdom unless one of four conditions are satisfied (the first of which is that obtaining a tax advantage is not the main purpose or one of the main purposes of the arrangement). A range of other tests may capture other profits.
Various exemptions exist for certain types of companies, those with low profits or low margins, CFCs in excluded territories, or others with corporation tax rates similar or above UK rates.
There is a special exemption for intra-group financing profits that can result in an exemption of between 75% and 100% of the financing profits on qualifying loans. In order to make the regime Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD) compliant, the government tightened these rules so that (from 1 January 2019) the reduced rate of tax is no longer available in relation to profits that are attributable to UK SPFs. This exemption has been the subject of an in-depth investigation by the European Commission into whether it constitutes fiscal state aid. In 2019, the European Commission (EC) found that certain parts of the UK’s CFC regime (prior to 1 January 2019 only) constituted state aid. However, in September 2024, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) upheld an appeal against the EC’s decision and annulled the state aid determination. It is therefore now clear that this exemption does not give rise to any state aid concerns.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 15 December 2024
Tax rates on the profits of UK PEs of non-resident corporations are the same as for domestic corporations.
There are specific rules setting out how the PE's profits should be evaluated for UK tax purposes, which broadly seek to treat the PE as if it were an independent entity dealing at arm’s length with its related parties, including other parts of the entity of which it is a PE. The United Kingdom recognises the OECD’s Authorised OECD Approach (AOA) to the attribution of profits. The precise application of the independent entity approach, and the use of the AOA, will depend on the terms of the DTT between the United Kingdom and the other territories involved. Financing arrangements between the PE and head office must be disregarded, and deemed royalty payments may also need to be disregarded. There are special rules for banks to stop under-performing loans being allocated to the UK PE in a way that is considered unacceptable and similar potential manipulations.
As part of the legislative consultation back in June 2023, in addition to the PE threshold options considered (_see 'Permanent establishment (PE)' in the section for more information_), HMRC is considering amending the domestic provisions in relation to profit attribution to align with the AOA. As noted above, the Government has announced that it will further consult on these reforms in Spring 2025.
Tax is not generally withheld on transfers of profits from a UK PE to the head office.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 15 December 2024
## Foreign tax credit
The United Kingdom has an extensive network of DTTs. Unilateral relief is generally available, in any event, to credit overseas tax paid on non-UK source profits against the UK tax on the same profits; while the relevant treaty might sometimes extend that relief, their main function for UK companies is to limit overseas WHTs that would otherwise be payable on passive income.
The United Kingdom has a complex regime allowing 'underlying' tax relief in respect of foreign dividends, so that tax suffered at lower levels can be relieved (at least in part) where dividends flow to the United Kingdom via a chain of companies. However, that relief is only available where the dividend concerned is subject to tax. It is therefore of limited application because most foreign dividends are exempt from tax.
## Capital allowances
A variety of tax incentives are given in the form of enhanced tax depreciation allowances (_known as capital allowances, see Depreciation and amortisation in the section_). 
## Annual investment allowance (AIA)
All businesses, regardless of size, can claim an AIA of 100% on the first GBP 1 million (from 1 January 2019, previously GBP 200,000) tranche  of capital expenditure incurred on most qualifying expenditure. This is restricted to a single allowance for groups of companies or associated businesses. The AIA has become permanent at GBP 1 million.
## Research and development (R&D) incentives
Relief for expenditure of a revenue nature on R&D that is related to a company’s trade and is undertaken by the company or on its behalf is wholly allowable as a tax deduction. In certain circumstances, either enhanced relief is available or a credit is available that is offset against R&D costs in the company’s profit and loss account.
Expenditure of a capital nature on R&D related to a company’s trade is also wholly allowable as a tax deduction (i.e. 100% capital allowances are available). This covers capital expenditure on the provision of laboratories and research equipment; however, no allowance is available for expenditure on land.
There were significant changes that apply for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 April 2023, including:
  * A company is required to pre-notify that they are making a claim if they are a first-time claimant or if they have not made claims in the past three years. The notification must be made by six months after the end of the period in which they intend to make a claim. HMRC have indicated that late notifications will not be accepted, so companies will need to be planning much further ahead when considering whether to make claims.
  * It is mandatory for claimants to share certain information when making a claim. The key documentation that needs to be shared with HMRC includes:
    * a description of the R&D undertaken
    * a breakdown of qualifying costs
    * details of any agent who has advised on the R&D claim, and
    * sign off from a senior officer of the company.


  * Cloud and data costs have become qualifying cost types; however, these costs need to clearly align with direct R&D and cannot be included in R&D claims where these costs only relate to indirect supporting activities.


  * Pure maths research is now within the scope of the R&D relief, which is likely to benefit those undertaking data science or artificial intelligence-based R&D activities.


In addition, there are further significant changes that apply for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 April 2024, including:
  * A new merged scheme (merger of the below SME and RDEC schemes), which has restrictions on eligible overseas costs and complex rules regarding subcontracting and the eligible company that may claim the R&D relief ().


### **R &D relief: SMEs**
Certain companies incurring R&D expenditure of a specific nature are entitled to claim R&D tax relief.
A standalone company (or the group where the UK company is part of a global group) must be an SME, as defined by the European Union. The company (broadly together with any company of which it owns 25% or more or that has more than 25% interest in it, subject to some exceptions) should have fewer than 500 employees and either an annual turnover not exceeding EUR 100 million or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding EUR 86 million.
The R&D may be undertaken by the company or directly on its behalf. The R&D must be related to the company’s trade. R&D that is deemed to be funded or subcontracted to the company may only be claimed under the large companies RDEC scheme ().
Detailed below are the types of expenditure that may be included within claims.
Enhanced R&D tax relief is given by increasing the deduction for qualifying SME R&D in a company’s corporation tax computation from a 100% deduction to 230% deduction for qualifying expenditure. This rate was reduced to 186% deduction from 1 April 2023.
One of the ways HMRC is tackling abuse in the SME regime is through the SME cap that applied from 1 April 2021. The amount of payable tax credit a qualifying loss-making business can receive is capped at three times the company’s total PAYE and NICs liability for that year. There is a threshold of GBP 20,000, so that the smallest claims are uncapped (i.e. a company receiving a payable credit of below GBP 20,000 for a 12-month period will not be impacted by the cap). There are also rules that attempt to limit the impact of the cap on some businesses with genuine R&D and IP substance in the United Kingdom.
### **R &D tax credits**
Where an SME company has a ‘surrenderable loss’ it may claim an R&D tax credit. Generally, a surrenderable loss arises where the company incurs a trading loss.
The surrenderable loss is the lower of the unrelieved trading loss or 230% of the qualifying research and development expenditure. This reduced to 186% from 1 April 2023.
The cash payment is 10% of the amount of losses surrendered. This equates to a cash repayment of up to 18.6% (being 186% at 10%) from 1 April 2023. Where the R&D tax credit is claimed, the trading loss carried forward is reduced by the amount of the surrendered loss.
From 1 April 2023, for loss-making, R&D-intensive SME businesses, a higher credit rate is available providing a higher cash benefit, as follows:
  * Credit rate of 14.5%.
  * Cash benefit of 27%.


This credit is intended for R&D-intensive businesses that are considered to need additional support. The R&D-intensive definition is met if at least 40% of the total group expenditure is on qualifying R&D expenditure. This threshold is reduced to 30% for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 April 2024.
### **R &D Expenditure Credit (RDEC)**
Relief under RDEC is available to large companies (unless subcontracted to the claimant company by a UK SME) and SME companies where expenditure has been funded or subsidised (by grant income, customer funding, or otherwise).
This credit is different to the payable credit referred to above for SMEs. Companies may claim to receive a taxable credit payable at 20% (13% prior to 1 April 2023). The credit is brought into account ‘above the line’ and reflected in the operating profits of the company, similar to a grant. The credit itself is taxable and so taking a 25% corporation tax rate into account, the net benefit to the company of the credit is 15%. The net benefit was previously 10.5% prior to 1 April 2023 (taking a corporation tax rate of 19%).
### **Merged scheme**
A merged ’RDEC for all’ regime came into effect for accounting periods starting on or after 1 April 2024. This brings together the incentives regimes for SMEs and large companies for the first time (with the exception of the additional regime for R&D-intensive SMEs).
  * The merged regime generates a gross taxable credit of 20%.
  * The rate at which tax is deducted from the repayable credit for loss-making companies is reduced from 25% to 19% resulting in a 16.2% repayable rate compared to 15% for profitable companies. This means large loss-making companies will have an increase in rate from 15% to 16.2%. SMEs, however, will see a further reduction in benefit from 21.5%/18.6% to 15%/16.2% for profitable / loss-making SMEs, respectively. The higher credit rate scheme for R&D-intensive loss-making SMEs will continue and run in parallel to the merged scheme.
  * There is a significant change on who can claim for subcontracted R&D under the merged scheme. This is the main area of change and complexity for both large companies and SMEs. In the main, where a principal company contracts a third party to undertake work connected with their R&D project, the principal company may claim the qualifying R&D costs of that contract.The company contracted to do that work may not claim for R&D activities that deliver the project outcome for another company’s R&D project. However, if a company is contracted to do work for another company, but the work does not form part of the R&D for the customer (i.e the customer has no knowledge that R&D is required) and was instead initiated by the contractor, then the contractor may be able to claim relief for their work if it is eligible R&D. This is a complex area and advice should be sought from R&D specialists. In addition, where a UK subcontractor undertakes R&D work for an overseas principal or a government body, the subcontractor will still be eligible to make a claim.
  * Loss-making companies not paying corporation tax will be able to claim a repayable credit, and the potential PAYE cap on this will mirror the current SME cap. This will benefit large loss-making companies where their spend on non-staffing costs is significantly higher than their staffing costs.
  * Overseas costs restrictions are included under the merged regime, limiting the eligibility of overseas subcontracted R&D or payments to externally provided workers that do not meet specific eligibility criteria.


## Patent box
Where the taxable profits can be attributed to the exploitation of patents, a lower effective rate of corporation tax applies. For 202425, the rate is 10%. The Nexus scheme requires companies to stream their IP income and the application of a fraction to relevant IP profits based on the proportion of R&D undertaken by itself. The Nexus scheme meets revised OECD principles and limits the qualifying IP profits based on the proportion of R&D undertaken by the company, by applying ‘the R&D fraction’.
## Other incentives
A deduction equal to 150% of the qualifying expenditure on the remediation of contaminated or derelict land is given in the year incurred, which can be surrendered for a cash payment (at a rate of GBP 24 for each GBP 100 of qualifying land remediation spend) by companies that are trading at a loss.
There are special tax reliefs available for certain expenditure on UK film production, high-end television, animation, video games, theatres, orchestras, and museum and gallery exhibitions. 
Some significant changes have been made to the UK creative industry tax reliefs, including film, TV, and video game tax reliefs. The audio-visual tax reliefs are now above-the-line expenditure credits similar to the current RDEC.
The Video Games Expenditure Credit (VGEC) replaces the Video Games Tax Relief, and the audio-visual expenditure credit (AVEC) replaces:
  * Film Tax Relief.
  * High-End TV Tax Relief.
  * Animation Tax Relief.
  * Children’s TV Tax Relief.


Key changes include: 
  * A taxable credit rate of 34% applies to film, high-end TV, and video games, and a higher credit rate of 39% applies to animated film and TV and children’s TV. This equates to a net cash credit of approximately 20.4% for film, high-end TV, and video games, and 23.4% for animated film and TV and children’s TV.


  * The expenditure credits are available for expenditure incurred from 1 January 2024. New productions must claim under the new expenditure credits rules from 1 April 2025.


  * The mechanism for the credits is very similar to the RDEC, although there is no PAYE cap applicable to these credits. 


  * The qualifying criteria and other rules for the current reliefs will mostly be carried across into AVEC and VGEC unchanged, including the 80% cap on qualifying expenditure. Qualifying expenditure will still be calculated on a cumulative basis.


  * There are transitional rules for film or TV productions and video games that continue after 1 January 2024. Existing productions / games can continue under the existing rules up to March 2027, or the new expenditure credit can be claimed. From 1 April 2025, claims for new productions and games must be made under the expenditure credits system. For accounting periods starting on or after 1 April 2027, all productions will need to be claimed under the new rules.


  * Akin to R&D claims, companies claiming creative tax reliefs are now required to complete and submit an online information form at the same time as making a claim in the tax return. 
  * Expenditure potentially eligible for R&D credits (irrespective of which scheme) is now excluded from claiming under the VGEC or AVEC, whether or not an R&D credits claim is actually made.
  * A new additional tax credit relief for Independent Films will also be introduced for 2025.


There are no tax holidays and no foreign investment incentives in the United Kingdom.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 15 December 2024
Under UK domestic law, a company may have a duty to withhold tax in relation to the payment of either interest or royalties (or other sums paid for the use of a patent). The circumstances in which such a liability arises are discussed below.
There is no requirement to deduct WHT from dividends, except in respect of property income dividends (PIDs) paid by UK REITs, which are subject to WHT at 20%, subject to certain exemptions. Therefore, dividends (apart from PIDs) may always be paid gross, regardless of the terms of the applicable DTT.
Please note, however, that this is not an exhaustive list of all the deductions that might be required to be made in respect of UK tax from payments made to or by companies. In particular, non-resident companies that are subject to UK tax on UK-source rental profits (_see the_ _section for more information_) will find their letting agent or tenants are obligated to withhold the appropriate tax at source (currently 20% without any allowances) from their rental payments unless the recipient has first applied and been given permission to receive gross rents under the NRL scheme. Companies are also under an obligation to withhold tax from annual payments. Two other important examples are the UK's deduction at source regime for entertainers and sportsmen, and the scheme under which payments to unregistered subcontractors working on big building projects may need to have tax deducted at source.
## Interest WHT
As a general rule, UK domestic law requires companies making payments of UK-source interest to withhold tax at 20%, regardless of where they are resident. However, there are a number of exceptions to this general rule. The key exclusions are:
  * Payments of interest by UK resident companies if the beneficial owner of the interest is also a UK resident company, or a UK PE, provided the interest concerned will be taxed in the United Kingdom as part of the PE's trading profits.
  * Payments of interest on a quoted Eurobond.
  * Payments of interest paid to or by a UK bank (or a UK PE of a foreign bank).
  * Payments of 'short' interest. This is, broadly speaking, interest on loans that will not be in place for more than a year. However, the definition can be contentious, and detailed advice should be taken on this if intending to utilise this exemption.
  * Payments of interest that do not 'arise' in the United Kingdom. Whether a payment constitutes UK-source interest is a complex issue, and specialist advice needs to be taken if seeking to use this exception.
  * Payments of interest on private placement debts (widely defined) of UK companies.
  * Payments of interest made prior to 1 June 2021 (or 3 March 2021 where anti-abuse measures are applicable) that would have qualified for exemption under the EU Interest and Royalties Directive prior to Brexit.
  * Eligible payments made by a QAHC. 


If none of the exceptions apply, a payment of interest must be made after the deduction of WHT unless (or until) HMRC has given authorisation that the payment may be made gross (or with a reduced rate of WHT) because of the applicability of treaty relief for the recipient.
## Royalties WHT
UK domestic law requires companies making payments of patent, copyright, design, model, plan, secret formula, trademark, brand names, and know how royalties that arise in the United Kingdom to deduct WHT at 20%, regardless of where they are resident. In addition, there is also the possibility that other royalties that arise in the United Kingdom may also be subject to the same rate of WHT if they constitute 'qualifying annual payments', so specialist advice will be needed to clarify this. However, certain types of royalties, such as film royalties and equipment royalties, will generally not be subject to UK WHT.
In certain circumstances, and subject to certain conditions, royalty payments may be made gross (or with a reduced rate of WHT) where:
  * the beneficial owner of the corresponding income is a UK resident company (or trading in the United Kingdom through a PE or a partnership in which the partners meet specific conditions)
  * relief is available under a DTT, or
  * payment was made prior to 1 June 2021 (or 3 March 2021 where anti-abuse measures are applicable) of an amount that would have qualified for exemption under the EU Interest and Royalties Directive prior to Brexit.


Unlike the rule regarding interest, where such a relief is available, a company may make a royalty payment gross of WHT (or subject to a reduced rate of WHT under a treaty) without prior clearance having been given by HMRC if they reasonably believe at the time that the relief is due. However, if that belief is later found to be incorrect, HMRC may direct that the payment must be made net of WHT, with the WHT paid to HMRC, and the payer may be subject to interest and penalties in respect of the WHT that should have been withheld (even if their belief was reasonable).
## Double taxation treaties (DTTs)
The tables below set out the rates of WHT applicable to the most common payments of dividends, interest, and royalties under UK domestic law where such a liability arises and the reduced rates that may be available under an applicable DTT. Please refer to specific treaties to ensure the values are up-to-date and ensure you have considered the potential impact of the Multilateral Instrument (MLI), which came into force in the United Kingdom on 1 October 2018. The MLI will have a fundamental impact on how taxpayers access any DTT that both contracting states have opted to be covered by the MLI, subject to the options and reservations both have made in relation to a range of matters (including the date on which it will take effect for particular taxes).
Note that, as the United Kingdom is no longer a member of the European Union, EU Directives (including the Interest and Royalties Directive [IRD]) are no longer applicable to payments made by or to UK companies.
### **Dividends**
There is generally no requirement to deduct WHT from dividends. 
An exception is in respect of PIDs paid by UK REITs, which are subject to WHT at 20%, subject to certain exemptions. However, the recipient may be entitled to reclaim some or all of the WHT under the terms of any applicable DTT or as a result of any other relevant exemption. 
Therefore, dividends (other than PIDs) are always paid gross.
### **Interest**
As discussed in more detail above, WHT applies only to 'annual interest' (i.e. excluding interest on certain short-term loans). Banks and similar financial institutions are also normally able to pay annual interest to non-UK residents free of WHT. In addition, most of the UK treaties provide for a zero-rate of withholding on interest paid to governmental and quasi-governmental lenders. Such exemptions are not separately indicated in the tables below.

---|---  
Interest | Royalties  
Corporations | 0/20 (1) | 0/20 (1)  
Individuals | 20 | 20  
Note
  1. Payments to any UK resident company can be made free of WHT if the recipient is chargeable to tax on the interest or royalty.

Notes
UK domestic law generally charges WHT on patent, copyright, and design royalties, although there can be definitional uncertainties. Many treaties allow reduced rates for a wider range of royalties. These are mentioned in this table, even though there may be no UK WHT applied under domestic law.
  1. 3% for news; 5% for copyright; 10% industrial; 15% other royalties.
  2. Lower rate for loans from banks and financial institutions.
  3. Higher rate applies if recipient controls more than 50% of payer.
  4. Lower rate applies to copyright royalties.
  5. 0% on loans between businesses.
  6. Lower rate applies to industrial, commercial royalties.
  7. Specific additional conditions apply for lower rate.
  8. Lower rate applies for equipment royalties.
  9. Lower rate applies to films, TV, and radio.
  10. Higher rate applies to certain profit related interest.
  11. Specific conditions apply for higher rate.
  12. The United Kingdom considers its tax treaties with Belarus and Russia to remain in force and has stated its intention to continue to comply with their terms, despite receiving notification from Belarus and Russia that they have suspended substantially all of the UK-Belarus and UK-Russia tax treaties.

Last reviewed - 15 December 2024
## Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
IFRS is mandatory for the consolidated financial statements of listed UK companies.
Otherwise, UK companies have a choice of either using full IFRS or UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) - FRS 102 - for their consolidated and non-consolidated (solus) accounts. UK companies that are subsidiaries also have an option to prepare solus accounts under either IFRS or FRS 102 methodologies with reduced disclosures. There are also additional accounting options available for small companies and micro entities. However, the options available to a company are subject to the requirements of the UK Company Law framework for consistency of GAAP within a group.
## Intergovernmental agreements (IGAs) and cooperation
The United Kingdom has a wide range of international agreements, alongside DTTs, for the exchange of information about taxpayers. In addition, the United Kingdom seeks to take a participative role within the OECD with regard to the development of international tax principles.
### **Implementation of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)**
The FATCA legislation was enacted by the United States (US) to reduce tax evasion by US citizens and entities. FATCA requires financial institutions outside the United States to identify and report US persons holding financial accounts with them. On 12 September 2012, the United Kingdom and the United States signed an IGA to implement FATCA in the United Kingdom (The UK-US Agreement to Improve International Tax Compliance and to Implement FATCA). The US IGA was brought into force by The International Tax Compliance (United States of America) Regulations (as amended). Since June 2014, UK-based financial institutions must comply with FATCA requirements or may face non-compliance consequences, including penalties and withholding on US-source income.
### **Implementation of the Common Reporting Standard (CRS)**
On 21 July 2014, the OECD released the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters, including the Commentary on the CRS. The CRS seeks to establish the automatic exchange of tax information as the global standard. The automatic exchange of information involves the systematic and periodic transmission of extensive taxpayer information from the country in which a taxpayer’s financial accounts are located to that taxpayer’s country of residence. On 12 October 2022, the OECD released anticipated amendments to the CRS that widen the scope of potentially reportable financial products as well as the data points for reporting.
The regulations that require UK financial institutions to collect, maintain, and report information for exchange with jurisdictions party to the multilateral competent authority agreement or committed to automatic exchange are The International Tax Compliance Regulations 2015 (as amended), which came into force from 1 January 2016. Similar to FATCA, UK-based financial institutions must comply with the CRS or face non-compliance consequences, including penalties.
## UK tax legislation
Announcements of proposed new legislation generally occur at least once a year. The main announcement is made on Budget Day in March, when tax rates are set for the coming year. Other announcements can be made at other times and, subject to becoming approved and adopted law, can apply from a specified date. The new legislation is then included in an annual Finance Act, which is expected to be finalised in June or July. In the year of a general election, there may be additional Budget Days and Finance Acts.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 15 December 2024
A UK resident company is taxed on its worldwide total profits.
Total profits are the aggregate of (i) the company's net income from each source and (ii) the company's net chargeable gains arising from the sale of capital assets.
The main sources of income are (i) profits of a trade, (ii) profits of a property business, (iii) non-trading profits (or losses) from loan relationships, mainly interest receivable or payable, (iv) non-trading gains (or losses) on most intangible fixed assets, and (v) non-exempt dividends or other company distributions. The amount of income for sources (i) to (iv) is measured based on the company’s accounts, with specific adjustments. Taxable income from non-exempt dividends and calculating chargeable gains or income from other sources is based on actual amounts.
The rules for measuring the gross income are different for each category, and there are subtle differences in the rules about tax deductions and how gains are calculated. Because of this continuing reliance on taxing companies on a 'source-by-source' basis, it is difficult to explain the rules about income determination and deductions as two wholly separate topics.
## Basic rules for accounts-based sources
The main source of profits is often from trading. A company's trading profits are based on its worldwide profit before tax in its accounts. Adjustments are made for non-trading receipts (such as dividends from other companies and income from property) and non-deductible expenditure (such as capital expenditure). Depreciation for tax purposes (known as capital allowances) is calculated and substituted for the depreciation charged in the accounts. A number of other statutory adjustments are made; three important ones are that pension contributions, deferred pay, and benefits in kind are broadly deductible only when paid, that a deduction is available for the notional cost of certain share awards to employees, and that, where certain acquired intangibles are not depreciated in the accounts, a flat-rate deduction can usually be claimed. There are many other adjustments.
Similar principles apply in relation to the calculation of profits of a property business.
Financial profits from a company's trading and non-trading loan relationships and related matters are usually based on the accounts, and the distinction between 'capital' and 'revenue' receipts and deductions is not relevant. Instead, all credits and debits in the accounts are aggregated in order to find the net profit or deficit. Certain statutory adjustments have to be made, which include an interest capping limitation.
For traders, any profit or loss on loan relationships, and/or on intangibles, is generally included within the trading profits. If the company doesn’t have a trade, then loan relationships and intangibles are treated as a separate source of income or loss.
## Income losses
Where a loss arises in respect of a particular source of income, there are detailed rules regarding the possible offset of the loss. Carryback and sideways reliefs are often allowed within limits; carryforward is generally allowed and carried forward losses do not time expire, although since 1 April 2017, the maximum carried forward loss offset is broadly limited to GBP 5 million plus 50% of the current year profits in excess of that amount. Losses can also be utilised by other group companies (_see the section_).
More specifically, dealing with the main sorts of income losses:
  * Trading losses may be set off against any other source of profit or gains in the same year, may be carried back one year (three years on the cessation of the trade) against any other source of profit or gain, or may be carried forward without time limit against total profits (for trading losses accruing on or after 1 April 2017) or against profits of the same trade only (for trading losses accruing up to 1 April 2017).Property business losses are set off against any other source of profit or gains in the same year. Any remaining losses are carried forward without time limit against the company's total profits;; they cannot, be carried back. Relief is also available for certain income tax losses arising to non-resident companies that were formerly subject to income tax on the profits from their UK property business.
  * Non-trading deficits (NTDs) (i.e. interest and financing losses) can again be set off against any other source of profit or gains in the same year, may be carried back one year against non-trading credits (i.e. interest and financing profits), or may be carried forward without time limit against total profits (for NTDs accruing on or after 1 April 2017) or against non-trading profits (for NTDs accruing up to 1 April 2017).
  * Non-trading companies may deduct non-capital management expenses incurred in managing their investments from their total profits. Any excess management expenses can be carried forward without limit to set against profits in future years.


While income losses can generally be offset against capital gains of the same accounting period, capital losses are never available for offset against any type of income.
There are complex anti-avoidance rules that restrict the utilisation of all types of losses where there is a change in ownership of the company. Specific rules can also deny or limit loss relief or deductions arising from brought forward losses or potential losses where certain conditions are met.
## Inventory valuation
In general, the book and tax methods of inventory valuation will conform. In practice, inventories are normally valued for tax purposes at the lower of cost or net realisable value. A first in first out (FIFO) basis of determining cost where items cannot be identified is acceptable, but not the base-stock or the last in first out (LIFO) method.
## Capital gains
Gains on capital assets are taxed at the normal corporation tax rates. The chargeable gain (or allowable loss) arising on the disposal of a capital asset is calculated by deducting from gross proceeds the costs of acquisition and subsequent improvements that are reflected in the asset at the time of sale, plus the incidental costs of sale and indexation allowance up to December 2017. Indexation allowance compensates for the increase in costs based on the percentage rise (if any) in the UK retail prices index to the earlier of the date of disposal of the asset or December 2017. It cannot create or increase a capital loss. No indexation allowance is available on capital assets acquired on or after 1 January 2018. Generally, these calculations must be done in sterling, so any foreign exchange gains and losses will be taxed (or relieved) on disposal. Special rules apply to assets held at 31 March 1982 and for the disposal of UK immovable property by non-UK residents ().
Most acquisitions and disposals of capital assets between UK group companies (and non-UK companies within the charge to UK corporation tax on immovable property gains) are treated as made on a no gain no loss basis (i.e. at base cost plus indexation [if available]). Otherwise, acquisitions from, or disposals to, affiliates are treated as made at fair market value, as are other acquisitions or disposals not at arm's length.
Capital losses can only be deducted from capital gains. An excess of capital losses over capital gains in a company's accounting period may be carried forward without time limitation but may not be carried back. Relief for carried forward capital losses was brought into line with relief for carried forward income losses from 1 April 2020. Carried forward capital losses can only be offset in a later accounting period against 50% of any capital gains arising in excess of GBP 5 million ‘deductions allowance’, with a single GBP 5 million ‘deductions allowance’ being available per group against which carried forward losses (both income and/or capital) can be set.
Gains or losses arising on a particular asset can be allocated to another group member. So, the capital losses of one company can sometimes be set against the gains of a fellow group member in the same or subsequent period.
There is a good deal of anti-avoidance legislation concerning the computation of chargeable gains, notably to stop losses being created or gains avoided where assets are depreciated by intra-group transactions, or where losses are 'bought in' from third parties.
Gains realised on certain types of assets can be deferred where all or most of the proceeds are reinvested in other assets of those types within a specified period (generally three years). The 'rolled-over' gain then crystallises as and when the latter assets are sold. At present, the main asset categories qualifying for roll-over are land and buildings used for a trade.
Most disposals of shareholdings of 10% or more are exempt from tax. The main exceptions will be those of non-trading subsidiaries or subgroups, or of companies acquired within the previous year. Note that gains on goodwill and other intangibles acquired after March 2002 are taxed as income, not as capital gains.
### **Capital gains on disposal of UK immovable property by non-UK residents**
UK tax is charged on capital gains made by non-residents on direct and certain indirect disposals of all types of UK immovable property.
The indirect disposal rules apply where a person makes a disposal of an entity in which it has at least a 25% interest (or any interest with an appropriate connection to certain collective investment vehicles) where that entity derives 75% or more of its gross asset value from UK land.
The 25% ownership test looks for situations where the person holds at the date of disposal, or has held within two years prior to disposal, a 25% or more interest in the property-rich company. This holding may be direct, through a series of other entities, or via connected persons.
The 75% 'property richness' test will look at the gross assets of the entity being disposed of. Where a number of entities are disposed of in one arrangement, their assets will be aggregated to establish whether the 75% test is met.
There is a trading exemption, so that disposals of interests in property-rich entities where the property is used in a trade are excluded from the charge. This is likely to apply where, for example, a non-UK resident disposes of shares in a retailer that owns and operates from UK property.
All non-UK resident companies and certain collective investment vehicles that are deemed to be companies are charged to corporation tax rather than capital gains tax on their gains. The provisions relating to annual tax on enveloped dwellings (ATED)-related capital gains tax on UK residential property have been abolished.
Existing reliefs and exemptions available for capital gains continue to be available to non-UK residents in respect of gains on immovable property, with modifications where necessary. Those who are exempt from capital gains for reasons other than being non-UK resident continue to be exempt (e.g. overseas pension schemes and certain charities). The provisions of any relevant DTT would also need to be considered.
Losses arising to non-UK residents under the new rules are available. However, the offset by companies of carried forward capital losses will be subject to a loss restriction, which limits to 50% the amount of capital gains against which brought forward capital losses in excess of GBP 5 million can be offset. 
There are options to calculate the gain or loss on a disposal using the original acquisition cost of the asset or using the value of the asset at commencement of the rules in April 2019. However, where the original acquisition cost is used in the case of an indirect disposal, and this results in a loss, this will not be an allowable loss.
Special rules apply to collective investment vehicles.
## Trading in and developing UK land
Since 2016, UK corporation tax applies to non-UK resident companies that carry on a trade of dealing in UK land or developing UK land (whether or not the trade is carried on through a PE in the United Kingdom). The intention is to tax all non-UK traders in UK land on the whole of their profit wherever it arises.
The 'transactions in land' provisions are designed to ensure that profits from activities that are fundamentally trading in nature are taxed as income rather than capital gains and apply to both direct disposals of land and also indirect disposals (i.e. disposals of shares or other assets that derive at least 50% of their value from land). The ‘direct disposals’ provisions provide a statutory definition of trading in land (very broadly, where one of the main purposes of acquiring or developing land is to realise a profit or gain). The ‘indirect disposals’ provisions will apply when the person making the disposal is party to an arrangement concerning the development of the land.
The 'anti-fragmentation' rule may increase the profits charged to UK tax by the value of any 'contribution' to the development made by an associated person that is not subject to UK tax.
Anti-avoidance provisions apply to counteract arrangements that are intended to avoid any of the rules mentioned above.
## Non-resident companies within corporation tax on UK property rental business income from 6 April 2020
Prior to 6 April 2020, non-UK tax resident companies were subject to UK income tax on UK property rental income (either through withholding or by direct assessment) unless the income was in relation to a UK PE through which they were also carrying on a trade.
From 6 April 2020, all non-UK tax resident companies that carry on a UK property business have been brought within the scope of corporation tax in respect of the profits of that business from that date. 
Notwithstanding that corporate non-resident landlords (NRLs) are now within the scope of corporation tax in respect of the profits of their property rental business, the NRL scheme (that requires the NRL's letting agent or tenants to withhold income tax at 20% at source unless they have been notified that the NRL has applied for and been given permission to receive gross rents) still applies.
Since profits of a UK property business (for corporation tax purposes) do not take into account debits or credits from loan relationships or derivative contacts, a non-UK tax resident company that carries on a UK property business is also chargeable to corporation tax in respect of its debits or credits that arise from loan relationships or derivative contracts that the company is a party to for the purpose of that business.
In addition to the difference in the tax rates that apply (the income tax rate is 20% and the corporation tax rate is 25%), there are other changes as a result of the move to corporation tax. The corporation tax filing and payment requirements and deadlines are different.
There are also, amongst other things, additional restrictions on the deductibility of interest (interest capping), deductions related to hybrid mismatches, restrictions on the amount of losses brought forward from earlier periods that can be offset, and other provisions relating to the taxation of loan relationships and derivative contracts. In addition, there are late payment restrictions that can apply where interest is not paid within 12 months of the year-end to certain connected recipients. 
It is possible to surrender or claim eligible corporation tax losses to/from other companies in the same group that are subject to corporation tax.
Relief is also available for certain income tax losses arising to non-resident companies that were formerly subject to income tax on the profits from their UK property business.
## Dividend income
Most foreign and UK dividends received by UK companies are exempt from corporation tax; however, one of several criteria has to be met, but these are widely drawn (one test, for example, is that the recipient controls the payer). For non-exempt, foreign-source dividends, double tax relief (DTR) will usually be available on a dividend-by-dividend basis. It is unusual for companies to be taxed on UK dividends because of the breadth of the exemption; however, where they are taxed, there is no concept of DTR for UK dividends. Property income distributions received from a UK REIT are subject to tax as if they were profits from a UK property business.
## Royalty income
Royalty income received by corporates will normally be taxed in the same way as other forms of income. To the extent it arises from a trade, it is taxed as trading profits. Royalties from IP not comprising a trade will be taxed as income from intangible fixed assets.
## Realised and unrealised exchange gains/losses
Unrealised exchange gains and losses tend to arise on debts and derivatives; they are then taxed or allowed, together with realised amounts, on an accounts basis in the same way as other debits and credits arising out of loan relationships. Where gains or losses arise on other payables or receivables, to a trader or property investor, they will again generally be taxed or allowed on an accounts basis. For a trader, the taxable or allowable amount will become simply part of the trading profit or loss; for other companies, it will become a separate source of taxable profit (a 'non-trading credit') or loss (a 'non-trading deficit').
Where unrealised differences arise on other capital assets, they will not generally be taxable or allowable at that stage; instead, the exchange difference becomes part of the computation and is effectively taxed or allowed when the asset is disposed of and any difference is realised.
## Partnership income
In broad terms, if companies participate in UK partnerships (whether general partnerships, limited partnerships, or limited liability partnerships [LLPs]), they will be taxed on a flow through basis. This will, in very broad terms, mean that UK corporate partners will be taxed on trading, property, or financing income as it arises in the partnership accounts, and on non-exempt dividends on a receipts basis. The UK’s transfer pricing rules need to be considered when determining the taxable income of the partnership. There are specific anti-avoidance provisions in respect of Partnerships with both corporate and individual partners that can, in certain circumstances, reallocate (for UK tax purposes) profits from a corporate partner to an individual where the individual could confer some benefit from the corporate partner's profit share. Other anti-avoidance provisions may also be triggered, such as transfer of income streams where profits are diverted away from an individual partner to a corporation. Both sets of anti-avoidance provisions are a highly complex area of UK legislation, and we would suggest specialist advice. 
When considering overseas entities, the UK authorities will not be bound by how the entity is classified in its country of origin. Case law has determined a number of matters that should be considered when establishing whether a non-UK entity should be taxed in the United Kingdom as if it were a company or a partnership. HMRC also maintains a public list of non-UK entities and the decisions it has previously made regarding their classification. However, if the parties have flexibility regarding the constitution of such entities, then their classification may be viewed differently, either by HMRC or the courts. This area is complex; consequently, specialist advice should be sought.
For commentary on basis period reform, please see '_Basis period reform' in the section of the Individual tax summary_.
## Foreign income
In principle, the United Kingdom taxes on a worldwide basis. However, where a company makes the necessary election, an exemption is applicable to profits attributable to the non-UK PEs through which it carries on a business.
Where an election has been made, it applies to all accounting periods starting after the date it was submitted and to all the company's PEs (so it cannot be made on a PE-by-PE basis). The election is irrevocable and has the effect of exempting all profits (including gains) of the PE, subject to certain adjustments and exclusions. Equally, relief for PE losses will be denied.
Certain profits are excluded from this exemption. Profits and losses from a company’s business that consists of the making of investments are not covered by the exemption unless they arise from assets that are ‘effectively connected’ with any part of the PE through which a trade or overseas property business of the company is carried out in the territory concerned. HMRC interprets ‘effectively connected’ narrowly for this purpose, considering it to only cover incidental amounts of investment income that arise in connection with a trade or overseas property business.
Profits and losses from a company’s trade of dealing in or developing UK land, UK property business, and other UK property income are also excluded from the exemption, along with any profits or losses arising from loan relationships or derivatives that relate to such activity.
Profits will be measured by reference to DTTs or, where none is applicable, OECD principles. The adjustments required include:
  * Gains attributable to a foreign branch of a close company are not exempt unless they accrue on the disposal of assets that have been used (and only used) for the purposes of a trade carried on by the company in the relevant territory through the company’s PE there.
  * Profits attributable to a foreign branch of a small company are not exempt if the PE is in a territory other than a 'full treaty territory' (broadly, a territory that has a DTT with the United Kingdom that has an exchange of information article).
  * If the branch concerned has previously been in a loss-making position, loss transitional rules may prevent the exemption being available immediately.
  * To the extent the branch profits are considered to have been artificially diverted from the United Kingdom, the anti-diversion rule will stop them qualifying for the exemption (akin to the controlled foreign company [CFC] rules that apply to profits of subsidiaries).


Where no election is made, profits from non-UK PEs are computed and taxed in the normal way for UK tax resident companies. However, UK tax will generally be reduced by credit for local direct taxes paid, either under a treaty or via the UK's unilateral relief rules (_see Foreign tax credit in the section for more information_).


# United Kingdom
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 15 December 2024
Resident companies are taxable in the United Kingdom on their worldwide profits (subject to an opt-out for non-UK PEs), while non-resident companies are subject to UK corporation tax on the trading profits attributable to a UK PE, the trading profits attributable to a trade of dealing in or developing UK land (irrespective of whether there is a UK PE), on gains on the direct and certain indirect disposals of UK property, and on UK property rental business profits plus UK income tax on any other UK-source income. In practice, for many companies, the application of a wide range of tax treaties, together with the dividend exemption, makes the UK corporation tax system more like a territorial system.
## General corporation tax rates
The main rate of corporation tax is 25% for the financial year beginning 1 April 2024 (previously 25% in the financial year beginning 1 April 2023). This main rate applies to companies with profits in excess of GBP 250,000. For UK resident companies with augmented profits below GBP 50,000, a lower rate of 19% is generally applicable. For companies with augmented profits between GBP 50,000 and GBP 250,000, there is a sliding scale of tax rates. For corporate entities with associated companies, both profit limits are divided by the number of active companies worldwide. The main rate of corporation tax and the small profits rate will remain at 25% and 19% respectively, for the financial year beginning 1 April 2025. 
Where the taxable profits can be attributed to the exploitation of patents, a lower effective rate of tax applies. The rate is 10%. Profits can include a significant part of the trading profit from the sales of a product that includes a patent, not just income from patent royalties.
## Special corporation tax regimes
Apart from the six specific exceptions noted below, there are no special regimes for particular types or sizes of business activity; in general, all companies in all sectors are subject to the same corporation tax rates and rules. However, certain treatments and reliefs do vary according to size, including transfer pricing, R&D credits, and some targeted anti-avoidance rules.
For large companies, there are some additional compliance and reporting requirements. Some elements of HMRC’s organisational structure and approach to avoidance and compliance are arranged by size of business (e.g. Large Business Strategy).
### **Oil and gas company regime**
Profits that arise from oil or gas extraction, or the enjoyment of oil or gas rights, in the United Kingdom and the UK Continental Shelf ('ring-fence profits') are subject to tax in the United Kingdom at a full rate of 30%. In addition, a supplementary charge to tax (SCT) of 10% applies to 'adjusted' ring-fence profits and a further 38% ‘windfall’ tax - the Energy Profits Levy (EPL) - also applies.
Whilst taxed at a higher rate, ring-fence profits do benefit from a number of enhanced incentives not historically available under the general corporation tax regime, including:
  * 100% capital allowances on most capital expenditure (although since 2023 this has been available to most UK businesses)
  * extended loss carryback rules on decommissioning expenditure (not available against the EPL), and
  * investment allowances providing relief against supplementary charge for capex incurred.


Petroleum revenue tax (PRT) is now set at 0% but is retained for technical and historical reasons. PRT refunds are subject to corporation tax and SCT in the period received.
Effective 26 May 2022, the Energy Profits Levy (EPL), an additional tax on the profits of oil and gas companies was brought into effect. The rates and reliefs have changed a number of times since it was introduced. Following the Labour Party’s October 2024 Budget, the EPL regime is broadly as follows:
  * The EPL rate is 38% from 1 November 2024 (it increased from 35%; it was originally 25%). 
  * No relief for EPL purposes is available for historical tax losses carried forward as at 26 May 2022 or for any decommissioning expenditure incurred. 
  * The EPL will continue to 31 March 2030 (originally 31 December 2025). 
  * The ‘normal’ 29% investment allowance - originally designed to encourage investment in the UK North Sea - has been removed from 1 November 2024. 
  * A 80% decarbonisation investment allowance exists for capital expenditure associated with the decarbonisation of upstream petroleum production.


The Energy Security Investment Mechanism (ESIM) means that::
  * EPL will not apply should oil and gas prices remain at or below USD 74.21/bbl for oil and GBP 0.57/thm for gas. These prices will be adjusted on 1 April each year, calculated based on the previous December’s consumer price index (CPI).
  * The reference price period (in which oil and gas prices must on average fall below the reference price) is a rolling six month period, ending on the last day of each calendar month. 
  * The government has confirmed that if ESIM is triggered, legislation will be enacted to end the EPL effective on the last day of the reference price period in which the price went below the threshold price for oil and gas.


The government continues to review the UK oil and gas fiscal regime and engage with the energy sector on future changes. The outcome from the most recent call for evidence was confirmation from the government of the core principles that will direct future policy decisions, including:
  * Supporting investment through predictability over the future tax treatment of price shocks and maintaining the existing set of investment incentives.
  * Outlining support for and conclusions about energy transition and decarbonisation.
  * Highlighting continued engagement on suggestions for simplifying the tax regime.


### **Life insurance company regime**
Life insurance businesses are also taxed under a special regime, which effectively includes different corporation tax rates as well as special rules for quantifying profits.
### **Tonnage Tax regime**
Companies that are liable to corporation tax and operate qualifying ships that are strategically and commercially managed in the United Kingdom can elect (subject to certain conditions) to apply Tonnage Tax in the place of corporation tax. Tonnage Tax is an alternative method of calculating corporation tax profits by reference to the net tonnage of operated ships. The Tonnage Tax profit replaces the tax-adjusted profit/loss on a shipping business and certain related activities, as well as the chargeable gains/losses made on Tonnage Tax assets. Any other profits are taxable under the normal corporation tax regime.
A Tonnage Tax election must, broadly, be made within 12 months from the day that the company became eligible to enter the regime. However, a new window for entry into the Tonnage Tax regime for eligible companies from 1 June 2023 to 30 November 2024 was announced in Budget 2023 and implemented by a Statutory Instrument made on 9 May 2023. 
Finance Act 2024 extended the scope of Tonnage Tax to include elections into the regime by companies that manage qualifying ships, with effect for elections made on or after 1 April 2024. In addition, Finance Act 2024 increased the capital allowance limit for persons who lease ships to companies within Tonnage Tax with effect for leases entered into on or after 1 April 2024. 
### **Banking sector**
A supplementary tax (‘banking surcharge’) is applicable to companies in the banking sector at 3% on profits in excess of GBP 100 million with effect for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 April 2023. Prior to this date, the rate of supplementary corporate tax charge was 8% on profits above GBP 100 million. 
Loss utilisation is restricted; pre-1 April 2015 carried forward trading losses can be set against only 25% of profits in a period, and post-1 April 2015 carried forward trading losses are subject to the general loss restriction.
### **Real estate investment trust (REIT) regime**
A UK REIT is, broadly, a UK resident company or a group of companies of which the principal company is UK tax resident, carrying on a property investment business, with property let to third-party tenants. Subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, REITs are taxed under a special regime. 
A UK REIT is exempt from UK tax on both rental income and gains relating to its qualifying property rental business, as well as gains on the sale of shares in qualifying UK property-rich companies. 
Profits from activities of the REIT other than the property rental business (the ‘residual business’) are subject to corporation tax in the normal way.
Tax is effectively levied at the investor level (subject to the tax status of investors) on their share of rental income that is distributed to them by the REIT as a property income distribution (PID) on which 20% withholding tax (WHT) is applied, subject to certain exemptions. Distributions of exempt gains are treated in the same way (i.e. as PIDs).
Shareholders are generally treated as receiving property income, which is subject to corporation tax/income tax at the investor’s marginal tax rate. However, investors who are exempt from UK tax can reclaim any WHT to put them into a position equivalent to investing directly in UK real estate.
For non-resident investors, it may be possible to reclaim some or all of the WHT on dividends, depending on the terms of any relevant double tax treaty (DTT).
### **Qualifying asset holding company (QAHC) regime**
The QAHC regime was introduced with effect from April 2022, and slightly amended in 2023, in order to mitigate the tax roadblocks that prevent the use of a UK company to act as a holding company/intermediate holding company. 
A QAHC must be at least 70% owned by diversely owned funds managed by regulated managers, or certain institutional investors, and exists to facilitate the flow of capital, income, and gains between investors and underlying investments. There are a number of detailed provisions relating to the regime, but broadly, in terms of the benefits, it is allowed tax exemption/benefits in respect of:
  * Gains on the disposal of certain shares and non-UK property. 
  * The profits of an overseas property business.
  * The obligation to deduct income tax at the basic rate on payments of interest.
  * Modified rules in relation to deductions for interest and other finance costs on debt funding the QAHC.


Also, there is capital (as opposed to income) treatment of payments in the hands of investors made where a QAHC redeems, repays, or repurchases its own shares, and an exemption from stamp duty/stamp duty reserve tax (SDRT) on repurchases by a QAHC of share and loan capital.
### **Residential Property Developer Tax (RPDT)**
A UK RPDT was introduced with effect from 1 April 2022. It applies to a company or corporate group that holds or has held interests in land/property as trading stock in the course of a trade and is subject to corporation tax on trading profits from residential property development activity. The tax applies at a rate of 4% to annual profits exceeding GBP 25 million (on a group basis, where relevant).
## Income tax for non-resident companies
A non-resident company is subject to UK corporation tax on the trading profits of a UK PE and, irrespective of whether there is a UK PE, the trading profits attributable to a trade of dealing in or developing UK land, as well as profits from a UK property rental business. Non-resident companies are also subject to UK corporation tax on gains on the direct and certain indirect disposals of UK property (_see '_Capital gains on disposal of UK immovable property by non-UK residents’_ in the section_).
Any other UK-source income received by a non-resident company is subject to UK income tax at the basic rate, currently 20%, without any allowances (subject to any relief offered by a DTT, if applicable). This charge has most commonly arisen in relation to UK rental income earned by a corporate non-resident landlord (NRL), which, until 5 April 2020, was within the scope of UK income tax. The United Kingdom operates an NRL scheme that requires the NRL's letting agent or tenants to withhold income tax at 20% at source unless they have been notified that the NRL has applied for and been given permission to receive gross rents. The NRL scheme is continuing, notwithstanding that corporate NRLs are now within the scope of corporation tax in respect of the profits of their property rental business (_see ‘Non-resident companies within corporation tax on UK property rental business income from 6 April 2020' in the section_).
## Diverted Profits Tax (DPT)
DPT, introduced in April 2015, is part of the United Kingdom’s response to the shifting tax environment, most notably highlighted in the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) reports. DPT is separate from other corporate taxes. The usual rate of DPT charged on diverted profits (as defined) was increased from 25% to 31% from 1 April 2023, with apportionment provisions for accounting periods straddling the commencement date. This increase was made in order to maintain the differential between the rate of DPT and corporation tax, which was also increased by 6% from that date. The rate of DPT charged on diverted profits that are UK ring-fenced profits or notional ring-fence profits (broadly oil extraction operations) remains 55%. The rate of DPT charged on taxable diverted profits that would have been subject to the bank surcharge remains unchanged at 33%.
DPT may apply in two circumstances:
  1. where groups create a tax benefit by using transactions or entities that lack economic substance (as defined), involving an effective tax mismatch outcome and the insufficient economic substance condition is met, and/or
  2. where foreign companies have structured their UK activities to avoid a UK PE involving an effective tax mismatch outcome and the insufficient economic substance condition is met and/or the tax avoidance condition is met.


There are several situations or types of transactions that are not within the scope of the DPT rules.
The following are not within the scope of the DPT rules in either of the circumstances outlined above:
  * transactions where the parties are both SMEs,
  * situations where the tax mismatch arises from loan relationships (and derivatives hedging loan relationships), and
  * transactions involving the receipt of payments by the following types of bodies:
    * pension funds
    * person with sovereign immunity
    * certain investment funds, and
    * charities.


The following are not within the scope of the DPT rules in the second circumstance only:
  * total UK-related sales revenue is less than GBP 10 million for the period, or 
  * total UK-related expenses are less than GBP 1 million for the period.


Companies are required to notify HMRC if they are potentially within the scope of DPT (even if it is anticipated that there will be no DPT payable, e.g. due to credit relief) within three months of the end of the accounting period to which the notification would relate. The legislation is complex and subjective in places, and it has the potential to apply more widely than might be expected.
In January 2019, HMRC launched the Profit Diversion Compliance Facility, which is aimed at multinationals using arrangements targeted by DPT who are not currently under a DPT or transfer pricing enquiry.
The Facility is designed to encourage businesses potentially impacted to review their tax policies, change them as appropriate, and use the Facility to submit a report with a proposal to pay any additional tax, interest, or penalties due. This enables the business to bring their tax affairs up to date efficiently and without intervention from HMRC.
Finance Act 2022 (FA22) introduced three changes to the rules. It inserted a new subsection (101C FA2015) that provides that a final closure notice may not be issued in relation to an open enquiry where the review period for a DPT charging notice remains open. This is clearly a response to the First-tier Tribunal (FTT) decision in Vitol Aviation Ltd v HMRC, in which the FTT found that HMRC was in possession of sufficient information on the transfer pricing aspects to close their corporation tax enquiries and despite the DPT review period still being open, the FTT directed HMRC to close their corporation tax enquiries. This is an important immediate change to the legislation, resulting in DPT still being the 'stick' to encourage the resolution of transfer pricing disputes. This change has effect in relation to any relevant tribunal direction that is given on or after 27 October 2021, unless the application for the direction was made before 27 September 2021.
In addition, FA22 also: 
  * Extended the ability to amend tax returns under s101 A / B to the last 30 days of the review period instead of the first 12 months of the review period. Practically, this gives taxpayers an additional two months to agree to a corporation tax resolution to a DPT enquiry.
  * Introduced a measure to allow relief against DPT to be given where it is necessary to give effect to a decision reached in a Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP). This is a significant reversal of HMRC’s earlier position that DPT was 'treaty-proof' and will be a welcome development for taxpayers subject to DPT enquiries.


As part of HMRC’s consultation on the UK DPT legislation (as well as other international tax matters) back in June 2023, the main issue in focus is whether to remove DPT’s separate tax status and bring it within the scope of corporation tax by way of a new ’diverted profits tax assessment‘, explicitly acknowledging the connection between DPT and transfer pricing, and providing access to treaty benefits. This is seen as a notable simplification that would provide greater certainty and clarity.
In addition, there are some points that HMRC was looking to clarify in law to reflect their position in practice, including:
  * Confirming that the effective tax mismatch outcome (in essence the DPT approach to ’tax advantage‘) applies equally to a reduction in UK income as it does to an increase in UK expenses.
  * Clarifying that DPT applies to the creation or increase in the amount of a loss and not only to a reduction in profit.
  * Aligning the wording of the ’relevant alternative provision‘ (akin to the comparison with a third-party transaction) more closely to the UK’s tax treaties.


As noted above, the Government has announced that it will further consult on reforms to the UK DPT legislation in Spring 2025.
## Local income taxes
There are no local or provincial taxes on income, although legislative powers are in place to introduce a reduced rate of corporation tax in Northern Ireland. It is not clear when the reduced rate will be introduced or at what rate.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 15 December 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate of 20% applies to most goods and services, apart from domestic fuel and power and certain other reduced-rate supplies, which are subject to VAT at 5%. Traders who generate revenues above the VAT registration threshold (currently GBP 90,000 ) are required to register for VAT and charge VAT on their sales of goods and services. 
Certain small traders (supplies less than GBP 150,000 ) with a limited range of expenses may adopt a special flat-rate scheme, which computes VAT at a sector-specific flat rate.
Most exports, most food, most public transport, most books and publications (including, from 1 May 2020, e-publications), and certain essential goods and services are zero-rated. Some supplies are exempt, the main categories being the grant of certain interests in land, insurance, financial services, betting and gaming, education, certain sports services, cultural services, and health and welfare. Zero-rating is preferable to exemption because the VAT on costs incurred in making a zero-rated supply can be recovered while that incurred in making an exempt supply cannot.
VAT is chargeable on the supply of most goods and services made in the United Kingdom by 'taxable persons' in the course of business, when their taxable turnover exceeds the registration thresholds. Taxable persons include individuals, companies, partnerships, clubs, associations, or charities.
Taxable persons who are not normally resident in the United Kingdom, do not have a business establishment in the United Kingdom, and, in the case of companies, are not incorporated in the United Kingdom, but who make taxable supplies, sales to unregistered persons in the United Kingdom, or acquisitions of goods in the United Kingdom above the relevant limits, may be required to register and account for VAT in the United Kingdom.
If the value of taxable supplies is over a specified limit, registration for VAT is compulsory unless the taxable supplies made are wholly or mainly zero-rated, in which case it is possible to apply for exemption from registration. A zero VAT registration threshold applies for businesses not established in the United Kingdom.
The rules applying to VAT and territoriality are different to those applying to direct tax in that they derive from the principles of the place of supply in EU law, as enshrined in European Commission (EC) VAT Directives. Having determined that a supply of goods or services has taken place, the second condition to be determined, if the transaction is to fall within the scope of UK VAT, is whether the supply takes place within the United Kingdom. The place of supply rules are different for goods and for services. A person or business belonging outside the United Kingdom, with no place of business in the United Kingdom, may, nevertheless, be liable to UK VAT registration where the place of supply of those goods or services is in the United Kingdom.
For goods, the basic rule is that a supply of goods is taxable in the territory where those goods are physically located at the time of supply. Hence, if goods are supplied in the United Kingdom by a non-established taxable person, there will still be a liability for VAT purposes, and the person must register for VAT in the United Kingdom if the taxable supplies exceed the current UK VAT registration thresholds. A zero VAT registration threshold applies for businesses not established in the United Kingdom.
For services, the basic rule is that services are treated as made where the customer 'belongs' or is established for VAT purposes, and the customer is responsible for accounting for the VAT due via the reverse-charge procedure. However, this is subject to a number of special rules and exceptions. Determining where a business is established for VAT purposes is based on EU law criteria.
For business-to-consumer (B2C) supplies, the basic rule is that services are treated as made where the supplier 'belongs' or is established for VAT purposes. B2C supplies of telecommunications, broadcasting, and electronic services are taxed where the customer is located or is normally resident.
### **VAT returns and payments**
VAT returns must be completed at pre-set intervals (usually every three months). Larger companies may be required to file monthly returns or make monthly payments on account. All businesses are required to file VAT returns online and make electronic payments. Smaller enterprises can apply for annual returns. VAT returns are usually required to be filed 30 days after the end of the period.
All businesses are required to keep and preserve digital records and provide VAT returns using compatible software. This is done via an ‘application programming interface’ (API), which enables taxpayers to communicate electronically with HMRC. 
Annual accounting is available for taxable persons with annual turnover (taxable supplies, excluding VAT) not exceeding GBP 1,350,000.
Cash accounting is available for taxable persons with annual turnover (taxable supplies, excluding VAT) not exceeding GBP 1,350,000.
In addition, a flat rate scheme is available for small businesses with annual turnover (taxable supplies, excluding VAT) not exceeding GBP 150,000 and is intended to simplify VAT accounting procedures.
### **Brexit**
While the United Kingdom is no longer part of the European Union, under the Northern Ireland Protocol (NIP), Northern Ireland (NI) remains part of the single market and will continue to follow the rules for intra-Community supplies and acquisitions so that goods moving between Great Britain (GB) and Northern Ireland are treated as though they are imports/exports and goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the European Union will be subject to ‘Northern Ireland acquisition VAT’. Goods entering Great Britain from Northern Ireland are therefore subject to VAT as though they were imports, and relevant UK legislation applies. Goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain are also subject to VAT as though they were imports, and relevant EU or UK legislation applies as appropriate.
‘Distance sales' of goods from GB to EU consumers (B2C transactions) are no longer subject to the distance selling thresholds set by member states, and GB suppliers are required to comply with the rules on imported goods and local supplies in each of the EU member states (including local 'low value consignment relief' rules).
Businesses identified for VAT purposes under the NIP are subject to existing rules in respect of distance sales of goods to consumers (B2C) in EU member states, and EU businesses are able to supply goods to NI consumers under existing distance selling arrangements.
Following the withdrawal of 'low value consignment relief', import VAT is no longer due at the border for most consignments valued below GBP 135. From 1 January 2021, overseas businesses selling direct to UK consumers are required to register and account for VAT in the United Kingdom where the value of any consignment is GBP 135 or less. However, 'low value consignment relief' from import VAT for consignments not exceeding GBP 15 continues to apply in Northern Ireland (although not in respect of goods that are ordered remotely).
For movements of own goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, output VAT will need to be accounted for on the VAT return; this may also be reclaimed as input VAT (on the same VAT return), subject to the normal rules. For movements of own goods from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, no VAT will need to be accounted for unless the goods have been subject to a sale or supply to a customer.
UK VAT groups continue to operate largely as they did before the NIP came into force. The exceptions are:
  * Where goods are supplied by members of a VAT group, and those goods move from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, VAT will now be due in the same way as when a business moves its own goods.
  * Where supplies of goods are made between members of a VAT group, those goods are located in Northern Ireland at the time that they are supplied, and one or both members only have establishments in Great Britain, VAT must be accounted for by the representative member but may be reclaimed, subject to the normal rules.


In February 2023, the United Kingdom and the European Union agreed wide ranging amendments to the Northern Ireland Protocol, titled the Windsor Framework, in order to smooth the flow of trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Protocol, reached as part of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, aimed to prevent a hard border on the Island of Ireland and stipulated that Northern Ireland remained subject to certain EU customs, VAT, and regulatory rules. The implementation of the Protocol has led to numerous issues for businesses operating in and with Northern Ireland and has therefore been subject to continuous negotiations.
The amended agreement aims to remove these issues by: 
  * Creating ‘Green Lanes’ enabling goods that are transported from Great Britain to Northern Ireland that are destined to stay in Northern Ireland to be transported with minimal checks and paperwork.
  * Amending the text of the Protocol to ensure that UK VAT and excise changes will apply to Northern Ireland and not just Great Britain.
  * Implementing a new ‘Stormont Brake’ that will give the Northern Ireland Assembly the ability to block certain new EU laws from applying in Northern Ireland. 


The changes are set to take place in stages up to 2025 to provide businesses with time to adapt to the new arrangements.
Supplies of services between the United Kingdom and the European Union are treated, with effect from 1 January 2021, as supplies of services to a third country. The UK VAT rules determine the place of supply, whether the supply is subject to UK VAT, and whether input VAT incurred in making the supply is recoverable in the United Kingdom.
Following the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union, the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Act was enacted in 2023. This act makes provision for significant changes to the status and operation of retained European law. In order to prevent the repeal of several EU derived UK VAT and excise provisions as a result of this act, Finance Act 2024 included specific provisions for retained EU law relating to VAT, excise, and customs duty. As a consequence, UK VAT and excise law that was in force prior to 1 January 2021 (EU exit day) will continue to be interpreted in line with EU law principles.
The VAT directive remains applicable to Northern Ireland as regards all supplies of goods, but it does not apply to the supplies of services.
## Digital Services Tax (DST)
Pending international agreement on how to address the tax challenges of the digitalisation of the economy, in particular the OECD’s two-pillar approach, the United Kingdom has introduced a DST as an interim measure to address these tax challenges. From April 2020, this new DST applies at a rate of 2% to the revenues of certain digital businesses to reflect the value they derive from the participation of UK users, pending an appropriate international solution. The tax applies to annual UK revenues above GBP 25 million from activities relating to Internet search engines, social media platforms, and online marketplaces (of businesses with in-scope annual global revenues of more than GBP 500 million). Loss-makers are exempt, and businesses with very low profit margins are subject to a reduced effective rate. The intention, reiterated by the Government in the 2024 Autumn Budget, is that this will be disapplied once the OECD's appropriate global solution is in place.
## Customs and excise duties
Many goods imported into the United Kingdom from outside the European Union are subject to customs duties. The rates of duty are provided by the EU's Common Customs Tariff and vary widely.
Excise duties are chargeable on most hydrocarbon oil products, alcoholic drinks, and tobacco products imported into or produced in the United Kingdom. Examples include the following (note that the duty structure for alcoholic drinks was reformed from 1 August 2023):
Products | Excise duty (GBP)  
---|---  
Road fuels | 0.5295 per litre  
Cigarettes | The higher of 16.5% of retail price plus 316.70 per 1,000 cigarettes or 422.80 per 1,000 cigarettes.  
Tobacco (hand rolling) | 412.32 per kg  
Wines (8.5% to 22%) | 28.50 per litre of pure alcohol included  
Spirits | 31.64 per litre of pure alcohol included  
Following the end of the Brexit transitional period on 31 December 2020, goods moving between Great Britain and the European Union are treated as imports and exports. Under the provisions of the NIP, Northern Ireland has a special status in regards to customs.
EU goods imported into the United Kingdom by entering Northern Ireland are treated as domestic goods and will not be chargeable to import duty. However, anti-avoidance provisions apply in circumstances where goods are moved via Northern Ireland specifically to avoid paying UK duties that would have applied if the goods had moved directly from the European Union to the United Kingdom. Non-EU goods imported into the United Kingdom by entering Northern Ireland are subject to duty charged in accordance with EU customs legislation.
Rules allow UK-established traders to use a duty deferment account without holding a Customs Comprehensive Guarantee, upon grant of a guarantee waiver by HMRC. 
VAT-registered traders choosing not to, or not eligible to, defer their import declarations will still be able to use postponed VAT accounting if they choose to do so.
The United Kingdom has lost access to the intra-EU reporting functionality within the Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS). EMCS remains operational in the United Kingdom, but now operates solely for internal UK duty-suspended movements, including movements between the importer or exporter’s warehouse and the port.
Importers wishing to move goods under excise duty suspension need to be approved as a Registered Consignor (or seek the services of one) to declare goods to EMCS from the port of import. An excise movement guarantee must be in place (if required) for duty-suspended imports to cover the movement from the port to the warehouse.
Traders using the Common Transit Convention to import and export need to follow all transit procedures from 1 January 2021.
## Soft drinks industry levy (SDIL)
The government introduced legislation with effect from April 2018 to encourage the reformulation of drinks that are high in added sugar by levying a unit charge on UK producers and importers of such drinks. There is an exemption for smaller producers. For drinks that contain at least 5 grams (but less than 8 grams) of sugar per 100 millilitres of prepared drink, the SDIL will be charged at the rate of GBP 0.18 per litre of prepared drink; where the drink contains at least 8 grams of sugar per 100 millilitres, the SDIL will be charged at the rate of GBP 0.24 per litre of prepared drink.
## Stamp taxes
Stamp duty is charged at 0.5% on instruments effecting sales of shares. Agreements to sell shares usually attract stamp duty reserve tax (SDRT) at 0.5%. The liability to SDRT may be cancelled by paying the stamp duty due on a stock transfer form (or other transfer instrument) executed in pursuance of the agreement. Stamp duty is not usually charged on an issue of shares. Issues or transfers of shares to clearance services or depositary receipt systems that are not an integral part of an issue of share capital may attract SDRT at 1.5% (stamp duty at 1.5% may be payable on instruments effecting transfers of shares to such services or systems). Transfers of bearer shares also attract stamp duty at 1.5%.
Acquisitions of non-residential or mixed land and buildings in England and Northern Ireland are charged stamp duty land tax (SDLT) at progressive rates of up to 5%; the 5% rate applies for the portion of the consideration exceeding GBP 250,000. Acquisitions of residential property by companies and similar non-natural persons and by individuals acquiring second homes are charged at rates of up to 17% (15% pre 31 October 2024) (whereas acquisitions by individuals who do not own any other properties or who are replacing their main residence are capped at 12%). Companies and non-natural persons are subject to the 17% rate where the consideration exceeds GBP 500,000 and the company is not using the property for one of certain specific business purposes. Individuals and trusts will be subject to the 17%/12% where the consideration exceeds GBP 1.5 million. An additional 2% surcharge also applies to the acquisition of residential property by non-resident purchasers. Grants of new commercial leases are charged SDLT at 1% of the net present value (NPV) of the rents payable in excess of GBP 150,000 up to GBP 5 million and 2% of the NPV in excess of GBP 5 million. SDLT is also payable at up to 5% on any premium paid. Grants of residential leases are charged at 1% of the NPV of the rents payable in excess of GBP 125,000 plus up to 15% on any premium paid.
Purchases of land and buildings in Scotland are subject to Land and Buildings Transactions Tax (LBTT). Residential rates are graduated up to 12%, which applies for the portion of the consideration exceeding GBP 750,000. The Additional Dwellings Supplement (ADS) may also apply in respect of the purchase of second homes or buy-to-let properties, as well as certain acquisitions of residential interests by 'non-natural' persons. ADS applies to add a 6% surcharge to each consideration 'band'. In respect of non-residential interests, rates are graduated up to 5%; the top rate applies to the portion of the consideration exceeding GBP 250,000. Acquisitions of non-residential leases are chargeable to LBTT based on the NPV of rents over the term of the lease (calculated with reference to the first five years of the lease) as well as any premium payable. Rates are graduated up to 2% for any NPV of rents exceeding GBP 2 million. The tax due on the premium is calculated with reference to the non-residential freehold rates. A further LBTT return must be submitted on every third anniversary of the lease to take account of any changes that have taken place in the previous three years (e.g. to the rental payments) and any extensions or variations to the lease that have been agreed during that three-year period.
Land and buildings in Wales are subject to Land Transactions Tax (LTT). Residential rates are graduated up to 12%, which applies to the portion of the consideration exceeding GBP 1.5 million. The higher rates of LTT apply to add a 4% surcharge to each consideration band in respect of purchases of second homes and buy-to-lets as well as certain residential acquisitions by 'non-natural' persons. In respect of non-residential interests, rates are graduated up to 6%; the top rate applies to the portion of the consideration exceeding GBP 1 million. The acquisition of non-residential leases is chargeable to LTT based on the NPV of rents over the term of the lease (calculated with reference to the first five years of the lease) as well as any premium payable. Rates are graduated up to 2% for any NPV of rents exceeding GBP 2 million. The tax due on the premium is calculated with reference to the non-residential freehold rates. LTT is not charged on the NPV of the rents payable on the grant of a residential lease.
## Annual tax on enveloped dwellings (ATED) and related capital gains tax charge
An annual tax on enveloped dwellings is charged on the acquisition and holding of high-value residential properties (property over GBP 500,000) through a company or other 'non-natural' person. From 1 April 2023, for properties acquired before 1 April 2022, this is based on the value of the property at 1 April 2022, and for properties acquired on or after 1 April 2022, this is based on the value at acquisition. The charge on a property worth GBP 20 million or more cannot exceed GBP 292,350  from April 2025. The minimum charge is GBP 4,450 from April 2025 for a property valued at GBP 500,000.
There are certain reliefs that may be claimed to reduce the charge to nil, including where the residential property is let to third parties on a commercial basis or is part of the stock of a property trading company. There are also some complete exemptions from the regime, including charitable companies and public bodies.
In addition, a disposal of any property or an interest in such a property by a company or other non-natural person was, until 5 April 2019, subject to UK tax on gains. However, the ATED gains regime has been abolished from 6 April 2019 on the introduction of the broader non-UK resident gains regime applying to immovable property. The historic ATED-related gains regime, which charged capital gains tax at 28% on any gains accruing after 5 April 2013 (subject to relief for most property used for commercial, charitable, or public use), has been consolidated into the broader regime, which taxes all UK immovable property gains realised by non-UK residents (_see ‘Capital gains on disposal of UK immovable property by non-UK residents’ in the section_).
## Payroll taxes
Other than employers’ national insurance contributions (NICs) (), there are no other payroll taxes, the burden of which falls on the employer. Employers are, however, responsible for deducting the employees’ income tax liability at source, through the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system. The employer may also be required to deduct other amounts from pay (e.g. court orders).
## Employers' national insurance contributions (NICs)
Employers are obliged to pay NICs based on a percentage of each employee's earnings. For the year ending 5 April 2025, the rate is 13.8% on all earnings above GBP 175 per week.
## Apprenticeship levy
Employers are required to pay 0.5% of their total payroll in excess of GBP 3 million to create a fund to support apprenticeships.
## Pension protection fund levy
All defined benefit pension schemes pay a levy, based on pension fund liabilities and the financial risk of the employing company. This levy funds a compensation fund for pensioners and employees of failed schemes.
## Bank levy
A bank levy takes the form of an annual tax on certain liabilities of most UK-based banks and building societies. The tax is levied at the following annualised rates (for any periods on or after 1 January 2021):
  * 0.10% of a bank's short-term relevant liabilities.
  * 0.05% of long-term equity and liabilities.


The levy is not charged on the first GBP 20 billion of chargeable liabilities and is not deductible for corporation tax purposes. From 2021, it no longer applies to overseas branches and subsidiaries held by the UK business.
Bank profits are also subject to a 3% supplementary corporation tax charge on profits above GBP 100 million for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2023. Prior to this date, the rate of supplementary corporation tax charge was 8% on profits above GBP 25 million. Companies with accounting periods straddling 1 April 2023 must time-apportion their profits for the purpose of calculating the amount of surcharge.
## Insurance premium tax (IPT)
IPT at the standard rate of 12% applies to premiums for most general insurance, such as for buildings and contents and motor insurance, where the insured risk is in the United Kingdom. Life assurance and other long-term insurance remain exempt, though there are anti-avoidance rules surrounding long-term medical care policies. As an anti-avoidance measure, a higher rate of 20% applies to insurance sold by suppliers of specified goods or services, e.g. mechanical breakdown insurance, travel insurance (irrespective of supplier), insurance sold with TV and car hire, and 'non-financial' guaranteed asset protection (GAP) insurance sold through suppliers of motor vehicles or persons connected with them. Further anti-avoidance rules affect administration or similar fees connected with contracts of insurance, charged under separate contracts by brokers and other intermediaries.
## Airport passenger duty
Individuals leaving the United Kingdom by air are obligated to pay a duty, which, in practice, is invariably included in the cost of the air ticket. Typically, such taxes are borne by employers in respect of employee’s business travel. Further, significantly higher rates apply for travel in certain 'executive jets'.
## Environmental taxes
There are several environmental taxes, including the following.
### **Landfill tax**
The landfill tax is a tax on waste disposal in landfill sites. The standard rate increased from GBP 102.10 per tonne to GBP 103.70 per tonne from 1 April 2024. The reduced rate for inert waste increased from GBP 3.25 per tonne to GBP 3.30 per tonne from 1 April 2023. From 1 April 2024, the standard rate will increase to GBP 126.15 per tonne and the reduced rate will increase to GBP 4.05 per tonne.
### **Climate change levy**
The climate change levy is a tax on energy used in the United Kingdom, such as electricity, gas, coal, etc., and is charged at rates that depend on the nature of the fuel used. There are reduced rates and exclusions from the charge, e.g. supplies to domestic or charitable users, renewable source energy, and energy-intensive sectors committing to specific emissions/energy-saving measures.
### **Aggregates levy**
The aggregates levy is a tax on the extraction or importation of sand, gravel, and crushed rock for commercial exploitation in the United Kingdom. The rate of tax is GBP 2.03 per tonne and will increase to GBP 2.08 per tonne from 1 April 2025. The Scottish Parliament is currently considering the devolution of aggregates levy to Scotland with effect from 1 April 2026.
### **Carbon Reduction Commitment**
The Carbon Reduction Commitment is a mandatory scheme for large businesses with financial, reputational, and behavioural drivers aimed at improving energy efficiency.
### **Plastic packaging tax**
The government introduced a tax on the production and import of plastic packaging from 1 April 2022. This tax applies to plastic packaging that does not contain at least 30% recycled plastic. The rate of tax increased from GBP 200 per tonne to GBP 210.82 per tonne from 1 April 2023 and increased to GBP 217.85 per tonne from 1 April 2024.
## Local municipal taxes
Local taxes are not based on income, but rather are levied on the occupiers of business property by reference to a deemed annual rental (or 'rateable') value for the property concerned. These taxes (known as 'business rates') are administered by regional local government authorities rather than central government. The amounts paid are deductible for corporation tax purposes, provided they meet all the usual requirements for deductibility.
## Offshore Receipts in Respect of Intangible Property (ORIP) tax
The ORIP tax, introduced with effect from 6 April 2019, taxes UK-derived intangible property receipts arising to non-UK resident persons.
In overview, it imposes a 20% income tax charge on the gross amount of capital and revenue arising in respect of the enjoyment or exercise of rights that constitute intangible property (broadly defined) where the enjoyment or exercise of those rights enables, facilitates, or promotes UK sales of goods, services, or other property, if:
  * the recipient is not resident (as specifically defined for this purpose) in either the United Kingdom or a territory with which the United Kingdom has a full tax treaty (again, as specifically defined for this purpose), and
  * none of the exemptions apply.


This wording would appear sufficiently broad to catch receipts paid under almost any licence but not outright sales of intangible property or pre-existing licences.
The legislation includes (from 6 April 2019) the following exemptions:
  * Exclusion of companies for which the associated UK sales of goods, services, or other property in the tax year are less than GBP 10 million.
  * Exclusion of companies where the tax levied in the country of residence on the relevant income is at least half of the UK tax (but note that UK tax is on gross receipts, so this test may be hard to meet).
  * Exclusion of companies when the creation, development, and maintenance activities, and the activities undertaken for the purpose of generating receipts for the company in question, have always been undertaken in the company's territory of residence and the intangible property has not been acquired or derived from a related party.
  * Exclusion of companies resident in territories with which the United Kingdom does not have a full tax treaty if the company is resident in a territory on an excluded territories list and meets certain other conditions. This excluded territories list has not yet been published.
  * UK sales that are promoted, enabled, or facilitated to only an insignificant extent by a person’s intangible property will not need to be taken into account where those sales are made by an unconnected person (e.g. if a group makes a non-UK sale of a low value component and the unrelated buyer then makes a UK sale of a high value product that includes that component).
  * Where intangible property is licensed through a chain of related companies, a form of credit relief will (subject to certain conditions) be available to reduce or eliminate economic double taxation under the offshore receipts regime.


Special rules exist to deal with situations in which the overseas recipient of the income or capital concerned is a partnership.
In November 2023, the government announced that it will abolish the ORIP rules in respect of income arising from 31 December 2024. Legislation has been introduced in Finance Bill 2024-25 which, when enacted, will achieve this. The repeal of the ORIP rules will take place alongside the introduction of the UTPR, which the Government considers will more comprehensively discourage the multinational tax-planning arrangements that ORIP sought to counter.
