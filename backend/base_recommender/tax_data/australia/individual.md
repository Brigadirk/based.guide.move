## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 16 December 2024
## Foreign tax relief
Australian-resident individuals (who are not temporary residents) are subject to Australian tax on their worldwide income, with a foreign income tax offset (FITO) allowed for most foreign income taxes paid to the extent of Australian tax payable on foreign sourced and foreign taxed amounts. Such offsets are, subject to some additional restrictions, also available to non-residents.
## Tax treaties
Australia has tax treaties with many countries throughout the world. Under the treaties some forms of income are exempt from tax or qualify for reduced rates. These include royalties, dividends, and capital gains.
Below is a list of countries with which Australia currently has a tax treaty:
Argentina | Indonesia | Poland  
---|---|---  
Aruba * | Ireland | Romania  
Austria * | Isle of Man * | Russia  
Belgium | Israel  | Samoa *  
British Virgin Islands * | Italy | Singapore  
Canada | Japan | Slovakia  
Chile | Jersey * | South Africa  
China | Kiribati | Spain  
Cook Islands * | Korea | Sri Lanka  
Czech Republic | Malaysia | Sweden  
Denmark | Malta | Switzerland  
Fiji | Marshall Islands * | Taiwan  
Finland | Mauritius * | Thailand  
France | Mexico | Turkey  
Germany | Netherlands | United Kingdom  
Guernsey * | New Zealand | United States  
Hungary | Norway | Vietnam  
Iceland | Papua New Guinea  
India | Philippines  
* Limited to allocation of taxing rights in respect of certain income derived by specified individuals, such as retirees, government employees, and students.
The Australian government plans to enter into new and updated tax treaties in the coming years. A new treaty with Portugal was signed on 30 November 2023 (yet to enter into force) and a new treaty with Slovenia was signed on 9 September 2024 (yet to enter into force). Australia is also working towards negotiating its first tax treaties with Ukraine and Brazil, and will update its treaties with New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, and Sweden.
Australia has also entered into bilateral agreements with a number of countries in relation to the exchange of information in relation to taxes.
Australia has enacted the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (MLI). The MLI has been ratified, which means that it applies to ‘covered countries’, such as Belgium, Canada, France, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 16 December 2024
In March 2024, the government legislated a revised phase of tax cuts to take effect from 1 July 2024. Under the new tax rate schedule, additional tax cuts were provided to lower income earners._See the section for more information._
Under the superannuation guarantee (SG) scheme, employers are required to contribute a certain percentage of an employee's earnings base, subject to limited exceptions, to a registered superannuation fund or retirement savings account on behalf of the employee. From 1 July 2024, the SG percentage is 11.5% (up from 11%) and will remain so until 30 June 2025, after which time it will increase to 12%. In addition, from 1 July 2024, the caps on the amount of contributions that can be made to complying superannuation funds have increased. _See the section for more information._
The state of Victoria has a short stay levy (7.5%) that will apply to fees charged for short stay accommodation in a Victorian property from 1 January 2025. _See the section for more information._
The Australian government plans to enter into many new and updated tax treaties, with a new treaty with Portugal signed on 30 November 2023 and a new treaty with Slovenia signed on 9 September 2024 (both yet to enter into force). The relatively recently signed treaty with Iceland has entered into force to apply from as early as 1 January 2024. _See the section for more information._
For contracts entered into from 1 January 2025, a non-final 15% withholding tax (previously 12.5%) applies to the gross proceeds of the sale of taxable Australian property by non-residents._See the section for more information._
The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) continues to run a number of targeted income tax compliance programs, the aim of which is to provide greater assurance to the community that high wealth private groups and individuals are paying the right amount of tax. _See the section for more information._

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 16 December 2024
A resident individual is subject to Australian income tax on a worldwide basis, i.e. income from both Australian and foreign sources (except for certain foreign income and gains of temporary residents; _see Capital gains under the section for more information_).
A non-resident individual is liable to Australian income tax only on income (other than interest, royalties, and dividends, which are generally subject to withholding tax [WHT]) derived from sources in Australia, and certain statutory income that is taxable on a basis other than source (e.g. certain capital gains).
Australia has no surtaxes, alternative, or other income taxes on personal income.
## Personal income tax (PIT) rates
From 1 July 2024, a revised phase of tax cuts has been legislated to take effect. The following tables set out the PIT rates that apply to resident and non-resident individuals for the years ending 30 June 2025 and 30 June 2024. 
### Residents
The following table applies to the 2024/25 financial year, i.e. from 1 July 2024 until 30 June 2025.
Taxable Income (AUD*) | Tax on column 1 (AUD) | Income tax on excess (%)  
---|---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 18,200 | - | 0  
18,200 | 45,000 | - | 16.0  
45,000 | 135,000 | 4,288 | 30.0  
135,000 | 190,000 | 31,288 | 37.0  
190,000 | 51,638 | 45.0  
* Australian dollars
The following table applies to the 2023/24 financial year, i.e. from 1 July 2023 until 30 June 2024.
Taxable Income (AUD) | Tax on column 1 (AUD) | Income tax on excess (%)  
---|---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 18,200 | - | 0  
18,200 | 45,000 | - | 19.0  
45,000 | 120,000 | 5,092 | 32.5  
120,000 | 180,000 | 29,467 | 37.0  
180,000 | 51,667 | 45.0  
Note: These tables do not include the Medicare levy of an additional 2% of taxable income, which applies to most residents. An additional Medicare levy surcharge of between 1% and 1.5% applies to certain higher income taxpayers not covered by health insurance for private patient hospital cover. Special rates apply to unearned income of children below the age of 18 years at year end where that income is more than AUD 416.
In addition, the above tables do not include tax offsets, including the Low Income Tax Offset (maximum of AUD 700 for those earning up to AUD 37,500) that can apply to reduce the overall tax payable for those with taxable income up to AUD 66,667. 
### Non-residents
The following table applies to the 2024/25 financial year, i.e. from 1 July 2024 until 30 June 2025.
Taxable income (AUD) | Tax on column 1 (AUD) | Income tax on excess (%)  
---|---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 135,000 | - | 30.0  
135,000 | 190,000 | 40,500 | 37.0  
190,000 | 60,850 | 45.0  
The following table applies to the 2023/24 financial year, i.e. from 1 July 2023 until 30 June 2024.

120,000 | 180,000 | 39,000 | 37.0  
180,000 | 61,200 | 45.0  
Note: Non-residents are not required to pay the Medicare levy in Australia.
The above does not take into account any tax offsets that may apply.
### Working holiday makers
Special income tax rates apply to a working holiday maker who is typically an individual holding a temporary working holiday visa or a work and holiday visa in Australia. The first AUD 45,000 of a working holiday makers' income (broadly, the assessable income derived from sources in Australia, less related deductions) is taxed at 15%, with the balance taxed at ordinary rates.
## Local income taxes
There are no local taxes on personal income in Australia.


# Australia
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 16 December 2024
## Taxable period
The Australian income year for tax purposes consists of the 12-month period from 1 July to 30 June.
## Tax returns and assessments
A resident individual is required to file an income tax return where taxable income exceeds the tax-free threshold of AUD 18,200 (_see the section for more information_). A non-resident earning AUD 1 or more of Australian-sourced income must file a return. There is no joint assessment or joint filing in Australia.
The income tax return is due for filing by the following 31 October, unless an extension is available for tax agent lodged returns.
The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) will issue an income tax assessment of taxable income/tax loss and tax payable (if any) to the individual based on the income tax return. The Commissioner of Taxation will also issue individual taxpayers who have a tax liability of at least AUD 100 with a tax receipt, which will set out details of how their tax money is spent by government.
## Payment of tax
When salaries are paid by an Australian employer or by a non-resident employer from a base in Australia, amounts are required to be withheld from such payments under the pay as you go (PAYG) withholding regime. PAYG withholding tax must also be withheld from payments to contractors if an Australian Business Number (ABN) is not provided by the contractor and the payment amount disregarding GST exceeds AUD 75.
Employees and holders of certain investments must quote their income tax file number to their employer and/or relevant financial institution if they wish to prevent tax from being withheld (at the top marginal rate) on income paid to them. In addition, a tax file number is required to be quoted to employers to prevent tax from being withheld in respect of discounts received with respect to shares and rights/options acquired under an employee share scheme (_see Equity compensation under the section for more information_).
A non-final WHT applies to the gross proceeds of the sale of Australian real property or indirect Australian real property interests (broadly, interests of at least 10% held in an Australian entity, whose majority of assets consist of Australian real property), subject to certain exceptions. The rate of withholding for contracts entered into from 1 January 2025 is 15% (previously 12.5%). The exception in relation to the sale of real property with a market value of less than AUD 750,000 no longer applies in relation to contracts entered into from 1 January 2025. An exception applies in relation to indirect Australian real property interests when the transaction occurs on an approved stock exchange. There is also no withholding when the vendor disposes of either:
  * Australian real property and provides the purchaser with a clearance certificate (relating to Australian residency) from the ATO, or
  * any other asset where the purchaser is given a vendor declaration stating that the vendor is a resident or the asset is not an indirect Australian real property interest.


The rate of withholding can also be varied.
A PAYG withholding regime applies to require the deduction and remittance of taxes on behalf of foreign resident individuals and entities that are in receipt of the following types of payments:
Type of payment | Rate of withholding (%)  
---|---  
Payments for promoting or organising casino gaming junket arrangements | 3  
Payments for performing artists, sportspersons, including payments to support staff such as art directors, bodyguards, coaches, hairdressers, and personal trainers | if recipient is a company, 30  
if recipient is an individual, the applicable non-resident marginal tax rate  
Payments under contracts for the construction, installation and upgrading of buildings, plant and fixtures, and for associated activities | 5  
PAYG quarterly instalments of tax calculated on certain income derived during the previous quarter are payable by certain individuals. The due dates for these quarterly payments are normally 28 October, 28 February, 28 April, and 28 July.
The tax instalments are based on the total of certain gross income such as fees for services, sales in carrying on a business, interest, dividends, and royalties derived during the previous quarter (but not salary or wages), multiplied by an instalment rate provided by the Commissioner of Taxation to determine the tax payable. The individual may vary this instalment rate, but if this is less than 85% of the rate that should have applied, an interest charge will be payable. Individuals (and some other entities satisfying certain tests) may choose to pay quarterly instalments based on their 'GDP-adjusted notional tax'. If this method is chosen, the instalment payable will be based on the tax of a previous year adjusted for movements in Australia's GDP and the choice will continue until at least the first instalment quarter of the following year. Individuals whose notional tax amount is less than AUD 8,000 and who are not registered, nor required to be registered for the GST, may, in most cases, choose to pay a single annual instalment.
## Tax audit process
The ATO will issue an assessment of income tax for each income year and will rely on information and statements made by the taxpayer in the income tax return in making the assessment. However, the ATO can audit the affairs of the taxpayer following the making of the assessment or seek additional information as seen fit.
## Statute of limitations
A standard two-year amendment period generally applies to an individual who does not carry on a business (unless the individual is a small business entity), is not a partner in a partnership, and is not a beneficiary of a trust. Otherwise, a four-year time limit applies for amending an income tax assessment. Where an amended assessment increases the taxpayer's liability to tax, an administrative penalty and interest on any underpaid amounts may be levied in addition to the additional tax liability.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The ATO has a number of targeted income tax compliance programs, the aim of which is to provide greater assurance to the community that high wealth private groups and individuals are paying the right amount of tax, including:
  * The Top 500 private groups program, which includes private groups with over AUD 250 million turnover, regardless of net asset value, or with over AUD 500 million net assets, regardless of turnover, or with over AUD 100 million turnover and over AUD 250 million in net assets, or that are market leaders or groups of specific interest.


  * The Next 5,000 program, which covers Australian resident individuals who, together with their associates, control wealth of more than AUD 50 million. The ATO will use sophisticated data matching and analytic models to identify wealthy individuals and link them to associated entities.


  * A Personal Income Tax Compliance Program that focuses on non-compliance and addressing emerging areas of risk, such as deductions relating to short-term rental properties to ensure they are genuinely available to rent.


The following continue to be areas of focus for the ATO for individuals:
  * Work-related expense claims (e.g. working from home expenses, overnight travel, motor vehicle expenses for travel between home and work, work-related proportion of use for computers, phones and electronic devices).
  * Rental property income and expenses (e.g. excessive deductions for holiday homes, inappropriate splitting of income and deductions for jointly owned properties, interest deductions being claimed for the private proportion of loans).
  * Capital gains from crypto assets, property, and shares.
  * Lifestyle not supported by after-tax income.
  * Accessing business assets for tax-free private use.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 16 December 2024
## Employment expenses
To the extent that expenses are not reimbursed, residents and non-residents can deduct properly substantiated expenses incurred in earning employment and other income, for example, business-connected travel expenses, automobile expenses, subscriptions to professional or trade organisations, certain home office expenses, and protective clothing.
The ATO allows a practical administrative approach to determine working from home deductions covering energy expenses, Internet expenses, mobile and/or home telephone expenses, stationery, and computer consumables using a fixed rate (67 cents per hour) applied to the number of hours worked from home while carrying out employment duties or while carrying on business based on records.
COVID‑19 tests (including polymerase chain reaction and rapid antigen tests) are tax deductible where they are purchased for work‑related purposes (i.e. for testing for COVID-19 to determine whether the individual can attend or remain at their place of work).
An employee is not entitled to a tax deduction for the following expenses:
  * Costs of travelling to and from the place of work to home.
  * Expenses of a private or domestic nature.
  * Entertainment expenses.


Prepaid expenditures are generally only deductible over the period to which the expenditure relates, subject to certain limited exceptions.
Allowances provided to an employee for living-away-from-home are currently subject to FBT that is payable by the employer. A portion of living-away-from-home allowances in relation to the provision of accommodation and excess food costs is exempt from FBT, provided certain conditions are met. The concessional tax treatment of living-away-from-home allowances and benefits provided to employees is limited to 12 months for employees who are living away from a home in Australia.
Certain relocation fringe benefits are exempt from FBT. To the extent that a fringe benefit is exempt from FBT, it will also usually be exempt from income tax. Employer-provided cars are taxed concessionally under the FBT rules. Relocation costs are typically not deductible to the individual employee.
## Personal deductions
Deductions can be claimed for losses and outgoings incurred in the gaining or producing of assessable income. For example, to the extent that an individual owns a rental property, deductions would be available for any interest incurred in respect of borrowings to fund the acquisition of the property, property rates, insurance, repairs and maintenance, and depreciation on items such as new carpets, curtains, and any new furniture acquired for the rental property.
Tax deductions are not available for expenses of a private or domestic nature, for example, the cost of personal medical expenses, private health insurance premiums, the costs of child care (_see the section for more information_), alimony, life insurance premiums or interest incurred in respect of borrowings to fund the acquisition of an individual's place of residence.
### Superannuation contributions
Individuals (aged up to 75 years) can claim a deduction for contributions made to complying superannuation funds, regardless of the extent of their employment-related activities. There is no additional tax if the total of all superannuation contributions made in a year for the individual (including contributions made by an employer) exceed the annual 'concessional contributions cap' of AUD 30,000 (AUD 27,500 up to 30 June 2024); however, the individual includes the excess amount in their assessable income and is entitled to a 15% tax offset on the amount.
An individual with a total superannuation balance of less than AUD 500,000 at the end of 30 June of the previous financial year may be entitled to carry forward the amounts of the unused concessional contributions cap on a rolling basis for five years so as to contribute more than the concessional contributions cap in later years. 
### Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions of AUD 2 or more are generally deductible where they are made to entities that are specifically named in the tax law or endorsed by the Commissioner of Taxation as 'deductible gift recipients'. However, deductions for such gifts cannot generate tax losses. That is, generally the deduction is limited to the amount of assessable income remaining after deducting from assessable income all other deductions.
## Personal allowances
Residents receive the first AUD 18,200 of taxable income tax-free. Non-residents generally do not benefit from a tax-free threshold, nor do they qualify for the various tax rebates and tax offsets (_see the section for more information_).
### Family Tax Benefits
Provided family income is below certain thresholds, resident individuals (or individuals in Australia with a special category visa or an approved visa for family tax benefit purposes) may be entitled to Family Tax Benefit payments if they have a dependent child or a secondary school student aged 16 to 19 years (who is not receiving a pension, payment, or other government allowance) for whom one cares for at least 35% of the time.
The limits, rates, and nature of Family Tax Benefit payments (i.e. Family Tax Benefit Part A and/or Family Tax Benefit Part B) vary depending upon family income, number of children, and ages of children, and change from year to year.
## Business deductions
An individual will be able to claim a deduction for expenditure incurred in gaining or producing assessable income or which is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income (not being expenditure of a private, capital, or domestic nature). Entitlement to a deduction for certain motor vehicles or travel expenses will, however, depend on satisfying the particular record keeping requirements of the substantiation provisions.
A self-employed individual is entitled to a tax deduction for personal contributions made to a complying superannuation fund. _See Personal deductions above for further details_.
A deduction is allowable for costs incurred in managing tax affairs.
## Losses
Subject to some limits and exceptions, where deductions exceed assessable income, an individual is able to carry forward tax losses for offset against assessable income derived in future income years.
Individuals are not permitted to carryback losses for Australian tax purposes.
The non-commercial loss rules prevent losses from non-commercial business activities carried out by an individual from being offset against other assessable income in the year the loss is incurred. The rules operate to defer a deduction for the loss, so that it may be offset in later years against assessable profits from the activity. There are tests to determine if a business activity is non-commercial. These rules do not apply to losses on passive investments such as real estate held for rental, or stocks and shares. There are rules limiting the ability to claim losses in respect of boats and 'leisure facilities' (which includes holiday houses), although a boat owner may be able to claim deductions up to the amount of income earned from the boat hiring activity. Non-commercial losses of individuals with 'adjusted taxable income' of AUD 250,000 or more, are automatically quarantined for use only against income from the non-commercial business activity in future years.
Capital losses are offset only against capital gains (and are applied to any capital gains before discounting) and cannot be offset against other income. In calculating capital losses, there is no indexation of the cost base (_see Capital gains in the section for more information_).

## Individual - Other issues
Last reviewed - 16 December 2024
## Tax equalisation
A tax equalisation plan ensures that an employee's total tax burden will remain the same as in the home country. If the tax in the overseas country is greater than that which would have been incurred in the home country (usually referred to as the 'hypothetical tax liability'), the employer reimburses the excess. If the tax in the overseas country is less than the hypothetical tax liability, the employer retains the benefit.
This plan requires the calculation of the employee's hypothetical home country tax. The hypothetical tax is generally calculated on a base salary and other base remuneration, as in the home country.
## Residential property vacancy fee for foreign persons
A property vacancy fee and annual reporting is applied to certain foreign owners of Australian residential property who submit a Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) notice or application (or would be so required had an exemption not applied) to acquire a residential dwelling or residential land at any time from 7:30 pm AEST on 9 May 2017. An individual who is not ‘ordinarily resident’ in Australia (with certain exceptions, such as Australian citizens), including a holder of a visa that permits the individual to remain in Australia for only a limited period, is subject to these rules.
In summary:
  * the foreign owner of Australian residential real estate with a dwelling is required to give the Commissioner of Taxation an annual ‘vacancy fee return’, within 30 days after the end of a ‘vacancy year’, even if there is no liability to a vacancy fee, and 
  * a vacancy fee is imposed on the foreign owner where the property is not residentially occupied in the specified manner (i.e. occupied as the residence of the owner [or their relatives] or genuinely occupied, or available for occupation [at a market rent], as a residence under lease or licence with a term of 30 days or more) for at least 183 days in the ‘vacancy year’, or in cases where the annual vacancy fee return is not lodged. 


The relevant ‘vacancy year’ is broadly based on the first and each successive 12-month period commencing from the owner’s initial right to occupy the dwelling.

## Individual - Sample personal income tax calculation
Last reviewed - 16 December 2024
## Assumptions
  * Year ended 30 June 2025.
  * Resident individual earning both Australian and foreign sourced income.
  * During the income year, the individual sold an investment property which had been held for greater than 12 months and realised a capital gain. There were no net capital losses carried forward from prior years. Prior to disposal, the individual derived rental income from the property, and incurred interest costs in connection with borrowings to acquire the property.
  * The individual has full private patient hospital cover for the entire income year, and therefore is not liable for the Medicare levy surcharge.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 16 December 2024
## Employment income
Gross assessable income of an employee includes cash remuneration arising from employment. Cash remuneration includes salaries, wages, commissions, bonuses, pensions, and allowances paid to employees. 
Resident individuals are subject to Australian tax on their overseas employment income, unless special exemption requirements are met. However, tax treaties are in force with various countries, and provisions in those treaties may require a different tax treatment of certain employment income.
Resident individuals are liable to Australian tax on income derived from all sources, including foreign employment income. Salary and wages derived by resident individuals, in performing duties overseas for a continuous period of at least 91 days, are only eligible for exemption from income tax if the foreign service is directly attributable to specified activities (e.g. services directly attributable to the delivery of Australia's overseas aid program or deployment as a member of a disciplined force) and provided the earnings are not exempt from tax in the foreign country in which they are earned.
Foreign nationals are generally taxable on salary and allowances relating to services performed in Australia, regardless of where the payment is made and whether the income is remitted to Australia.
## Non-cash benefits
Non-employee resident taxpayers are subject to tax on non-cash business benefits.
However, for non-cash benefits provided to employees, employers are currently liable for an FBT that is levied at 47% of the taxable value multiplied by a gross-up factor of the fringe benefits granted to employees. The gross-up factor is 2.0802 for 'type 1 aggregate fringe benefits', i.e. fringe benefits which, subject to certain exceptions, the employer was entitled to an input tax credit for GST. The gross-up factor is 1.8868 for other fringe benefits, which are referred to as 'type 2 aggregate fringe benefits'. FBT is generally deductible by the employer for income tax purposes.
Benefits subject to FBT are excluded from the employee's taxable income, but may be taken into account (as reportable fringe benefits) when determining the employee's liability for tax surcharges such as the Medicare levy surcharge and income-related obligations such as child support, and entitlement to certain tax offsets.
## Equity compensation
Special rules govern the tax treatment of employee share schemes (ESS).
Under these rules, tax is imposed on the discount on shares and rights/options issued to an employee (or associate) under an ESS in the income year in which the shares or rights/options are acquired.
An annual exemption threshold of AUD 1,000 is available to employees where the scheme meets certain conditions (including being non-discriminatory), and is only available for employees whose taxable income (after adjustments taking into account reportable fringe benefits, total net investment losses, and reportable superannuation contributions) does not exceed AUD 180,000.
There is an ability to defer the imposition of tax, subject to meeting certain conditions. For ESS shares awarded from 1 July 2015, the taxing point is the earliest of:
  * when there is no real risk of forfeiture of the shares and any restrictions on the sale are lifted
  * when the employee ceases employment (but only where this occurs before 1 July 2022), or
  * 15 years after the shares were acquired.


In the case of options granted from 1 July 2015, discounted options will generally be taxed the earliest of the above-mentioned in relation to the rights (not shares) or when the employee exercises the right, and after exercising the right there is no real risk of forfeiture of the underlying share and the restrictions on sale of the share are lifted.
Tax deferral is also available for ESS interests received at a 100% discount under certain salary sacrifice arrangements where the employee receives ESS interests of not more than AUD 5,000 worth of shares under those arrangements in an income year (other conditions must also be met).
Further concessions apply to options or shares provided by 'eligible start-up companies' (broadly an unlisted company that was incorporated for less than ten years and with aggregated turnover of no more than AUD 50 million). These concessions include an income tax exemption on the discount on certain shares and a deferral of income tax on the discount on certain rights until exercise or sale under the capital gains tax rules.
The disclosure and licensing requirements have been simplified for many companies where companies do not lend or charge to employees to whom they offer ESS interests and for unlisted companies that make ESS offers valued at up to AUD 30,000 per employee on offers over a 12-month period, plus an additional 70% of any dividends and 70% of cash bonuses received in that year.
In general, and subject to Australia's double tax treaties, Australian residents are subject to tax on all discounts they receive in respect of shares and rights/options acquired under an ESS regardless of whether it is received in relation to employment in Australia or outside Australia. Foreign residents are only subject to Australian tax on discounts they receive in respect of shares and rights/options acquired under an ESS to the extent that the discount relates to the employment in Australia (e.g. because the employee works in Australia during all or part of the vesting period).
The rules also include annual employer reporting obligations both in the year of acquisition of shares or rights/options, and in the year of income in which the taxing point on deferred shares or rights/options arise.
WHT will apply where an employee fails to provide their employer with a 'tax file number' (TFN) by the end of the income year in which any applicable discount is subject to Australian tax.
## Business income
Income from a trade, business, profession, or vocation derived by an individual is assessable. The individual will be able to claim a deduction for expenditure incurred in gaining or producing the income or which is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing the income (not being expenditure of a private, capital, or domestic nature). Entitlement to a deduction for certain motor vehicles or travel expenses will, however, depend on satisfying the particular record keeping requirements of the substantiation provisions.
## Capital gains
Capital gains tax (CGT) applies to assets acquired on or after 20 September 1985. Capital gains made upon the realisation of such assets are included in assessable income and are taxed at ordinary rates of tax. Capital losses are offset only against capital gains (and are applied to any capital gains before discounting) and cannot be offset against other income.
If the asset was acquired on or after 11:45 am AEST on 21 September 1999 and has been held for at least 12 months, a discount applies such that 50% of the nominal gain (with no indexing of costs for inflation) is included in the individual's taxable income. The CGT discount for resident individuals who invest in qualifying affordable housing is 60%. A non-resident individual is not entitled to the discount on capital gains accrued after 7:30 pm AEST on 8 May 2012.
If the asset was acquired before 11:45 am AEST on 21 September 1999 and was held for at least 12 months, an individual has a choice of calculating the assessable capital gain using the discount method or the indexation method (i.e. 100% of the gain calculated after allowing for inflation based on the CPI of costs incurred up to 30 September 1999, but not beyond that date). In calculating capital losses, there is no indexation.
Residents of Australia, except temporary residents, are liable for the tax on gains from the disposal of assets wherever situated, subject to a tax offset for foreign tax paid.
Non-residents are subject to Australian CGT only where the asset is 'taxable Australian property', that is broadly, Australian real property, or the business assets of Australian branches of a non-resident. Australian CGT also applies to 'indirect Australian real property interests', i.e. non-portfolio interests in interposed entities (including foreign interposed entities), where the value of such an interest is wholly or principally attributable to Australian real property. 'Real property' includes other Australian assets with a physical connection with Australia, such as mining rights and other interests related to Australian real property, but is proposed to be broadened with effect from 1 July 2025 to include assets “with a close economic connection to Australian land”. A 'non-portfolio interest' is an interest held alone or with associates of 10% or more in the interposed entity.
Net capital gains are calculated in the same way for non-residents as it is for residents (except for the 50% discount that is not available for capital gains accrued after 7:30 pm AEST on 8 May 2012 as noted above) and are included in the assessable income of the non-resident.
Although a non-resident is not required to notify the Australian revenue authorities of a disposal at the time the asset is sold, for contracts entered into from 1 January 2025, a non-final 15% WHT (previously 12.5%) applies to the gross proceeds of the sale of taxable Australian property by non-residents. Disclosure is made upon lodgement of the tax return, and any amounts withheld are creditable against any actual income tax liability.
Where a non-resident becomes an Australian resident, capital assets owned by the non-resident (other than assets acquired before 20 September 1985 and taxable Australian property) are deemed to have been acquired by the non-resident for a consideration equal to the market value of the assets at the time residence commences. Special provisions also apply where a resident individual ceases to be a resident, so that assets which are not taxable Australian property are deemed to be disposed of, unless an election to the contrary is made. An exception to this rule applies for temporary residents.
The CGT main residence exemption does not apply to foreign residents. However, in cases where the residence is sold as a result of a 'life event' relating mainly to health and family matters, the exemption can apply where the individual has been a tax non-resident of Australia for a period of six years or less.
## Dividend income
A dividend imputation system designed to prevent the double taxation of Australian corporate profits distributed to shareholders, applies to dividends paid out of Australian-taxed profits of resident corporations (franked dividends). Resident individual shareholders receiving franked dividends are entitled to a 'franking offset' of Australian corporate tax paid on the profits reflecting the dividends. If a franking offset exceeds the tax payable by a resident individual, the excess is refundable to the individual.
Certain payments, loans, and debts forgiven by private companies to shareholders (or their associates) may be treated as an assessable (unfrankable) dividend to the extent that the company has realised or unrealised profits ('distributable surplus'). In addition, these deemed dividend rules cover circumstances where a shareholder (or associate) is permitted to use an asset owned by a private company, such as real estate, a car or boat for no fee or at a discounted rate.
Resident individuals are generally taxable on foreign-source dividend income but are eligible for a tax offset for foreign taxes paid on such income (_see the section for more information_).
Non-resident individuals receiving franked dividends are generally not entitled to a franking offset but are exempt from WHT on the dividends, and are exempt from WHT on unfranked dividends to the extent that the dividends are paid out of certain foreign-source income and gains, and the dividend paying company has made a conduit foreign income (CFI) declaration in relation to the dividend.
WHT at the rate of 30% (although this rate may be reduced (usually to 15%) where a tax treaty applies) is imposed as a final tax on unfranked dividends paid to non-residents. WHT is usually withheld by the payer on behalf of the payee on the gross amount of the dividend and remitted to the Australian revenue authorities.
## Interest income
Resident individuals are subject to Australian tax on interest income from both Australian and foreign sources. A WHT on domestic interest payments by financial institutions and certain other investment bodies will apply to investors who fail to quote their tax file number to the financial institution in the manner required by the Commissioner of Taxation.
In relation to foreign-sourced interest income, resident individuals are generally eligible for a tax offset for foreign taxes paid on such income (_see the section for more information_).
WHT is imposed on interest paid to a non-resident to the extent that the interest is paid by a resident or is an expense of an Australian permanent establishment (PE) carried on by a non-resident. WHT is not imposed if the interest is derived by the non-resident in carrying on business through a PE in Australia. In that case, the interest will be subject to the ordinary rates of income tax.
The rate of WHT is 10% of the gross amount of interest paid, although this rate may be reduced in limited circumstances where certain tax treaties apply. The tax is usually withheld by the payer on behalf of the payee and remitted to the revenue authorities. WHT represents a final tax in Australia on the interest income.
## Rental income
Resident individuals are subject to Australian tax on the rental income derived from both Australian and foreign property. Non-resident individuals are subject to Australian tax on rental income derived from an Australian source. Gross rental receipts are included as assessable income in the individual's tax return. A deduction for expenses incurred in deriving such income will be allowed. Where the deductions exceed the rental income, the resultant loss may be offset against the individual's other income.
A deduction is not allowed for travel costs in connection with a residential investment property, including costs incurred to inspect and maintain the property, collect rent, or visit the real estate agent, even if that is the sole purpose of the travel. In addition, for any residential rental property acquired under contracts entered into after 7:30 pm AEST on 9 May 2017, depreciation deductions for items of plant and equipment (e.g. dishwashers, ceiling fans, carpet, and hot water systems) in residential investment properties are limited to those assets that have not previously been used.
Tax deductions are denied for expenses related to the holding of certain vacant land that is not used in carrying on a business for the purpose of producing assessable income. Vacant land does not include land on which there is a substantial and permanent structure or residential premises that is being constructed, or substantially renovated, but only where it is lawfully able to be occupied and is leased, hired, or licensed. There are exceptions to ensure that a land owner is not denied deductions when structures on the land are affected by natural disasters or exceptional circumstances, or when the land is owned by a primary producer or is subject to an arm's-length lease arrangement to an entity who carries on a business on the land.
## Foreign income
Resident individuals are generally subject to Australian tax on foreign-source income while non-residents are exempt from Australian tax on foreign-source income.
In addition, certain foreign non-comparably taxed income, which is generally sheltered in low-tax countries through foreign companies controlled (directly or indirectly) by Australian residents may be attributed to Australian-resident controllers and taxed in Australia. Any income subject to taxation on attribution will be exempt from Australian tax when repatriated to Australia.
Under the controlled foreign company (CFC) rules, non-active income of foreign companies controlled by Australian residents (determined by reference to voting rights and dividend and capital entitlements) may be attributed to those residents under rules which distinguish between companies resident in 'listed countries' (e.g. Canada, France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and in other 'unlisted' countries. In general, if the CFC is resident in an unlisted country and it fails the 'active income test' (typically because it earns 5% or more of its income from passive or 'tainted' sources), the CFC's 'tainted income' (very broadly, passive income and gains, and sales and services income that has a connection with Australia) is attributable. If a CFC is resident in a listed country, a narrower range of tainted income is attributed even if the CFC fails the active income test.
## Foreign exchange gains and losses
Foreign currency gains and losses are recognised when realised regardless of whether there is a conversion into Australian dollars, and are included in or deducted from assessable income, subject to limited exceptions. There are exceptions to the timing and characterisation aspects of the realisation approach where the foreign currency gain or loss is closely linked to a capital asset.
To reduce compliance costs with foreign currency denominated bank accounts caused by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) approach mandated in the rules, taxpayers may elect to disregard gains or losses on certain low balance transaction accounts that satisfy a de _minimis_ exemption, or may elect for retranslation by restating the balance of the account annually by reference to deposits, withdrawals, and exchange rates at the beginning and end of each year.
## Financial arrangements
The taxation of financial arrangements (TOFA) rules, which generally apply to financial arrangements that start to be held on or after 1 July 2010, do not apply to individual taxpayers, other than those who elect to have the rules apply and to certain deferred interest securities. Where the rules apply, gains and losses from financial arrangements are generally recognised for tax purposes on an accruals basis or on a realisation basis.
## Exempt income
Exempt income that is not subject to Australian tax includes:
  * Certain salary and wages directly attributable to a limited class of activities (usually government aid programs and defence force personnel serving overseas), which were earned overseas, that are subject to tax in the country of derivation.
  * Non-cash fringe benefits provided by an employer to an employee (such as use of a car, accommodation, low interest loans, etc.). These benefits are generally exempt from income tax in the hands of the employee, but the value of the benefit is taxed to the employer under the FBT system.
  * Certain government pensions, scholarships, and bursaries.


The exempt income rules interact with other rules so that tax losses are offset against certain types of exempt income, and in some very limited cases the exempt income is aggregated with taxable income to determine the rate of tax on that taxable income.

## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 16 December 2024
There are no specific income tax incentives applicable to an individual working in Australia. However, there are a number of personal tax offsets that may have the effect of reducing tax payable or, in some instances, the cost of health insurance or child care.
## Personal offsets
Personal offsets generally take the form of tax rebates or tax offsets, which are, in most cases, available only to residents.
### Dependant invalid and carer tax offset
The dependant invalid and carer tax offset is only available to taxpayers who maintain a dependant who is unable to work due to invalidity or care obligations. For the year ended 30 June 2025, the invalid and carer tax offset is capped at AUD 3,300 (AUD 3,152 for 30 June 2024) and is subject to abatement for the 'adjusted taxable income' of the dependant, cutting out if this exceeds AUD 13,482 (AUD 12,890 for 30 June 2024). This offset is only available where the taxpayer's adjusted taxable income is no more than AUD 117,194 (AUD 112,578 for 30 June 2024).
### Other personal tax offsets
Other tax offsets include offsets for those residing in isolated areas, a Seniors and Pensioners Tax Offset, and rebates for certain lump sums received in arrears.
In addition, for the income years ended 30 June 2024 and 2025, if taxable income is below AUD 66,667, a Low Income Tax Offset also applies at a maximum of AUD 700 if taxable income is less than AUD 37,501. 
## Medical expenses
A tax deduction is allowed for COVID‑19 tests (including polymerase chain reaction and rapid antigen tests) where they are purchased for work‑related purposes. There is no tax relief for any other medical expenses.
## Health insurance premiums
A tax offset (or a rebate provided directly against the premium) is available for the cost of private health insurance premiums (which covers hospital treatment), provided certain eligibility criteria are met.
The applicable tax offset is income tested and depends on the age of the individual. For the period from 1 July 2023 through 30 June 2024, there is no entitlement where adjusted taxable income exceeds AUD 151,000 for singles (AUD 144,000 for 30 June 2024) or AUD 302,000 for families (AUD 288,000 for 30 June 2024), regardless of the individual's age. For an individual under the age of 65, the offset for the period from 1 July 2023 through 30 June 2024 ranges from:
  * 8.202% where adjusted taxable income is between AUD 108,001 and AUD 144,000 for singles or between AUD 216,001 and AUD 288,000 for families. 
  * 16.405% where adjusted taxable income is between AUD 93,001 and AUD 108,000 for singles or between AUD 186,001 and AUD 216,000 for families. 
  * 24.608% where adjusted taxable income is AUD 93,000 or less for singles or AUD 186,000 or less for families.


For individuals aged 65 years or over, higher offset entitlements are available and can be as high as 32.812% for those aged 70 years and over with adjusted taxable income of AUD 93,000 or less for singles or AUD 186,000 or less for families.
The offset entitlements are indexed annually.
## Child care subsidy
A child care subsidy is available to assist eligible families with the cost of child care (i.e. long day care, family day care, occasional care, outside school hours care, vacation care, and registered care). The child care subsidy is not administered through the tax system.
## Spouse contribution tax offset
If a resident spouse's assessable income (and reportable fringe benefits and employer superannuation contributions) does not exceed AUD 40,000, a resident may make a maximum rebatable contribution of AUD 3,000 for the spouse (including a _de facto_ spouse) to a complying superannuation fund or retirement savings account (RSA) and obtain a spouse contributions tax offset. It is also a requirement that the spouse did not have a total superannuation balance in excess of the balance cap, i.e. AUD 1.9 million as at 30 June 2024 for contributions made from 1 July 2024, or exceed the non-concessional contribution cap. The maximum offset is AUD 540 (the tax offset is the amount of the contribution x 18%) and applies if the spouse's assessable income (including reportable fringe benefits and employer superannuation contributions) is not more than AUD 37,000.
## Innovation investment offset
Investors in an Australian Early Stage Innovation Company (ESIC) (broadly, a company that is at an early stage of establishment to develop new or significantly improved innovations with the purpose of commercialisation to generate an economic return) are provided with a non-refundable carryforward tax offset equal to 20% of the amount paid for the investment, subject to an annual offset cap of AUD 200,000 (including affiliates).
## Exploration offset
Australian resident shareholders (other than corporates) who have invested in certain Australian resident companies that undertake greenfield minerals exploration in Australia may receive 'exploration credits' that entitle them to a refundable tax offset equal to the amount of the credit.
In broad terms, an exploration credit is a conversion of the company's tax loss attributed to the company's exploration or prospecting expenditure into a distributable tax benefit in the form of the offset available to the investor.
The Junior Minerals Exploration Incentive (JMEI) applies in relation to newly issued shares in eligible exploration companies made in the 2017/18 through to the 2024/25 income years.
## Small business income tax offset
A small business income tax offset applies to individuals who run small businesses (businesses with an aggregate annual turnover of less than AUD 5 million or who pay income tax on a share of the income of a small business partnership or trust.
The offset (capped to a maximum of AUD 1,000) is 16% of the income tax payable on the portion of an individual’s income that is small business income.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 16 December 2024
Under current rules, individuals are residents of Australia if they reside in Australia, and this includes the following:
  * Individuals whose domicile is in Australia, unless they have a permanent place of abode outside Australia.
  * Individuals who have actually been in Australia for more than one-half of the income year (i.e. at least 183 days in the income year), unless the individual's usual place of abode is outside Australia and the individual does not intend to reside in Australia.
  * If the individual is an 'eligible employee' for the purposes of legislation relating to the superannuation entitlements of Federal public servants.


Each residency decision turns on its facts. For instance, persons who take up a contract of employment in Australia may be regarded as residents if they are in the country for more than six months, particularly as this will usually be accompanied by other factors, such as physical presence and assets in Australia. Citizenship and nationality do not determine liability for Australian income tax.
A temporary resident for tax purposes is, broadly, an individual who:
  * holds a temporary visa granted under the Migration Act 1958
  * is not an Australian resident within the meaning of the Social Security Act 1991, and
  * does not have an Australian spouse as defined in the Social Security Act 1991.


A temporary resident will be exempt from Australian tax on foreign source income, while a resident of Australia is subject to tax on worldwide income.
Australia's tax treaty arrangements with certain other countries contain special rules for determining the jurisdiction to tax specified types of income (_see Tax treaties in the section for more information_). Most treaties contain 'tie-breaker' rules which seek to overcome situations where an individual is treated as resident of both Australia and the other tax treaty country. The determination of resident status under these tie-breaker rules overrides the operation of the general resident status rules referred to above.
The then Australian government announced in its 2021/22 Federal Budget that it will replace and modernise the tax rules for determining individual tax residency. There has been a change of government since this was first announced, and it remains unclear whether this proposal will proceed. If the measure is enacted as originally announced, under this proposal, there will be a new primary ‘bright line’ test where an individual would become an Australian tax resident if they are physically present in Australia for 183 days or more in any tax year. Where an individual does not meet this primary test, secondary tests apply. These secondary tests would set out objective criteria, e.g. whether an individual has the right to reside permanently in Australia, whether they have Australian accommodation, family located in Australia, or Australian economic connections. If these changes are enacted as originally announced, then they are proposed to apply from 1 July following the enactment of the enabling legislation, i.e. 1 July 2025 at the earliest.


# Australia
## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 16 December 2024
## Social security contributions
There are no social security taxes in Australia. However, a levy is imposed on taxable income and reportable fringe benefits of residents for the funding of a National Health Scheme (Medicare). The Medicare levy is currently 2%. No levy is payable by those with taxable income below the relevant low income thresholds.
A surcharge of between 1% and 1.5% applies to high income taxpayers where the taxpayer and their dependants are not covered by a private health insurance fund registered in Australia that provides basic hospital cover.
Both employers and foreign nationals working in Australia should take care in choosing a health fund which both qualifies for the exemption from the Medicare levy surcharge and provides adequate cover because it is possible to have a policy that provides full cover but does not also exempt the policy holder (and their family members) from the surcharge and vice versa. Proper advice should be sought from a tax expert to ensure that the policy covers both aspects.
## Superannuation and retirement taxation
Employer supported and self-employed contributions to 'complying' superannuation entities and retirement savings accounts (RSAs) in Australia play a role similar to that of social security levies. The retirement benefits provided by these superannuation entities (which are independent of government, but have to comply with regulations so they are 'complying') are in addition to a means-tested age pension that is provided by the federal government.
The rules governing the taxation of superannuation entities are complex. Below is a brief summary of the current law.
Employers must contribute a set minimum percentage of the employee's earnings base, subject to limited exceptions, to a complying superannuation fund on behalf of their employees or be liable to a superannuation guarantee (SG) charge. The SG percentage increased to 11.5% from 1 July 2024 (from 11% for the year ended 30 June 2024) and will increase to 12% from 1 July 2025.
It is usually tax effective (subject to certain limits) for employees to forgo or 'sacrifice' part of their salary to allow employer superannuation contributions on their behalf above this minimum. There is no limit to the amount of contributions that can be claimed as a deduction. However, there are limits on the amount that can be contributed per individual per income year that are eligible to receive concessional (favourable) tax treatment. Concessional superannuation contributions can be made on behalf of an individual up to AUD 30,000 (AUD 27,500 for the year ended 30 June 2024). Individuals with superannuation balances of less than AUD 500,000 also have the ability to carry forward unused concessional contributions from up to the five previous financial years and use the amounts to make additional concessional contributions during a particular financial year.
Individuals can also make non-concessional contributions to a superannuation fund (i.e. contributions that are not deductible). The annual non-concessional contribution cap is AUD 120,000 (AUD 110,000 up to 30 June 2024), subject to a three-year bring forward rule for those individuals aged under 75 years. The non-concessional cap is nil if the individual has a total superannuation balance greater than or equal to AUD 1.9 million as at 30 June 2024.
Individuals aged 55 years or over can use the proceeds from the sale of their eligible main residence to make ‘downsizer contributions’, limited to the lesser of AUD 300,000 and their share of the sale proceeds. These contributions are not tax deductible and can be made regardless of other contribution caps and voluntary contribution restrictions.
Generally, concessional contributions made to complying superannuation funds together with the fund's earnings are subject to tax at the rate of 15% payable by the fund. The concessional rate of tax on contributions is effectively limited such that concessional contributions made in respect of individuals with combined taxable income, total net investment losses, reportable fringe benefits, and concessionally taxed superannuation contributions exceeding AUD 250,000 are subject to additional tax at 15% on those contributions that exceed the threshold.
Under the First Home Super Saver Scheme, an individual can apply to release voluntary superannuation contributions, along with associated earnings, to help purchase their first home, subject to meeting certain eligibility requirements. Concessional tax treatment applies to amounts withdrawn under the scheme.
Generally, all superannuation benefits received by an individual aged 60 or over are tax-free where those benefits are paid from a taxed source. However, the tax treatment of other superannuation benefits may depend on factors such as the components of the benefit, the amount of the benefit, the age of the member when the benefit is received, and whether the benefit is received as a lump sum or as a superannuation income stream.
Certain superannuation income streams are subject to minimum drawdown rates. 
The government is proposing to introduce an additional tax imposed on the individual who has a total superannuation balance above AUD 3 million. The tax will apply from 1 July 2025 at the rate of 15% on the member’s 'earnings' (i.e. the proportional increase in the total superannuation balance above AUD 3 million) from funds.
## Consumption taxes
The federal government levies goods and services tax (GST) at a rate of 10%. The GST is a value added tax (VAT) applied at each level in the manufacturing and marketing chain. It applies to most goods and services, and registered suppliers get credits for GST on inputs acquired to make taxable supplies. Supplies of digital currency receive equivalent GST treatment to supplies of money.
Food, with some significant exceptions, exports, most health, medical, feminine hygiene products, educational supplies, and some other supplies are 'GST-free' (the equivalent of 'zero-rated' in other VAT jurisdictions). A registered supplier of a GST-free supply can recover relevant input tax credits, although the supply is not taxable.
Residential rents, the second or later supply of residential premises, most financial supplies, and some other supplies are 'input-taxed' ('exempt' in other VAT jurisdictions) and are not subject to GST. However, the supplier cannot recover relevant input tax credits, except for financial suppliers who may obtain a reduced input tax credit of 75% of the GST on the acquisition of certain services.
Health insurance is GST-free, life insurance is input taxed, and general insurance is taxed. 'Reverse charges' may apply to services or rights supplied from offshore, where the recipient is registered or required to be registered, and uses the supply solely or partly for a non-creditable supply.
GST applies to cross-border supplies of digital products and services imported by Australian consumers. GST is payable on certain supplies of low value goods (valued at AUD 1,000 or less) that are purchased by consumers and are imported into Australia.
Purchasers of ‘new residential premises’ or ‘potential residential land included in a property subdivision plan’ are required to withhold and remit to the ATO an amount on account of GST.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
Australia does not have a net wealth tax.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift tax
Australia does not have inheritance, estate or gift taxes. However, special tax rules apply to:
  * the transfer of assets to a beneficiary from a deceased estate for capital gains tax purposes and
  * the transfer of superannuation entitlements to beneficiaries of a deceased person.


## Property taxes
All the states and territories of Australia impose land taxes on landowners based on the unimproved value of the land they hold, subject to certain exemption thresholds, exemptions for a principal residence, and land used for certain purposes. Municipal councils also levy rates and other charges on land within their municipalities.
Some Australian states impose a duty or land tax surcharge on certain Australian real estate holdings of a 'foreign person', which generally includes a foreign natural person, corporation, or trustee of a foreign trust. In addition, there is an annual vacancy fee imposed at the Federal level on a foreign owner of Australian residential property that is essentially vacant for at least half of a year and that was acquired at any time since 7:30 pm AEST 9 May 2017 (_see section for further information_).
The state of Victoria has a windfall gains tax that applies to the increase in value of land in Victoria of at least AUD 100,000 that results from a rezoning, in effect since 1 July 2023, subject to certain transitional arrangements.
Furthermore, the state of Victoria has a short stay levy that will apply to fees charged for short stay accommodation that is less than 28 consecutive days in a Victorian property from 1 January 2025. The levy is a flat 7.5% of the total booking fees paid. The levy will not apply to a short stay in a property that is someone’s principal place of residence (PPR), whether they own or rent the property.
## Excise duties
Excise duties are imposed at high levels on beer, spirits, liqueurs, tobacco, cigarettes, and petroleum products. Excise rates for tobacco and alcohol are indexed biannually based on movements in the consumer price index (CPI) (although there is a one-off increase of 5% per year for three years in addition to normal indexation for tobacco from 1 September 2023).
A fuel tax credit system provides a credit for fuel tax (excise or customs duty) that is included in the price of taxable fuel. Broadly, credits are available to entities using fuel in their business and to households using fuel for domestic electricity generation and heating.
## Stamp duty
All states and territories of Australia impose stamp duty at various rates on various transactions or documents, such as real property conveyances, motor vehicles, insurance policies, and contracts effecting the transfer of real estate or interests therein.  Some states also apply additional duty to foreign purchasers of residential property. The imposition of duty on share transfers involving unlisted entities differs from state to state.
Stamp duty is levied by the states and territories, and, as a result, the range of exemptions vary.
## Import duties
Imports into Australia are subject to duties under the Australian Customs Tariff, unless an exemption applies. The top duty rate is 5%.
## Fringe benefits tax (FBT)
Fringe benefits are not taxable in the hands of the employee. Instead, a separate tax collection procedure applies to fringe benefits, with the tax known as FBT, which is levied on the employer (_see Non-cash benefits in the section for more information_).
