## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 06 September 2024
Ecuador currently taxes its citizens and foreigners mostly on their Ecuador-source income, which is defined as any income derived from activities executed in Ecuador, regardless of where the income is received or paid.
Income generated abroad by Ecuador-resident individuals, local or foreign, is taxable. Income tax credit is granted up to the income tax attributable to such income in Ecuador.
Non-residents are subject to tax on their Ecuador-source income regardless of their domicile or place of residence. Non-residents are subject to 25% income tax on income received from local sources, which is withheld at source. Payments made to non-residents occasionally working in Ecuador, when not charged to an Ecuadorian company or branch of a foreign entity, do not give rise to income tax. Foreigners with resident visas are subject to income tax on any earnings and are not entitled to exclusion of income for periods of temporary absence from Ecuador.
## Personal income tax rates
The personal income tax (PIT) table applicable for year 2024 is as follows:
Taxable income (USD*) | Tax on column 1 (USD) | Tax on excess (%)

Note that any individual who performs an economic activity, without a labour relationship, must obtain the commercial registry or ‘ _patente municipal_ ’. Professionals must pay this tax ranging from USD 10 to USD 700, depending on their economic activity and the condition of being required to keep accounting records or not.

## Taxable period
The fiscal year is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Annual tax returns should not be filed if the taxpayer's income does not exceed the non-taxable base (i.e. USD 11,902 for fiscal year 2024). The employer's annual withholding return is considered the employee's income tax return. If taxable income is obtained from other sources, or from more than one employer, the employer must consolidate both incomes in a single annual return.
Individuals who end their economic activity prior to the end of the fiscal year are required to file their corresponding income tax return upon termination of their activities. Once this return is filed, the individual must cancel the Tax Identification Number (TIN) connected with their own activity within 30 days of termination.
## Payment of tax
In the case of employees, there is mandatory monthly withholding by the employer as long as the total annual net income exceeds the non-taxable base of USD 11,902. The filing date is determined by the ninth digit of the individual’s TIN.
Other individuals must file their income tax return in March of the following year.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 06 September 2024
For PIT purposes, it is necessary to differentiate between two main contractual relationships that may exist between a company and a person: labour and professional fee-based relationships.
A labour relationship exists where a person provides personal and legitimate services to a company under the provisions of the Labour Code. The employee is then under a labour contract, and the individual is included in the company's payroll, thus receiving a fixed monthly remuneration.
A professional fee-based relationship exists when an individual provides professional services to a company on a freelance basis or under a civil contract. This individual is not included in the company's payroll and is not subject to regulations established in the Labour Code. Usually this contractual relationship is used for independent contractors. Their remuneration will always be denominated as ‘fees’.
## Employment income
Residents (national or foreign) are taxed on their total labour compensation, net of social security contributions. Total compensation includes any payments in cash, kind, or services made by the employer. Allowances such as car, vacation travel, housing, and utilities (profit-shares) are considered taxable.
Individuals under labour relationship must exclude the Christmas Bonus (13th salary), as well as Educational Bonus (14th salary), from the taxable income (exclusions must be considered by the employer).
In cases where the employer pays PIT and social security contributions on account of an employee (net salaries), the income tax liability on the net salary is added only once to the total income to get the taxable base, and the social security deduction is not allowed.
## Independent professional gross income
Residents (national or foreign) are taxed on the total fees invoiced. Independent professionals are required to pay social security contributions.
## Capital gains
Capital gains (defined as those obtained in the sale of real estate and stock transactions) are levied with income tax. The financial yield on long-term investments (over 180 days) negotiated through the stock market is tax exempt, provided some conditions are met.
## Dividend income
Dividends received from local corporations are taxable.
## Interest income
Interest on savings accounts is tax exempt.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 06 September 2024
Since fiscal year 2015, an individual's tax residency in Ecuador is established in accordance with the conditions and criteria stated by tax regulations, which are focused on the individual's presence in Ecuador and on the individual’s economic and personal interests and activities.
Specifically, Ecuadorian tax residency is determined when the individual’s presence in Ecuador is greater than 183 days, including sporadic absences, calendar or not, consecutive or not, within the same fiscal year (or in a 12-month time period within two fiscal years). Other conditions may apply.
As of January 2024, a new ‘temporary tax residency’ regime is established for individuals without previous Ecuadorian tax residents status, provided some other conditions are met. Under this regime, the individual will pay income tax only on Ecuadorian-source income during a five-year term.
