## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
Individuals are subject to business income tax, called _Impôt sur les Revenus_ (IR), or to salary income tax, called _Impôt sur les Revenus Salariaux et Assimilés_ (IRSA), depending on the nature of the revenue earned. 
For IRSA purposes, an individual resident in Madagascar, either Malagasy or of a foreign nationality, is liable on worldwide income.
For IR purposes, an individual who is not resident in Madagascar is liable only on income from Malagasy sources.
## Salary income tax (IRSA)
IRSA scale:
  * Income range up to 350,000 Malagasy ariary (MGA): 0%
  * Income range from MGA 350,001 to MGA 400,000: 5%
  * Income range from MGA 400,001 to MGA 500,000: 10%
  * Income range from MGA 500,001 to MGA 600,000: 15%
  * Income range above MGA 600,000: 20%


In all cases, regardless of the income, the minimum salary income tax payable is MGA 3,000.
## Individual business income tax (IR)
An individual business having an annual turnover of less than MGA 400 million is subject to IR at a rate of 5% (with a possible reduction of 70%) of the annual turnover, called 'synthetic tax'. However, the minimum tax is MGA 16,000 or MGA 150,000, depending on the activity.
Basic producers, such as farmers, foresters, and intermediaries operating with the said producers in the sales chain, are subject to synthetic tax on their income from their activities regardless of the MGA 400 million threshold.
Individual members of cooperative societies are personally subject to IR (income tax) or to synthetic tax.
An individual business having an annual turnover exceeding MGA 400 million is taxable in the same manner as a corporation (income tax on the profit). _See the section in the Corporate tax summary for more information_.

The tax on salary and all statutory social contributions are withheld monthly by the employer, who is responsible for tax filing and payment.

If the employee does not have any business income, there is no requirement to file for IR.
### IR
Small business income tax returns must be filed with the tax office by 31 March of each year. For taxpayers with a tax year spanning two years, the deadline is no later than the end of the third month following the end of the fiscal year.
IR returns for large individual businesses must be filed before 15 May of each year for businesses having financial years ended on 31 December, before 15 November of each year for businesses having financial years ended on 30 June, and within 15 days of the fourth month of the end of financial year for other businesses.
