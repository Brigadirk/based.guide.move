## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 18 February 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
As per the new PIT Law, taxpayers are no longer required to prepare and file the annual tax return (form PDD-GDP). Instead, the PRO undertook the obligation to prepare the annual tax return based on the electronic fillings made during the year by the companies and the taxpayers _elaborated in description of Payment of tax below_. The PRO would deliver to each taxpayer the draft annual tax return for the calendar year by 30 April of the following year. Within the next month (until 31 May), the taxpayer should confirm the correctness of the data included in the draft return or make appropriate corrections. If the taxpayer neither confirms nor corrects the prepared return by the PRO, the draft tax return would be deemed as final. In case the PRO cannot confirm the corrected annual tax return by the taxpayer, the tax would be determined by way of a Tax Assessment Form issued by the tax authorities.
Individuals who realise business income and keep accounting records submit annual accounts and annual tax return by 15 March of the following year for the previous calendar year.
## Payment of tax
Under the new PIT Law, all taxable income should be reported and PIT paid in advance. Before payment of any taxable income to individuals, taxpayers that are domestic companies and domestic taxpayers that keep accounting records are obligated to calculate, withhold, and pay PIT on behalf of the individuals. These taxpayers should electronically file a calculation for the income payable to the individual and the PIT due to the PRO for approval. The PRO confirms the calculation, following which the payment of income and PIT could be made at the banks.
In all other cases, the taxpayer is obligated to report taxable income and pay PIT in advance on a monthly basis. This obligation would apply for the taxable income realised abroad as well, except for salaries. Namely, by the 10th day of the following month for the income realised in the previous month, each taxpayer should electronically file a calculation for the income and the PIT due to the PRO for approval. Following the approval by the PRO, the PIT should be paid by the 15th day of the following month for the income realised in the previous month. Evidence related to the realised income should be filed to the PRO simultaneously. The electronic reporting of the salary received from abroad should be filed by 31 March of the following year.
In case the calculation filed electronically by the taxpayer is not approved, or the corrected tax return is not accepted, the tax authorities would issue a Tax Assessment Form. In this case, the tax should be paid within 15 days as of the delivery of the Tax Assessment Form to the taxpayer.
Individuals who realise business income and keep accounting records make monthly advance payment of tax in the amount of one twelfth of the calculated tax in the annual tax return for the previous year. The difference between the final tax liability based on the annual tax return and the tax paid in advance for the calendar year is settled by 30 June.

## Social security contributions
The basis for the mandatory social security contributions calculation is the salary and the additional remuneration from employment (including bonuses) as determined in the labour legislation.
The law also sets the minimal base for payment of social security contributions on salary and bonuses, which on a monthly basis is 50% of the average salary paid in North Macedonia.
The highest base for payment of mandatory social security contributions on a monthly basis is 16 average salaries paid in North Macedonia. No social contributions are due on the difference above this threshold.
Calculation and payment of all the employees’ social contributions is regulated under the Law on Mandatory Social Insurance Contributions.
Employers are obligated to calculate, withhold from employees’ gross salary, and pay into the accounts of respective funds the compulsory social contributions and personal income tax (PIT). The current level of the compulsory social contributions on gross salary is as follows:
  * Pension and disability insurance: 18.8%.
  * Health insurance: 7.5%.
  * Employment insurance: 1.2%.
  * Additional health insurance: 0.5%.


The Public Revenue Office (PRO) is the authorised body to control the calculation and the payment of compulsory social contributions and PIT on salaries. All employers send their calculations to the PRO that controls them and, if correct, issues a declaration of acceptance that is afterwards presented to the respective depository bank, in order to perform the payment of mandatory social security contributions, PIT, and net salaries.

## Inheritance and gift tax
Inheritance and gift tax is paid on real estate and entitlements to usage of real estate, which the heirs or the receivers of gifts, respectively, inherit/receive on the basis of an inheritance/gift agreement. Tax is also paid for cash, money claims, securities, and other movable property, provided the value of the inheritance/gift is higher than the average annual salary in North Macedonia as determined by the State Statistical Bureau for the previous year. The values of all gifts of the same type, received in the course of one calendar year, are included in one tax base. The municipal administration keeps records on the value of the gifts, on the basis of which, at the end of the year, the tax can be determined for the person receiving the gift, should one receive more gifts of the same type that cumulatively surpass the non-taxable amount in the course of the year.
An inheritance taxpayer is an individual or a legal entity, resident of North Macedonia, who inherits taxable property. A gift taxpayer is also an individual or a legal entity that receives property as a gift in the country or abroad. Additionally, an inheritance and gift taxpayer is a foreign individual and a non-resident legal entity for the real estate and movable property inherited or received as a gift on the territory of North Macedonia.
The inheritance and gift tax base is the market value of the property inherited or received as a gift as at the moment the tax liability arises, decreased by the debts and expenses burdening such property.
Property tax rates are proportional and differ on the basis of the order of succession. They are prescribed within a certain range and depend on the decision of the relevant municipality.
The heir or receiver of the gift in first order of succession is exempt from paying inheritance and gift tax. The taxpayer in the second order of succession is subject to a tax rate between 2% and 3%. As for the taxpayer in third order of succession or a taxpayer who is not related to the testator, 4% to 5% tax rate is levied.
