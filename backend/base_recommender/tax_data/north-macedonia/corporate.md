Last reviewed - 18 February 2025
As per the local transfer pricing legislation, the taxpayer whose total annual revenue is above 300 million Macedonian denars (MKD) and the value of its transactions with non-resident related parties exceeds MKD 10 million is required to prepare a Full Transfer Pricing Report, containing a Master File and a Local File.
According to the recent amendments to the Corporate Income Tax (CIT) Law, there is no longer an obligation for companies to submit the transfer pricing documentation for the calendar year by 30 September of the following year. However, the Public Revenue Office has the right to request the transfer pricing documentation no earlier than 30 days after the deadline for submitting of the financial statements and CIT return, which is 15 March. Therefore, the request from the Public Revenue Office can come on 15 April at the earliest for the transfer pricing documentation for the previous year. The taxpayer is required to submit the form within 15 days of receiving the request from the Public Revenue Office. Thus, the earliest potential deadline for submitting the transfer pricing documentation upon request of the tax authorities is 1 May of the following year.
As per the latest amendments to the Law on Value Added Tax (VAT), an obligation is introduced for a foreign person to register for VAT if such person neither has headquarters nor a subsidiary in the country and sells goods and services in the country that are subject to taxation under the VAT Law. These amendments are applicable as of 1 January 2024 onwards.
During 2023, a new Solidarity Tax was introduced, which is applicable only for the current year.
Solidarity Tax is due by the taxpayers that are liable for CIT with generated revenue greater than MKD 615 million for fiscal year (FY) 2022. The generated revenue does not include income from sale of property in bankruptcy proceedings.
The Solidarity Tax rate of 30% should be applied on the tax base determined as a difference between the:
  * tax base after deductions for FY 2022 from the annual CIT return or the average base after deductions from FY 2021 and FY 2022, and
  * average tax base after deductions from previous periods (FY 2018, FY 2019, and FY 2021) or average tax base after deductions from previous periods (FY 2017, FY 2018, and FY 2019), respectively, increased by 20% (i.e. 30% in case of changes in the taxpayerâ€™s legal status).


Taxpayers are required to submit the tax return for Solidarity Tax no later than 4 October and settle the extraordinary tax until 25 October 2023.
## Implementation of Pillar Two minimum taxation rules in North Macedonia 
Pillar Two legislation was enacted in North Macedonia on 27 December 2024.
The Law on Minimum Global Corporate Income Tax, is aligned with the GloBE Rules under Pillar 2 of the OECD/G20 Framework (BEPS). This law is set to be implemented retroactively for the tax period starting 1 January 2024.
This landmark legislation introduces a domestic top-up corporate income tax that will impact the largest multinational enterprises (MNEs) present in North Macedonia, provided they meet the statutory criteria. With the domestic top-up corporate income tax, the profit of MNEs generated in North Macedonia will be taxed at a rate of 15%.
MNEs should not be required to pay domestic additional tax for the fiscal year if their average qualified revenue in North Macedonia is below 10 million euros and their average qualified profit is below 1 million euros. This exemption is calculated based on data from the current and the two preceding fiscal years for all companies in the country that are part of the MNE.

## Taxable period
The taxable period for which CIT is determined covers one calendar year.
## Tax returns
Taxpayers are obligated to calculate and pay CIT on the basis of a CIT return, which must be submitted to the Public Revenue Office by the end of February of the following year or, if filed electronically, by 15 March of the following year.
Taxpayers who distribute profit arising from FY 2009 to FY 2013 are obligated to calculate and pay CIT on the basis of a tax return on profit distribution, which should be submitted to the tax authorities up to the date of profit distribution.
Taxpayers that have used the incentive for reinvested profit in previous years should submit a specific tax return to the tax authorities and pay the due CIT within 30 days as of the date taxpayers no longer satisfied the conditions for using such incentive.
Taxpayers should submit a specific tax return and pay the CIT due at the moment of transfer of revaluation reserves of tangible and intangible assets into accumulated profit. Only the transfer of revaluation reserves recognised prior to 2019 is taxable. 
Small taxpayers who fall under the simplified tax regime are obligated to calculate and pay the tax due on the basis of a tax return on overall income, which should be submitted to the tax authorities by the end of February of the following year or, if filed electronically, by 15 March of the following year.
## Payment of tax
Corporate taxpayers are obligated to pay monthly CIT advance payments during the year within 15 days of the end of each month.
Monthly CIT advance payments are calculated as one-twelfth of the CIT obligation for the previous calendar year, increased by the index of cumulative retail price growth as determined by the State Statistical Bureau.
The difference between the advance payments and the final CIT liability as determined in the CIT return should be paid within 30 days as of the deadline for submission of the CIT return. Daily penalty interest of 0.03% is due on late tax payments.
In case the sum of monthly advance payments exceeds the final tax liability in the CIT return, the taxpayer may request for a refund of overpaid tax. The tax should be refunded within 60 days as of the date of submitting the request via the CIT return. If the taxpayer does not ask for a tax refund, the overpaid amounts will be considered as advance payment for the following period.
## Tax audit process
The tax audit may include one or more taxes, one or more fiscal periods, or only certain tax issues. The extent of the tax audit is determined solely by the tax authorities and is based on their estimation of risk in respect of the specific taxpayer. VAT audits are commonly conducted when VAT refund is requested by the taxpayer, and, in this case, the tax audit is usually limited in the area of VAT. The advance notice for tax audit for large taxpayers and concerns is four weeks, whereas the advance notice for all other taxpayers is two weeks. In cases where the tax authorities find that it would be an obstacle for the tax audit, an advanced notice will not be given to the taxpayer.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations is five years as of the end of the calendar year in which the tax event occurred. In case of tax evasion, the statute of limitations is ten years as of the end of the calendar year in which the tax event occurred.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
There are currently no topics of particular focus for the tax authorities.


# North Macedonia
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 18 February 2025
A company is resident in North Macedonia for tax purposes if it is established or maintains its headquarters in the territory of North Macedonia. Foreign legal entities with headquarters abroad are non-residents for tax purposes, but their Macedonian branches are liable for tax on any profit generated in the territory of North Macedonia if they are considered as a PE for the foreign legal entity in the country.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Generally, a PE is a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on, either directly or through a dependent agent.
More specifically, the domestic law provides that a PE may include a place of management, a branch office, an office, a factory, a workshop, mining activities, or any other place of extraction of natural resources.
A building site or construction or installation project, as well as related supervision activities, may constitute a PE if it lasts longer than six months.
Furthermore, the provision of services, including consulting services with regard to one or several related projects, is deemed to give rise to a PE if such activities last longer than 90 continuous days within any 12-month period. If one or several persons establish a PE as per above, any other non-related project on which they are working on becomes part of the PE, irrespective of its duration.
The PE should be registered as a corporate taxpayer at the beginning of its activity in the country for the purposes of obtaining a tax number.


# North Macedonia
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 18 February 2025
The CIT Law exhaustively lists the expenses that are not recognised for CIT purposes and are part of the CIT base.
## Hidden profit distribution
The following transactions with shareholders or their related parties are considered as hidden profit distribution subject to CIT:
  * Sales of goods/services on terms below the market price.
  * Purchase of goods/services on terms above the market price.
  * Providing loans with an interest lower than the market one.
  * Arrangements under which gains are realised by the shareholders or their related parties.


Some of the transactions above may be regulated under the transfer pricing provisions in the CIT Law as well. It seems that the purpose of these provisions is to tax the non-fair transactions with shareholders and their related parties that, based on their value or related party definition, fall out of scope of the specific transfer pricing rules of the CIT Law.
## Unjustified shortages
Unjustified shortages are taxable if not reimbursed from the salary of the responsible person.
## Non-business-related expenses
Expenses that are not related to the business activity of the taxpayer are taxable.
## Depreciation
Under the CIT Law amendments applicable as of 1 January 2019, the expenses for depreciation of the re-valuated amount of tangible and intangible assets are deemed as tax non-deductible expenses.
CIT is payable in case revaluation reserves of tangible and intangible assets are transferred into accumulated profit. The tax base is the transferred amount into accumulated profit less the amount of depreciation of the revaluated value of assets from 1 January 2019 until the date of write-off or disposal of the assets. 
The depreciation expenses of assets are tax deductible if calculated within the statutory-prescribed depreciation rates and rules. Taxpayers should include in the tax base the portion of depreciation that exceeds the amount calculated based on the prescribed tax rates. At the end of December 2019, the government has published the Guidelines for depreciation rates and the methodology for calculating the depreciation for tax purposes. 
On the other hand, based on the recent amendments, the taxation of depreciation became a temporary difference. Taxpayers are allowed to decrease the tax base in the following year for the amount of taxed depreciation in the previous tax period.
Furthermore, the write-off of the residual value of assets that can no longer be used is tax deductible, following an approval issued by the Macedonian tax authorities. Such approval is subject to submitting a request by the taxpayer by 31 January of the following year.
## Goodwill
There are no specific provisions in the tax legislation with regard to goodwill.
## Start-up expenses
There are no specific provisions in the tax legislation with regard to start-up expenses.
## Interest expenses
Interest paid on non-business related credits of the taxpayer, as well as interest on credits for purchase of passenger vehicles, furniture, carpets, works of art, and decorative objects, is a taxable expense. Interest on business-related credit is also taxable, provided it falls under the thin capitalisation or transfer pricing rules (_see Thin capitalisation or Transfer pricing in the section for more information_).
## Uncollected receivables from loans
Uncollected receivables arising from loans (or transactions that are considered loans in their economic substance) that are not repaid in the year of granting are considered as taxable expenses. On the other hand, taxpayers are allowed to reduce their tax base in the tax period when such receivable is partially or fully collected. According to the recent amendments, the uncollected loan receivables from resident legal entities are not taxable.
## Impairment and write-off of receivables
Impairment of receivables is not taxable for banks, saving institutions, and insurance companies if impaired in accordance with the methods prescribed by law. As to other corporate taxpayers, impairment of receivables is a taxable expense, excluding the receivables from entities under bankruptcy or liquidation procedure (if confirmed within these procedures).
Write-off of receivables is a taxable expense for all corporate taxpayers.
On the other hand, taxpayers are entitled to decrease the tax base for the amount of collected receivables (taxed in previous years) in the year of collection.
## Charitable contributions
Donations and sponsorships expenses are taxable if not pursuant to the manner, the conditions, and the procedure set forth in the Law on Donations and Sponsorships in Public Activities. If compliant with the law requirements as per above, donations in public activities are taxable if the annual amount borne by the taxpayer exceeds 5% of its overall revenue, whereas sponsorship expenses are taxable if above 3% of the overall revenue of the taxpayer.
The above incentive could be utilised by meeting certain statutory-prescribed criteria.
## Compensation expenses
Employeesâ€™ related expenditures (e.g. organised transportation to/from work, canteen, business trip allowance, field allowance, family separation allowance, one-off severance payment, retirement allowance, annual holiday allowance, anniversary awards) are taxable on the part exceeding the amount prescribed by law and collective agreement. According to the latest amendments, the taxation of these expenditures is not linked to their payment. However, taxpayers are allowed to decrease the tax base if the provisions for these expenses are cancelled in future tax periods for the amount of recognised revenue due to such cancellation.
Voluntary pension insurance contributions are taxable if their annual amount per employee exceeds two average monthly gross salaries paid out in the country for the previous calendar year.
The monthly allowances and expenses for the managing board members are tax-deductible, up to 50% of the average gross monthly salary paid out in the country for the previous year.
Expenses made for accommodation (up to 4 star hotels and in the daily amount of up to MKD 6,000 per person) and transport of non-payroll employees engaged at the taxpayer for the purposes of its business activities are tax deductible, provided they are properly documented.
Depending on the period of the internship contract, the tax-deductible internship allowance could be in the range between 42% to 100% of the minimum net monthly salary paid out in the country.
The monthly allowance for practical trainings of students is tax deductible up to MKD 8,000 per person. 
## Insurance expenses
Voluntary health insurance premiums are taxable if their annual amount per employee exceeds one average monthly gross salary, paid out in the previous calendar year.
Voluntary pension contributions paid to the private pension fund are taxable if their annual amount per employee exceeds two average monthly gross salaries, paid out in the previous calendar year.
Other insurance premiums paid for members of the management board and the employees (if not paid out from their salary) are taxable expenses. Only the collective insurance of the employees for work-related injuries is a non-taxable expense for corporate taxpayers.
## Entertainment expenses
Expenses for gifts, business dinners, recreation, and entertainment are taxable, up to 90% of the annual amount borne by the taxpayer.
## Scrapping
Expenses for scrapping exceeding the standards for the particular industry set forth in the rulebook on the standardised amounts of debris, scrap, waste, wreckage, and scattering of goods and specific products are taxable. Scrapping expenses caused by _vis major_ or an uncontrollable event are not taxable.
## Fines, penalties, and taxes
Fines and tax penalties, penalty interest on unpaid public duties, and expenses for enforced payments, as well as withholding tax (WHT) borne by the taxpayer on behalf of third parties, are taxable.
## Net operating losses
The CIT Law stipulates that the loss realised in the income statement for the year, adjusted for the amount of non-deductible expenses, can be carried forward against future profits for a maximum period of three years as of the year when the profit has been realised.
On the other hand, the loss realised for 2020 and 2021 can be carried forward against future profits for a maximum period of five years as of the year when the profit has been realised.
Loss carrybacks are not allowed under the Macedonian tax legislation.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
There are no specific provisions in the tax legislation with regard to payments towards foreign affiliates.

## Transfer pricing
### New transfer pricing legislation
The CIT Law and the Transfer Pricing Rulebook have introduced new provisions in respect of transfer prices applied between related parties from 1 January 2019 onwards. The above legislation prescribed detailed rules on transfer pricing, both in terms of substantial and transfer pricing reporting aspects. 
### Transfer pricing reporting requirements
The amended tax legislation outlines new transfer pricing reporting requirements for taxpayers, as follows:
  * Transfer pricing report requirement does not apply to (i) taxpayers that have realised total annual revenue of up to MKD 300 million and (ii) transactions between related parties that are Macedonian residents.
  * Short Transfer Pricing Report requirement: Taxpayers that have total annual revenue above MKD 300 million and have transactions with non-resident related parties in an annual amount up to MKD 10 million.
  * Full Transfer Pricing Report requirement: All other taxpayers that do not fall under the two categories above.


The above-mentioned transfer pricing reports should be prepared in Macedonian language and should be submitted to the tax authorities within 15 days of their request.
### Detailed definition of related parties
According to the new transfer pricing legislation, two persons would be considered as related in the following situations:
  * One of them has acquired, directly or through another entity, at least 20% of the shares in the share capital of the other person or when it holds at least 20% of all voting rights in its assembly.
  * Any third party, directly or through another entity, has acquired at least 20% of the shares in the share capital in each of the related parties, or when it holds at least 20% of all voting rights in its assembly or in any of related partiesâ€™ assembly.
  * One or more executive or non-executive directors or members of the Management or Supervisory Board of one person are executive or non-executive directors or members of the Management or Supervisory Board in the other person.
  * A loan granted or guaranteed by one person constitutes more than 20% of the book value of the total assets of the other person.
  * One person, directly or through another entity, receives at least 20% of the profits of the other person, based on an agreement for business cooperation between the two persons.
  * One person is a PE of another person.
  * One person performs business and financial transactions with another person who is resident of a country in which the CIT rate is 25% lower than the CIT rate applicable in the Republic of North Macedonia.


For the purpose of the above paragraphs, the shares or voting rights of a natural person shall be considered together with those of the spouse, the relatives in a vertical line, the siblings, the guardians, and the adoptive parents.
### Full Transfer Pricing Report
In general, the Full Transfer Pricing Report should include a:
  * Master File
  * Local File, and
  * Statutory-prescribed attachments (e.g. consolidated financial statements of the group, financial statements of the local taxpayer, copy of inter-company agreements, copy of any Advance Pricing Agreements [APAs], etc.).


The elements of the Master File and the Local File are generally aligned with the elements prescribed in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Transfer Pricing Guidelines.
### Short Transfer Pricing Report
The Short Transfer Pricing Report should contain data for each category of transactions (i.e. a group of transactions of the same type) as follows:
  * Description of the transactions.
  * Value of the transactions.
  * A related entity with which the transactions have been performed.


### Transfer pricing methods, comparables, and market range of comparablesâ€™ data
The new legislation prescribes five transfer pricing methods (instead of the previous two) that can be used for determination of the transfer price upon transactions with related parties.
The prescribed methods are:
  * Comparable Uncontrolled Price Method.
  * Resale Price Method.
  * Cost Plus Method.
  * Transactional Net Margin Method.
  * Profit Split Method.


The taxpayer should choose the most appropriate method in accordance with the armâ€™s-length principle and should choose a method for each type or category of transactions. If necessary, in specific cases, a combination of several methods may be used.
## Thin capitalisation
A proportional part of the interest related to a loan received from a non-resident shareholder, who directly holds at least 20% of the capital in the company, that exceeds three times its share in the equity in the company will be taxable during a tax period. Thin capitalisation rules also apply to loans from banks if they are granted in relation to a deposit of the shareholder in that particular bank. Note that thin capitalisation rules do not apply for newly established companies within the first three years of operation.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no CFC rules in North Macedonia.

## Foreign tax credit
The taxpayer is allowed a tax credit for the tax paid on foreign income abroad, up to the amount of tax payable for that income in North Macedonia. However, a tax credit for the WHT paid abroad is allowed only if a double tax treaty (DTT) is in place and in case the Macedonian company obtains proof for the amount of tax paid in the foreign country.
## Reinvested profit
The CIT Law introduces a possibility for decreasing the tax base for the year for the amount of profit reinvested for development purposes of the local taxpayer. The amounts from the reinvested profit that would be recognised for the purposes of the above tax relief cover investments both in tangible and intangible assets, except for some explicitly listed types of assets intended for administrative purposes.
In order to be able to utilise the above tax relief, the taxpayers must maintain ownership over the assets purchased with the reinvested profit for a period of five years as of the day of their purchase. If the taxpayer sells the assets before the expiration of the five-year period, the taxpayer owes the respective CIT.
## Technological industrial development zones
A taxpayer that is a registered user within a technological industrial development zone is exempt from CIT payment for a period of ten years from the commencement of the performance of the activity in the zone or until the state aid amount is fully exhausted under terms and conditions and according to a procedure determined with the Law on Technological Industrial Development Zones.

Macedonian resident entities are taxed on their worldwide income. Non-resident entities are taxed on the profit realised through their PE in North Macedonia.
Non-profit organisations (including non-governmental organisations, religious and humanitarian organisations, trade unions, political parties, etc.) are taxed on income from their business activities (if any) if their total annual revenues are higher than MKD 1 million. The CIT would be calculated as 1% of the total annual revenues from business activities, decreased by the prescribed tax exemption of MKD 1 million.
The CIT rate is 10%.
The tax base for CIT is the profit realised for the current year, as determined according to the applicable accounting standards, adjusted for the amount of non-deductible expenses incurred during the fiscal year.
Under the previous CIT legislation, there were two separate tax bases for CIT, which were subject to filing of two separate tax returns. In the period between FY 2009 and FY 2013, CIT was payable separately on non-deductible expenses (on an annual basis) and on financial profit (only if distributed). By means of the applicable CIT Law, the accumulated profit realised for the period FY 2009 to FY 2013 is subject to taxation at the moment of distribution or at the moment it is used to off-set accumulated losses. Taxpayers are obligated to cover the losses from previous years prior profit distribution.
CIT is not payable on received dividend income from domestic taxpayers, under condition that such income was taxed at the level of the payer.
Also, according to the new amendments in the CIT Law, 10% CIT is payable in case revaluation reserves of tangible and intangible assets are transferred into accumulated profit. The tax base is the transferred amount into accumulated profit less the amount of depreciation of the revaluated value of assets from 1 January 2019 until the date of write-off or disposal of the assets. CIT is payable by way of submitting a specific CIT return by the taxpayer.
## Simplified tax regime for companies
Companies (except companies that provide banking, financial, and insurance services, as well as services in the field of games of chance and entertainment games) can choose to benefit from the simplified tax regime based on their overall annual income. Provided other criteria prescribed in the CIT Law are met, companies will qualify for the simplified tax regime if their overall annual income from all sources is between MKD 3 million and MKD 6 million, excluding 2020 where the range is between MKD 5 million and MKD 10 million. These companies will pay 1% CIT on their overall income from all sources as stated in their income statement and financial statements for the respective calendar year.
Provided their overall annual income in the following three years is within the above range, companies under the simplified tax regime cannot request to be excluded from the simplified tax regime.
Under the simplified tax regime, exemption from CIT is available for companies with an overall annual income from all sources of up to MKD 3 million, with the exception of 2020. In 2020, companies that achieved overall annual income from all sources of up to MKD 5 million are fully exempted from paying CIT.
The exemption is not applicable for companies that perform banking, financial, and insurance activity or activity in the field of games of chance and amusement games.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
In general, the VAT regulations are in line with the provisions of the sixth European Union (EU) VAT directive.
The standard VAT rate is 18%. This rate applies to overall turnover and imports of goods and services. In addition to the standard VAT of 18%, preferential rates of 5% and 10% are applied for turnover of certain goods and services.
The preferential tax rate of 5% applies to supply of food for human consumption; food for livestock; drinking water from public supply systems; computers and software; agricultural material and equipment; wood pellets, pellet stoves, and pellet boilers; baby products; school supplies (e.g. school backpacks, notebooks, pencils); pharmaceutics and medical equipment; publications, such as books, pamphlets, newspapers, and other printed material, except for publications mainly used for advertising purposes; electricity for households; transport of passengers; accommodation services, bed and breakfast services, as well as half-board and full-board services provided by hotel keepers in the country; craft-related services, such as repair of bicycles, shoes, and clothes, hairdressing services, etc.
The preferential tax rate of 10% applies to restaurant services and catering services, with the exception of alcoholic beverages, as well as for certain food products that are not deemed as basic products for human consumption.
All taxpayers whose total annual turnover exceeds MKD 2 million or whose total supplies, as projected at the beginning of the business activity, will exceed this amount are liable to register for VAT purposes.
Residents that do not meet the criteria above may voluntarily register for VAT purposes at the beginning of each calendar year.
The standard VAT period is one calendar month. However, if the total turnover in the previous calendar year did not exceed MKD 25 million, the tax period is the calendar quarter. The VAT period for voluntary VAT registered taxpayers is the calendar quarter.
The taxpayer is obligated to submit a VAT return for each tax period within 25 days following the end of the relevant tax period. VAT is payable within 30 days following the end of the relevant tax period. 
## Customs duties
Customs duties generally apply to most products imported into North Macedonia. The customs rates under the most favoured nation treatment for agricultural products are up to 31%, whereas the customs rates for industrial products are below 23%.
North Macedonia has signed trade agreements with Turkey, Ukraine, and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member states. The country is a member state to the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) and has signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the European Community.
The import of industrial products with preferential origin and certain raw precious metals is exempt from customs duties.
According to the Stabilisation and Association Agreement 2001 signed between Macedonia and the European Union, products with Macedonian origin can generally be exported into EU countries free of customs duties.
## Excise duties
Excise duties are levied with respect to a limited number of goods produced or imported in North Macedonia. Alcohol and alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, and fuels and electricity are subject to an excise duty at a flat or percentage rate. The excise period is one calendar month, and excise duty is payable within 15 days as of the end of the calendar month. The excise duty for alcohol beverages and tobacco goods is levied by way of purchasing excise stamps.
Alcohol and alcoholic beverages are taxable per litre/percentage of alcohol. Some categories of alcoholic beverages (e.g. wine) are not subject to excise duty. Maximum excise duty payable is up to MKD 340 per litre on pure alcohol.
The excise duty for tobacco products is combined and is calculated both per unit/kilo and as a percentage from the retail price. As of 1 January 2024 up to 1 January 2030, the rate of the specific and minimum excise duty on cigars/smoking tobacco will increase by MKD 0.23 per peace every year.
The excise duty for fuels and electricity is paid in cases where those are used as a fuel or heating fuel. The excise base for fuels is the amount of fuels expressed in kilo net mass, normal cubic meters, litre, or giga joules gross calorific value, except for electricity where the excise base is the amount expressed in megawatt hours.
## Property tax
Property tax is paid annually on the ownership of real estate, including land (agricultural, construction, forest, and pastures) and buildings (residential buildings or flats, business buildings and business premises, administrative buildings and administrative premises, buildings and flats for rest and recreation, and other construction facilities, as well as installations constructed on the buildings or below and permanently attached to the buildings).
The person liable for property tax is the legal entity or the individual owner of the property. If the owner is not known or cannot be reached, the person liable for property tax is the user of the property. A property taxpayer may also be the taxpayer who usufructs the property; and, if the property is owned by several persons, each of them is a property taxpayer proportionately for the portion owned. A property taxpayer is also the person who uses real estate owned by the state and the municipality.
The property tax base is the market value of the real estate. The market value of the real estate is determined in accordance with the methodology prescribed by the government.
Property tax rates are proportional and range from 0.10% to 0.20%. The rates may be determined on the basis of the type of the property. As an exception, property tax rates on agricultural land not used for agricultural production and residential or commercial real estate that is not used or not leased for more than six months during a calendar year may be increased outside the above range (i.e. from three to five times in relation to the basic rates).
The amount of the rates is decided by the Municipal Councils.
## Transfer tax
The transfer of the right to ownership of real estate for or without compensation, as well as other means of acquiring real estate for or without compensation, between legal entities or natural persons is subject to transfer tax.
The person liable for transfer tax is the seller of the real estate. As an exception, a taxpayer may also be the buyer of the real estate if agreed in the sale and purchase agreement. When replacing real estate, the taxpayer is the party that replaces the real estate of greater value.
When selling real estate in bankruptcy and law-enforcement procedure, as well as when realising agreements on mortgage, the taxpayer may be the buyer of the real estate.
In the case of transfer of ownership of an ideal share in real estate, taxpayers are each of the owners separately.
The tax base is the market value of the real estate at the moment the tax liability arises.
When replacing real estate, the tax base is the difference between the market values of the real estate being replaced.
When selling real estate in bankruptcy and law-enforcement procedure, the tax base is the attained selling price.
The market value is determined by a special municipal commission in accordance with the methodology prescribed by the government.
Tax rates are proportional and range from 2% to 4%. The tax rates are determined by the municipal councils by way of decision.
There are certain exemptions from transfer taxes available for specifically determined cases (i.e. transfer of shares, sale of securities, the first sale of residential premises for the first five years from the end of their construction, etc.).
## Stamp taxes
Stamp taxes are not payable in North Macedonia.
## Social security contributions and payroll taxes
Employers are obligated to calculate and withhold from employeesâ€™ gross salary and pay into the accounts of respective funds the compulsory social security contributions and personal income tax (PIT). The current level of the compulsory social security contributions is as follows:
  * Pension and disability insurance: 18.8%.
  * Health insurance: 7.5%.
  * Employment insurance: 1.2%.
  * Additional health insurance: 0.5%.


The legislation prescribes the minimum and the maximum base for calculation of the social security contributions.
The Public Revenue Office (PRO) is the authorised body to control the calculation and the payment of the compulsory social security contributions and PIT on salaries. All employers send their calculations to the PRO that controls them and, if correct, issues a declaration of acceptance that is used by the banks to perform the payment of the social security contribution, PIT, and net salaries.
## Garbage collection fee

## Communal taxes
Companies and individuals are liable for paying communal taxes for usage of certain rights and services (mainly for usage of the urban space in the municipalities, posting commercials, etc.).
## Motor vehicle tax
From 1 January 2020, a new tax on motor vehicles is introduced, which basically taxes passenger cars and other motor vehicles designed primarily for transport of persons, including motorcycles and pickup vehicles, as well as vans for combined transport of persons and goods.
The subject of taxation is new and used motor vehicles that are imported and/or put into free circulation in the country for the first time. This law does not cover freight motor vehicles and exclusively electrically driven vehicles.
The tax base for motor vehicle tax calculation is the amount of average carbon dioxide (CO2) expressed in grams per kilometre, depending on the type of propulsion fuel and the sales value of the vehicle or import value of the vehicle if the vehicle is imported.
Motor Vehicle Tax = Value + Specific Component
Where:
Value = The value of the motor vehicle multiplied by the percentage of the value of the vehicle for the appropriate value category.
Specific component = The amount of average CO2 emissions multiplied by the value of 1 gram of CO2 for a given category, depending on the fuel type of the vehicle.
There are specific rules for: 
  * hybrid vehicles, in which case the amount of tax on motor vehicles is reduced by 50%
  * pickup vehicles, in which case the tax is calculated on the basis of the amount of engine power expressed in kW and the value of one kW, depending on the level of exhaust emissions
  * motorcycles, tricycles and quadricycles, in which case the tax is calculated on the basis of engine volume data expressed in cm3, motor vehicle tax amount per cm3 expressed in Macedonian denars for the relevant category and emission level, and
  * old-timers (vehicles older than 35 years), in which case the tax is calculated and paid in lump sum of MKD 5,000.


The competent authority for determining, collecting, and controlling the implementation of the Law on Motor Vehicles is the Customs Administration of the Republic of North Macedonia.
