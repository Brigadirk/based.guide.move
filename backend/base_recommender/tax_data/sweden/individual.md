## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Introduction of the concept of 'economic employer'
The Swedish government implemented the concept of ‘economic employer’ into Swedish tax law as of 1 January 2021. Previously, Sweden applied a more formal employer concept.
The new concept particularly applies when interpreting the so-called ‘183-days rule’ in tax treaties where Sweden is a contracting state. The regulations will, however, not impact employees working in Sweden for a maximum of 15 days in a row or 45 days in total during a calendar year. 
## New rules on mandatory tax withholding
In addition to the introduction of the economic employer concept, new rules on on tax withholding for work performed in Sweden were introduced from 1 January 2021.
A withholding tax (WHT) obligation now applies for Swedish payers when making payments to a foreign company, or to a non-resident person, for work carried out in Sweden, unless the recipient of the payment is approved for F-tax (an F-tax certificate signifies that you are an entrepreneur who is responsible for paying your own taxes and contributions).

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Employment income tax for residents
Employment income is taxed at the following rounded taxable income amounts (2025):
Taxable income (SEK *) | National income tax (%) | Municipal income tax ** (%)  
---|---|---  
From 0 to 625,800 | 0  | 32  
Over 625,800 | 20 | 32  
* Swedish kronor
** This rate equals the average municipal tax rate.
## Employment income tax for non-residents
Non-residents working in Sweden for a Swedish employer or a foreign employer with a permanent establishment (PE) in Sweden are taxed a flat rate of 25% at source. The same rate applies when a pension is paid by a Swedish source to a person not tax-resident in Sweden.
Non-residents working in Sweden for a non-Swedish employer without a PE in Sweden are tax liable in Sweden if the beneficiary of the employee’s work is an entity in Sweden and the work is performed under the management and control of the Swedish entity. The tax rate is 25%. An exception applies if the employees is working in Sweden for less than 15 days in a row and less than 45 days in total during a calendar year. 
## Capital tax
Capital income is generally taxed at a flat rate of 30%. _See Capital gains and investment income in the section for more information_.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Taxable period
Individuals file a tax return for the calendar year.
## Tax returns
The filing date is normally 2 May of the year after the calendar year, or the following Monday if 2 May occurs on a Saturday or Sunday. An extension of the filing date may be available upon application.
The tax authorities assess income taxes by applying the appropriate tax rates to the aggregate taxable income from the various sources. Spouses are taxed separately.
The tax assessments are issued during June-December of the same year the tax return is filed.
## Payment of tax
Preliminary taxes must be withheld by a resident employer. In the case of a non-resident employer, tax payment must be submitted to the tax authority by the employees themselves.
Income taxes not covered by the preliminary taxes withheld must be paid by the individual 90 days after the final tax bill is issued.
Interest is payable if the taxes withheld do not cover the final tax liability. In order to avoid interest being levied, the individual may pay the taxes to their tax account by 14 February of the year after the income year.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Employment expenses
In principle, all expenses incurred during the fulfilment of the employment agreement are deductible (e.g. travel expenses, automobile expenses, living allowances on business trips, necessary literature, tools of the trade). The deduction related to cost-of-living allowances is, however, limited.
Expenses for travel between home and place of work are deductible based on the cheapest means of public transport or, if a private car or a company car is used, on a fixed amount per kilometre. Only the part of the cost exceeding SEK 11,000 is deductible. The employee must fulfil certain criteria for the deduction (e.g. save at least two hours per day by using a private car instead of public transportation).
Expenses incurred due to double accommodation and home travel during temporary assignments away from one’s ordinary place of work may be deductible for a period of two years for single individuals and up to five years for married individuals (applicable to Swedish accommodation and home travel within the EU/EEA only). Home travel may be deducted separately for an even longer time.
Mandatory home country employee social security charges are deductible (for EU/EEA only).
## Personal deductions
### Interest expenses
Interest costs paid to Swedish or non-Swedish lenders are deductible.
### Management costs
Management costs for the administration of investments are no longer deductible as from 1 January 2016.
### Pension insurance premiums and contributions
Personal pension insurance premiums and contributions to restricted pension savings accounts are deductible within certain limits, but only if the employee is not included in an employer funded company pension plan.
## Personal allowances
From the aggregate taxable income, basic allowance of SEK 16,800 to SEK 44,800 (2024) is granted.
## Losses
Losses from the sale of private real property, securities, etc. are generally only 50% or 70% deductible. A tax credit may be applicable in certain instances (_see the section_).


# Sweden
## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Employment income
All remuneration from employment, whether in cash or in kind, is treated as taxable income. Director’s fees, bonuses, commissions, pensions, annuities, allowances, tax equalisation payments, and incentives (e.g. stock options, share programs) are considered as employment income. A housing benefit, a company car, and free meals are the major taxable benefits in kind. Compensation is normally taxed when paid out (cash principle). Specific rules apply for incentives that are subject to restrictions.
Premiums to employer pension plans, which do not qualify as tax favourable pension plans under Swedish law, may be considered taxable income for the employee.
Loans from an employer to an employee at low or no interest are deemed to generate a taxable benefit. The taxable benefit is deductible as an interest cost. Note that members of management and shareholders may not be allowed to lend money from the employer due to the Swedish financial assistance rules.
## Equity compensation
Employee stock options trigger taxation as employment income when exercised. The value of the benefit should be determined as the difference between the fair market value and the exercise price.
Favourable rules regarding qualified employee stock options are implemented in 2018. The rules apply to a very restricted type of small companies under very specific circumstances.
## Income from closely held companies
Special rules apply to the taxation of income from closely held companies. Since the rules are complicated, it is recommended that PwC be contacted for advice.
## Capital gains and investment income
Individuals resident in Sweden are taxed on capital gains realised during the period of residence. All current income from bank savings, financial instruments, claims of different kinds, dividends, and gains received by a resident person is taxable as investment income. For example, interest income, dividends, gains on the sale of stock and private property, and rental income from letting real estate or apartments are taxable.Individuals who have been resident in Sweden continue to have a tax liability on capital gains from the disposal of, _inter alia_ , Swedish stock and similar assets during a ten-year period after they leave Sweden. This time limit is reduced in several double taxation agreements (DTAs).Non-resident individuals are taxed on Swedish source gains (e.g. capital gains on Swedish real estate and tenant owner’s apartments). Investment income and capital gains are normally taxed at a 30% flat rate.
### Sale of real estate and apartments
A tax rate of 22% applies to the sale of private real property and tenant owner’s apartments. Under certain circumstances, it is possible to defer the taxation of gains, up to a certain amount, from selling a private real property when a new private real property (house or apartment) is bought either in Sweden or the EU/European Economic Area (EEA) area. 
### Sale of stock
Capital gains on stocks are taxed at 30%. The taxable gain on the sale of stock is the net profit (i.e. the sales price less the average purchase price for all stock of the same kind). Only 70% of the calculated loss may normally be deducted.For non-quoted shares, the tax rate is 25% since only 5/6 of the gain is taxable. The same applies for losses on non-quoted shares (i.e. only 5/6 of the calculated loss can be deducted at 70%).Special rules apply to the taxation of capital gains from the sale of stock of closely held companies. The rules are complicated, and it is therefore recommended that PwC be contacted for advice.
### Sale of personal assets
Gains on the sale of personal assets are taxable only if they exceed SEK 50,000 per year. The acquisition cost of personal assets is either the real purchase price or, optionally, 25% of the sales price. Other assets are taxed on the net profit without the mentioned limitations.Employee stock options generally do not qualify as securities and trigger taxation as employment income when exercised (_see Equity compensation above_). Sale of the underlying share is normally taxed as capital gains.
### Rental income
Worldwide rental income from the letting of private property is normally considered as capital income. Tax is assessed on annual rentals and other income received from the real property after deduction of related expenses. For private property (house), the related expenses are deemed to amount to a standard amount of SEK 40,000 and 20% of the annual rental income. Specific rules apply for letting apartments and if the house/apartment is let to the employer.
### Yield tax
Foreign endowment policies, such as life insurance policies and foreign pension insurances, that are owned by the individual are generally subject to an annual yield tax.
### Exchange of foreign currency
Exchange of foreign currency, as well as payment of debt in foreign currency, is generally taxable as investment income.

## Expert tax relief
Foreign experts and key personnel employed by a Swedish company or a non-Swedish company with a PE in Sweden may apply for 'expert tax relief'. The employment and stay in Sweden must be limited in time, and the employee must be a non-Swedish national and must not have been a Swedish tax resident at any point during the five calendar years prior to the year the employment in Sweden starts.
Under an alternative rule, the expert tax relief will be granted if the recurring income paid on a monthly basis exceeds two times the Swedish price base amount for the year the job in Sweden starts. For 2024, this corresponds to a monthly income exceeding SEK 114,600. However, recently the Swedish government decided that from 1st January 2025, the amount limit should be lowered to 1,5 times the price base amount, this corresponds to a monthly income exceeding SEK 88,200 for employment starting 31st of December 2024 or later.
To qualify, the employee must apply for a ruling from the Taxation of Research Workers Board (_Forskarskattenämnden_). The application must be filed within three months of the day the employee started working in Sweden.
If the tax relief is granted, it applies to all taxable compensation paid by the Swedish resident employer, including base salary, annual cash bonuses, equity compensation, and benefits in kind.
The tax relief means that 25% of the compensation will be exempt from Swedish tax and social security charges during a five-year period. Some benefits (e.g. school fees, moving allowances, and home travel allowances twice per year) are tax free and exempt from Swedish social security charges.
On 1 January 2024, the rules changed, and the period for which tax relief was granted was extended from five to seven years. Transitional rules apply. 
## Credit for losses
If the total of investment income and capital gains/losses is negative, a tax credit of 30% of the net deficit not exceeding SEK 100,000 and 21% of the net deficit exceeding SEK 100,000 is granted against certain other taxes. The tax credit may not be carried forward.


# Sweden
## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
The following criteria can individually trigger taxable residence and taxation on the individual’s worldwide income:
  * Permanent stay/domicile.
  * Continuous stay exceeding six months.
  * Essential connection if the individual previously has been a Swedish tax resident.


## Five-year rule
Swedish citizens, as well as foreigners who have been resident in Sweden for at least ten years, are deemed resident in Sweden for tax purposes until they can prove that all important ties with Sweden have been broken. Five years after a taxpayer leaves Sweden, the burden of proof is reversed and the tax authorities must prove that ties still exist between the individual and Sweden.
## Six-month and one-year rule
Swedish residents who have been assigned to work abroad or who have taken up employment abroad with a planned duration of at least six months are not liable to Swedish income taxes on income from this employment, provided the income is taxed in the country of employment and the individual does not spend more than six days per month or a maximum of 72 days per 12-month period in Sweden. Part of a day counts as a full day in Sweden when counting the six days per month. Any income that is not taxed in the working country is normally taxed in Sweden. If the income is exempt from taxation in the working country under domestic legislation, the income can be tax exempt in Sweden if the stay abroad lasts for at least one year.
The Supreme Administrative Court has recently made a statement regarding the possible tax exemption for non-residents. They decided on 25 October 2022 not to review dispensation to an appeal regarding a decision made by the Court of Appeal, which leaves the previous rulings fixed. 
Previous case law has stated that EU-citizens that are non-residents in Sweden got to apply a tax exemption (six-month rule tax exemption) since the requirement on tax residency was in conflict with article 45 in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the concept of free movement of workers.
The question in the court case was if such rules where discriminatory against non-EU-citizens if they were to be treated differently, in accordance with double taxation agreements following the OECD guidelines. The ruling concluded that it was not on the basis of nationality but on non-tax residency and that such criteria were not directly discriminatory and not against the double taxation agreements. Non-EU-citizens were therefore taxable in Sweden from work earned through work abroad where the income was received after arrival to Sweden, such as with incentive disbursements or bonus payments.
## Permanent residence
The Swedish Tax Agency (Skatteverket) has proposed a new definition of "permanent residence" (stadigvarande vistelse) in the Income Tax Act (1999:1229). This proposal aims to clarify and simplify the application of tax regulations, thereby increasing predictability for individuals and entities involved. Under the current system, determining whether an individual is considered to have a permanent residence in Sweden can be complex. The existing criteria require a continuous stay of at least six months, including temporary absences. However, the lack of a precise definition has led to difficulties in application, especially for individuals who frequently travel between Sweden and other countries. 
According to the proposal, a stay in Sweden will be considered permanent if it exceeds:
  1. 160 days in a calendar year, or
  2. 120 days in a calendar year, provided that the individual also stayed in Sweden for more than 120 days in the preceding calendar year.


Only days that include an overnight stay (dygnsvila) will be counted as residence days. The proposed regulations are scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2025. However, as of today, the Swedish Parliament has not yet made a final decision on the matter. The legislative process is still ongoing, and it remains uncertain when or if the parliament will approve the proposals.

## Social security contributions
Employers pay Swedish employer social security contributions on compensation paid to employees who are covered by the Swedish social security system.Social security contributions are levied at 31.42% of the total taxable remuneration (no cap) in cash and in kind paid by a Swedish employer or a foreign employer with a PE in Sweden. Foreign employers who do not have a PE in Sweden must register for the payment of social security contributions or may enter into an agreement with the employee that the employee pays and reports the contributions on a monthly basis. Different rates apply depending on which solution is used.
A pension fee of 7 % of gross earned income, up to SEK 650,442 (i.e a maximum fee of SEK 45,530), is payable by the employee, but the fee is normally fully tax creditable on the employee’s tax return (i.e. the effective cost for the employee is normally nil).
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The Swedish VAT system is harmonised with the European Union (EU) rules. The general VAT rate of 25% is chargeable on most goods and services. Reduced rates apply to a few goods and services, such as foodstuffs, restaurant meals, and non or low alcoholic drinks (12%), as well as to transport of passengers (6%). Certain financial and insurance services are exempt from VAT.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
The Swedish wealth tax was abolished as of 1 January 2007.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There are no inheritance, estate, or gift taxes in Sweden.
## Property fee
Property fee is paid by the registered owner of the real property as of 1 January each year. The fee rate is a maximum of SEK 9,287 or 0.75% of the taxable value of the real estate for houses and for block of flats. The real estate fee is not payable on real estate situated abroad.
## Special wage tax on pension premiums
Swedish employers and non-Swedish employers with a PE in Sweden pay special wage tax of 24.26% on pension costs relating to tax qualified company pension plans.
