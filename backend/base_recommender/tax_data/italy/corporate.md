## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
The major recent changes in the Italian tax rules that occurred in the last 12 months are the following:
  * Approval of several corporate income tax (CIT) provisions.


  * Introduction of value-added tax (VAT) and other taxes modifications.
  * New administrative penalties regime.
  * Enhancement of Tax Control Framework (TCF) and cooperative compliance regime.
  * Approval of different regulations in the area of tax credits and incentives.


Please note that Italy tax updates are generally expected to occur between November and December in connection with the Budget Law and approval of related implementing laws.
## Approval of several CIT provisions
The Legislative Decree 192/2024 (Revision of the Income Tax Regime – Individual Tax / Corporate Income Tax - CIT) introduced a number of different provisions on CIT matters. Below are the main measures:
  * **Reduction of book to tax differences**. 
    * **Capital account contributions** : elimination of the option to defer taxation. Effective date: contributions received in the fiscal year 2024;
    * **Short-term and long-term contracts and projects** : the accounting evaluation method adopted, namely "completed contract" or "percentage of completion," will also be relevant for tax purposes, provided it aligns with accounting principles.
    * **Unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses** : exchange rate differences, for the FY 2024, will be immediately relevant for tax purposes, without the need to account deferred taxes including all the exchange rate differences noted at December 31, 2024.
  * **Regulation of book to book differences** : the income and asset components, arising from these differences, are fiscally relevant according to the applicable accounting principles, except when they are inconsistent with previous deduction and taxation rules applied. Possibility to realign the differences resulting from evaluations of assets and liabilities and from past variations, either using the global balance method, applying the standard CIT and regional tax rates (i.e. 24% + 3,9%), or individually, using substitute rates of CIT (18%) and Regional Production Tax (3%). Effective: FY 2024.
  * **Realignment of the higher values arising from extraordinary transactions** : possibility to realign the aforementioned higher values for M&A carried out from January 1, 2024 by paying a step up tax of 21% in a single payment (CIT 18% and Regional Production Tax 3%, replacing the previous rates of 12-14-16%) with reference to the year in which the operation was carried out.
  * **Tax Suspension Reserves Release** : it is possible to release tax suspension reserves existing in the financial statements as of December 31 2023, by paying a substitute tax of 10% in four equal annual installments.
  * **Tax Loss Carryforward (NOLs)** : different conditions and limits to tax loss carryforward have been introduced in case of change of control and change of actual business purposes. For intragroup transactions, the carryforward loss limits do not apply. Effective for: transactions implemented in the FY 2024. Transitional regime is applied for all the tax assets acquired up to the tax period ending on December 31, 2023.
  * **Demerger with spin-off (DWSO)** : the new tax regulation of the demerger pursuant to Article 2506.1 of the Italian Civil Code allows for a tax neutral regime, even in case of the demerger of individual assets, activities, or liabilities, and not only in case of such assets and liabilities were representing a going concern (business), like in the past.
  * **Contributions** : additional contributions of minority shares, distinct from the initial contribution that allowed the control, can benefit from the controlled realization regime (and thus achieve tax neutrality). It is also possible to create a “family-run” holding company with more than one shareholder, as well as making underperforming contributions. The deductibility of the related capital loss, equal to the difference between the increases in the capital of the transferee company and the recognized tax cost of the contributed share, is allowed. It is expressly provided that the goodwill value is included in the business contribution and, consequently, in the value of the share received by the contributor.
  * **Liquidation** : with the reform intervention, the result of each FY in ordinary liquidation will be determined definitively, no longer temporary.
  * **Regime of Italian shell companies** : the rates to be applied to the tax base of buildings, participations, and financial credits for calculating the presumed revenues have been halved, as well as the rates for calculating the minimum revenues whereas the operational test has not been passed.


The 2025 Budget Law introduced the following main Corporate Income Tax measures:
  * **Reduced CIT rate for companies reinvesting profits in qualified fixed assets** (so called “IRES Premiale”): reduction of the CIT rate from 24% to 20%, for the fiscal year 2025 only, for companies that respect certain conditions. Please refer to the specific section for more details.
  * **Additional deduction for labor costs** : this measure introduced by 2024 Budget Law only FY 2024 has been extended also for Fiscal Years (FYs) 2025, 2026, and 2027.
  * **Stock-option deduction** : the deduction of negative components charged to the income statement related to stock option plans occurs at the time of actual allocation to beneficiaries. It applies to FYs 2025 and followings.
  * **Step up of participations (listed and non-listed) and agricultural lands** : for FY 2025 and following is possible to step up of the tax cost of participation and land, by paying a substitute tax of 18%.
  * **Electronic payments for entertainment, meal, and lodging expenses’ deduction** : payments and the related reimbursements of aforementioned costs must be made electronically to be deductible for CIT, Regional Production Tax, and Individual Tax purposes.
  * **Change of goodwill and other intangible assets deduction which gave rise to DTA converted into Tax Credit** : deduction related to said intangible assets has been postponed.


The deadlines for filing corporate income tax (IRES) and regional production tax (IRAP) returns is by the end of the tenth month following the fiscal year-end (i.e. 31 October for calendar year). 
## Introduction of VAT modifications and other taxes provision modifications
Please find here below the main VAT news:
  * **Application of VAT exemption regime provided by art. 8, paragraph 1, letter c), Presidential Decree no. 633/1972 in case of the supply of vehicles** : the VAT exemption regime provided for by art. 8, paragraph 1, letter c), Presidential Decree no. 633/1972, is applicable in the case of transfer of motor vehicles (in relation to which art. 19-bis1, paragraph 1, letters c) and d), Presidential Decree no. 633/1972, provides for a partial deduction of VAT (i.e. 40%), except from specific cases) towards “usual exporters” (within the limits of the “plafond”) only when the provider is able to prove the recipient's right to fully deduct the input VAT(the Supreme Court published the case no. 15679/2024).
  * **Obligation of the electronic memorisation and transmission of the considerations’ data** : the operator should ensure the integration and the interaction between the process related to the daily considerations’ registration and the process of electronic payment. Said system’s update should be implemented by the operators within January 1, 2026. Penalties might be applied in case the operators do not comply with the above mentioned provision (2025 Budget Law).
  * **VAT treatment of training services** : the VAT taxability of training services provided to entities authorized to provide labor pursuant to article 4, Legislative Decree no. 276 of 2003 (so called “agenzie per il lavoro”, expressly authorised companies whose activity is temporary work provision, by training entities and companies financed via the so called “bilateral fund” established pursuant to article 12, paragraph 4, Legislative Decree no. 276/2003) (2025 Budget Law).
  * **VAT deduction of the transactions costs incurred in the context of leveraged buy-out merger operations (also “MLBO”)** : the Supreme Court has opened to the possibility to deduct input VAT on the so-called "transaction costs" incurred by special purpose vehicles ("SPV") in the context of merger leveraged buy out ("MLBO") operations. The Supreme Court judges, overturning the constant practice of the Italian tax authorities on the matter, have stated that the VAT paid on such costs is deductible since they represent for the SPV preliminary costs to the performance of an economic activity (cases no. 22608/2024 and 22649/2024).
  * **Extension of the reverse charge mechanism** : the reverse charge mechanism is extended to the provision of services carried out through procurement contracts, subcontracting, assignment to consortium members or business relationships characterized by a prevalent use of labor and capital goods owned by the client, rendered to companies that carry out transport and handling of goods and logistics services (2025 Budget Law).
  * **VAT credit offset with other taxes** : the Italian tax authorities provided clarifications regarding, inter alia, changes in the procedure of tax credit offset according to article 17, Legislative Decree no. 241/1997 (Circular Letter no. 16/E, dated June 28, 2024).
  * **Warranty obligation for fiscal representatives and non-EU taxpayers intending to carry out intra-EU transactions in Italy** : with two new ministerial decrees dated 4th and 9th December 2024, the Ministry of Finance has implemented the new obligations introduced by legislative decree no. 13 of February 12, 2024 in relation to the obligations for fiscal representatives and non-EU taxpayers intending to carry out intra-EU transactions in Italy.
  * **Secondment of staff** - taxable for VAT purposes from January 1, 2025: as a result of art. 16-ter, Decree-Law no. 131/2024 (added by conversion law no. 166/2024), the current reference legislative provision, i.e., art. 8, paragraph 35, Law no. 67/1988, will be repealed starting from personnel loans and secondments stipulated or renewed from January 1, 2025.
  * **Re-engineering of the electronic export clearance system** : as from December 2, 2024, the Customs Authority, as part of the re-engineering project for the export clearance IT system, has implemented new telematic formats for the transmission of the export customs declarations.
  * **Modifications of VAT rates** : 
    * Extension of the application of the 5% VAT rate to the provision of mountaineering courses carried out by Alpine guides independently;
    * Increase in the VAT rate from 10% to 22%, within the management, warehousing and temporary storage of urban and special residues, for the disposal in landfill and the incineration without efficient energy recovery of urban waste and special waste.
  * **Payment of VAT in case of the elimination of stock** for entities adopting Italian GAAP.
  * **Tax****on sweetened soft drinks** (‘sugar tax') is postponed to July 1, 2025, and tax on the consumption of single use manufactured goods (‘plastic tax‘) is postponed to July 1, 2026.


## New administrative penalties regime
Starting from September 1, 2024, a new regime of administrative penalties has been introduced on tax violations. In general terms, taxpayers should benefit from a reduction of penalties, and self-disclosure procedures are encouraged.
## Enhancement of Tax Control Framework (TCF) and cooperative compliance regime
Additional certainty is granted to taxpayers under the cooperative compliance regime regarding transparency with the tax authorities. In particular:
  * assessment terms are significantly reduced;
  * rewards are enhanced with regards to the penalty regime;


A certification of the TCF has been introduced to apply for the regime.
Entities that are part of a group can opt for the cooperative compliance regime in case at least a group entity meets the size requirements and the group has implemented a certified TCF.
Subjects not eligible can apply for an optional regime, provided that a certified TCF is in place.
A Code of Conduct is introduced to define and regulate mutual commitments between the tax authorities and taxpayers.
## Tax credits and incentives
The main changes introduced by the 2025 Budget Law in terms of incentives for businesses include: 
  1. The limitation of the use of the tax credit for investments 4.0 and the simplification and strengthening of the Transition bonus 5.0.
  2. Confirmation for 2025 of the tax credit for investments in the single ZES, also for companies operating in the agricultural, fishing and aquaculture sectors.
  3. Recognition of a capital contribution for entities that have joined the procedure for repaying the tax credit for investments in research and development activities (so-called “fiscal amnesty”).
  4. Extension, until 2027, of the tax credit for the listing of SMEs.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Taxable period
The ordinary taxable period is equal to 12 months. Conformity with the calendar year is not requested. In particular cases, the duration of the taxable period can be different from 12 months (e.g. newly established companies may be allowed to have taxable periods of up to 18 months; companies that are involved in extraordinary transactions [merger, de-mergers, etc.], as well as companies that are liquidated, may have taxable periods shorter than 12 months).
## Tax returns
From 2024, as a general rule, IRES and IRAP returns must be filed by the end of the tenth month following the tax year-end (i.e. October 31 for calendar-year entities).
The filing deadline for the WHT agent return is October 31 of the following year.
## Payment of taxes
For IRES and IRAP purposes, the tax law provides for both advance payments and settlement payments. As a general rule, the advance payments are equal to the net tax liability for the previous tax period and are due during the tax period to which they refer. The advance payments due are equal to 100%.
Advance payments are split into two instalments:
  * 40% by the end of the sixth month following the tax year-end.
  * 60% by the end of the 11th month following the tax year-end.


For taxpayers subject to the so-called Synthetic Index of Tax Reliability, please refer to the next paragraph. The advance payments have to be split into two equal instalments.
Settlement payments are due by the end of the sixth month following the tax year-end to which they refer to.
Tax payments should be performed through a specific form to be electronically filed to the tax authorities (i.e. F24 form).
### Offsetting of taxes
Payables and receivables (not claimed for refund) resulting from a return regarding different taxes are allowed for off-setting within a yearly limit of EUR 2 million.
Furthermore, in order to offset tax credits exceeding EUR 5,000, a so-called ‘conformity mark’ affixed by a qualified professional on the related return is required. In addition, there is an obligation to channel the filing of the F24 form through the tax authorities system (so-called ‘ _Entratel’_) in case of offsetting tax liabilities with other tax credits.
No offsetting is allowed in case of unpaid taxes resulting from an official payment notice and exceeding EUR 1,500.
From July 1, 2024, a general prohibition on offsetting has been introduced in case of expired tax rolls or enforceable assessments in excess of EUR 100,000.
## Administrative penalties
### For the violations committed as of September 1, 2024
Failure to file a tax return results in a fixed penalty of 120% of the taxes due. Minimum penalties (ranging from EUR 250 to EUR 1,000) are applicable if no tax liability emerged in the return.
A tax return showing either a taxable income lower than the one assessed or a tax credit higher than those owed to the taxpayer (i.e. an untrue tax return) results in a fixed penalty of 70% of the higher taxes ultimately due.
Omitted and/or late payments of taxes, of whichever kind and nature, result in a penalty equal to 25% of the unpaid/late paid tax. However, in cases where the delay is within 15 days, the penalty is equal to 1% per day (up to 12.5%); if the delay is between 15 and 90 days, the penalty is equal to 12.5%.
### For the violations committed up until August 31, 2024
Failure to file a tax return results in a penalty ranging from 120% to 240% of the taxes due. Minimum penalties (ranging from EUR 250 to EUR 1,000) are applicable if no tax liability emerged in the return.
A tax return showing either a taxable income lower than the one assessed or a tax credit higher than those owed to the taxpayer (i.e. an untrue tax return) results in a penalty ranging from 90% to 180% of the higher taxes ultimately due.
Omitted and/or late payments of taxes, of whichever kind and nature, result in a penalty equal to 30% of the unpaid/late paid tax. However, in cases where the delay is within 15 days, the penalty is equal to 1% per day; if the delay is between 15 and 90 days, the penalty is equal to 15%.
### Self-disclosure
Self-disclosure of tax law breaches is allowed by the payment of the higher taxes and reduced administrative penalties (computed on the floor of the applicable range of penalties for the violations committed up until August 31, 2024)
The actual reduction of penalties depends on the time elapsed between the occurrence of the breach and the self-disclosure itself (i.e. different interim thresholds apply). The penalty is reduced from 1/10 if the correction is done within 30 days (for an omitted/lower tax payment only) up to1/4 (upper floor) if the correction is carried outafter the issue of a pre-assessment deed (). 
The starting of an audit does not prevent the possibility to amend tax returns or to carry out late tax payments. In any case, the possibility to apply the self-disclosure is prevented after the issuance of final notice of tax assessment (_i.e. avviso di accertamento_) or tax redetermination (_i.e. avviso di irregolarità_).
Special rules apply where similar violations are repeated over various years.
## Synthetic Index of Tax Reliability (the so-called ISA)
Starting from FY 2018, the so-called Sector Studies Assessment (i.e. special tax control procedures for those enterprises whose total turnover does not exceed EUR 7.5 million) has been replaced by a system of indexes to identify and reward reliable taxpayers (now applicable for the taxpayers which total turnover does not exceed EUR 5,164,569). 
In particular, the ISA represents an economic and statistical methodology to determine the level of the tax reliability of the taxpayers. A low level of reliability will increase the risk to be included in the list used by the tax authorities in order to select the taxpayers to be audited. 
### Advanced biannual agreement (i.e. _’concordato preventivo biennale_ ’)
Institution of the _’concordato preventivo biennale_ ‘ by Article 7 of Decree Law no. 13/2024 is an arrangement reserved for (i) taxpayers applying Synthetic Index of Tax Reliability (so-called ISA) and (ii) taxpayers under the flat-rate regime provided by Law no. 190/2014 (so-called ’ _forfettari_ ‘). This consists of the proposal by the Italian Revenue Agency of a forecast, for the following two-year period, of the income from business activity for IRES and IRAP purposes, in order to establish the taxes due in advance.
## Tax ruling
The tax ruling is an instance where the taxpayer directed a behaviour for tax purposes to the tax authority before implementing it; its scope is to seek clarification on the interpretation of a rule objectively uncertain, related to state taxes, to be applied to concrete and personal cases.
The procedure can also be started by non-resident taxpayers, by WHT agents, and by persons in charge of fulfilling the tax payments.
The tax authorities must admit to the procedure within 30 days from the receipt of the instance; however, tacit acceptance from the tax authorities applies. The procedure that involves a contradictory procedure between the tax authorities and the taxpayer ends within 180 days from the receipt of the instance.
The content of the instance could be on the transfer pricing, the application of rules to attribute profits and losses to a PE, the tax treatment of dividend, interest, royalties, or other incomes, etc.
In particular, for those enterprises that intend to make new investments in Italy for a value not lower than EUR 15 million, a ’ruling on new investments’ could be filed, disclosing tax treatment of the investment and all related extraordinary transactions. The tax authorities will be bound not to issue any deed inconsistent with the answers given.
The tax authorities’ answer must be notified within 120 days. The deadline can be extended for an additional 90 days if the tax authorities ask for new additional information.
## Tax Control Framework (TCF) and cooperative compliance regime
In order to promote cooperation between the tax administration and taxpayers, a cooperative compliance regime (so-called '_Adempimento Collaborativo_ ') has been introduced into the domestic tax system by means of Legislative Decree no. 128 of 5 August 2015.
With the approval of the Law no. 111/2023 for the reform of the tax system and with the enactment of the Legislative Decrees no. 221/2023 and no. 108/2024, additional certainty is granted to companies that intend to invest in transparency with the tax authorities under the cooperative compliance regime. In particular:
  * Assessment terms are significantly reduced.
  * Rewards are enhanced on the level of penalties for taxpayers who apply the regime, up to the disapplication of both the administrative penalties and the criminal penalties.


In detail, the following new changes have been introduced:
  * A progressive reduction of the access threshold: 
    * EUR 750 million (2024-2025).
    * EUR 500 million (2026-2027).
    * EUR 100 million (from 2028).
  * An extension to taxpayers who belong to the same group, provided that at least one subject in the group meets the size requirements and that the group adopts a certified integrated system of detection, measurement, management, and certified tax risk control.
  * The strengthening of the reward effects, such as: 
    * For significant tax risks communicated in a timely and exhaustive manner before the submission of the return or before the tax deadlines: 
      * Exclusion of administrative penalties and no liability for the crime of unfaithful return.
      * Reduction of assessment deadlines by two years with certified TCF.
      * Further reduction of one year in the assessment deadlines in case of obtaining tax certification (so-called ’strong‘ conformity mark).
    * Reduction of administrative penalties to 50% for tax risks included in the tax risk control matrix.
    * Exclusion of administrative penalties applied as well as no liability for the crime of unfaithful return for risks connected to conduct in tax periods prior to entry into the regime if communicated within 120 days of the admission provision.


To enjoy the above benefits, a TCF certification, issued by qualified professionals enrolled in the register of lawyers or chartered accountants and accounting experts, has been introduced.
For medium-sized taxpayers who do not meet the requirements to apply the regime at hand, but have implemented an effective integrated TCF by giving specific communication to the tax authorities (irrevocable two-year option) and communicated, via tax ruling, the tax risks in a preventive manner before submitting the return or before the tax deadlines, the following benefits are provided:
  * Exclusion of administrative penalties.
  * No liability for the crime of unfaithful return.


A Code of Conduct is introduced to define and regulate mutual commitments between the tax authorities and taxpayers.
Joining the cooperative compliance regime is also the first step for taking part in the International Compliance Assurance Programme (ICAP).
ICAP is a voluntary program for a multilateral co-operative risk assessment and assurance process, which gives comfort and assurance where tax administrations participating in an MNE’s risk assessment consider a covered risk to be low risk.
## Tax audit process
For larger companies having a yearly turnover exceeding specific thresholds (that are in the process of being progressively decreased to EUR 100 million), administrative checks on tax returns may be carried out within the year following that in which the tax return has been filed.
Tax audits can take place at the taxpayer’s premises as well as in the tax authorities’ offices. The statute of limitations provides that tax auditors can stay at a taxpayer’s premises for not longer than 60 working days (30 days ordinary term plus 30 days of extension). At the end of this period, the audit must come to an end. Tax auditors must take note of the observations and requests made by the taxpayer. At the end of their audit, the tax auditors must draw up a tax audit report whereby the outcome of the audit activity must be detailed and the findings (if any) must be illustrated and motivated. 
Should the taxpayer accept all the challenges raised by the tax auditors, it may take advantage of the application of reduced penalties. The reduced penalties are equal to 1/6 of the applied penalties.
In case the taxpayer decides not to accept the challenges by the tax auditors, a copy of the report has to be filed with the tax office.
The tax office receiving the tax audit report examines the findings reported by the tax auditors and starts the assessment procedure, which may lead to the issuing of a tax assessment notice bearing the request for payment of higher taxes and/or penalties.
## Tax controversy and dispute resolutions
Should the taxpayer accept all of the challenges raised by the tax authorities' tax assessment notice, it may take advantage of the application of reduced penalties. The reduced penalties are equal to 1/3 of the applied penalties.
Should the taxpayer decide not to accept the challenges by the tax authorities, a settlement procedure can be initiated. The favourable outcome of the settlement procedure brings forth the agreed-upon reduction of challenged taxes and the reduction of penalties. The reduced penalties are equal to 1/3 of the applied penalties.
In case no settlement is either achieved or requested for, the taxpayer may start a tax dispute before the Court. The judicial proceedings are structured in three tiers:
  * Tax Court in first instance.
  * Tax Court in second instance.
  * Supreme Court of Cassation.


The settlement can be reached also during the judicial proceeding. The favourable outcome of the judicial settlement procedure brings forth the agreed-upon reduction of challenged taxes and the reduction of penalties. The reduced penalties are equal to 40% if the settlement is reached during the first instance, 50% if the settlement is reached during the second instance, and 60% if the settlement is reached during the Supreme Court instance.
## Statute of limitations
The Italian tax authorities are entitled to make an assessment in relation to corporate taxes (IRES and IRAP), VAT, and WHT returns up to:
  * the end of the fifth calendar year following the year in which the tax return was filed (previously up to the end of the fourth calendar year), or
  * the end of the seventh calendar year following the year in which the tax return would have been filed, for an omitted return (previously up to the end of the fifth calendar year).


Due to the COVID-19 emergency, the deadlines for tax periods 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 will be extended by 85 days.
Different rules were applicable until FY 2015.
The possibility to file an integrative tax return in favour of taxpayers within the deadlines of tax assessment has been introduced (e.g. FY 2018 tax return is amendable in favour of the taxpayer until FY 2024, FY 2019 tax return is amendable in favour of the taxpayer until FY 2025).
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Extraordinary transactions (such as mergers, de-mergers, etc.) continue to be a topic of focus for tax authorities due to the potential applicability of tax anti-abuse rules.
As a response to recent cases of carousel-frauds on VAT, cross-border transactions are being more heavily scrutinised.
Over the last few years, we experienced an increasing focus by the tax authorities on transfer pricing and PE-related issues.
The beneficial ownership condition is very carefully scrutinised in case of payments where a nil or reduced WHT is applied based on EU Directive or applicable DTT, in particular when the ultimate owner of the group is non-EU.
The tax authorities will also focus on intercepting the improper utilisation of contributions and tax credits intended to cope with the economic crisis caused by the epidemiological emergency from COVID-19.
## Tax offences and the entity’s criminal liability: The rules as per Decree 231/2001
With the Fiscal Decree linked to the Budget Law (Decree Law no. 123, converted into Law no. 157 of 2019 on 'Urgent provisions on tax matters and urgent matters that cannot be postponed'), a significant part of the tax crimes, attributable to tax fraud, entered the catalogue of offences for the liability of entities for administrative offences, governed by Legislative Decree no. 231 of 2001 (Decree 231/2001).
Article 39(2) of the fiscal Decree has amended decree 231/2001 by inserting under article 25-quinquiesdecies (sources of administrative criminal liability) the following tax fraud crimes, which are included in Legislative Decree no. 74 of 2000 (Decree 74/2000):
  * Fraudulent tax returns, through the use of invoices or other documents for non-existent transactions (Article 2(1) and (2), Decree 74/2000).
  * Fraudulent tax returns, by means of other artifices (Article 3, Decree 74/2000).
  * Issuing invoices or other documents for non-existent transactions (Article 8(1) and (2a), Decree 74/2000).
  * Concealing or destroying accounting documents (Article 10, Decree 74/2000).
  * Fraudulent deduction from the payment of taxes (Article 11, Decree 74/2000).


Further legislative changes occurred as a result of Legislative Decree no. 75 of 2020 (implementing Directive (EU) 2017/1371, better known as the 'PIF Directive'), which expanded the category of tax offences provided for in Article 25 quinquiesdecies of Legislative Decree 231 of 2001 with the following types of offence:
  * Unfaithful declaration (Article 4, Decree 74/2000).
  * Omitted declaration (Article 5, Decree 74/2000).
  * Undue compensation (Article 10c, Decree 74/2000).


The same Legislative Decree no. 75 of 2020 provides that the offences listed above are relevant to the administrative liability of the entity if they are committed as part of cross-border fraudulent schemes and for the purpose of evading VAT for a total amount of not less than EUR 10 million.
The last relevant amendment was made by Legislative Decree no. 156 of 4 October 2022.
Particularly, the amendment provides that if the conduct is carried out for the purpose of evading VAT in the context of cross-border fraudulent schemes, connected to the territory of at least one other member state of the European Union, from which overall damage equal to or exceeding EUR 10 million results or is likely to result (so far there are no differences), the offence provided for in Article 4 is punishable as an attempt. Apart from cases of complicity in the offence referred to in Article 8, the offences provided for in Articles 2 and 3 are punishable as attempted offences, when the same conditions set out in the first sentence are met.
It is therefore necessary to update the Organisation, Management, and Control Model (MOGC) to include the tax risks associated with the types of tax offences included in 'catalogue 231'. Procedures must be mapped in the MOGC in order to define roles, responsibilities, principles of conduct, operating procedures, as well as the criteria of conduct that individuals must uphold in order to prevent the commission of tax fraud offences.
The sanctions applicable to the entities, in relation to the commission of the offences, may be both pecuniary and interdictory. Pecuniary sanctions range from a minimum of 400 to a maximum of 500 quotas, with a possible increase of one third in the event of a significant profit obtained by the entity as a result of the commission of tax fraud. Considering the current value of the quotas, the maximum financial penalty applicable to the entity for a tax offence may reach up to EUR 1,032,667.
Interdictory sanctions with a considerable impact may also be imposed. Interdictory sanctions may even be applied as a precautionary measure, including a prohibition on contracting with the public administration and a prohibition on advertising goods or services, as well as confiscation and seizure of the profits accumulated from the tax offence.
## Mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation in relation to reportable cross-border arrangements (the so-called 'DAC 6')
The EU 'DAC 6' Directive, adopted by the Council of the EU on 25 May 2018 and entered into force on 25 June 2018, introduces new rules at a European level regarding the mandatory automatic exchange of information in the tax sector.
In particular, DAC 6 requires intermediaries and taxpayers to promptly communicate to the tax authorities of the member state of tax residence, establishment, or in which they operate, the 'cross-border arrangements subject to the reporting obligation' ('Reportable Cross Border Arrangement' or RCBA), when certain conditions are met.
In this regard, from an objective point of view, two elements are relevant:
  * the presence of a cross-border element and
  * the presence of at least one of the hallmarks in the arrangement, so that it is considered to be 'subject to the reporting obligation' (such hallmarks are listed in the Annex IV of DAC 6).


Each person, in the role of an intermediary or a relevant taxpayer, with respect to DAC 6 can assume the obligation to report the arrangements that have an impact on its tax position or on its client’s taxation or on the correct application of Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and anti-money laundering (AML) procedures. As a result, DAC 6 requires the prompt interception of potential RCBAs and to proceed with their analysis and, if necessary, report to the revenue agency.
The reporting obligations were scheduled to enter into force as from 1 July 2020 and intermediaries and taxpayers would have 30 days to comply with the reporting obligations.
The tax authorities of the EU member states, on a quarterly basis, will exchange among themselves the information submitted by intermediaries and taxpayers in order to promptly intercept aggressive tax planning schemes and neutralise the distorting effects that they produce on the EU market.
In Italy, the implementation of DAC 6 rules is basically aligned with the EU minimum standard, with the main possible deviation linked to the hallmarks and the relevance for the application of the main benefit test, which considers the taxes due by a taxpayer with a link with Italy (residence, presence of a PE, income sourced in Italy, or economic activity carried out in Italy).

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
From the fiscal year following the one in progress on 29 December 2023 and from 2024 for entities with a tax period coinciding with the calendar year, the criteria according to which tax residence is recognised on the basis of the principal business activity has been eliminated.
From that time, companies and entities are deemed to be resident in Italy if they have in the territory of the state, for the greater part of the tax period, at least one of the following:
  * The legal office.
  * The place of effective management, which is the place where the company’s strategic decisions are made.
  * Their principal place of ordinary management, which is the place where acts of day-by-day management are carried out.


A foreign company holding one or more Italian subsidiaries is deemed to be resident in Italy for tax purposes if at least one of the following conditions exists:
  * The foreign company is, either directly or indirectly, held by Italian tax resident persons.
  * The board of directors of the foreign company is made up mainly of Italian resident individuals.


Non-resident companies are subject to IRES and IRAP only on their Italian-source income. Specifically, Italian non-resident companies having a PE in Italy are subject to IRES and IRAP with respect to the taxable income generated from the PE in Italy.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The domestic definition of PE is substantially aligned with the OECD model.
## Corporate residence of a trust
Trusts are considered as persons subject to corporate taxation.
Residence is defined on the basis of the location of the place of effective management or the place of ordinary management. In the absence of any such structure, trusts managed by a trustee will be deemed as tax resident in Italy if the trustee is tax resident in Italy; in case of more than one trustee, a case-by-case analysis shall be conducted in accordance to specific guidelines.
In addition, trusts that have the largest part of their assets located in Italy (e.g. real properties or real rights) are deemed to be tax resident in Italy; nevertheless, in case the assets are composed of financial activities, an _ad hoc analysis_ is required to define the place of effective course of business, being irrelevant the residency of the trustee(s).
Note that there are anti-avoidance rules for Italian non-resident trusts, setting out the specific conditions on which these trusts can become Italian tax resident.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
_The principles outlined in the section on also apply for deductible costs_.
## **Additional deduction for labor costs**
The additional deduction for labor costs has been extended also for Fiscal Years (FYs) 2025, 2026, and 2027. Previously the deduction was granted for FY 2024 only.
Under CIT purposes, the additional deduction is equal to 20% of the cost of newly hired personnel under a permanent employment contract. An additional deduction of 10% is granted for hiring “disadvantaged” workers who fall within certain categories.
## Depreciation and amortisation
All fixed assets that are used in the business of the company, except land, are depreciable for tax purposes (for both IRES and IRAP).
For IRES, the maximum depreciation rates for fixed tangible assets are set forth in a Ministerial Decree. Such depreciation rates are different depending on the type of asset and on the economic sector in which the company operates. In the event that financial accounting depreciation exceeds the amounts allowed for tax purposes, temporary differences arise. Tax depreciation of fixed tangible assets is allowed from the tax period in which the asset is first used. In the first tax depreciation period, the depreciation rate cannot exceed one-half of the normal rates.
From FY 2023 up to FY 2027 the amortisation of instrumental plants for large retail enterprises has been extended from 3% to 6%.
An additional increased IRES depreciation, the so-called 'super/hyper depreciation', was in force until FY 2019 to incentivize the acquisition of capital tangible and intangible assets used for business purposes. From the fiscal year starting on January 1, 2020, the purchases of new tangible and intangible assets may benefit from a tax credit (_see the_ _section_) instead of the above-mentioned increased tax deprecation.
Land is not a depreciable asset. Amortisation of goodwill derived from an asset deal and amortisation of trademarks are deductible for an amount not exceeding 1/18 of the cost in any year.
Patents, know-how, and other intellectual property (IP) may be amortised over a two-year period. Concession rights may be depreciated with reference to the utilisation period as determined either by law or in the relevant agreement.
For IRAP purposes only, depreciation and amortisation (other than as related to goodwill and trademarks) are deductible in accordance with the amounts reported in the financial statements, regardless of the limits outlined above.
## Finance leasing
Leasing expenses booked in the profit and loss statement pursuant to Italian GAAP are fully deductible from the IRES taxable base if the relevant agreement has a minimum duration period. In particular, if the agreement was executed as of 1 January 2014, the duration required is the following:
  * For fixed tangible assets, at least half of the depreciation period as set forth in the above Ministerial Decree.
  * For real estate, at least 12 years.


Longer minimum duration periods are provided for financial leasing agreements executed before 1 January 2014.
For IFRS adopters, the lease accounting of IFRS 16 is relevant for corporate income tax (CIT) purposes pursuant to the enhanced derivation principle (_see Adoption of IFRS and taxation in the section_).
## Interest expense
Generally, interest expense is fully tax deductible up to the amount of interest income. Thereafter, excess interest expense is deductible at up to 30% of the gross EBITDA (interest deduction capacity) relevant for tax purposes (before 2019, reference had to be made to EBITDA as reported in the financial statements). Gross operating margin is defined as the difference between operating revenues and expenses excluding depreciation of tangible and intangible assets and charges for leased assets based on their tax value.
Net interest expense in excess of the yearly limitation is carried forward in the following fiscal years. Hence, net interest expense not deducted in previous years can be deducted in the future fiscal years as long as total interest in that year does not exceed 30% of gross operating margin. If net interest expense is lower than the annual limit (i.e. 30% of gross operating margin), this difference can be carried over to increase the company’s interest deduction capacity in the future five years.
Starting from 2019, interest income exceeding interest expenses can be carried forward to offset future interest expenses in any following FYs.
Dividends received from foreign subsidiaries are excluded in the computation of the EBITDA used to determine the interest expense deductibility limit (prior to FY 2017, these dividends were included).
Where an election is made for the domestic tax consolidation regime (_as discussed in the section_), the net interest expense limitation applies to the consolidated tax group. As a consequence, if a company participating in a tax group has an excess interest deduction capacity, this excess may be used against the interest deduction deficit in another company belonging to the same tax consolidation group. 
The above-mentioned rules are not applicable for financial institutions, such as banks and insurance companies, where the deductibility of interest expense (for both IRES and IRAP purposes) is fully admitted. For SGR and SIM, the deductibility of interest expense is limited to a fixed amount of 96% of the interest expense shown in the income statement of these entities.
The tax authorities have provided guidelines regarding leveraged buyout (LBO) operations. The latter shall be considered, in general, legitimate, and interests arising from related acquisition financing shall be considered, in principle, deductible within the ordinary limits (30% of EBITDA, transfer pricing rules, etc.). It is advisable to seek _ad hoc_ advice before implementing LBO operations.
## Bad debts
Yearly provision for bad debts not guaranteed by third parties and relating to sales of goods and services is tax deductible at up to 0.5% of the receivables gross value. Deduction shall no longer be permitted when the total amount of the bad debts reserve exceeds 5% of the above-mentioned gross value of the receivables as of the end of the fiscal year.
Regardless of the above, losses on bad debts shall be deductible if supported by precise and objective elements or, in any case, if the debtor is subject to bankruptcy proceedings, including foreign ones.
Specific rules apply to small credits. In particular, a loss on a bad debt can be deducted for IRES purposes when the following conditions jointly apply:
  * The term for payment has elapsed by six months.
  * The receivable has a determined threshold. In particular, the item is up to EUR 2,500 for small companies and up to EUR 5,000 for big corporations (with turnover over EUR 100 million).


The loss is tax deductible, regardless of the amount, when the collection right is prescribed.
Moreover, losses are tax deductible in case of derecognition of bad debts applied in compliance with accounting standards (both Italian GAAP and IFRS), always provided the inherence test is met.
## Charitable contributions
Deduction of charitable contributions is allowed. The amounts allowed for deductions depend on the specific features of the recipient entity, and specific limitations are set by the law.
## Entertainment expenses
For IRES purposes, expenses for gifts and entertainment that meet the requirements (both qualitative and quantitative) contained in the specific Ministerial Decree are fully deductible in the tax period in which they are incurred. Entertainment expenses that do not meet these requirements cannot be deducted.
Expenses related to gifts with a value of EUR 50 or less are entirely deductible.
From the fiscal year subsequent the one in progress on December 31, 2024 (i.e. FY 2025 for entities with calendar fiscal year) payments and the related reimbursements of aforementioned costs must be made electronically (for example bank or postal transfer, debit, credit and prepaid cards, bank and cashier's checks) to be deductible for CIT, Regional Production Tax, and Individual tax purposes.
## Meals and lodging expenses
For IRES purposes, the deduction for meals and lodging expenses incurred within the municipality is limited to 75% of the amount incurred. However, the VAT related to such costs is fully recoverable.
From the fiscal year subsequent the one in progress on December 31, 2024 (i.e. FY 2025 for entities with calendar fiscal year) payments and the related reimbursements of aforementioned costs must be made electronically (for example bank or postal transfer, debit, credit and prepaid cards, bank and cashier's checks) to be deductible for CIT, Regional Production Tax, and Individual tax purposes.
## Car costs
The IRES deductibility of expenses related to cars used by companies is as follows:
  * 20% for cars that are not assigned to employees or are granted to employees solely for business use.
  * 70% for cars granted to employees for both business and private purposes.


Car costs may be entirely deducted if (i) automobiles are absolutely necessary for the company’s business or (ii) automobiles are an essential element in the company’s activity (i.e. vehicles owned by a car rental company).
## Telephone expenses
For IRES purposes, up to 80% of the total expenses related to both mobile and landline telephones are deductible.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are generally not considered inherent costs and are, consequently, not deductible for tax purposes.
## Taxes
The following IRAP items are deductible in determining the IRES taxable base:
  * 10% of IRAP paid during the year.
  * An amount determined on the IRAP paid on the cost of employees, net of relevant deductions.


IMU is deductible for IRES purposes up to 100% of the amount paid in FY 2022 and in the following fiscal years. Previously, it was deductible up to 50% of the amount paid in FY 2019 and 60% of the amount paid in FY 2020 and FY 2021.
## Net operating losses
Tax losses can be carried forward for IRES purposes and used to offset income in the following tax periods without any time limitation.
Tax losses can only be offset with taxable income for an amount not exceeding 80% of the taxable income. Thus, corporations are required to pay IRES on at least 20% of taxable income.
Note that losses arising in the first three years of activity can be offset with 100% of taxable income.
For IRAP purposes, tax losses may not be carried forward.
Specific (tax anti-avoidance) rules limit the carryforward of tax losses in the event of:
  * change of control and
  * an effective change of the main activity (performed by the company carrying forward the losses).


The Legislative Decree 192/2024 has revised the conditions and limits in case of change of control and change of actual business purposes. 
The vitality condition based on the number of employees has been removed. The "fair value of the net equity" (instead of the book value, as provided in the past) limit has been identified for the carryforward of "non-intragroup" NOLs. For intragroup transactions, the carryforward loss limits do not apply. 
The new provision is effective for transactions implemented in the FY 2024.Transitional regime applies for the tax assets acquired up to the tax period ending on December 31, 2023.The aforementioned changes must occur together in order for the limitations to be applicable. The change of the main activity is relevant for these purposes if it takes place in the tax period in which the change of control occurs or in the two subsequent or preceding periods.
Specific anti-abuse provisions are also applicable to net operating losses in cases of merger or de-merger.
In Italy, tax losses may not be carried back.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Transactions with foreign affiliated companies should be at ‘fair market value’ and, generally, as defined by OECD Guidelines. _See Transfer pricing in the section for more information_.
## Deduction of costs suffered for transactions with non-cooperative jurisdictions
Expenses borne for transactions with entities resident or located in non-cooperative tax jurisdictions are deductible for CIT purposes within the limit of their fair market value, unless actual evidence of their economic soundness and effective execution is provided to the tax authorities. Notwithstanding all the above, a proper disclosure of such transactions is to be provided in the tax return. Penalties for omitted disclosure are introduced. Corporations applying the cooperative compliance regime can define in advance with tax authorities the fair market value for the transactions at hand.
## Allowance for corporate equity (ACE) deduction
As from the fiscal year subsequent the one in progress on December 31, 2023 (i.e. FY 2024 for entities with calendar fiscal year), the **ACE is repealed**. Nevertheless, the use of any excess credits from the previous fiscal year is permitted until they are fully utilised.
ACE was a deduction equal to the net increase in the equity employed multiplied by a rate determined each year. This rate was equal to 1.3% from FY 2019.
The relevant increase was determined by the equity contributions and by the retained earnings (except profits allocated to a non-disposable reserve) less the following items:
  * Reductions of the net equity with assignment to shareholders, including, in particular, dividend distributions.
  * Investments in controlled companies.
  * Certain intra-group business acquisitions and transactions.


If the allowance for a year was higher than the net IRES taxable base, the difference would have been carried forward to the next fiscal period.
To calculate the equity increase, the reference equity was the one disclosed in the Financial Statements for the fiscal year current at 31 December 2010, net of the profits for the same year.
Specific ACE anti-avoidance rules, in order to exclude duplicates of ACE benefit within a group of companies, apply. ACE anti-avoidance inter-company transactions had to be carefully monitored.
Legislative Decree no. 34/2024 changed the regulation of Super-ACE credits. As of the Decree's entry into force (February 2024), Super-ACE credits can only be sold once. This also applies to credits already sold, prior to the entry into force of the law.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Domestic tax consolidation
Companies belonging to the same group can elect for domestic tax consolidation. This regime allows the determination of a single IRES taxable base comprised of the taxable income and losses of each of the participating entities. The tax consolidation does not operate for IRAP purposes.
Where an overall tax loss position arises, this can be carried forward and used against future consolidated taxable income. Conversely, tax losses arising in fiscal years preceding the domestic tax consolidation election can be carried forward and used only by the company to which these losses belong.
The taxable basis determined by each company participating in the tax consolidation arrangement is included in its entirety. No apportionment is made in relation to the percentage of control.
In order to validly elect the Italian domestic tax consolidation regime, the following conditions must be met:
  * The consolidating entity must be an Italian tax resident company, and it must hold, directly or indirectly, more than the 50% of the share capital of the consolidated entities (so called ‘legal control’).
  * This control must be in place from the beginning of the tax period for which the tax consolidation is applied for.
  * All of the companies participating in the group must have the same year-end.


The consolidation arrangement operates on an elective basis. Taxpayers may select whether to be included or not, and it is not necessary for all the Italian group/sub-group companies to jointly elect for the tax consolidation.
Once the election is made, it cannot be revoked until three fiscal years have passed.
The election is also allowed to Italian 'sister' companies or PEs in Italy of foreign companies resident in EU/EEA countries with which Italy has entered into an agreement that ensures an effective exchange of information. An Italian entity should be designated to exercise the option, acting as a consolidating entity.
The election is silently renewed at the end of the three-year period.
## Worldwide tax consolidation group
A worldwide tax consolidation group is available, allowing the consolidation of foreign subsidiaries.
In addition to the requirements set out for the domestic tax group system, the following conditions apply:
  * The ultimate parent company must be either owned by individuals who are tax residents of Italy or listed on the Italian Stock Exchange.
  * The option must be exercised for all foreign companies (under the ‘all in, all out’ principle).


Income for each company is apportioned in the tax consolidation based on the actual percentage of control exercised by the ultimate parent company that is an Italian tax resident.
A number of additional requirements need to be fulfilled in order for a worldwide tax consolidation to be operative, including a mandatory audit of the financial statements of all the foreign subsidiaries.
Once the election is made, it cannot be rescinded for five fiscal years. The option is silently renewed at the end of the related period.
## Transfer pricing
Income derived from operations with non-resident corporations that directly or indirectly control the Italian entity, are controlled by the Italian entity, or are controlled by the same corporation controlling the Italian entity have to be valued on the basis of the arm’s-length nature of the goods transferred, services rendered, and services and goods received if an increase in taxable income is derived there from. Possible reductions in taxable income as a result of the arm’s-length principle are allowed:
  * on the basis of mutual agreement procedures or the EU Arbitration Convention
  * on the conclusion of tax audits performed under international cooperation procedures, where the results are agreed by the tax authorities involved, or
  * through a specific application filed by an Italian taxpayer where a final adjustment has been made in a country that has a double tax treaty (DTT) in place with Italy that allows an acceptable level of information exchange.


Statutory rules on transfer pricing are set out in Article 110, paragraph 7, of the Italian Income Tax Code (TUIR), which has been amended, making specific reference to the arm’s-length principle. Before this amendment, the Italian Transfer Pricing Law used the concept of ‘normal value’ (_valore normale_) as the basis for pricing inter-company transactions. This concept was similar to the OECD arm’s-length principle, although not precisely the same and potentially open to various interpretations. The new definition formally endorses the OECD standard by providing that inter-company transactions are determined based on the ‘conditions and prices that would have been agreed in comparable circumstances between independent parties acting at arm’s length’.
Furthermore, on 14 May 2018, the Italian Ministry of Finance published a Decree providing key principles to assist implementation of the provisions contained in the revised wording of TUIR, aligning Italian transfer pricing rules with international standards, taking into account the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project and the 2017 OECD Guidelines. The Decree addresses only points of principles, while the Regulation issued by the Italian Revenue Agency on 23 November 2020 (‘ _Provvedimento del Direttore dell’Agenzia delle Entrate_ ’, prot. 2020/360494) and the subsequent Circular Letter No. 15/E published by the Italian Revenue Agency on 26 November 2021 include operational and procedural guidance.
### Penalty protection regime with transfer pricing documentation support
Transfer pricing rules provide for a penalty protection regime in case of transfer pricing audit, provided that the taxpayer has prepared proper documentation detailing the compliance of inter-company transactions with the arm's-length principle.
The Regulation issued by the Italian Revenue Agency on 23 November 2020, as provided for in Article 8 of the Ministerial Decree dated 14 May 2018, introduces significant and substantial changes to the rules related to the 'proper' transfer pricing documentation that shall be prepared in order to support the arm’s-length nature of the inter-company transactions, according to the Article 110, paragraph 7, of the Italian Income Tax Code, and establishes the new requirements for accessing the penalty protection regime.  Clarifications in this regard are provided in the Circular Letter No. 15/E published by the Italian Revenue Agency on 26 November 2021.
The Regulation applies to transactions incurred between Italian entities and non-resident entities belonging to the same group (transfer pricing rules are not applicable to domestic transactions). No specific methods have been introduced to test the arm’s-length nature of transactions; reference is made to the OECD Guidelines and to the Decree of 14 May 2018, which is in line with OECD recommendations. An exception exists for corporations involved in on-line advertising and related ancillary activities that are required not to use cost-based indicators for transfer pricing purposes, unless an advance pricing agreement (APA) has been defined with the tax authorities on this.
Based on the transfer pricing Regulation, taxpayers can obtain penalty protection if they provide the Italian tax authorities with:
  * Local File and Master File drawn up in the specific format detailed in the Regulation and in Italian language. However, the Master File can be presented in English language, as well as the information in annexes (i.e. inter-company contracts, existing unilateral and bilateral/multilateral APAs, and other tax rulings to which the local tax jurisdiction is not a party and which are related to controlled transactions described in the Local File).
  * Notification that the transfer pricing documentation has been prepared and available by checking the specific box in the annual CIT return.
  * Electronic signature of the legal representative of the company (or their delegate) and timestamp to be applied to the entire transfer pricing documentation package by the filing of the annual CIT return.


The documentation can be prepared only with reference to some of the inter-company transactions (cherry picking); in such a case, the penalty protection regime is applicable with exclusive reference to the covered operations.
In order to apply the simplified approach for the so-called ‘low value adding services’, specific information must be provided in the Local File for penalty protection purposes, which has to include (i) a description of the inter-company services, (ii) related inter-company services agreements, and (iii) supporting files through which such transactions are computed.
Documentation must be provided to the tax authority upon request, within 20 days, in the electronic format.
Transfer pricing documentation must be prepared each year on a company-by-company basis. Small and medium companies (defined as those with an annual turnover of less than EUR 50 million; the turnover must be computed considering also the revenues of directly or indirectly controlling or controlled entities) can update the economic analysis only every three years, provided that the comparability analysis is based on publicly available sources and no significant change between the fiscal years have occurred. Otherwise, it is necessary to update the economic analysis each year. All the other sections of the report have to be updated each year, even for small and medium companies.
Relief from penalties is granted for both IRES and IRAP applicable to transfer pricing adjustments to taxpayers who have prepared transfer pricing documentation in line with Italian Regulation.
### Advance pricing agreements (APAs)
According to Article 31-ter (titled 'Advance agreements with businesses with an international activity') of the Presidential Decree no. 600 dated 29 September 1973, the Italian Tax Assessment code, taxpayers may apply for an APA procedure. It is possible to obtain bilateral and multilateral APAs where a double taxation agreement has been concluded by Italy and the partner states based on article 25, paragraph 3 of the OECD Model Convention. The procedure is available for companies engaged in 'international activity' and can cover transfer pricing issues, allocation of profit to PEs, dividends, the existence or otherwise of an Italian PE, royalties, and interest. In 2015, the scope of the APA was extended to also cover the entry and exit values of assets and liabilities on change of corporate tax residence.
The agreement executed between the tax authorities and the taxpayer is binding for the fiscal year during which the agreement is executed and for the following four fiscal years and can then subsequently be renewed.
Rollback provisions are available as follows:
  * For unilateral APAs, rollback is permitted for fiscal years still subject to tax audits, provided that no changes occurred to the agreed conditions and circumstances and no inspections or tax audit or administrative activities started.
  * For non-unilateral APAs, rollback is permitted as of the fiscal year during which the APA request was filed with the tax authorities. However, rollback is allowed also to previous fiscal years, still subject to tax audit, provided that: 
    * the same factual and legal circumstances exist for these periods on the basis of the agreement stipulated with the competent authorities of foreign countries
    * the taxpayer has requested the roll back in the APA request
    * the competent authorities of foreign countries agree to extend the agreement to previous years, and
    * no inspections or tax audits or administrative activities started in relation to these fiscal years.


## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
CbC reporting has been introduced in Italy for multinational enterprise (MNE) groups with consolidated group revenues of at least EUR 750 million. With this report, any MNE group shall disclose annually and for each tax jurisdiction in which it conducts business the information set out therein.
The template of the CbC report includes:
  * aggregate tax jurisdiction-wide information relating to the global allocation of the income, the taxes paid, and certain indicators of the location of economic activity among tax jurisdictions in which the MNE group operates (Table 1)
  * a listing of all the relevant entities for which financial information is reported, including their jurisdiction of tax residence and incorporation (if different) and their main business activity (Table 2), and
  * additional information that may be useful to understand the mandatory information provided in the CbC report (Table 3).


The group entity responsible for the submission of the CbC report is the ultimate parent entity. However, where some conditions are met, the report shall be submitted by the entities resident in Italy for tax purposes.
The legislative Decree no. 214/2024 has been recently approved by the Italian Government and implements the EU Directive 2021/2101. The public CbCr applies to financial statement starting from the fiscal year beginning from June 22, 2024 and it envisages the publishment of a specific relation to the business’s website and the filing at the Company Register. Administrative penalties between EUR 10,000 and EUR 50,000 are imposed to the Director if the report is not filed. The above standard penalties are halved if the CbCR is not published on time and they are doubled if some relevant information is not true, or if some information required by the decree is omitted.
The CbC report shall be filed within 12 months of the last day of the reporting fiscal year of the MNE group. Moreover, the deadline for the notification of the CbC status to the Italian tax authorities is within the deadline for the submission of the income tax return.
## Thin capitalisation
Italy no longer has thin capitalisation rules _per se_. Instead, net interest expense is deductible only up to an amount equal to 30% of gross operating margin (_see Interest expense in the section for more information_).
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
An Italian company that controls, either directly or indirectly, a foreign enterprise, company, or other entity is required to consolidate the taxable income arising in proportion to the percentage of shareholding held, irrespective of whether the profits have been distributed or not.
Income from CFCs is taxed separately from the other taxable income of the business at the standard IRES rate (i.e. other tax losses cannot be used to offset CFC income). Foreign taxes paid by the CFCs are recoverable by way of a corresponding tax credit.
Dividends received by an Italian shareholder from a CFC are excluded from taxable income up to the amount of the taxable income attributed under the above CFC provisions. The excess of any dividends over income already included through the CFC regime is fully taxable in the hands of the shareholder.
Exemption from CFC rules can be achieved by means of an advance ruling from the Italian tax authorities showing that the CFC entity carries on a substantive economic activity by using employees, equipment, assets, and premises.
The CFC rules apply to controlled companies that jointly meet the following conditions:
  * The effective tax rate (ETR) is less than 50% of the effective tax rate that such companies would apply if they were resident in Italy.
  * More than 1/3 of the revenues derive from passive income including those deriving from trading goods and supplying services to associated enterprises with no or low economic value.


With the Legislative Decree n. 209/2023, the Italian law on CFCs has been modified to align the ETR test with Pillar 2 rules. Such modifications come into effect as from FY 2024. This new law establishes that where a foreign controlled entity has audited and certified financial statements, then the ETR test for CFC reasons may be simplified by assessing if there is a relevant threshold of 15% effective taxation, below which the test is not deemed to be satisfied. The update in the legislation also grants the parent company a three-year irrevocable option to pay a substitute income tax equal to 15% of the net accounting profit of the financial year computed disregarding the taxes that contributed to that value, the depreciation of assets, and provisions for risks with respect of all its CFCs. The three-year option is tacitly renewed upon termination, unless expressly revoked beforehand by the parent company.
In the absence of audited financial statements, the current criteria for computing the ETR remains applicable and the parent company is not allowed to opt for the payment of the 15% substitute tax.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
The tax regime for PEs is the same as for corporate Italian entities (e.g. joint-stock companies). Accordingly, a PE is subject to IRES as well as to IRAP. Both taxes are determined on the basis of a specific statutory account prepared according to the accounting principles applying to resident enterprises with similar business activity carried out by the PE.
Transfer pricing principles apply to ‘transactions’ between the head office and its Italian PE. A PE is considered a functionally separate entity, independent from its headquarters, and a PE’s profits and ‘free capital’ are attributed to it on the basis of OECD principles.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
In February 2023, the Council of Ministers gave the green light for the creation of a new 'incentives code' in order to block the extreme fragmentation of current incentive policies and achieve full efficiency of measures for businesses. The Ministry of Enterprise and Made in Italy (MIMIT) will have to adopt the delegated decrees within 24 months (December 2024).
The Reform is connected to the 2023-2025 Budget Law in line with the indications of the Economic and Financial Document and with the Recovery and Resilience Plan (RRP) and also includes among the objectives the simplification of the rules on investment and measures to facilitate the development of South Italy. In fact, the revision of incentives is a necessary step also for the promotion of Italian industrial policy, which requires at national level a greater efficiency of the measures available for companies as well as an orientation towards global challenges such as the green and digital transition.
## Foreign tax credit
Where foreign-source income definitively is taxed abroad, a tax credit can be claimed for use against a company’s IRES liability. The amount of the tax credit that can be claimed is the lower of the foreign tax incurred and the proportion of the IRES liability related to the foreign-source income. For partially exempt income (e.g. dividends), the foreign tax credit is reduced in proportion to the amount of the income taxable in Italy.
If an Italian company receives foreign income from more than one country, this limitation is applied separately to each country.
Foreign taxes borne by the foreign PE of an Italian resident company are allowed to be offset against the overall consolidated tax liability (IRES).
Any excess of foreign tax credit over the maximum amount allowed for recovery in the same tax period can be carried back or carried forward for eight years and recovered if specific conditions are met (e.g. same source country of the income, occurring because of an excess of the IRES liability related to the foreign-source income).
## Introduction of the reshoring exemption
As part of the policies aimed at so-called ‘reshoring’, art. 6 of Legislative Decree 209/2023 introduces into national law a tax relief aimed at encouraging the repatriation, within the territory of the Italian state, of business carried out in foreign countries not belonging to the European Union and/or the Economic Area European, including artistic and professional activities carried out in an associated form.
In detail, in the tax period in which the reshoring takes place and in the five subsequent tax periods, a 50% exemption for IRES and IRAP purposes is granted for income deriving from the repatriated assets and activities. For the determination of eligible income, the taxpayer is required to maintain separate evidence, from an accounting point of view, to allow verification of the correct determination of the income and the value of net production taxable for IRAP purposes.
To prevent any undue exploitation of the tax relief, activities carried out in the territory of the state in the 24 months preceding their reshoring are excluded from access to the relief. Furthermore, a monitoring period of five tax periods following that of reshoring of the assets and activities is envisaged (ten periods in case of large companies) in the event that the beneficiary will transfer outside the territory of the state, even if only partially, the activities subject to the tax exemption. In this case, the recapture mechanism is applied by the tax administration, including both unpaid taxes and the related interests.
## Tax credit for investments in new capital assets
Tangible assets '4.0'
For enterprises that invest in new tangible assets included in Annex A of Law n. 232/2016 (so called 'assets 4.0') different benefit rates are provided based on the tax period in which the investment is realised and based on the acquisition cost.
If such investments are made between January 1, 2023 and December 31, 2025, or by June 30, 2026, provided that by December 31, 2025 the purchasing order is accepted by the seller and the buyer paid an instalment of at least 20% of the purchasing cost, the tax credit is recognised in the following measures:
  * 20% of the cost for investments up to EUR 2.5 million.
  * 10% of the cost for investments between EUR 2.5 million and EUR 10 million.
  * 5% of the cost for investments between EUR 10 million and EUR 20 million.


The above-mentioned threshold applies for each fiscal year in the period 2023 through 2025.
Only for investments made in FY 2025, it is introduced a national budget limit equal to 2,2 billion euro. In order to obtain the tax credit, taxpayers must file specific communications to the competent authorities.
### Intangible assets '4.0'
With regard to intangible assets included in Annex B of Law 232/2016 (including expenses for services incurred in connection with the use of cloud computing solutions), Law No. 234/2021 introduced different rates depending on the year of investment.
Specifically, for investments made for FY 2023, the tax credit is granted at 20% of the cost, again up to an annual maximum of EUR 1 million. The tax credit rate decreases to 15% for investments made in FY 2024 and 10% for investments made in FY 2025.
The 2025 Budget law has terminated early the applicability of the tax credit for investments in intangible capital goods made in 2025. Therefore, in 2025 only investments already started in 2024 will remain eligible for the tax credit, for which the two reservation requirements had already matured, i.e. acceptance of the order by the supplier and payment of a minimum deposit of 20% by the buyer.
In all cases, there is a six-month window (until June 30 of the following year) if the conditions for the reservation are met by December 31 of each year.
### Tax credit Transition '5.0'
A tax credit is applicable to investments in tangible and intangible assets interconnected with the company’s Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) that enables the company to achieve its goals of optimising processes, reducing energy consumption (positively impacting the decarbonisation process), and improving production efficiency. Eligible investments must be made in FYs 2024/25 and they must be aimed at Transaction 5.0, allowing for energy savings compared with the level of consumption before the investments.
A minimum energy consumption reduction of at least 3% of the entire production structure or 5% of the specific production process is requested to access the tax credit. The tax credit is recognised to the extent of 35% of the cost for investments up to EUR 10 million, and 5% of the cost for investments between EUR 10 million and EUR 50 million.
In case of higher reduction of the energy consumption, the tax credit rates are increased by 5 or 10 percentage points. The energy consumption reduction must be certified by an independent energy expert, and the communication must be filed with the energy sector authority (GSE).
## Tax credit on investments in research and development (R&D), technological innovation, and design and aesthetic ideation: Common rules
The following tax credits are available to all enterprises that invest in eligible activities, regardless of the legal form and the economic sector in which they operate.
### R&D tax credit
For the R&D tax credit, in line with the legislation in force until 31 December 2019, the eligible activities consist of fundamental research, industrial research, and experimental development as defined, respectively, by the letters (m), (q), and (j) of point 15, par. 1.3 of the Communication no. 198/2014 of the European Commission. 
For eligible R&D activities, the tax credit is equal to 20% (12% in FY 2020) of the eligible costs incurred, with a maximum annual amount of EUR 4 million (EUR 3 million for FY 2020). The 2021 Budget Law extended for two years the increased benefit rates provided for if the R&D activities are carried out in the South Italy regions.
The 2022 Budget Law extended the measure up to the tax period including 31 December 2031; however, the tax credit rate was decreased to 10% of the eligible expenses, and the annual ceiling of the credit increased to EUR 5 million.
To determine the cost basis of the benefit, the following expenses are eligible:
  1. Personnel costs.
  2. Depreciation charges, costs of the financial or simple lease, and other expenses related to movable tangible assets and software used in R&D projects.
  3. Expenses for _extra-muros_ research contracts concerning the direct execution of eligible R&D activities by the provider.
  4. Depreciation charges related to industrial privatives.
  5. Expenses for consultancy services and equivalent services related to R&D eligible activities.
  6. Expenses for materials, supplies, and other similar products used in the R&D projects.


### Tax credit for technological and digital innovation and ecological transition
A tax credit for enterprises that invest in technological and digital innovation activities '4.0' and in projects aimed at the ecological transition is also applicable. 
Until FY 2023, this tax credit is equal to 10% (6% in FY 2020) of the eligible costs incurred, with a maximum annual amount of EUR 2 million (EUR 1.5 million in FY 2020). The applicable rate is increased to 15% (10% in FY 2020) in case the eligible activities consist of technological innovation aimed to reach an ecological transition goal or a digital innovation goal compliant with the so-called '4.0' model, without prejudge of the maximum annual amount of EUR 2 million (EUR 1.5 million in FY 2020).
Based on changes introduced by the 2022 Budget Law, for the tax periods 2024 and 2025, the tax credit rate is reduced to 5% while the annual maximum limit of EUR 2 million remains unchanged.
On the other hand, as regard the tax credit for investments in 4.0 digital innovation projects or for projects aimed at achieving ecological transition objectives, for the tax period 2022, the measure of 15% is confirmed within the annual maximum limit of EUR 2 million, and then it is progressively reduced to 10% for the tax period following the one in course on 31 December 2022, within the annual maximum limit of EUR 4 million, and to 5% for the tax period following the ones in course from 31 December 2023 to 31 December 2025, again within the annual maximum limit of EUR 4 million.
To determine the tax credit, taxpayers shall consider the same eligible expenses as for R&D credit, under the same conditions, except for those relating to industrial property rights as indicated in (iv) of the paragraph above.
### Tax credit for design and aesthetic ideation activities
This measure is addressed mainly to enterprises operating in the textile and fashion, footwear, eyewear, gold, furniture, and ceramic sectors that have carried out design and aesthetic ideation activities for the conception and realisation of new products and samples. 
The tax credit rate is equal to the one for technological innovation. To determine the tax credit, taxpayers shall consider the same eligible expenses as for the R&D credit, under the same conditions, except for those relating to industrial property rights indicated in (iv) above.
## Tax credit for investments in the Southern Italy Special Economic Zone (SEZ)
In relation to the tax credit 2024 for investments in the SEZ area, 2025 Budget Law modified art. 16 co. 6 of Legislative Decree 124/2023 bringing some changes to the national budget available to finance this measure. In particular, the tax credit at hand is recognised within the maximum limit of EUR 2,2 billion for the year 2025 (investments made in the period January 1 through November 15), based on the definitions and the criteria provided for by the Ministerial Decree issued.
As already provided for by Legislative Decree 124/2023, the tax credit will be recognised in a variable amount depending on the size of the company and the location of the investments made in the regions of Southern Italy, which become a single special economic zone, relating to the purchase of new capital goods (plants, equipment, and machinery) and the purchase of land and the construction of buildings, including restructuring expenses.
The nominal rate of the tax credit for large companies is 15% of the eligible investments in the Region Abruzzo, 30% in the Regions Molise, Basilicata, and Sardinia, and 40% in the Regions Campania, Puglia, Calabria, and Sicily. Increased rates of 10% and 20%, respectively, are applicable for medium and small companies, as defined based on the EU applicable regulation.
## Advertising campaign tax credit
There is a facilitative measure intended for businesses, self-employed workers, and non-commercial entities in relation to investments made in advertising campaigns in the daily and periodical press, including online (article 57-bis, Legislative Decree 50/2017).
From 2023, to benefit from the tax credit, it is necessary that the overall amount of advertising investments made exceeds the amount of similar investments made in the previous year by at least 1%.
The incentive consists of a tax credit equal to 75% of the incremental value of the investments made. It is granted within the maximum limit of the annual allocation and in compliance with the European Union regulations on '_de minimis_ ' aid. Therefore, if the overall amount of credits requested exceeds the amount of available resources at a national level, these are divided percentage-wise among all those who are entitled to the bonus.
## Patent Box regime
Law Decree no. 146 issued on October 21 2021, as amended by the 2022 Budget Law, has revised the previous Patent Box regime with effect from 2021 by shifting from a profit-based incentive to a cost-based incentive. In particular, the costs for the R&D activities (incurred either directly by the Italian resident companies and PEs of non-resident entities or by outsourcing the R&D activities to universities or other research institutes or equivalent institutes) in relation to copyrighted software, patents, designs, and models can be recognised for tax purposes for an amount equal to 110% of the relevant expenditure for both IRES and IRAP. R&D costs incurred with related parties are not eligible. The election for the new Patent Box procedure lasts for five fiscal years, is irrevocable, and is renewable.
In order to benefit from this new procedure, each year taxpayers have to opt for it in the annual CIT return and prepare a proper documentation set, whose possession has to be declared in the annual CIT return. This documentation, which has to be prepared in Italian language, electronically signed with time-stamp by the legal representative of the company (or its delegate), and provided to the tax authority upon request, within 20 days, in the electronic format, will allow taxpayers to benefit from the penalty protection relief in case of tax audit and related challenge.
All relevant instructions for implementing the new Patent Box regime are included in Regulation no. 48243/2022 and no. 52642/2023 of the Director of the Italian Revenue Agency and clarifications provided in Circular Letter no. 5/2023.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
A 26% base standard withholding tax (WHT) rate applies on the yields on loans and securities (bonds, shares, etc.) paid by Italian resident entities to both Italian and non-Italian resident investors.
The standard WHT rate, however, may be reduced under the applicable DTTs, EU Directives, or other special domestic tax regimes (such WHT exemptions and reductions are only granted to the beneficial owner of the income).
Interest on government bonds is subject to a 12.5% domestic WHT.

Notes
  1. The actual applicable rate depends on the nature of the recipient. Applicable rates are as follows: 0% applies on loan agreements and ordinary notes when the recipient is a corporation; 26% rate in all other cases.
  2. For resident individuals, generally a 26% WHT applies, but there is a grandfathering regime for dividends received by ‘qualified’ shareholders (i.e. holding more than 20% of voting rights or 25% of the share capital, 2% or 5% in case of listed companies) applicable to dividend distributed in 2021 but accrued up to 2017. The rate applicable to 'non-qualified shareholders' is always 26%. Non-residents are always subject to a 26% WHT, irrespective of whether or not they are 'qualified'.
  3. The domestic rate applies on 75% of the gross amount of the royalty paid; however, treaty ceilings apply on the gross amount of the royalty paid.
  4. Pursuant to the EU Directives and provided that the requirements set forth therein are met, payments of dividends, interest, and royalties made by an Italian company to an EU resident group company can be WHT exempt. Specifically for the dividends, the minimum shareholding requirement (to benefit from this exemption) is currently equal to 10%; for interest and royalties, it is 25% of voting rights; a one-year minimum holding period applies for both.
  5. Should the full WHT exemption not apply, 1.2% applies on dividends paid to EU and EEA tax resident corporations.
  6. Pursuant to the Swiss EU tax agreement and provided that the requirements contained therein are met, payments of dividends, interest, and royalties made by an Italian company to a Swiss tax resident group company can be WHT exempt.
  7. Non-resident persons have the right to obtain reimbursement for up to 11/26 of the withholding effected, upon proof of the actual taxation of the dividends in the foreign country where the recipient is a resident.
  8. Provided that all conditions are met, domestic tax legislation is applicable if more favourable for the taxpayer. In a number of circumstances, tax treaties may provide for particular tax rates mainly dependent on the nature of the instruments and on the profile of the recipients/payers. In such cases, the applicable WHT rate must be verified from an analysis of the relevant tax treaty.

## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Adoption of IFRS and taxation
For IAS/IFRS adopters, the Italian tax law provides for the enhanced derivation (_principio di derivazione rafforzata_) of the CIT basis from the IFRS statutory financial statements.
The taxable base is determined starting from the net income arising from the profit and loss, increased or decreased by items directly booked to equity pursuant to the application of IAS/IFRS. In this respect, the accrual principle, and the qualification and classification criteria stated by the IFRS, are relevant for the calculation of the taxable base. Valuations criteria are not accepted for tax purposes. Specifications and limitations of the derivation principle can be introduced by means of a Decree issued by the Ministry of Finance.
The First Time Adoption is characterised by the neutrality principle (_Principio della Neutralità_); such principle aims to neutralise the effects deriving from the movement to IAS/IFRS.
The following specific rules applicable to IAS adopters must be considered:
  * Adjustments or recognitions of transactions made in equity and/or in the ‘other comprehensive income (OCI)’ are relevant for tax purposes, to the extent that such items are in compliance with general tax principles.
  * For equity instruments, the legal classification is prevailing over the accounting one (debt vs. equity classification).
  * Under certain conditions, unrealised profits and losses recognised in the profit and loss become taxable and deductible (e.g. fair value on securities other than shareholdings and on derivatives transactions).
  * The tax treatment of transactions between IFRS adopters and non-IFRS adopters is based on the accounting principle adopted by each company (e.g. financial leasing transaction).
  * Depreciation and amortisation are permitted within the rates provided by the tax rules and limited to the amount booked in the profit and loss statement. In this respect, the abolition of the imperative systematic depreciation of the goodwill and its substitution by the goodwill's review for impairment does not affect the tax deduction of the goodwill amortisation that should be made solely for tax purposes.
  * Negative components booked in the income statement as expenses for personnel settled with equity instrument under IFRS 2 (stock options) are deductible only at the time of actual assignment to beneficiaries. This provision has been introduced by 2025 Budget Law and will be applied to the plans whose costs will be booked for the first time in the financial statements for the fiscal year in progress as of December 31, 2025 or later.
  * In order to identify financial instruments with hedging purposes, IFRS adopters are allowed to give relevance to the classification made in the financial statement. In particular, financial instruments designated in the financial statement as hedging instruments in compliance with IFRS principles are considered also as hedging instruments for fiscal purposes (hedging accounting approach including the fair value option [FVO]).


## Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
The FATCA aims to detect and discourage offshore tax evasion by United States (US) citizens or residents for tax purposes in the United States who hold financial assets through foreign financial institutions (FFIs), generally banks, custodial institutions, certain investment entities, and life insurance companies.
In order to simplify the obligations imposed on FFIs, the US Treasury and various foreign governments have entered into intergovernmental agreements (IGAs).
The Italian Inter-Governmental Agreement (i.e. Italian IGA) was signed between Italy and the United States on January 10, 2014, and it has been ratified by the Law no. 95/2015 (i.e. FATCA ratification law) issued on January 18, 2015. 
For countries that have signed a Model 1 IGA, the United States has granted a number of important simplifications, such as the possibility for FFIs to use information collected for anti-money laundering (AML) purposes and for FATCA customer identification and the suspension of most of the penalties (e.g. account closure) for those account holders who refuse to provide the information required for their correct identification (i.e. recalcitrant).
The FATCA implementation Decree (i.e. FATCA Decree) was issued by the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) on August 6, 2015.
FATCA obligates Italian financial institutions to identify (starting from July 1, 2014) and classify account holders in order to report certain financial information (e.g. name, address, taxpayer identification number [TIN], account balance) related to US persons to the Italian Revenue Agency. The Italian tax authority will then exchange such information with the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by the end of September of each year.
The IGA ratification Law also includes provisions regarding on-boarding and due diligence requirements for CRS purposes.
The CRS implementation Decree (i.e. CRS Decree) was issued by the MEF on December 28, 2015. The CRS Decree includes the Annex C, which lists the reportable jurisdictions (i.e. each European Union member state that is not Italy and each jurisdiction that has signed an agreement with Italy or with the European Union on the basis of which it would receive information on reportable accounts), and Annex D, which lists the participating jurisdictions (i.e. each European Union member state that is not Italy and each jurisdiction that has signed an agreement with Italy or with the European Union on the basis of which it would transmit information on reportable accounts). Annex C and Annex D have been modified by further Decrees issued by the MEF.
Starting from January 1, 2016, Italian financial institutions are required to identify and report non-resident (non-US) account holders to the Italian Revenue Agency, as provided by the CRS developed by the OECD.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## IRES income determination
Specific rules have been released for entities adopting Italian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) rather than International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for Italian statutory financial reporting purposes. These provisions are aimed to align the taxable basis determination rules with the statutory financial reporting (so-called principle of derivation of the corporate income taxable basis from the statutory financial statements).
Therefore, the taxable basis is influenced by the qualification criteria, time-based recognition, and classification in the financial statements provided by the related accounting standards.
The already issued provisions for International Accounting Standards (IAS)/IFRS entities also apply to Italian GAAP adopters, if compatible.
There are also measures aimed at coordinating different items of the tax code in the light of new evaluation and representation criteria introduced by the accounting reform.
## IRAP income determination
For IRAP purposes, relevant income and expenses are those reported in the statutory financial statements. Positive and negative items resulting from transfer of business concern are out of the scope of the taxable basis.
## Inventory valuation
Italian tax law allows the application of all the most commonly used inventory valuation methods: last in first out (LIFO), first in first out (FIFO), average cost. For IRES only, the reference prices used to calculate the written down value of the inventory items cannot be lower than their market prices during the final month of the tax period.
Companies operating in the oil and gas sector are required to adopt either average cost or FIFO for tax purposes.
The 2024 Budget Law has introduced the option to adjust inventories to the actual inventory situation for the tax period in progress at 30 September 2023. The adjustment entails the payment of a substitute tax for IRES and IRAP at the rate of 18%. In case of elimination of inventory in respect of the opening balance, in addition to the 18% substitute tax, VAT is also due. The choice must be made in the tax return related to the fiscal year in progress at 30 September 2023.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are taxable in the tax period in which they are realised, as follows:
  * Fixed assets: The gain realised on the sale of fixed assets is taxable for both IRES and IRAP purposes. Additionally, for IRES purposes, tax on capital gains can be spread over a maximum of five years. This treatment is allowed if the company owned the fixed assets for not less than three years.
  * Financial investments: A specific participation exemption regime (PEX) is applicable. Under this regime, capital gains realised by Italian companies on sales of shareholdings are 95% exempt from IRES.


PEX applies if all of the following conditions are met:
  * The shareholding was held uninterruptedly for at least 12 months prior to the sale.
  * The investment was classified under financial fixed assets in the financial statements relating to the first tax period of uninterrupted ownership.
  * The subsidiary is actually carrying on a commercial activity (e.g. investments in companies mainly performing management of their own real estate are not entitled to PEX benefits).
  * The majority of the subsidiary's income is not generated in a tax haven country or one with a privileged tax regime.


The third condition must be met both at the time of the sale of the investment and in the three preceding years. The fourth condition must be met since the beginning of the shareholder period, or, if the buyer is a third party, over the five-year period before the disposal. If these conditions are not met, the capital gain realised by the company is ordinarily taxed.
Capital losses arising from the sale or write-down of shareholdings meeting PEX conditions are basically not tax deductible. Likewise, the capital losses realised on sales of non-PEX investments are tax deductible. Specific exemptions are provided for those entities adopting IFRS for Italian statutory accounts reporting purposes.
Specific anti-dividend washing rules provide that where capital losses arise from the disposal of shareholdings that are not eligible for PEX, such losses are deductible only for the part exceeding the tax exempt amount of dividends (_see Dividend income discussion below_) received from the shares in question in the 36 months prior to the disposal.
Capital gains on financial investments generally are excluded from the IRAP taxable base.
From 1 January 2024, capital gains realised by EU or EEA companies and entities, without a PE in Italy, with respect to the sale of qualified participations, having PEX requirements, where taxable also in Italy, are subject to taxation on only 5% of their amount.
## Dividend income
Dividends received by Italian resident companies from Italian companies or from companies resident in countries other than tax havens (i.e. not included in the 'black list') are excluded from the IRES taxable base for 95% of their amount. Conversely, no exemption applies to dividends paid by entities that are resident in tax haven jurisdictions (unless those dividends derive from profits that were already taxed under the Italian CFC rules). There are specific rules for entities adopting IFRS for Italian statutory financial reporting purposes. For such entities, dividends from investments in shares and other financial instruments held for trading are fully taxable.
To avoid the standard taxation on dividend originated by a foreign entity resident in tax havens, provided that certain conditions are met, Italian parent companies may elect a new substitute tax regime (9% to 6% tax rates) on the amounts of profits and retained reserves distributed. For calendar year entities, the substitute tax is due by 30 June 2024 and the relating option is required in the tax return. The payment of the substitute tax allows for an increase of the tax value of the participation when assessing the taxable base for the determination of capital gains.
Dividends generally are excluded from the IRAP taxable base.
## Interest income
Interest income is generally part of the taxable base.
## Waiver of credits
A specific regime is applicable regarding the waiver of credits (e.g. financial and/or commercial) towards the company by its shareholder. In particular, the part that exceeds the tax value of the credit is considered taxable income. Furthermore, the shareholder is required to provide a statement to the company pointing out the tax value of the credit. Without such a statement, the company will have to tax the full amount of the waiver of the credit.
## Foreign income
An Italian resident corporation is taxable on all income whether produced in Italy or abroad. Profits earned by subsidiaries that are resident or located in countries or territories other than tax havens are taxed only on distribution of the relevant profits. Double taxation is, in principle, avoided by means of foreign tax credits.
An optional branch exemption regime is available, which allows Italian companies to exempt from Italian taxation branch income and losses arising outside Italy, instead of the normal regime, which provides for taxation of worldwide income with foreign tax credit relief. This option affects all foreign PEs of the Italian company and is irrevocable. It must be exercised at the time the branch is incorporated and takes effect from that fiscal year.
## Shell companies
Resident companies and PEs of non-resident companies can be qualified as non-operating entities if the average revenues recorded in the current fiscal year and in the prior two years are lower than the amount resulting by applying certain 'deemed return’ percentages to the average balance sheet value of specific assets in the current fiscal year and the two previous years.
The main assets to be taken into consideration are shares and shareholdings, financial receivables, owned or leased real estate, and owned or leased tangible and intangible assets. The value of any assets acquired or sold during the fiscal year must be adjusted according to the ownership period.
These conditions must be checked every year. Therefore, it is possible for an entity to be 'non-operative' in one year and operative in the following year.
The shell company is assessed as having a minimum taxable income for both IRES and IRAP purposes.
For IRES purposes, the taxable income of a non-operative entity is determined as the sum of such values emerging from the application of specific percentages to the book values of the above-mentioned assets.
From FY 2024 the percentage to be applied to the tax base of buildings, participations, and financial credits for calculating the presumed revenues have been halved, as well as the rates for calculating the minimum revenues whereas the operational test has not been passed.
The current IRES standard rate for entities qualified as shell companies is 34.5% (24% plus surtax of 10.5%).
Tax losses generated in a tax period when the company was deemed to be non-operating cannot be carried forward.
For IRAP purposes, non-deductible items have to be added back to the deemed minimum IRES income as outlined above.
These rules are not applicable in the first year of a company’s incorporation. Exemptions from these rules can be achieved:
  * by means of an advance ruling from the Italian tax authorities aimed at assessing the specific circumstances that caused the company not to earn the minimum amount of income or
  * by specific objective situations provided for by Italian law (e.g. company directly or indirectly held by listed companies).


Shell companies are also subject to limitations in their ability to recover VAT credits.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Applicable rates
Italian corporate entities are subject to a corporate income tax, known as _imposta sul reddito sulle società_ or IRES, and to a regional production tax, known as _imposta regionale sulle attività produttive_ or IRAP.
The standard rates are as follows:
  * 24% for IRES.
  * 3.9% for IRAP.


Specific rules apply for bank and financial entities.
Different IRAP rates are applicable for certain entities (i.e. banks and financial entities, insurance corporations, entities with a determined governmental exclusive right to provide services).
Regions have the power to slightly increase or decrease IRAP rates.
### **Reduced CIT rate for companies reinvesting profits in fixed assets (so called “****”)**
Reduction of the CIT rate from 24% to 20%, for the tax period following the one in progress as of December 31, 2024 (FY 2025 for companies with calendar fiscal year), for companies that jointly (i) allocate 80% of the profits of the FY ending December 31, 2024, to a specific retained earning reserve, (ii) reinvest 30% of them in the purchase of new 4.0 and 5.0 fixed assets (it must be at least equal to the 24 per cent of profits by FY December 31, 2023, and the minimum threshold is EUR 20,000), (iii) have maintained stable employment levels in 2024, (iv) increase them by at least 1% in 2025, and (v) the company has not resorted to the wage guarantee fund (CIG) during the fiscal year in progress as of December 31, 2024.
## General rules
### IRES
The IRES taxable base is determined according to the worldwide taxation principle, which states that, regardless of the location/jurisdiction where the income is produced, to the extent that the income is legally attributable to an Italian resident entity, the income is taxed in Italy. IRES is charged on the total net income reported in the financial statements of the company as adjusted for specific tax rules. Non-resident companies are taxed only on Italian-source income.
### IRAP
There are different methods of computation for the IRAP taxable base, depending on the nature of the business carried out by the taxpayer. Provisions for liabilities and risks, as well as extraordinary items, cannot be taken into account when determining the IRAP taxable base.
For sales and manufacturing companies, the IRAP taxable base is broadly represented by the company’s gross margin in its financial statements. In addition to the non-deductible items mentioned above, interest income and expense and provisions for bad debts are excluded for the purposes of the IRAP taxable base.
For banks, the IRAP taxable base is broadly defined as follows:
  * Intermediation margin reduced by 50% of dividends.
  * 90% of amortisation costs relating to fixed tangible and intangible assets.
  * 90% of other administrative expenses.
  * Net value of adjustments and reassessments for bad debts.


Special rules apply to financial institutions, other than banks, and holding companies.
IRAP is levied on a regional basis, and regions are allowed to increase or decrease the standard IRAP rate up to 0.92%. Companies with facilities in different regions must allocate their overall taxable base to the different regions on the basis of the employment costs of personnel located at the various sites. Facilities become relevant to the calculation of IRAP if they have been established for more than three months. Italian companies with PEs abroad, as well as shipping companies qualifying for the tonnage tax regime (_see Tonnage tax below_), are not subject to IRAP on the income earned through these PEs.
The deduction of labour costs for IRAP purposes depends on the type of hiring contract. In particular:
  * Full deduction for costs related to employees hired with an open-ended contract.
  * Deduction limited to contributions for compulsory insurance against accidents (i.e. _Istituto Nazionale Infortuni sul Lavoro_ or INAIL) for temporary employees.


## Global minimum tax
On December 28, 2023, the Legislative Decree no. 209 implementing EU Directive 2022/2523 has been published.
### Income Inclusion Rule (IIR)
The Decree provides for a IIR applicable to parents (ultimate parent entity [UPE], intermediate parent entity [IPE], or partially owned parent entity [POPE]) located in Italy with respect to foreign located and stateless low-taxed constituent entities (LTCEs). The Decree also provides for a domestic IIR applicable, under the rule order, by an Italian parent to itself and to Italian located constituent entities that are LTCEs. IIR and domestic IIR applies to fiscal years beginning on or after 31 December 2023.
### Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR)
The Decree, in line with the Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) rules and the Directive, provides for the UTPR as a separate charging provision. The UTPR will be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after 31 December 2023.
### Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax (QDMTT)
The QDMTT is applicable for fiscal years that begin on or after December 31, 2023. The same is provided for multinational groups in the initial phase of internationalisation and for large-scale domestic groups. The Illustrative memorandum affirms that the QDMTT is intended to be qualified and designed as a permanent safe harbour.
As regards the accounting standards, the Decree adopts the Local Accounting Standard with the UPE's accounting standard as a last resort rule. The substance-based income exclusion (SBIE) is expected to apply equally to the QDMTT as it does the IIR.
### Safe Harbours
On May 21, 2024, the Ministry of Economy and Finance issued a Decree providing further details on the application of the Transitional Safe Harbours. The decree only addresses the Transitional Safe Harbours (QDMTT and Simplified Calculations Safe Harbours are not included). Most of the decree addresses the Transitional Country-by-Country Reporting (CbCR) Safe Harbour, and it includes the additional rules from the December 2023 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Administrative Guidance.
_Please also refer to_.
## Substitutive tax on reorganisations (mergers, de-mergers, contributions in kind)
Corporate restructurings, such as mergers, de-mergers, and contributions in kind, are, in principle, tax neutral even if, for financial accounting purposes, the transaction results in the recognition of higher values of the assets or of goodwill. Companies may elect to obtain partial or full recognition for tax purposes of the step-up in the financial accounting values of assets or of the goodwill arising from the corporate restructurings, provided they pay a substitutive tax.
## Tonnage tax
Italian tax resident shipping companies, as well as non-resident shipping companies operating in Italy through a PE, can qualify for and then elect to be subject to the Italian tonnage tax regime. The regime basically allows for the determination of presumptive income based on the net tonnage of the qualifying ships (tonnage income). The tonnage income is subject to IRES only.
To qualify for the tonnage tax, ships must: (i) have a net tonnage of more than 100 net tons (NT); (ii) be used for goods transportation, passenger transportation, salvage, towing (subject to certain conditions) and other services; and (iii) operate in international shipping as defined by the rules disciplining Italian International Registry. Specific rules apply in the case of bare boat charter. In particular, the ship will always be subject to the Tonnage Tax, while the specific net income will be subject to the analytical taxation provided for by the ordinary rules (IRES 24%). A Tax credit will be recognized in order to avoid double taxation. Chartered ships with crew are included in the tonnage tax regime if their global net tonnage is less than 50% of the total net tonnage.
Tonnage income is calculated on the basis of the ship’s net tonnage. The daily income is determined according to the following rate system:
Ship's net tonnage (NT) | Daily income in EUR per NT  
---|---  
0 to 1,000 | 0.0090  
1,001 to 10,000 | 0.0070  
10,001 to 25,000 | 0.0040  
above 25,001 | 0.0020  
It is necessary to consider all days of possession / ownership of the ship, even when it is stopped for repairs. 
No deductions and tax losses offset are allowed from tonnage tax income.
Income and expenses from the following activities are all deemed to be covered by the tonnage income determined as previously discussed:
  * Transport of goods.
  * Transport of passengers.
  * Salvage and towing (subject to certain conditions).
  * Other services that need to be performed on the high seas.
  * Charges related to the above-mentioned activities (e.g. administrative and commercial expenses, insurances fees).
  * Other operations performed in close connection with the transportation operations (e.g. loading and unloading (subject to certain conditions).
  * Other minor activities.


Capital gains or losses arising from the transfer of ships that have been acquired by a company while under the tonnage tax regime are also deemed to be included in tonnage tax income. In the event of options exercised from FY 2016, if the taxpayer sells a ship already owned before the tonnage tax application, a capital gain determined according to the rules of Article 158 of the Italian Income Tax Code (TUIR) is added to the taxable income. In such case, the capital gain is equal to the lower of (i) the difference in the market value of the vessel and the non-amortised cost of the same, recorded on the last day of the year preceding the one in which the option is exercised, and (ii) the difference between the consideration received and the cost not amortised at the time of the sale. In any case, the taxable amount cannot be lower than the 'net latent capital gain' calculated as the difference between the market value of the vessel and the non-amortised cost of the same both before the tax period in which the option is exercised decreased by the tonnage income determined until the time of transfer.
In the event of an option exercised before FY 2016, the sale of a vessel purchased before tonnage tax can generate a capital gain or a loss to be added to the tonnage tax; this amount is equal to the difference between the consideration received and the non-amortised cost of the last antecedent fiscal year to that of the first application of the tonnage tax.
An election for the tonnage tax regime should be made for all of a company’s or group’s qualifying vessels. So called ‘cherry picking’ is not allowed. Election for the tonnage tax regime is on a voluntary basis, but, once elected, it remains in effect for ten years. The election is silently renewed at the end of the ten-year period.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
Italian VAT (_Imposta sul Valore Aggiunto_) applies to the supply of goods and services carried out in Italy by entrepreneurs, professionals, or artists and on importations carried out by anyone. Intra-Community acquisitions are also subject to VAT under certain situations.
The Italian standard VAT rate is 22%. Reduced rates are provided for specifically listed supplies of goods and services, such as:
  * 4% for listed food, drinks, and agricultural products, and e-books/e-periodicals that meet certain requirements.
  * 5% for certain health services, for the sale of food herbs, for certain transport services on seas, lakes, and rivers, and for district heating services.
  * 10% for electric power supplies for listed uses, listed drugs, pellets, and for specific products regarding childhood (e.g. milk powder).


Intra-Community supplies and exports are exempt from VAT under certain conditions.
Under certain conditions, transactions with taxable persons who usually carry out export of goods are exempt from VAT with right to deduct. The exemption with right to deduction is subject to the following procedures:
  * The usual exporter is required to submit via electronic means the declaration of intent, which can concern more than one transaction, to the Italian tax authorities, who will issue a receipt with a specific protocol number. In the declaration of intent, the usual exporter has also to communicate the amounts of the purchases for which is entitled to purchase goods and services without the application of VAT, i.e. so called “plafond”, whose amount is based on the exports and similar transactions carried out in the previous year). The “plafond” can not be used for purchases of goods and services for which VAT is non-deductible pursuant to articles 19 et seq., Presidential Decree no. 633/1972 (see, inter alia, Supreme Court’s case. no. 23588/2012);
  * The supplier is required to check, on the Italian tax authorities’ website or in its own Tax Box (_Cassetto Fiscale_), whether the letter of intent has been duly submitted. After checking the above, the protocol number of the receipt has to be quoted on each invoice issued without application of VAT towards the usual exporter. With reference to the applicable penalties in relation to the supplier who does not take care to check whether the letter of intent has been duly submitted, a substantial penalty equal to 70% for the violations carried out from September 1, 2024.
  * In case of import, the importer of goods has to quote on the customs declaration the details of the protocol number of the receipt.


The content of the declarations of intent is defined by Act no. 96911/2020 of the Italian tax authorities.
The Italian tax authorities will carry out specific risk analysis and substantial controls with the aim to prevent the release of fake declarations of intent and to invalidate those fake declarations already issued.
In particular:
  * if, as a result of the above-mentioned analyses, the Italian tax authorities find out that one taxable person does not meet the conditions to issue a 'declaration of intent', the latter will be prevented from the possibility of issuing new declarations of intent via electronic means to the Italian tax authorities, and
  * it will no longer be allowed for the supplier to issue an invoice ('exempt from VAT according to article 8, paragraph 1, let. c, Presidential Decree no. 633/1972' as VAT treatment) via the SDI ('_Sistema di Interscambio'_) with the indication of the protocol number of a declaration of intent invalidated by the Italian tax authorities. Starting from February 1, 2024, a specific control will be introduced in SDI that determines the rejection of the electronically issued invoice if the invalidity of the declaration of intent is detected in the 'other management data' field.


In case an irregularity is detected, the Italian tax authorities could also invalidate the declaration of intent sent by the usual exporter.
On June 5, 2024, the Supreme Court published the case no. 15679/2024, in which it states that the non taxable regime provided by art. 8, paragraph 1, letter c), Presidential Decree no. 633/1972, is applicable only in the case of transfer of motor vehicles (in relation to which art. 19-bis1, paragraph 1, letters c) and d), Presidential Decree no. 633/1972, provides for a partial deduction of VAT (i.e. 40%), except from specific cases) towards “usual exporters” (within the limits of the “plafond”), can be legitimately applied by the supplier only if the latter is able to prove the client's right to fully deduct the input VAT.
The legal principle expressed by the supreme judges seems excessively strict where it is stated that the non taxable regime can be applied by the suppliers only if they are able to verify and prove the habitual exporter clients’ right to fully deduct VAT on the purchase of the vehicle.
In this regard, although the Italian tax authorities have never yet expressed an opinion on the use of the “plafond” in cases of purchases for which a partial objective non-deductibility is provided, in line with the ratio of the provision, it should be recognized the possibility of a "partial" use of the “plafond” for the deductible part of VAT (in this case, 40%).
In these circumstances, without prejudice to the obligation of the supplier to verify the submission of the declaration of intent to the Italian tax authorities by the usual exporter customer, the verification activity by the supplier as set out by the Supreme Court appears to be particularly onerous (in fact, these would involve substantial controls that appear to be those of the Italian tax authorities).
In light of these considerations, clarifications from the Italian tax authorities are expected aimed, on one side, at better contextualizing the orientation expressed by national case law, and on the other side, at providing clear and practical indications on the procedures that suppliers of usual exporters should implement in order to avoid disputes in cases analogous or similar to the above-mentioned one. 
In the meantime, suppliers of usual exporter clients should assess their internal procedures as well as the check currently in place, especially if the type of goods/services supplied fall into a category for which the VAT Law provides for objective non-deductibility, even if partial.
Specific supplies of goods and services expressly listed in the law are exempt from VAT (e.g. hospital and medical care, education, insurance services, specific financial services, supply/leasing of certain immovable property,cosmetic surgery healthcare services only on condition that the therapeutic purposes are demonstrated by a specific medical certificate).
Input VAT on purchases of goods and services related to business activity generally is allowed for recovery. Special limitations apply in relation to specific items (e.g. cars, entertainment expenses) and to companies carrying out both taxable transactions and transactions exempt from VAT with no right to deduct.
The filing deadline for the **annual VAT return** is **30 April** of the following year.
### Cross-border communication
Taxpayers resident or VAT-established in Italy are required to communicate to the Italian tax authorities the data related to the supply of goods and services provided/received to/from counterparts not VAT-established or VAT-registered in Italy, starting from July 1, 2022.
In this respect, Law no. 215/2021, amending paragraph 3-bis of article 1 of Legislative Decree no. 127/2015, provides that the data related to the supplies of goods and provisions of services received/carried out from/in favour of taxable persons not established in Italy (i.e. taxable persons established in the European Union or outside the European Union) must be communicated to the Italian tax authorities in .XML format and transmitted to the SDI (except for the transactions for which an e-invoice or a customs bill is issued and for the purchase of services not exceeding EUR 5,000 that are out of the scope of Italian VAT). In particular, the above-mentioned data will be communicated to the Italian tax authorities within the following deadlines: 
  * The transmission of the data related to the cross-border sales should be carried out within the deadlines of issuance of the invoices or documents that certify the considerations.
  * The transmission of the data related to the cross-border purchases should be carried out within the 15th day of the month following the one in which the foreign supplier invoice is received or the transaction has been carried out. 


Moreover, with reference to the cross-border sales, the Italian resident or VAT-established taxpayers must generate an electronic .XML file to be transmitted to the SDI by using the codes <TipoDocumento> TD01 or TD04 (credit notes) indicating the foreign client as the recipient of the invoice.
On the other hand, with reference to the cross-border purchases, the Italian resident or VAT-established taxpayers must generate an .XML self-invoice/integration document to be transmitted to the SDI by using the following <TipoDocumento> codes:
  * TD17 in relation to integration document/self-invoices for purchase of services from abroad.
  * TD18 in relation to integration document for intra-EU purchases of goods.
  * TD19 in relation to integration document/self-invoice for purchase of goods ex article 17, paragraph 2, Presidential Decree n. 633/1972.
  * TD28 in case of purchases for which the foreign supplier wrongly charged Italian VAT (this provision is applicable from February 1, 2024).


Finally, with reference to the penalties applicable for the cross-border transactions, please note that article 1, paragraph 1104, Law no. 178/2020 provides that, from July 1, 2022, for the omission or incorrect communication of transactions carried out with foreign counterparties, an administrative penalty of EUR 2 per each invoice is applied, up to a limit of EUR 400 per month. The penalty is reduced by half, within the limit of EUR 200 for each month, if the transmission is made within 15 days from the deadline.
### Electronic invoicing obligations
Starting from January 1, 2019, a mandatory electronic invoicing obligation is in place for the supplies of goods or services carried out between persons that are resident or established in Italy. This obligation does not apply for non-established taxable persons, even if registered in Italy through direct VAT identification or a fiscal representative.
Electronic invoices should be:
  * converted into .XML format, in accordance with technical specifications referred to format currently used to send electronic invoices towards the public administration
  * signed with a qualified or digital signature (this is mandatory for B2G invoices and recommended for B2B and B2C invoices), and
  * sent to the counterpart through the Italian tax authorities’ SDI.


Electronic invoicing is also mandatory for business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions, where the supplier has the obligation to issue an invoice, with certain different specifications.
For the transmission of electronic invoices, the taxpayers, upon agreements between the parties, can rely on qualified intermediaries. However, the supplier will still be responsible for the issuance of the invoice in front of the Italian tax authorities.
On an experimental basis, in relation to the transactions carried out from July 1, 2021, the Italian tax authorities should have made available the draft of the following documents:
  * Sales VAT ledger.
  * Purchases VAT ledger.
  * Communications of periodical VAT settlements.
  * Draft of the annual VAT return (from January 1, 2022).


At the time being, the Italian tax authorities have limited the above to Italian established taxable persons who carry out VAT payments on a quarterly basis and to:
  * Taxpayers who pay the VAT on a quarterly basis.
  * Taxpayers declared bankrupt in the reference year.
  * Taxpayers who apply specific methods of determining the VAT allowed for deduction, such as agricultural producers or those who carry out related agricultural activities, agrotourism companies or associations operating in agriculture, or wine tourism companies.


### E-invoicing regime between Italy and San Marino
A mandatory electronic invoicing obligation has also been introduced for supplies of goods between taxable persons established in Italy and taxable persons established in the Republic of San Marino, which is mandatory starting from July 1, 2022.
The invoicing process towards business customers resident in San Marino provides some peculiarities compared to the SDI process currently in force for domestic supplies. In particular:
  * The electronic invoices and the credit/debit notes related to supplies of goods shipped or transported into the Republic of San Marino, once sent to the SDI, will be transmitted by the latter to the tax office of San Marino, which, after some checks, should validate the invoice by submitting a specific communication to the Italian tax authorities. Accordingly, the outcome of the checks made by the San Marino tax office will be made available by the Italian tax authorities to the Italian supplier through an appropriate IT channel.
  * In this respect, as indicated in article 3 of the Decree, in the event that in the four months following the issuance of the invoice the San Marino tax office does not validate the invoice, the Italian supplier should issue a credit note pursuant to article 26, paragraph 1, Presidential Decree no. 633/1972, without the payment of penalties and interests.
  * On the other hand, if the San Marino office validates the transaction, the latter can be considered VAT-exempt with right to deduction according to articles 8 and 9, Presidential Decree 633/1972.


With reference to the invoices issued by San Marino taxable persons to Italian business customers (with transport of the goods from San Marino to Italy), the e-invoices will be transmitted by the San Marino tax office in electronic format to the SDI, which will make them available to the Italian business customer through a specific IT channel.
### The obligation of the electronic memorisation and transmission of the considerations’ data
The electronic transmission of the considerations’ data is a new fulfilment introduced with the purpose to promote the companies’ digitalisation process and, at the same time, to contrast tax evasion and VAT frauds.
Taxpayers that carry out the activities provided by art. 22 of the Presidential Decree no. 633/1972 have the new obligation to memorise and transmit the considerations’ data, on a daily basis, to the Italian tax authorities.
The main benefits for the taxpayers are the exemption from the obligation to keep the considerations’ book, provided by article 24 of the Presidential Decree no. 633/1972, and the abrogation of some accounting fulfilments, such as the issuance and the storage of the fiscal receipts (i.e. '_scontrini'_ and '_ricevute fiscali'_).
The transactions are documented by the issuance of a document, the so-called '_documento commerciale'_.
Specific exemptions have been temporarily provided to certain taxpayers with regards to the activity performed (e.g. banks, insurance companies, and certain kinds of taxpayers who carry out retail trade activities).
With the 2021 Budget Law, the new penalties regime was introduced related to the penalties that might be applied for the violations related to the electronic memorisation and the telematic transmission of the consideration’s data.
With the 2025 Budget Law, it is stated that the operator should ensure the integration and the interaction between the process related to the daily considerations’ registration and the process of electronic payment. Said system’s update should be implemented by the operators within January 1, 2026. Penalties might be applied in case the operators do not comply with the above mentioned provision. 
### New VAT treatment of training services
The 2025 Budget Law established the VAT taxability of training services provided to entities authorized to provide labor pursuant to article 4, Legislative Decree no. 276 of 2003 (so called “agenzie per il lavoro”, expressly authorised companies whose activity is temporary work provision, by training entities and companies financed via the so called “bilateral fund” established pursuant to article 12, paragraph 4, Legislative Decree no. 276/2003. 
In brief, according to art. 10, paragraph 20, Presidential Decree no. 633/1972, VAT exemption with no right to deduction applies only whether the following conditions are jointly met, i.e. the services:
  * must be professional training, refresher courses, requalification and professional reconversion;
  * must be “provided by colleges or schools recognised by public administration”. However, the reference to colleges or schools is not exhaustive and clear. In fact, it should be recalled that the question of whether the said training services provided by entities authorized to provide labor pursuant to article 4, Legislative Decree no. 276 of 2003, by training entities and companies financed viathrough the so called “bilateral fund” established pursuant to article 12, paragraph 4, Legislative Decree no. 276/2003 were taxable or exempt from VAT.


In the light of the previous interpretative uncertainty of the Law (1), the 2025 Budget Law does not affect the behaviors adopted by the taxable persons in relation to the above-mentioned services performed prior to the date of entry into force of the Budget Law itself (i.e. January 1, 2025), for which no definitive acts have occurred (tax refunds are not envisaged). 
For the judgements pending upon the entry into force of the 2025 Budget Law (i.e. January 1, 2025), the possibility of close them is recognized by submitting an ad hoc request to the Italian Tax Authorities and the payment of the higher VAT assessed (only if due), without, therefore, the application of penalties and interest, or with the proof of the payment of VAT by the supplier. It is expected that the amounts already paid while the judgment is pending will be deducted from the amounts due.
(1) As said, the question of whether the said training services were taxable or exempt from VAT pursuant to art. 10, paragraph 1, no. 20), Presidential Decree no. 633/1972 has been widely debated and there is not an univocal orientation in the jurisprudential cases. In particular, the question of whether the training services were exempt from VAT with no right to deduct input VAT when financed through a bilateral fund pursuant to art. 12, paragraph 4, Legislative Decree no. 276/2003 has been the object of several decisions by the Italian tax courts, which have alternated between positions in favour and not in favour of the existence of the subjective requirement for VAT exemption.
### Thresholds to opt for the settlement of VAT on a quarterly basis
Taxable person can opt for settlement of VAT on a quarterly basis (in this case, 1% interest is due) if the turnover of the previous calendar year has not exceeded a certain threshold at the following amounts (set by the 2023 Budget Law, starting from January 1, 2023):
  * EUR 500,000 in case of provision of services only.
  * EUR 800,000 in case of supply of goods.


Please note that the previous thresholds, in force until the end of the year 2022, were the following:
  * EUR 400,000 in case of provision of services only.
  * EUR 700,000 in case of supply of goods.


In order to benefit from the above method, an election has to be carried out in the annual VAT return. 
For the above-mentioned taxable persons, the 2021 Budget Law introduced a broader deadline for the registration of the output invoices, i.e. within the end of month following the quarter in which the transaction was carried out and with reference to the month of the tax point.
### Marketplaces
In order to contend with tax evasion on e-commerce and reduce the VAT gap, a specific compliance obligation has been introduced in Italy starting from year 2019 for taxable persons who facilitate, through the use of an electronic interface such as a virtual market, a platform, a portal, or similar means (i.e. marketplaces), distance sales of imported goods or distance sales of goods within the European Union.
By the end of the month following each quarter, the above taxable persons are required to transmit certain information regarding the supplies carried out by each supplier via the above marketplaces.
The above taxable persons are responsible for VAT due for distance sales supplies carried out via the marketplaces for which they have not transmitted or have incompletely transmitted specific data mentioned by the law, unless they can prove that VAT was paid by the supplier.
Specific regulation regarding the context of the communication as well as the technical ways of filling has been issued.
Such specific compliance obligations remained in force until the end of June 2021 as long as the new e-commerce VAT package rules, as implemented by Legislative Decree No. 83/2021, came into force on July 1, 2021. 
Starting from that date, if a taxable person facilitates, through the use of an electronic interface such as a virtual market, a platform, a portal, or similar means,:
  * distance sales of goods imported from third territories or third countries whose intrinsic value does not exceed EUR 150, and/or
  * distance sales and local sales of goods carried out within the European Union by a taxable person not established in the European Union towards a person who is not a taxable person,


the taxable person who facilitates the supply shall be deemed to have received and supplied those goods oneself.
In this respect, such transactions should be split into two different supplies:
  * A first supply between the supplier and the taxable person who facilitates the supply (non-moved supply).
  * A second supply between the taxable person who facilitates the supply and the final customer (moved supply).


In order to declare and pay VAT on their supplies, the taxable persons who facilitate the supply are allowed to opt for OSS/IOSS special regimes (_please see below_).
As part of the actions to contend VAT evasion and fraud, the 2023 Budget Law has introduced new reporting requirements, implying the communication of data of suppliers and of transactions carried out, to be borne by the electronic interface (i.e. marketplaces, digital platforms, digital portals, and similar) that facilitates the online sales to end consumers of certain goods (e.g. mobile phones, gaming consoles, tablet PCs, and laptops) to be identified by decree of the Minister of Economy and Finance, which are present in the territory of the state.
The 2023 Budget Law does not indicate a specific date of effectiveness for this new reporting obligation. Also in this respect, it would be necessary to wait for the issuance of the implementing regulations of the Minister of Economy and Finance within 60 days from the entry into force of the 2023 Budget Law (i.e. December 29, 2022).
### One-stop shop (OSS) / Import one-stop shop (IOSS) regimes
By implementing the new e-commerce VAT package rules, Legislative Decree No. 83/2021 also transposes in Italy the new OSS and IOSS special regimes.
OSS and IOSS are the new optional European VAT clearance system, centralised and digital, that extends the scope of the mini one-stop shop (MOSS), currently covering electronic, telecommunications, and broadcasting services only.
The MOSS is an electronic system that allows taxpayers who provide TTE services in the European Union to declare and pay the VAT due in all the EU member states in a single member state.
As of July 1, 2021, the MOSS has therefore become an OSS and has been extended to all the following B2C transactions:
  * Distance sales of goods imported from third territories or countries (with the exception of goods subject to excise duty) carried out by suppliers and taxable persons facilitating the supply through the use of an electronic interface (to be reported in the IOSS section).
  * Intra-Community distance sales of goods carried out by suppliers and taxable persons facilitating the supply through an electronic interface (to be reported in the OSS section).
  * Domestic sales of goods carried out by taxable persons facilitating the supply through an electronic interface (to be reported in the OSS section).
  * Supplies of services carried out by taxable persons not established in the European Union or by taxable persons established within the European Union but not in the member state of consumption (to be reported in the OSS section).


The OSS scheme simplifies the VAT compliance obligations applicable for taxable persons that sell goods and provide services to final consumers in the European Union, enabling them to:
  * register electronically for VAT purposes in a single member state for all the eligible supplies of goods and provisions of services carried out towards final consumers in the other 26 member states
  * declare VAT by means of a single electronic VAT declaration and make a single payment of the VAT due on all the eligible supplies of goods and services carried out, and
  * collaborate with the tax authorities of the member state in which they are registered for the OSS and in a single language, even if their supplies take place in other EU countries.


In this respect, it is worth reminding that the new legislative provisions abolish the reference thresholds previously in force for the payment of VAT in the country of residence in the context of intra-Community distance sales. With the new regulations, a single threshold of EUR 10,000 is recognised; once this is exceeded, the VAT is applied in the country where the service or sale is to be made.
Moreover, the new provisions also abolish the VAT exemption for goods of negligible value imported into the European Union. Since 1 July, therefore, VAT is due on all the imported goods regardless of their value.
The creation of the IOSS regime allows suppliers who sell goods delivered or transported from a third country or territory to final customers in the European Union to collect VAT from the purchaser on distance sales of low-value imported goods and to declare and pay this tax through the IOSS.
If IOSS is used, the import of low-value goods (with an intrinsic value not exceeding EUR 150) into the European Union is exempt from VAT.
Please note that, since April 1, 2021, on the Italian tax authorities’ website it is possible to register in order to exercise the option for the application of OSS and IOSS special regimes.
The use of the special regimes is optional; however, if a taxpayer exercises the option, it should apply them for all the operations that fall within them.
### Timeline in order to deduct input VAT
A reduction of the time frame for the exercise of the right to deduct VAT has been introduced since 2017.
The right to deduct input VAT may be exercised at the latest with the VAT return related to the year in which the right arises and under the conditions existing at the time of such a right has arisen.
According to the Italian tax authorities' guidelines, _inter alia_ , the time from which the deadline for VAT deduction begins to run is set when the following conditions jointly happen:
  * the tax point occurred (substantive requirement), and
  * a valid invoice is received by the taxpayer (formal requirement).


In practice, a taxpayer that purchased and paid for a service in December 2017 and receives the invoice (dated December 2017) in January 2018 can exercise the right of deduction only from the VAT settlement related to January 2018 and by April 30, 2019 (i.e. deadline for submission of the relevant VAT return). However, VAT deduction must be exercised under the conditions existing at the time of the tax point (i.e. 2017).
Conversely, in case the invoice is received in December 2017, it will be possible to register it by April 30, 2018, but it will be necessary to use a special sectional of the VAT purchase ledger related to 2017; as such, the purchase will be included in the annual VAT return of the same calendar year.
Previously, the right to deduct could be exercised, at the latest, with the VAT return related to the second year following the one in which the right to deduct had arisen.
The Italian tax authorities also clarified that the credit notes as per article 26, paragraph 2, Presidential Decree no. 633/1972 (e.g. following to customer’s insolvency proceedings) have to be issued, and the higher VAT previously paid at the time can be deducted, at the most late, within the deadline for the submission of the annual VAT return re the year in which the right to issue the credit note has arisen. In this respect in the case the right to issue the credit note has arisen during the year X and the related credit note has been issued in the following year (i.e. year X+1) within the deadline for the submission of the annual VAT return of the year X, the above-mentioned credit note has to be included in the VAT settlement of the month of issuance or, at the latest, in the annual VAT return of the same year (i.e. X+1).
Starting from October 23, 2018, the right to deduct input VAT can be anticipated at the deadline of the VAT settlement in relation to the purchase invoices received and registered within the 15th of the month following the one in which the transaction is carried out.
By way of example, input VAT deduction on a purchase invoice whose tax point occurs on January 31, 2019 can be exercised with the January VAT settlement provided that the invoice is received and registered by February 15, 2019.
This possibility is not provided (as already introduced from 2017) for invoices received related to transactions carried out in the previous year. In this case, VAT must be deducted in the year in which the invoice is received.
### **VAT deduction of the transactions costs incurred in the context of leveraged buy-out merger operations (also “MLBO”)**
The Supreme Court, with the cases no. 22608/2024 and 22649/2024, has opened to the possibility to deduct input VAT on the so-called "transaction costs" incurred by special purpose vehicles ("SPV") in the context of merger leveraged buy out ("MLBO") operations. The Supreme Court judges, overturning the constant practice of the Italian tax authorities on the matter (2), have stated that the VAT paid on such costs is deductible since they represent for the SPV preliminary costs to the performance of an economic activity.
Both cases are based on the valorization of the role of the SPV, which, according to the Italian Court, should be considered, rather than as a mere vehicle for the acquisition of the so-called "target" company, in the same way as a VAT taxable person who is preparing to carry out an economic activity relevant for VAT purposes.
Even if the Supreme Court cases’ principle in comment should be welcomed, it is believed that an immediate and generalized application of the same in the varied panorama of MLBO operations may still be premature, exposing economic operators to the risk of challenge by the Italian tax authorities, which has not yet taken any steps back on its orientation on the matter.
(2) See, inter alia, Italian tax authorities’ circular letter no. 6/22016 and Ruling n. 17/2019, on the basis of which the check on whether a subject has to be considered as a taxable person and the right to deduction in the context of MLBO operations should be checked by applying the same principles expressed by the Court of Justice of the European Union in the matter of holding companies.
### European Court of Justice (ECJ) Case no. C-341/22 - Right to deduction and 'non-operational company'
On March 7, 2024, the ECJ issued the Judgement in the case C-341/22 (_Feudi di San Gregorio Aziende Agricole SpA_) regarding the right to deduct input VAT for an Italian company which was deemed 'non-operational' according to the Italian tax Law.
In summary, according to the Italian tax Law, the right to deduct input VAT paid or to ask input VAT for refund may be denied to a company that carries out transactions subject to VAT while not reaching the income threshold provided for by the Italian tax Law at issue, where that company does not demonstrate that objective circumstances rendered it impossible to achieve income higher than that threshold.
With the above-mentioned cases, ECJ stated that the above-mentioned Law provision is not compliant with the VAT Directive (i.e. EU Directive no. 112/2006). In fact, the status of a taxable person, and the related right to deduct input VAT, is not subject to satisfying a particular threshold of transactions and should only be determined according to whether that person actually carries out an economic activity.
### Issuance of credits notes in the case of insolvency proceedings
The right to recover VAT beyond the annual year limit is also applicable in the event of non-payment of the consideration, in whole or in part, by the customer, starting from the date on which the latter has been subjected to an insolvency procedure.
The debtor is considered subjected to insolvency proceedings from the date of the decision declaring the bankruptcy (or the act of compulsory administrative liquidation or the decree of admission to the procedure of arrangement with creditors or the decree that provides for the extraordinary administration procedure of large companies in crisis).
If the consideration is paid in whole or in part, the repayment of the recovered VAT regarding the credit note is due by the supplier.
According to the Italian tax authorities:
  * With reference to the issue of the creditor’s prior introduction to the debtor’s liabilities as a prerequisite for the recovery of the VAT, the issuance of the credit note (from the date the insolvency procedure starts) is not precluded to the creditor who decided to not join to the procedure. Therefore, the previous tax authority’s practice that subordinated the issuance of the credit note to the 'necessary participation of the creditor to the procedure' has been replaced.
  * With reference to the deadline within which the creditor can issue the credit note and exercise, consequently, the right of VAT recovery, the Italian tax authorities provide with the following example, confirming the content of the above-mentioned Ruling no. 119/2021: 
    * In the case of sentence declaring the bankruptcy of the debtor in the course of 2022, the creditor will have the right to issue the credit note in the same year and recover VAT, at the latest, with the annual VAT return to be submitted within April, 30 2023 (relating to the 2022);
    * however, it is also possible for the creditor to issue the credit note within the first four months of 2023 (deadline for submission of VAT return relating 2022) and, in such a case, exercise the right to the VAT recovery in the periodical settlement of issuance of the credit note or in the annual VAT return to be submitted within April 30, 2024 (relating to 2023).


The new provisions apply in relation to insolvency proceedings starting from May 26, 2021.
In this respect, the Italian tax authorities, with the Response no. 485/2022, have clarified that, in the case the creditor has decided not to issue the credit note at the beginning of the insolvency procedure but decided to join the insolvency procedure and wait for the declaration of failure of the latter, the taxable person is entitled to issue the credit note with the definitiveness of the unfruitful distribution plan that certifies the definitive non-payment by the customer.
As provided by the Italian Law, the possibility of issuance of credit note at the beginning of the procedure applies also to the procedures regarding the negotiated settlement of the crisis (i.e. ’ _composizione negoziata della crisi_ ‘) referred to in article 23, paragraph 1, letters a) and c) and paragraph 2, letter b), Legislative Decree 14/2019 Code of business crisis and insolvency (i.e. ’ _Codice della crisi d'impresa e dell'insolvenza_ ’).
In this case, creditors who, following the above-mentioned negotiation, have reached an agreement with the debtor with consequent reduction of their credits can proceed with the reducing of the original credit. In particular, the credit note can be issued, starting from the date of the publication in the Register of Companies of the above-mentioned agreement or the application for approval of a debt restructuring agreement, in the event of an unsuccessful outcome of the negotiations.
### European VAT group
The deadline for option is September 30 for VAT groups effective from the following year (in the case the option is elected from 1 October to 31 December, the VAT group is effective from the second following year).
In the main, in the case of election of the VAT group:
  * transactions between taxable persons participating in the VAT group are considered as not relevant for VAT purposes (apart from certain cases), and
  * the VAT group operates as a single VATable person towards those not participating in the group itself.


There are certain conditions to be met in order to be entitled for the election.
Starting from 23 October 2018, European VAT group rules also apply to VATable persons established in Italy who participate in a Cooperative Banking Group (_Gruppo Bancario Cooperativo_). 
The current VAT group settlement regime, which consists of settlement of VAT debits and credits among taxable persons meeting certain requirements in terms of chain of controls, will remain in place.
Via a legislative provision published in 2020, under specific conditions, VAT exemption has been confirmed applicable also for the past and to services rendered by consortia, consortium companies, and cooperative companies with consortium functions (hereinafter 'consortium') towards a consortium member who is also a member of a VAT group, where the consortium is not part of it.
The above-mentioned law also provides for a specific way of calculation of one of the conditions (pro rata of deduction) for the VAT exemption in the case of a VAT group.
### Italian tax authorities’ guidelines in case of a UK VAT group
As a general rule, where either a branch and/or the head office/’sister‘ branch is a member of a EU VAT group, supplies of services from a VAT point of view are relevant for VAT purposes (since the mentioned ’entities‘ are considered as separate taxable persons).
In the light of the evolution of the guidelines of the VAT Committee of the European Commission, the Italian tax authorities clarified that:
  1. A VAT group set up in the United Kingdom, after the so called ’Brexit‘, is not the same as a VAT group set up in a member state for the purposes of the application of the VAT Law and, in particular, of the principle expressed in Skandia judgement (C-7/13).
  2. In the light of the above, the supplies of services or goods carried out between the two branches of the same legal entity, e.g. branch established in Italy and branch established in the United Kingdom, the latter being a member of a VAT group established in the United Kingdom, are excluded from the scope of application of VAT (i.e. Skandia principles are not applicable) since the VAT group set up in a third country (United Kingdom) is not comparable to a VAT group set up in a member state of the European Union.


### Reporting obligations
In addition to the new monthly communication of the data regarding the purchases and sales transactions carried out with foreign counterparts to the SDI, taxable persons have to submit to the Italian tax authorities, on a quarterly basis, the communications of the periodic VAT balances.
The communications of periodic VAT balances require one to submit electronically to the Italian tax authorities, on a quarterly basis, the summary of VAT balances accounting data (also in case the entity results in a credit position). The deadlines for each quarter are May 31, September 30, November 30, and the last day of February of the following year (in case the deadline is Saturday/Sunday/bank holiday, it is postponed to the first working day that follows).
The communication of periodic VAT balances of the fourth quarter where the relevant data are, alternatively, included in the annual VAT return. In this case, the annual VAT return must be submitted by the end of February of the following year (e.g. the communication of the fourth quarter of 2019 can be avoided provided the relevant data are included in the 2019 VAT return to be submitted by the end of February 2020; the standard deadline of the annual VAT return would be April 2020).
### Service supply rules
Generic services supplied by a taxable person to another taxable person (business-to-business or B2B) are in the scope of the Italian VAT if the services are supplied to Italian taxable persons or to PEs of an Italian non-resident entity.
The specific rules are as follows:
  * For services related to immovable property, reference must be made to the place in which the immovable property is located.
  * For the transportation of passengers, the place in which the transportation takes place must be identified, including the proportion of the distance covered.
  * For catering and restaurant services, the place in which the activity will be physically carried out must be identified.
  * For short-term hiring, leasing, and similar means of obtaining transport services, the place in which the vehicle is used must be identified (use and enjoyment rule has been implemented on these services).


The general rule for services supplied by a taxable person to a non-taxable person (B2C) identifies the place of taxation with the country of residence of the supplier.
Several rules, in addition to the B2B general rules, exist for the following:
  * Brokerage services.
  * Goods transport services.
  * Services related to movable goods and ancillary activities related to transports.
  * Long-term hiring/leasing of means of transport services.
  * Electronic services supplied by extra-European Union suppliers.
  * Telecommunications and television/radio broadcast services.


In addition, special rules are provided for certain services rendered to final customers established outside the European Union.
In relation to the VAT treatment of cultural, artistic, sporting, scientific, educational, recreational, and similar services, VAT is due in the country where the activities were physically carried out for B2C activities and VAT is due in the country of the recipient for B2B activities other than admission. For B2B services in respect of admission, the place of supply is where the events take place.
### Time of supply for certain services
Time of supply is the time of completion in case of:
  * supply of services falling under the general rule (i.e. generic supply of services) rendered by EU and non-EU taxable persons to taxable persons established in Italy, and
  * supply of services falling under the general rule rendered by taxable persons established in Italy to EU and non-EU taxable persons.


In case of periodic or continuous supply of services, the time of supply is the date of maturity of the consideration.
Moreover, the above supplies of services, if performed/received by taxable persons established in Italy continuously over a period longer than one year and if no payments are carried out, even partially, in the same period, shall be considered carried out at the end of each calendar year up to completion of the same supplies.
### Reverse-charge mechanism
According to the reverse-charge mechanism, the obligations related to supply of goods and provision of services carried out in Italy by non-resident taxable persons towards taxable persons established in Italy are fulfilled by the latter. The recipient of goods and/or services has to integrate the invoice received by the EU supplier or has to issue a self-invoice in case of a non-EU supplier and record it in the VAT sales register and VAT purchase register within a defined timeline.
Reverse-charge mechanism also applies to certain domestic supplies between Italian taxable persons (e.g. cleaning, demolition, equipment installation, and completion services related to the buildings). Please note that for certain supply of goods (e.g. supplies of gas and electricity to taxable dealer; supplies of gas and electricity certificates; supplies of mobile telephones), the reverse-charge mechanism is applicable on a temporary basis and on the optional decision of Italy as a EU member state, according to article 199-bis, paragraph 1, EU Directive no. 112/2006 (i.e. so-called 'VAT Directive'). In this respect, please note that the EU Directive no. 2022/890 has just postponed the deadline for the EU member states to adopt the above-mentioned 'optional reverse-charge mechanism' from June 30, 2022 to December 31, 2026. In this respect, Italy has just transposed the aforementioned law provision (art. 22, Law Decree no. 73 dated June 21, 2022). 
The application of the reverse-charge mechanism also applies to the provision of services (with certain exceptions) carried out through procurement contracts, subcontracting contracts, contracts of reliance to consortium members, or other contractual relationships however named, which are carried out with the prevalent use of manpower at the client's premises and with the use of capital goods owned by the client or attributable to the latter in any form (the effectiveness of the above-mentioned law provision is subject to the issuance, by the Council of the European Union, of a specific authorisation).
The omitted reverse charge is punished with the penalty for undue input VAT deduction (i.e. 70% of input VAT that could have been deducted for the violations committed from September 1, 2024) in the case the violation is committed in the case of non-existent supplies within a fraud or evasion and where it is proved that the purchaser/recipient was aware of it.
According to the 2025 Budget Law, the reverse charge mechanism is extended to the provision of services carried out through procurement contracts, subcontracting, assignment to consortium members or business relationships characterized by a prevalent use of labor and capital goods owned by the client, rendered to companies that carry out transport and handling of goods and logistics services. 
The effectiveness of the provision is subject to the release of a specific authorization by the Council of the European Union. On this point, pending the full effectiveness of the provisions above, the supplier and the client may opt for the payment of VAT on the services rendered to be made by the client in the name and on behalf of the supplier, who is jointly liable for the VAT due. In particular, the option has a three-year duration and is communicated by the client to the Italian Tax Authorities with a specific form that will be approved by the director of the Italian Tax Authorities and made available on the Italian Tax Authorities's institutional website. The invoice is issued by the supplier, pursuant to art. 21, Presidential Decree no. 633/1972, and the VAT is paid by the client, without the possibility to offset. On this point, in the event that the VAT is not due, the right to reimbursement belongs to the client provided that it demonstrates the actual payment of the VAT. The latter would also be subject to the application of the penalty, pursuant to art. 6, paragraph 9-bis, Legislative Decree no. 471 of 1997, payment of which the provider is jointly liable.
### Split-payment mechanism
The split payment is the mechanism provided for by article 17-ter Presidential Decree no. 633/1972 applicable for supplies of goods or services relevant for VAT purposes carried out towards, mainly, the Public Administrations (please note that the Italian VAT Law and specific Ministerial Decrees duly established the list of taxable persons subjected to the above-mentioned mechanism). 
According to the above-mentioned mechanism, the Public Administration pays to its supplier the amount net of VAT for the purchase of goods and services, while the relative VAT, quoted in the invoice issued by the supplier, is paid directly to the Treasury by the Public Administration itself.
Italy is authorised by EU Council to continue to apply the split payment mechanism until 30 June 2026 but, starting from July 1, 2025, the split payment regime will not be applied to the transactions carried out towards companies listed on the stock exchange that are included in the Financial Times Stock Exchange Milano Indice di Borsa (‘FTSE MIB’) index (and quoted yearly in the Italian Official Gazette). Therefore, for the period July 1, 2025 to June 30, 2026, split payment mechanism will apply to the transactions carried out towards public administrations and companies controlled by public administration according to article 2359 of the Civil Code.
### VAT credit offset with other taxes
To offset a VAT credit against other taxes for an amount higher than EUR 5,000, it is necessary to wait until the 16th day of the month following the filing of the yearly VAT return on which the credit is shown.
The threshold to offset tax credits (including VAT) with other taxes or social contributions, via the F24 form, or through simplified tax refund procedure, has been increased up to EUR 2 million (FY 2022 Budget Law).
Furthermore, in order to avoid abuse, taxpayers intending to offset a VAT credit for an amount higher than EUR 5,000 are required to ask their tax advisors or auditors to affix their signature to the VAT return, which is known as the ‘conformity mark’ (i.e.  _visto di conformità_).
Further restrictions for the offsetting of the credits with other tax debits have been introduced (2024 Budget Law). In particular, the offset is prevented for taxable persons who have to pay taxes due for committed violations (so-called '_iscrizione a ruolo_ ') or executive tax assessment entrusted to the Revenue Agency for amounts in total exceeding EUR 100,000 (for which the payment terms expired and payments are still due or the payment is not suspended).
With the Circular Letter no. 16/E, dated June 28, 2024 , the Italian tax authorities provided clarifications regarding, inter alia, changes in the procedure of tax credit offset according to article 17, Legislative Decree no. 241/1997.
In particular, it has been introduced the general obligation to use only the telematic services provided by the Italian tax authorities (i.e., through the submission of the F24 form) for all payments carried out by offsetting debits with tax credits, of any nature and amount, starting from July 1, 2024.
In more detail, the obligation to carry out the payments referred to in article 17, Legislative Decree no. 241/1997, exclusively through the electronic services provided by the Italian tax authorities, has been introduced also in the case where, after the offset, a balance is still due (before the change, the obligation to use the mentioned electronic services was just in the case of zero balance, after the offset). Moreover, the Circular Letter clarified that the offset subject to the above mentioned obligation is not just those between different taxes, according article 17, Legislative Decree no. 241/1997 (i.e., “compensazione orizzontale”), but also the offset between the same type of tax (i.e. “compensazione verticale”).
From a first reading of the Circular Letter, the extension of the obligation also to the so called “compensazione verticale” does not seem to be perfectly in line with the legislative provision. Having said that, following the Italian tax authorities’ guidelines, the payments of VAT debts, resulting from monthly and quarterly settlements done, from July 1, 2024, even partially, through the offset with an annual/quarterly VAT credit (accrued prior to the accrual of said VAT debt), must be made exclusively through the electronic submission of the F24 model.
So, in the case of offset of the VAT credit resulting from the annual VAT return 2024 (related to 2023), which has not been included in the periodic VAT settlements prior to July 1, 2024, with a VAT debt, relating to monthly VAT settlements from June to December 2024, must be shown in F24. The same applies to quarterly VAT credits emerging from VAT TR models (forms related to the quarterly VAT credit asked for refund/to be offset).
### Provisions to prevent the opening of fictitious Italian VAT numbers
The 2023 Budget Law provides for some measures to prevent the opening of fictitious Italian VAT numbers. More in detail, the Italian tax authorities have the task of carrying out specific analysis of the risk related to the issue of new Italian VAT numbers, at the end of which it may invite the taxable person to appear in person to produce the compulsory accounting records required by the Italian VAT Law to verify the actual activity carried out and to demonstrate the absence of the identified risk profiles. Should the taxable person fail to appear or should the outcome of the checks on the documents produced be negative, the Italian tax authorities may decide to terminate the Italian VAT number.
The application for an Italian VAT number may subsequently be submitted by the same person, as an individual entrepreneur, self-employed person, or legal representative of a company, association or entity, with or without legal personality, set up after the termination of the VAT number. However, this requires the prior issuance of a surety policy or bank guarantee for an amount of no less than EUR 50,000 with a duration of three years from the date of issue.
The 2023 Budget Law has introduced the provision of an administrative penalty of EUR 3,000 to be applied at the same time as the above-mentioned termination of the VAT registration, without the possibility of applying penalty reduction (so-called _'cumulo giuridico_ ’).
### Checks on VAT registration numbers
There are certain checks that the Italian tax authorities have to carry out in relation to the attribution of a VAT number to taxable persons, such as:
  * newly assigned VAT numbers, characterised by a short period of operation and link to a failure to fulfil the reporting and tax payment obligations, and
  * existing VAT numbers, specifically those that 'after a period of inactivity or following changes in the object or in the structure, restart to operate with the aforementioned characteristics'.


In particular, the Italian tax authorities will carry out specific risk analyses on VATable persons, following which, the taxpayer may be invited to appear at the offices to show their accounting records. If the taxpayer does not comply with the above-mentioned request or does not provide the elements suitable for demonstrating the non-existence of the risk profiles, the Italian tax authorities’ office in charge notifies the provision of termination of the VAT number together with the penalties.
The recipient of the provision can subsequently request the attribution of a new VAT number, only upon presentation of a bank guarantee in favour of the Italian tax authorities for a period of three years and for an amount, in any case, not less than EUR 50,000.
### **Warranty obligation for fiscal representatives and non-EU taxpayers intending to carry out intra-EU transactions in Italy**
With two new ministerial decrees dated 4th and 9th December 2024, the Ministry of Finance has implemented the new obligations introduced by legislative decree No. 13 of February 12th, 2024.
In implementation of the new paragraph 7 quater of Art. 35 of d.P.R. 633/72 (“VAT Decree”) and the new phrase of paragraph 3 of Art. 17 of the VAT Decree, those intending to assume the role of fiscal representative of foreign entities not established for VAT purposes in Italy must jointly:
  1. possess the personal integrity requirements indicated by Art. 8, para. 1, lett. a), b), c) and d) of Ministerial Decree no. 164 of May 31th, 1999;
  2. submit to the competent Provincial Directorate of the Italian tax authorities on the basis of the fiscal domicile of the fiscal representative (hereinafter referred to as “competent PD”) a notarial deed pursuant to Arts. 46 and 47 of Presidential Decree 445/2000, aimed at attesting the existence of the aforementioned personal integrity requirements;
  3. personally provide an appropriate guarantee to the competent PD if they intend to represent multiple entities;
  4. verify the completeness of the documentation and information set produced by the represented entity established outside the EU, in order to include their VAT number in the VIES database, and its corresponding accuracy to the information in their possession.
  5. Fiscal representatives who meet the requirements of integrity and have provided adequate guarantee will be available for consultation on the Italian tax authorities’ website.


Fiscal representatives who, on the contrary, do not fulfill the new guarantee obligations are subject to an administrative penalty ranging from 3,000 euros to 50,000 euros, without the possibility of applying the legal cumulation.
The guarantee referred to in point sub. 3 must be personally submitted by the fiscal representative and must meet the following requirements:
  * Form: (i) collateral in government bonds or bonds guaranteed by the government; or (ii) bank guarantee; or (iii) guarantee insurance policy;
  * Beneficiary: acting director pro tempore of the competent Provincial Directorate of the Italian tax authorities on the basis of the fiscal domicile of the fiscal representative (hereinafter “competent DP”);
  * Minimum amount:
    * EUR 30,000.00, if the representatives are min. 2 max 9;
    * EUR 100,000.00, if the representatives are min. 10 max 50;
    * EUR 300,000.00, if the representatives are min. 51 max 100;
    * EUR 1,000,000.00, if the representatives are min. 101 max 1,000;
    * EUR 2,000,000.00, if the representatives are more than 1,000.00.
  * Submission method: personally by the fiscal representative to the competent DP;
  * Duration: for a minimum period of 48 months from the date of assuming the role of fiscal representative, i.e. from the date of submission of the guarantee to the competent DP (after which it does not need to be resubmitted).


Furthermore, with the ministerial decree of December 4, 2024, the Ministry of Finance has outlined the criteria and methods for issuing the guarantee that non-EU taxable persons – identified in Italy through a fiscal representative as per Art. 17, paragraph 3, of the VAT Decree – must present in order to include their VAT number in the VIES database to carry out intra-EU transactions in Italy.
This guarantee must be presented directly by the non-EU entity or through their fiscal representative to the competent DP and must meet the same formal requirements mentioned above for the fiscal representative’s guarantee. In this case, the minimum amount to be guaranteed must be equal to 50,000.00 euros for a minimum duration of 36 months from the date the guarantee is submitted (after which - even in this case - it does not need to be resubmitted).
On this matter, both the Italian tax authorities and the Italian financial police will jointly conduct specific risk analyses aimed at identifying the fiscal representatives of non-EU entities that present indicators of risk regarding the proper fulfillment of obligations to verify the completeness and accuracy of documents produced by the foreign entity.
For both changes to become operational, it is still necessary to wait for the issuance of two provisions by the Director of the Italian tax authorities, who has been entrusted with the operational aspects.
Finally, it is worth noting that the changes will also apply to fiscal representatives and non-EU entities (which carry out intra-EU transactions) even before the entry into force of the regulation and that they will continue to operate in the same manner. Indeed, the fiscal representatives, who will act as such on the date of publication of the relevant operational measure, will be required to submit the declaration of notarial deed and the guarantee within 60 days from that date, under penalty of termination of the VAT number of the foreign subject. Similarly, non-EU subjects who, on the date of publication of the relevant operational measure, are already included in the VIES, will be required to present the guarantee within 60 days from that date, under penalty of exclusion from the aforementioned database.
### **Secondment of staff - taxable for VAT purposes from January 1, 2025**
Secondment of staff occurs when an employer, to satisfy their own interest, temporarily makes one or more employees available to another entity for the execution of a specific work activity (art. 30, paragraph 1, Legislative Decree no. 276/2003).
From January 1, 2025, the VAT treatment of secondments of staff will undergo significant changes.
As a result of art. 16-ter, Decree-Law no. 131/2024 (added by conversion law no. 166/2024), the current reference legislative provision, i.e., art. 8, paragraph 35, Law no. 67/1988, will be repealed starting from personnel loans and secondments stipulated or renewed from January 1, 2025.
According to art. 8, paragraph 35, Law no. 67/1988, “loans or secondments of staff for which only the reimbursement of the related cost is paid are not considered relevant for VAT purposes.” As clarified by the United Sections of the Court of Cassation in judgment no. 23021/2011, this legislative provision applies only in cases where the amount paid by the seconding party exactly corresponds to the wages and social security charges of the seconded personnel, which are legally borne by the seconding party.
Regarding the compatibility of the aforementioned article with Directive 2006/112/EC (hereinafter “VAT Directive”), the European Court of Justice (hereinafter “CJEU”) intervened with the judgment of March 11, 2020, in case C-94/19, San Domenico Vetraria (hereinafter “San Domenico Vetraria judgment”). In this judgment, the EU judges ruled that a national legislation under which loans or secondments of staff from a parent company to its subsidiary, for which only the reimbursement of the related cost is paid, are not considered relevant for VAT purposes, is not compliant with the VAT Directive. This is provided that the amounts paid by the subsidiary to the parent company and such loans or secondments are mutually conditional. The EU judges referred to the referring court to verify this circumstance. The repeal of the mentioned article followed discussions with European institutions to avoid an infringement procedure for failure to implement the aforementioned CJEU judgment.
The new legislation stipulates that secondments and loans of staff stipulated or renewed from January 1, 2025, will be taxable for VAT purposes, regardless of whether the seconding company pays an amount equal to, less than, or greater than the personnel cost. The repeal of the legislative on secondments presents interpretative and practical application uncertainties.
One aspect concerns the determination of the VAT taxable base for secondments and personnel loans. 
### Another aspect to consider concerns the effective date of the repeal of the mentioned art. 8. It is provided that the legislative provision is considered repealed for personnel loans and secondments stipulated or renewed from January 1, 2025. There is no reference to the execution of supplies, provided by art. 6, Presidential Decree no. 633/1972. In the past, regarding new legislative provisions whose entry into force was linked to the stipulation or renewal of the contract, the Italian tax authorities clarified that the changes applied also with reference to renewals – both express and tacit – as well as extensions that occur after the aforementioned date of December 31, 2015, even if referring to contracts concluded between the parties before that date. For the purpose of identifying, from a temporal perspective, the applicable discipline, reference is made to the date of stipulation, renewal, or extension of the contracts in question.
### Sale and lease back: clarification on VAT treatment by the Italian authorities
With Resolution no. 3 of February 3, 2023, the Italian tax authorities have provided guidelines on the VAT treatment to apply on the sale and lease back agreement, that is a sale agreement with a lease back.
In brief, the Italian tax authorities have stated that some elements of the contractual arrangements may constitute significant indices in order to evaluate the transaction for VAT purposes as a supply of goods or rather as a purely financial operation.
In particular, for example, the following are indicative of an exclusively financial nature of the transaction:
  * The presence, within the regulation of the contractual relationship, of clauses that exclude or significantly limit the leasing company’s power to legally dispose of the asset as owner (e.g. clauses that expressly limit the owner’s prerogatives, precluding the possibility of selling the asset or granting it as a guarantee to third parties).
  * The provision of faculties, contractually granted to the user of the asset, which are particularly incisive and stringent, such that it is the latter who retains the right to dispose of the asset 'as if [one] were the owner' (e.g. conventional clauses limiting the liability of the formal owner that, in effect, highlight that the user continues to bear most of the risks and benefits related to the legal ownership of the asset).


The qualification of the sale and lease back must, therefore, be left to the interpreter according to a case-by-case approach.
### Italian tax authorities Circular no. 30 of October 27, 2023: first considerations on the VAT treatment of crypto-assets
The Italian tax authorities have provided some comments on the VAT treatment of crypto-assets, although not regulated by the aforementioned Finance Law.
As a preliminary remark, the Italian tax authorities have recalled the fact that there is a lack of a specific VAT legislation at the domestic and EU level and the necessity, for the time being, to refer to international best practice and guidelines at the European level.
In addition, the Italian tax authorities emphasise how, for the topic under analysis, it is necessary to adopt a look-through approach also for the determination of the VAT treatment of crypto-assets, as well as recommend a case-by-case analysis: this is due to the fact that this is a constantly evolving topic “linked to the use of technologies that are themselves constantly advancing and whose potential developments cannot be imagined at present”. The Italian tax authorities also suggest that it is not the _nomen juris_ attributed to the instrument by the issuer what matters but an analysis of its substance is required.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, without claiming to be exhaustive, the Italian tax authorities have anyway provided more comprehensive guidelines compared to previous clarifications. A case-by-case analysis remains necessary whenever the actual cases and the characteristics of each case do not correspond to the categories of instruments already known and for which an assessment has already been made by the Italian tax authorities.
### Reporting obligations for payment service providers with reference to cross-border payment (CESOP)
On November 3, 2023, a new reporting obligation has been introduced for payment service providers in relation to cross-border transactions.
These new obligations are part of the European Union's action plan to fight VAT fraud in e-commerce.
Please see below a summary of the new obligations as well as the highlights of the implementation of the CESOP Directive in Italy.
A EU platform called Central Electronic System of Payment information (hereinafter, ’CESOP‘) has been created for the reporting and storage of cross-border payment information and for the further processing of such data by member states’ anti-fraud officers. The data will be made available to the local tax authorities under specific conditions, in line with current data protection legislation.
The new obligations require payment service providers (PSPs) to (i) transmit on a quarterly basis certain data on cross-border payments to the tax authorities of the relevant member states, starting from those made from January 1, 2024, as well as (ii) store the relevant data for a period of three years starting from the end of the year in which the original payments were carried out.
Having received the data from the PSPs, the Italian tax authorities transmit them to CESOP by the tenth day of the second month following the end of the reporting period.
#### CESOP Directive in Italy
The ’entities in scope‘ of the new obligations are the PSPs as defined pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 11 of 27 January 2010 (implementing in Italy PSD Directive), i.e. ’electronic money institutions and payment institutions, as well as credit institutions, Poste Italiane S.p.A. [Italian post office institutions, which are entitled under national law to provide payment services], the European Central Bank, national central banks, national and local public bodies when not acting in their capacity as monetary authority, or other public authorities’.
The obligation to collect and report the payment information is related to cross-border payments, i.e. payments made by a payer located in an EU member state to a payee located in another jurisdiction (i.e. in another EU member state, in a third territory, or in a third country).
The obligation to report the cross-border data is triggered when a PSP processes more than 25 cross-border payments towards the same payee during a calendar quarter.
Cross-border payments data for which Italy is the ’member state of origin‘ of the PSP (i.e. the member state in which a PSP has requested and obtained its payment licence, which may be the member state in which the PSP has its registered office or head office) must be reported to the Italian tax authorities. In the event that a PSP operates in different member states, other than the member state of origin, the data of the cross-border payments for which Italy is the ’host member state‘ (i.e. any member state, other than the member state of origin, in which the PSP is providing payment services either via an agent, a branch or directly) must be reported to the Italian tax authorities.
In case the PSPs of the payer and of the payee are located within the territory of the European Union (as inferred by the BIC or any other available identification code), the reporting obligation shall fall exclusively on the PSP of the payee.
This reporting will take place on a quarterly basis starting from January 2024 and will require PSPs to submit the data to the local tax authorities of the member states of origin or of the host member state at the latest by the end of the month following the calendar quarter to which the data refers.
With specific reference to the obligation to store the data of the cross-border payments subject to transmission, as anticipated, they must be stored for a period of three years starting from the end of the year in which the original payments were carried out.
The documents/information that PSPs will need to store are:
  * The BIC or any other business identifier code that unambiguously identifies the PSP.
  * The name or business name of the payee, as it appears in the records of the PSP. 
  * If available, any VAT identification number or other national tax number of the payee.
  * The IBAN or, if the IBAN is not available, any other identifier that unambiguously identifies and provides info on the location of the payee. 
  * The BIC or any other business identifier code that unambiguously identifies, and gives the location of, the payment service provider acting on behalf of the payee where the payee receives funds without having any payment account.
  * If available, the address of the payee as it appears in the records of the PSP.
  * The details of any cross-border payment and the details of any payment refunds, i.e.:
    * The date and time of the payment or of the payment refund.
    * The amount and the currency of the payment or of the payment refund.
    * The member state of origin of the payment received by or on behalf of the payee, the member state of destination of the refund, as appropriate, and the information used to determine the origin or the destination of the payment or of the payment refund.
    * Any reference that unambiguously identifies the payment.
    * Where applicable, information that the payment is initiated at the physical premises of the merchant.


Moreover, the Implementing Decree specifies the penalties applicable in case of violation of the report/storage obligations. In particular:
  * In case of violations regarding the storage of the CESOP data, fixed administrative penalties in a range from EUR 1,000 to EUR 8,000 are applicable.
  * In case of violation of the filing obligations that occurred up to August 31, 2024, fixed administrative penalties in a range from EUR 2,000 to EUR 21,000 are applicable. In case of violation of the filing obligations that occurred from September 1, 2024 onwards, fixed administrative penalties in a range from EUR 1,500 to EUR 15,000 are applicable.


## Registration tax
Specific deeds and contracts must be filed with the local registration tax office either upon signature or if specific circumstances occur, and the relevant tax must be paid.
Depending on the nature of the contract and on the assets that are the object of the contract, as well as on the form of the contract, registration tax is levied as a fixed amount or as a percentage of the value of the goods and/or rights that are the object of the contract. As a general rule, no proportional registration tax is due in the case of transactions subject to VAT.
## VAT and registration tax on lease of immovable properties
Leases of residential and commercial buildings, or portions thereof, generally are exempt from VAT with no right to deduction and subject to the registration tax at a 2% or 1% rate.
Different VAT rates, VAT treatment, and registration tax treatment apply depending on the type of buildings the lease refers to (e.g. residential, commercial buildings) and the supplier (e.g. individual, construction companies, taxable persons other than construction companies).
Specific rules apply in case of financial leases of residential and commercial buildings from a registration tax perspective.
## Customs duties
At the moment of the importation of goods into the EU territory, customs duties are applied. The amount of customs duties to pay depends on the value and nature of the goods imported. In particular, for each kind of good, the Common Customs Tariff provides a tax rate to be applied to the value or number of the goods imported.
The correct classification of the goods is one of the most important issues to consider when an economic operator introduces goods in Italy. A wrong classification can give rise to the application of higher customs duties, and the operator could face a tax burden not due, or to the application of lower customs duties, and this situation could lead to a tax assessment by the Italian Customs Authority.
The value of the goods is represented by the transaction value, hence, the price actually paid or payable for the goods when sold for exportation to the customs territory of the EU, provided that:
  * there are no restrictions as to the disposal or use of the goods by the buyer
  * the sale or price is not subject to some condition or consideration for which a value cannot be determined with respect to the goods being valued
  * part of the profits of any subsequent resale, disposal, or use of the goods by the buyer will not be accrued, directly or indirectly, to the seller, and
  * the buyer and seller are not related, or, where the buyer and seller are related, that the transaction value is acceptable for customs purposes.


In determining whether the transaction value is acceptable, the fact that the buyer and the seller are related is not, in itself, sufficient for considering the transaction value as not acceptable. Where necessary, the circumstances surrounding the sale are examined, and the transaction value is accepted if the relationship did not influence the price.
The price actually paid or payable is the total transaction amount paid for the imported goods and includes all payments made as a condition of sale of the imported goods by the buyer to the seller or by the buyer to a third party to satisfy an obligation of the seller.
In determining the customs value, the following items shall be added to the price, to the extent that they are incurred by the buyer and are not included in the price (list not exhaustive):
  * Commissions and brokerage.
  * Royalties and licence fees related to the goods under assessment.
  * The cost of transport and insurance of the imported goods.


At the same time, provided that they are shown separately from the price actually paid or payable, the following items shall not be included in the customs value (list not exhaustive):
  * Charges for the transport of goods after their arrival at the place of introduction into the customs territory of the European Union.
  * Charges for construction, erection, assembly, maintenance, or technical assistance, undertaken after importation of imported goods such as industrial plant, machinery, or equipment.
  * Buying commissions.


A reduced or zero rate of duty at importation can be applied when the goods imported have a preferential origin. The preferential origin depends on the existence of commercial agreements between the European Union and other non-EU states or by facilities provided by the European Union to non-EU states unilaterally.
The application of a reduced or zero rate of duty can even depend on the existence of preferential tariff treatment or on the existence of a particular exemption provided by law for some kind of goods.
Any person may appoint a representative in one's dealings with the Customs Authority to perform the activities and formalities laid down by customs rules. Such representation may be direct, in which case the representative shall act in the name and on behalf of another person, or indirect, in which case the representatives shall act in one's own name but on behalf of another person.
For direct representation, a forwarding agent, holder of a particular licence, must be appointed.
The representative must be established within the European Union.
### Re-engineering of the electronic import clearance system
As of November 30, 2022, the Italian Customs Authority, as part of the re-engineering project of the electronic import clearance system, announced the definitive dismissal of the IM message in favour of the new telematic tracks for the transmission of the customs declarations.
The implementation of the above-mentioned telematic tracks means that the customs declaration is originated by the exchange of data through electronic messages, thus removing the necessity and also the possibility of getting the Single Administrative Document (i.e. SAD).
In order to register the transaction in the VAT ledgers and deduct the relevant import VAT, operators must therefore download a new document from their reserved area on the Italian Customs Authority website called _’prospetto di riepilogo ai fini contabili_ ‘. This document is in PDF format.
As clarified by the Italian Tax Authority with the Ruling no. 417/2022, documents other than the _’prospetto di riepilogo ai fini contabili_ ‘(e.g. ‘courtesy documents‘ issued by forwarding agents or customs brokers) cannot be used in this respect.
### **Re-engineering of the electronic export clearance system**
As from December 2, 2024, the Customs Authority, as part of the re-engineering project for the export clearance IT system, has implemented new telematic formats for the transmission of the export customs declarations.
The Customs Authority put at disposal of the operators the so called DAE (i.e., Export Accompanying Document) in PDF format and the exit message in .XML format (iVisto). The latter file is the electronic message ("exit result") transmitted by the exit customs office to the export customs office and recorded in the IT system of the Customs Authority, certifying the departure of the goods from the EU and supporting the VAT exemption regime of the export sales.
## Excise duties
The following goods are subject to excise duties:
  * Energetic products (e.g. petrol, gas oil, natural gas, coal).
  * Alcohol and alcoholic drinks (e.g. wine, beer, ethylic alcohol).
  * Processed tobaccos (e.g. cigars, cigarettes, tobacco).
  * Electric power.


The subjection of a product to excise duties has to be verified on the basis of its customs combined nomenclature code.
The tax liability, depending on the products, arises:
  * at the moment of importation or production (and the excise duties must be paid at the moment in which they are released for consumption in Italy)
  * when the excisable goods are used for heating or as fuel, and
  * when the excisable goods are released for consumption or used for own use.


As a general rule (with exception of natural gas and coal, coke, and lignite), with reference to excise goods released for consumption during a month, the payment of the relative excise duties has to be made by the 16th day of the following month.
With reference to excise goods imported, customs rules are applied as far as the procedure and terms of payment are concerned.
The production, processing, and holding of 'excise goods', except from natural gas, coal, coke, lignite, and electric power, are subject to a suspensive regime performed through a fiscal warehouse.
In order to manage a fiscal warehouse, it is necessary to acquire a licence issued by the Italian Customs Authority, and there are specific obligations for the owner of a fiscal warehouse (e.g. provide for a particular guarantee, keep a particular accounting system for the goods stored, be subject to controls performed by Italian Customs Authority, where requested).
The Italian legislation provides for many exemptions with regards to the use of 'excise goods'.
Furthermore, under certain circumstances, a tax refund is granted to the operator who released for consumption if, afterwards, the products are not consumed in Italy.
## Plastic tax and sugar tax
The 2020 Budget Law introduced a new tax on the utilisation, event partial, of single-use plastic items or ’MACSI‘ (‘plastic tax‘), which have or are intended to have the function of containing, protecting, handling, or delivering goods or food products (e.g. plastic bottles, bags, and trays for food), even in sheet, film, or strip shape.
The tax does not apply to compostable MACSIs, as well as to medical devices and plastic containers used to contain and protect medicinal drugs.
The taxable amount of the new tax is fixed at EUR 0.45 per kilogram of plastic material contained in the MACSI.
The 2020 Budget Law also introduced a new tax on sweetened beverages (‘sugar tax’). Notably, the tax applies to finished products and those prepared to be used as such after dilution, falling within the headings of NC 2009 (fruit juices, vegetables, and legumes) and 2202 (water with added sugar or other sweeteners or flavouring, and other non-alcoholic beverages) of the EU combined nomenclature, put up for sale, intended for human food consumption, obtained by adding sweeteners, and having an alcoholic strength of less than or equal to 1.2% by volume.
The taxable amount of the new tax is fixed, respectively, at EUR 10 per hectolitre for finished products and at EUR 0.25 per kilogram for products intended to be used as such after dilution.
An exemption applies to sweetened beverages if the overall content of sweeteners is less than or equal to, respectively, 25 grams per litre for finished products, or 125 grams per kilogram for products intended to be used as such after dilution. 
The Law no. 67, dated May 23, 2024, provided for the deferral of the plastic tax to July 1, 2026 and of the sugar tax to July 1, 2025.
## Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)
Regulation EU 2023/956 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 May 2023 introduced the so-called ’Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism’ (CBAM).
Starting October 1, 2023, the CBAM applies to import of the following product groups to the European Union from non-EU countries:
  * Aluminium
  * Iron and steel
  * Fertilisers
  * Hydrogen
  * Electricity
  * Cement


The CBAM does not apply to goods originating in the following countries:
  * Iceland
  * Liechtenstein
  * Norway
  * Switzerland


In the transitional period starting October 1, 2023, there are requirements for quarterly reporting of embedded greenhouse gas emissions of products imported to the European Union, with the first reporting to be submitted by January 31, 2024.
In the CBAM definitive period starting January 1, 2026, only the ’authorised CBAM declarants‘ would be allowed to import the CBAM products to the European Union.
In the definitive period, there would be more obligations in relation to CBAM, including purchasing certificates, verification of greenhouse gas emissions data, and submission of annual declaration.
The price of CBAM certificates would be linked to the carbon prices at the EU ETS.
## Stamp duty taxes
Stamp duty taxes (_Imposta di Bollo_) apply on a certain list of deeds or documents provided for by the relevant law provision (e.g. checks, bills of exchange, statements of account, certificates, books of account, deeds of transfer of quotas, and, in some specific cases identified by the Law, invoices).
According to the kind of deed, stamp duty tax is due upon the deeds’ origin or in case of use (e.g. if the deed is filed to the Italian Registration Office). Moreover, it can be a fixed amount or as an amount proportional to the value of the deed or document.
Stamp duty tax can be paid:
  * ordinarily, through a physical stamp attached on the document, or
  * virtually, through electronic means (in this case, a specific authorisation from the Italian tax authorities and a specific process procedure are needed).


Even considered the mandatory electronic invoicing obligation for the supplies of goods or services carried out between persons that are resident or established in Italy, there are specific ways of payments of stamp duty tax.
Stamp duty tax is usually alternative to VAT; however, in case of considerations partially subject to VAT and partially not subject to VAT, the invoice is subject to stamp duty tax if the total amount of the considerations not subject to VAT exceeds EUR 77.47. Moreover, some transactions are stamp duty tax exempted (e.g. inter-Community supply of goods). For transactions that are exempted from VAT (with restriction on VAT credit) and for transactions out of scope of VAT, exceeding EUR 77.47, an amount of EUR 2 is due as stamp duty tax for each issued invoice.
For electronic invoices sent to SDI, the stamp duty must be paid quarterly on the basis of the calculations provided by the Italian tax authorities.
The Italian tax authorities will make available, within the reserved area _Fatture e Corrispettivi_ of the Tax Box (_Cassetto Fiscale_), a payment service and an F24 draft with the indication of the stamp duty to be paid (determined on the basis of the amount indicated in the field 2.1.1.6 '_DatiBollo'_ of the .XML invoice).
The 2021 Budget Law provides that for the payment of stamp duty tax on e-invoices and other documents submitted through the SDI, the taxpayer who provides the goods or services is jointly and severally liable, even where the invoice is issued by a third party.
The Italian tax authorities, through Act no. 34958/2021, introduced important changes related to the settlement of stamp duty on e-invoices. In particular, the new provisions concern: 
  * the procedures, addressed to the Italian Tax Authorities, to detect e-invoices subject to stamp duty tax, and 
  * the procedures, addressed to the taxpayer, for the consultation and integration of the data relating to the stamp duty tax and for its payment.


## Unified municipal tax (_Imposta Unica Comunale_ or IUC)
The IUC is composed of the following different taxes:
  * _Imposta Municipale Unica_ (IMU): Real estate tax levied on the ownership of immovable properties (buildings, rural land, farmlands), except for immovable properties owned as primary private properties. The standard tax rate is 0.76%. Depending on the municipality and status of the taxpayer, the tax rate can be increased or decreased. The taxable base is generally determined on the basis of the so called ‘cadastral value’ (i.e. capitalisation of the deemed standard income that is expected to be derived from the real estate).
  * _Tassa sui rifiuti_ (TARI): A waste tax levied on the owner or the user of immovable properties.


For the '_Imposta Municipale Unica_ (IMU)' is provided:
  * The tax rate is set at 0.86%, with the possibility for municipalities to increase it to 1.06% or decrease it until zero.
  * The deadline for the submission of the tax return is 30 June of the year following the one in which the ownership of the immovable property has begun or in which there have been significant changes in the determination of the tax.


## Financial Transaction Tax (FTT)
Italian FTT applies to (i) cash equities, (ii) derivatives, and (iii) high-frequency trading transactions.
Cash equities FTT applies to the purchase of shares and other equity instruments issued by Italian companies, as well as securities (wherever issued) tracking those Italian shares (e.g. ADRs). The taxable base is the net daily balance of transactions on the same financial instruments by the same person on the same settlement date. The rate is 0.2% on OTC trades or 0.1% on trades executed in a regulated market (or multilateral trading facility).
Derivatives FTT applies to any derivative contract or securitised derivative, whose underlying value is directly or indirectly tied to Italian shares. The taxable base is the notional amount of the derivative (no netting applies), and it is subject to a special tax scale, on both the purchase and the sale legs; the amount is reduced to 1/5 for transactions executed on regulated markets and multilateral trading facilities.
High-frequency trading FTT applies to transactions on shares (wherever issued) and share-based derivatives (wherever the underlying share is issued) in the Italian financial markets; trades amended or cancelled within half a second are subject to a 0.02% rate, to the extent they exceed 60% of overall trades.
## Digital service tax (DST)
As of FY 2020, corporations will apply a tax at the rate of 3% on the value of specific digital services collected, net of VAT and other indirect taxes.
The web tax is addressed to taxpayers who individually or at the group level realise during a taxable year (i.e. calendar year):
  * a total amount of worldwide revenues exceeding EUR 750 million, and
  * a total amount of revenues realised in the Italian territory exceeding EUR 5.5 million.


Taxpayers must pay the tax by 16 May of the calendar year following the year in which the taxable revenues were obtained.
Taxpayers also must submit an annual tax declaration regarding the provided taxable services by June 30 of the following year. For companies that are part of the same group, a single entity must be identified to comply with the above-described provisions.
The entry in force is January 1, 2020. The Italian DST shall be repealed when internationally agreed-upon provisions on the digital economy’s taxation become applicable.
The DST is aimed at the revenues collected from the provision of the following services:
  * Channeling of advertisement on a digital interface targeted to the users of that digital interface.
  * Offer of a multi-sided digital interface that allows users interaction and for the purposes of facilitating the direct provision of goods and services.
  * The transmission of data collected about users and generated from users' activities on digital interfaces.


The collected revenues are taxable when the user uses the device to access the above digital services in the Italian territory. In order to identify the location of the user, the Italian tax authority has provided specific linking rules between the user and the Italian territory (i.e. IP address or by other means of geo-localisation).
## Social security contributions
The Italian employer, in order to pay social security contributions for employees, must register with the Italian Social Security Administration (_Instituto Nazionale Previdenza Sociale_ or INPS).
The total social security rate is around 40% of the employee's gross compensation (the rate depends on the work-activity performed by the company, the number of employees of the company, and the employee's position), and is shared as follows:
  * Employer's charge is around 30%.
  * Employee's charge is around 10%.
