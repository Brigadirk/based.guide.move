## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## Foreign tax relief
In case of double taxation of the same income (between Italy and a foreign country), the individual can claim foreign tax relief for the taxes paid abroad. The relief can be claimed only when the foreign taxes become 'final and settled' by filing the Italian tax return. The foreign tax relief is calculated using a specific formula.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
The main income tax levied on individuals is the personal income tax (PIT), also known as the _Imposta_ _sui redditi delle persone fisiche_(IRPEF).
In Italy, the individual is subject to the following income taxes:
  * National income tax.
  * Regional income tax.
  * Municipal income tax.


The tax liability shall be computed on a progressive rate, and the applicable tax rates are shown below (_see_ _National income tax_).
## The scope of taxation in Italy
The tax status of an individual is the starting point for applying the correct taxation in Italy. According to the Italian tax law, both Italian residents and non-resident individuals are subject to taxation in Italy, but on a different basis.
### Tax resident individuals
Tax resident individuals are liable to the Italian personal (or national) income taxes on their income wherever produced (under the so called ‘worldwide principle’). Therefore, tax residents are also subject to taxation on foreign incomes (e.g. deriving from real estate owned outside of Italy, foreign dividends and interest, foreign compensation and director’s fees, and other foreign income).
Tax resident individuals are also subject to 'wealth tax' on real estate and on financial investments owned outside of Italy (_see_ _the section for more information_).
Tax resident individuals are required to declare all their foreign investments (financial and not) for monitoring purposes through the Italian tax return.
### Tax regime for neo-domiciled individuals
Individuals who transfer their tax residency _(see the section for more information_) from abroad to Italy may elect for the application of a flat tax, at a fixed amount of 100,000 euros (EUR) (hereinafter the ‘neo-domiciled tax regime’) on the foreign sourced incomes.
Due to changes occurred by the entering in force of the Article 2 of the Law Decree No 113 of 2024, for the individual who opt for the neo-domiciled tax regime from 2025 tax period, the flat tax amounts to 200,000 euros (EUR). The individuals who opted for the regime from 2024 tax period can continue to pay the fixed amount of euros 100,000 (EUR) up to the end of the application of the regime regardless of the new provisions.
The mentioned tax regime will also apply on:
  * the income tax on foreign investments (foreign interests, dividends, and capital gains) with the exception of capital gains on qualified participation earned in the first five years
  * the wealth tax on real estate and financial investments owned out of Italy, and
  * financial monitoring obligations through the Italian tax return (meaning that the individual is not required to declare one's foreign investments into the Italian tax return).


In addition to the taxpayer, each family member could be subject to a flat tax on non-Italian sourced income at a fixed amount of EUR 25,000.
In order to be eligible for this tax regime it is necessary to carry out the option through the annual Italian tax return. In any case, it is advisable to submit an advance ruling to the Italian tax authorities in order to obtain their formal opinion on the applicability of the special regime.
To elect such treatment, the individual must meet several requirements, including previous non-Italian tax residency for at least nine years over ten fiscal years preceding the transfer.
The mentioned tax regime is not cumulative with the special tax regime for inbound workers (s _ee New tax regime for inbound workers in the section_)_._
### Flat tax regime for non- Italian retirees
The special regime provides for a flat tax rate of 7% on the non-Italian sourced pensions and incomes.
The ordinary length of the regime is 10 years starting from the year in which an individual become Italian tax resident. The regime applies to pension income but also to employment or self employment income, business income, capital income, rental income.
An individual is allowed to apply for the 7% flat tax regime if the following conditions are meet:
  * The individual has not been resident of Italy for tax purposes for at least 5 tax periods before the option for the application of the 7% flat tax regime become effective (i.e. tax period in which the transfer of tax residence occurs)
  * The individual is holder of a foreign pension income
  * The individual transfers s the tax residence to Italy, pursuant to the art. 2 of the Italian tax code (DPR 917/1986) in one of the municipalities belonging to the territory of «southern Italy», with a population of less than 20,000 inhabitants, located in the following Regions: Sicily, Calabria, Sardinia, Campania, Basilicata, Abruzzo, Molise and Puglia
  * The transfer of residence occurs from countries with which are in force administrative cooperation's agreements.


In addition, according to the law provisions, annuities and lump sum pension payment fall into the application of the 7% flat tax regime with exclusion of those deriving from unit linked policies, integrative foreign pension fund, annuities linked to life insurance policies and aimed at covering the risk of permanent disability.
The option for the 7% flat tax regime is exercised through the filing ot the annual income tax return linked to the tax year in which the tax residence is transferred to Italy. This option is valid from that tax period and for the first nine subsequent tax periods. Specifically, the individuals need to indicate, in a dedicated section of the Italian tax return, the country or countries in which he/she was the tax residence before to exercise for the above mentioned option.
It ia also possible to exclude one or some jurisdictions from the application of the 7% flat tax regime.
With the Resolution no. 21/E of 2024 the Italian tax Authority clarified that for the application of 7% flat tax regime, in compliance with the other requirements provided by the law, it is sufficient the registration with the record of Italian resident population (i.e. Anagrafe)
### Non-tax resident individuals
Tax non-resident individuals are subject to PIT (IRPEF) only on ‘income produced’ in Italy (i.e. employment income related to the work activity performed in Italy). Therefore, the foreign incomes are not relevant to the purposes of taxation in Italy.
## National income tax
National income tax for FY 2025 is levied at progressive tax rate on all income reported below.
Taxable income (EUR) | Tax on excess (%)  
---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 28,000 | 23  
28,001 | 50,000 | 35  
50,001 | 43  
## Additional tax on variable compensation in the financial sector
Variable compensation (e.g. bonus/stock option/incentive plan) paid to an executive/manager in the financial sector (i.e. banks, financial institutions, and other companies whose business is exclusively or primarily to acquire ‘holdings’; management companies, _Società_ _di Gestione del Risparmio_[SGR] and _Società_ _di Intermediazione mobiliare_[SIM]; financial intermediaries) is subject to an additional tax of 10% as described below.
With the Sentence no 16257/2023 the Italian Supreme Court further extended the subjective scope of application of the rule, also including companies that provide consultancy and compliance services in corporate and financial matters to companies.
In case the variable compensation is paid before 17 July 2011, the taxable base for the additional tax of 10% is the variable compensation (FY ‘n’) less three times the base salary (FY ‘n’).
In case the variable compensation is paid after 17 July 2011, the taxable base for the additional tax of 10% is the variable compensation (FY ‘n’) less the base salary (FY ‘n’)
In both cases, the comparison between variable/base compensation has to be applied between variable and base compensation in the same fiscal year (independently from the year of payment).
## Flat tax on 'productivity' bonus
Productivity bonus consists of a variable remuneration paid to an employee in light of the improvement of the quality of production and/or of the company’s productivity, as long as it is applied for the whole eligible workforce (or homogeneous category of them) grounded on objective, fair, predetermined and materially valuable performing criteria, generally named ‘KPIs’ (e.g. savings related to electricity, growth of revenue, profits increase, decrease of the production waste; improvement of the delivery time; implementation of the smart working scheme).
The productivity bonus cannot exceed EUR 3,000 per year.
Such bonus is subject to a flat taxation equal to 10% as PIT, regional, and municipal withholding, but it is not exempt from social security withholding borne by the employer and employee. The Budget Law for FY 2025 has reduced, confirming what was already provided with the Budget Law for FY 2024, the applicable tax rate to 5%. This provision is valid up to the tax period 2027.
With regard to eligibility, employees who have received an annual gross retribution during the previous year (including variable compensation scheme potentially provided) exceeding EUR 80,000 are not entitled to benefit from the aforesaid tax discount.
In order to allow for the application of the aforementioned measures, the employer shall mandatory sign a collective agreement with unions/work councils. In case of lack of unions/work councils, it is possible to apply a territorial collective agreement (if existing) signed by the most representative unions (if any) in the territory of reference.
## Regional income tax
Regional income tax depends on the region of residence. The regional income tax rate ranges from 1.23% to 3.33%.
## Municipal income tax
Municipal income tax depends on the municipality of residence. The municipal income tax rate ranges from 0% to 0.9%. Municipalities can establish progressive tax rates applicable to the national income bracket.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year for individuals in Italy is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
The taxpayer can file Modello  _Redditi PF_ or _Modello_ 730 (_Mod_. 730, a simplified income tax return) on the basis of his/her personal situation. Generally the 730 form is filed by the individuals who have an Italian withholding agent.
### Mod. 730
In Italy, the _Mod_. 730 is a simplified income tax return. It can be filed only for specific incomes (i.e. incomes subject to ordinary taxation) and the taxpayer must meet the following conditions:
  * Individual is an Italian tax resident in the year of filing of the _Mod_. 730 and in the previous one.
  * Individual has a withholding agent in Italy in the period of the filing of the Italian income tax return.
  * Individual has no VAT number.


The main advantage of this tax return is that the taxpayer is not required to prepare any calculation; the balance resulting from the tax return is directly withheld or refunded (if the result is a credit) to the employee in the Italian pay slip. Married couples can file the _Modello_ 730 jointly.
This tax return has to be submitted to the Italian tax authorities by 30 September via electronic filing.
In case _Mod_. 730 is not applicable, the taxpayer has to file the Italian tax return called . This tax return has to be submitted to the Italian tax authorities by 31 October via electronic filing. Married couples cannot file the jointly.
Payment of taxes is due on a self-assessment basis. In case the result of the tax return is a credit this will be refunded to the individual by the Italian tax Authorities, directly.
### WHT and Mod. CU issued by the employer
On employment income, the employer, as tax agent, applies for the monthly withholding tax on the basis of the tax rates applicable to the annual employment income.
The employer is required to issue within 16 March of the next year an annual employment certification, so called _Model CU_ , certifying the amounts of the taxable income of the employee and the withholding taxes applied during the fiscal year.
In case the foreign individual has an employment relationship with an Italian company, the Italian employer, as withholding agent, is required to act as above.
In case foreign individuals have no employment relationship with an Italian company, they are required to declare the income in the Italian tax return (through the so called ‘self-assessment method’).
## Payment of tax
The income taxes are paid through the individual tax return using the so-called 'self-assessment' method as follows:
  * Two advance payments (30 June and 30 November of the current year).
  * One final tax balance (30 June of the following year).


The following payments are due:
  * First advance payment = (100% of the income tax balance of the previous year) x 40%.
  * Second advance payment = (100% of the income tax balance of the previous year) x 60%.


Tax advances are used to offset the tax balance of the following year.
Starting from 1 July 2024, the payment forms, which include credits used to offset the tax liability, need to be electronically filed through the online web services of the Italian tax authorities (i.e. it is no longer possible to make such payments through the online banking services).
## Tax audit process
The tax authorities have the power, during the period up to 31 December of the fifth year following the year in which the tax return has been filed, to audit the taxpayer's return. The taxpayer has the option to appeal within 30/60 days from the notification date of the notice of assessment.
In case of an omitted tax return, the tax authorities can assess during the period up to 31 December of the seventh year following the year when the tax return should have been filed.
If the taxpayer has appealed, then a judgement will be issued by the tax commission. It is possible to appeal against this judgement again by means of a petition filed within 60 days from the date of the notification of the tax commission's notice of judgement. The case is reviewed by the tax commissions. It is possible to appeal against this second judgement only on a point of law.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
At the moment, the main areas of focus for the Italian tax authority are: 
  * Assessment of the foreign tax credits.
  * Assessment of the tax residence for Italian citizens who moved their tax residence abroad (_see the section for more information)._
  * Assessment of the requirements to benefit of the special tax regimes.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
The Italian tax law allows for certain expenses to be deducted from a taxpayer’s gross income, while tax credits can be used as an offset against a taxpayer’s tax liability.
## Employment expenses
With reference to employment income, Italy has adopted a system of tax credits (_see Employment tax credits under the section for more information),_ unlike other countries that permit an employment expenses deduction in determining taxable income. 
Provided that the conditions requested by law are met, the main deductions from employment taxable income are the following:
  * Employee’s mandatory social security contributions are fully deductible.
  * Contributions paid to the specific complementary pension funds are deductible, up to EUR 5,164.57.


## Personal deductions
Provided that the conditions requested by law are met, the main deductions from gross taxable income, if they have not been deducted from each kind of income, are the following, if properly documented:
  * Employee’s mandatory social security contributions are fully deductible (_see Employment expenses above_).
  * Social security contributions paid for domestic worker: up to EUR 1,549.37.
  * Medical expenses for disabled individuals are fully deductible.
  * Contributions paid to the specific complementary pension funds are deductible, up to EUR 5,164.57 (_see Employment expenses above_).
  * Voluntary social security contributions paid to the mandatory pension scheme are fully deductible.


### Alimony payments to a separate spouse

Note that only the portion that is related to the separate spouse is deductible, while the portion attributable to maintenance of children is not deductible.
### Charitable contributions
Contributions to certain religious entities can be deductible from the taxable income up to EUR 1,032.91 (per taxpayer). Payments need to be made through traceable means (i.e. credit or debit card, electronic services of a bank account).
## Personal exemptions

## Losses
For personal income taxation purposes, offset of losses against income is allowed for capital gains/losses on income items of the same nature.
It is possible to offset the gain/loss from sale of shares regardless of the issuer of the shares, whether the shares are quoted or not. The loss of quoted shares can be offset against the gain from the sale of unquoted shares.
It is not possible to offset the gain/loss of ‘qualified’ and ‘not qualified’ participation.


# Italy
## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
Taxable income is generally subject to progressive tax rates _(see the section for more information)_.
The Italian tax system provides the six following categories of income:
  * Employment income.
  * Business income.
  * Self-employment income.
  * Real estate income.
  * Investment income.
  * Capital gains.


The gross taxable income is determined by the sum of the taxable incomes of the above categories subject to ordinary taxation.
Please note that some kinds of income (interest, dividends, and capital gains) could be subject to a flat tax rate provided that conditions established by the Italian tax law are met.
## Employment income
Employment gross taxable income includes all compensation (cash or benefits in kind) received by the employee in relation to their employment relationship, including: bonuses, stock options, loans, overseas adjustments, cost of living allowance, tax reimbursements, car allowance, etc.As a general rule, 100% of compensation paid in cash is subject to tax (some exceptions to this rule are reported below), and compensation paid as fringe benefits (such as housing, loans, company car granted for personal and business use) are taxed on the base of the ‘normal value’ or on a lump-sum basis. Normal value is defined in Article 9 of the Italian Tax Code, as the price generally applied to similar goods and services on the market. In particular, for shares, bonds, and other securities listed on stock exchange or traded over-the-counter, the normal value shall be determined on the basis of the average closing price during the preceding month (30-31 days); for other shares, it is determined in proportion to the net equity value of the company.Specific rules apply to the items listed below.
### Out-of-town travel allowance
Travel allowances provided for transfers/business trips are included in taxable income on amounts exceeding EUR 46.48 per day (transfers within Italy), or EUR 77.47 per day (transfers outside of Italy), if no meal and no accommodation costs are reimbursed. The above amounts are reduced by:
  * 1/3 if meals or accommodation are reimbursed by the employer, or
  * 2/3 if both meals and accommodation are reimbursed by the employer.


If the employee does not receive any travel allowances, any expenses supported by receipts that are related to food, travel, and accommodation are not taxable in Italy. 
As a general rule the expenses need to be paid through traceable means (i.e. credit or debit cards, other electronic methods required by the law)
### Relocation allowance
A relocation allowance is taxed at 50% of the amount, for a sum that cannot exceed EUR 1,549.37 for transfers within Italian territory, and EUR 4,648.11 for foreign transfers. It should be noted, however, that such beneficial treatment is recognised only for the first year of transfer.
### Moving expenses
Moving expenses reimbursements (transportation of household goods, travelling expenses for employee and their family) are fully tax-free, if reimbursed by the employer upon submission of related receipts. The payments must be made with traceable means, such as bank transfers, credit or debit cards, or other electronic methods required by the law
### Employer contributions
Employer contributions to insured medical benefits are also considered taxable income in certain cases.
### Housing benefit
As a general rule accommodations provided to an employee by an employer are considered as a taxable benefit.
If the rental contract is in the name of the employer, and the rental fee is paid by the employer, the taxable amount is the difference between a figurative value called cadastral value (approximately equal to about 1/10 to 1/15 of the annual rental amount), increased by the utilities eventually reimbursed to the employee, and reduced by any contributions paid by the employee (if any).
If the rental contract is not in the name of the company, the taxable amount will be equal to the difference between the annual rental amount and the contributions paid by the employee (if any).
### Personal use of company car
The company car benefit (provided by the employer to the employee for private and business use) constitutes taxable income to the employee for an amount equal to the 30% of the imputable value determined in accordance with tables provided by the Italian Automobile Club (based on car model, engine power, fuel, and considering an average annual mileage of 15,000 km/_per annum_). This rule applies until 30 June 2020.
Starting from 1 July 2020, the Italian Budget Law 2020 has foreseen different percentages of the fringe benefit taxable depending on the level of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions emitted into the atmosphere, as follows:
  * 25% with the value of CO2 emitted less than 60 g/Km.
  * 30% with the value of CO2 emitted more than 60 g/Km and less than 160 g/Km.
  * 50% with the value of CO2 emitted more than 160 g/Km and less than 190 g/Km.
  * 60% with the value of CO2 emitted more than 190 g/Km.


Starting from January 1st 2025 the percentage of the imputable value is reduced to 10% for battery powered electric vehicles and to 20% for plug-in hybrid vehicles. For all other vehicles, except the two ones mentioned above, the imputable value is 50% of the amount corresponding to the conventional mileage of 15.000 kilometres.
### Interest on loans
The taxable income derived from loans granted by the employer, directly or through third parties, is equal to 50% of the difference between interest calculated at the official interest rate (in force at the end of each tax year concerned) and interest calculated at the rate applied by the employer or the third party.
Due to the increase of the official interest rate, the above provision, for the determination of the taxable value of the fringe benefits, has been amended by the Law Decree 145/2023 as follows:
  * For variable rate loans, the reference official interest rate is that in force on the due date of each instalment.
  * For fixed rate loans, the reference official interest rate is that on the date of granting of the loan.


### New tax regime for inbound workers
Individuals who transfer their tax residency (_see the_ _section for more information_) to Italy starting from tax period 2024 are subject to a reduction of 50% of the employment incomes earned on the Italian territory.
Article 5 of Legislative Decree 27 December 2023, no. 209, introduced significant changes to the ’inbound workers regime’.
In its current formulation, the tax benefit applies to employment incomes or equivalents and to self-employment incomes produced in Italy by the employees who transfer their tax residency pursuant to the new paragraph 2 of the Presidential Decree of 22 December 1986, no. 917.
Such incomes, within the limit of EUR 600,000 per year, do not contribute to the formation of the overall income to the extent of 50% of their amount.
The regime applies from the year of acquisition of the tax residence and for the four subsequent years.
The application of the new inbound workers regime is subject to compliance with the following conditions:
  * The employees undertake to reside for tax purposes in Italy for at least four tax periods.
  * The employees have not been tax residents in Italy in the three tax periods preceding their transfer.
  * However, if the employee carries out one’s work in Italy in favour of the same employer with whom one was employed abroad before the transfer or in favour of an employer belonging to the same group of companies, the minimum requirement of foreign residency is of: 
    * Six tax periods if the employee has not previously been employed in Italy for the same employer or for an employer belonging to the same corporate group.
    * Seven tax periods if the worker, before moving abroad, was employed in Italy for the same employer or for an employer belonging to the same corporate group.
  * The work activity, for the greater part of the tax period, is carried out in Italian territory.
  * The workers have high qualification or specialisation requirements as defined by the Legislative Decree. no. 108 of 28 June 2012 and by Legislative Decree no. 206 of 9 November 2007.


The contribution to the formation of the overall income is reduced to 40% in the event that the worker moves to Italy with a minor child or in case of the birth of a child during the period of use of the regime. In this latter case, the application of the greater benefit will start from the tax period in progress at the time of birth. In any case, it is required that, during the period of use of the regime, the minor child maintains residency in Italy.
The new provisions will apply to subjects who transfer their tax residency to Italy starting from the 2024 tax period.
Limited to individuals who transfer their legal residency to Italy in 2024, the application of the regime can be extended for another three years in the event that they become owners, by 31 December 2023 and, in any case, in the 12 months preceding the transfer in Italy, of a residential real estate used as a main residency in Italy. The non-contribution to the formation of the gross income, for the further three years, is equal to 50%.
Individuals who transferred their legal residency (i.e. who made the registration within the record of Italian resident population) by 31 December 2023 continue to apply the previous provisions regarding the application of the inbound workers regime.
### Employment activity performed abroad
Regarding the taxation of employment income derived from a work activity performed outside of Italy by a tax resident individual, the Italian tax law provides a specific rule which allows the individual to be subject to taxation on the ‘notional remuneration’ (_retribuzione convenzionale_). This particular tax regime is applicable when the following conditions are met:
  * The employee is a resident of Italy for tax purposes.
  * The employment activity is rendered wholly and continuously abroad for more than 183 days in a 12-month period.
  * The employee’s assignment abroad is regulated by a written agreement signed by the parties (the employee and the employer).


The ‘notional remuneration’ depends on the employee’s position (i.e. employee, manager) and the national labour contract applicable to the company (i.e. industrial/commercial activity).
Employment income derived from work activity performed abroad (outside of Italy) by a non-tax resident individual is not subject to taxation in Italy.
The Italian Budget Law for 2025 provided a new interpretation of the article of the law which governs the application of the _"retribuzioni convenzionali"._ In particular the condition that the employment activity is rendered wholly and continuously abroad for more than 183 days in a 12-month period is meet also assuming the employee return to his domicile in Italy one way per week.
### Equity compensation
The possibility of obtaining the benefit of an exemption from employment income taxation has been abolished by Law Decree number 112/2008 which entered in force on 25 June 2008. The taxation of stock options has been subject to different changes in law in the last few years; this latest Law Decree has established that, starting on 25 June 2008, income derived from the exercise of stock options (the difference between the ‘normal value’ of the shares at exercise date and the strike price) will be considered as taxable employment income and subject to ordinary progressive income tax rates. However, this income, as per the interpretation made by the Italian Social Security Authorities, is exempted from social security contributions.
## Self-employment income
Self-employment income is subject to IRPEF. The income derived from services rendered by self employees is calculated as the difference between fees collected and business expenses. Documented expenses refunded for travelling, boarding, and lodging expenses incurred in rendering services outside the tax domicile can be excluded from the formation of the taxable income.
Self-employment income can also be subject to VAT (_see Consumption taxes in the section_).
Self employees are required to keep accounting records, but directors and statutory auditors do not have to keep such records.
Non-residents who are self-employed are subject to a 30% final WHT unless otherwise provided by DTTs. In this case, they are not required to file an income tax return in case the WHT has been applied by an Italian withholding agent.
## Real estate income
Since FY 2013, the property used by the taxpayer as 'principal abode' is no longer subject to IMU (Real estate property tax)
### Principal abode
The taxable income deriving from the ownership of a principal abode is calculated on the basis of its 'cadastral value', which corresponds to the 'ordinary'/'average' income deemed to be derived from such properties, determined by the Cadastral Office in consideration of their characteristics. The cadastral value has to be increased by 5%.
In any case, the taxable value for principal abode can be deducted by the gross taxable income.
### Real estate at disposal
IMU has substituted IRPEF for real estate at disposal. The cadastral value, increased by 5%, of the real estates keep at disposal need to be reported on a tax return while no taxable income arises. However, an exception is provided for real estate at disposal located in the same municipality in which is located the principal abode, which constitutes taxable income in the measure of 50% of the cadastral value increased by 5%.
### Real estate rented
#### Taxed at a progressive tax rate
In case of rented real estate located in Italy, the taxable income generally corresponds to the highest amount between: (i) the cadastral income increased by 5% and (ii) 95% of the rental fees referring to the relevant tax period.
In fact, for leased buildings, the law admits a 5% flat rate reduction of rentals (higher flat rate reduction is provided in some specific cases) in consideration of eventual managing and maintenance expenses incurred by the owner.
As a result, related expenses actually incurred are not relevant for tax purposes.
The taxable income, as determined above, is subject to a progressive tax rate.
#### Taxed at a flat tax rate
As of FY 2011, a new tax regime, called _cedolare secca,_ has been introduced. It is a voluntary and optional tax regime which can replace the ordinary one. In case of application of the _cedolare secca_ , the rental income can be taxed at a fixed tax rate equal to 21% or 10%, provided some conditions are met.
This taxation replaces:
  * the incomes tax (national, regional, and municipal)
  * the registration tax
  * the stamp duty, and
  * other taxes.


The taxable base is 100% of the rental income.
### Foreign real estate
As of FY 2012, IVIE (_see the section for more information_) replaced the national income tax (IRPEF) on incomes deriving from foreign real estate not rented.
If the income deriving from the rented real estate owned outside of Italy is subject to rental income taxes in the foreign country, the same taxable base used in the foreign tax return is assumed as taxable base in Italy. This income is subject to taxation at progressive tax rates. In this case, the taxpayer is entitled to claim for the foreign tax credit in the Italian tax return in order to avoid double taxation.
The said deduction is limited to the proportion of the Italian tax corresponding to the ratio between the taxable income produced abroad (and subject to double taxation) and total income. The foreign tax credit cannot, in any case, exceed the net Italian tax due on the foreign source income.
Otherwise, if the income deriving from rented real estate owned outside of Italy is not subject to taxation in the foreign country, the rental income reduced by 15% constitutes the taxable income in Italy.
_See the tax regime for neo-domiciled individuals in the section, which substitutes the income tax on foreign rental income deriving from a real estate owned out of Italy, provided the individual opted for it_.
## Investment income
Investment income is generally defined as income arising from the use of capital, typically interest and dividends.
_See the tax regime for neo-domiciled individuals in the section, which substitutes the income tax on foreign interests and dividends, provided the individual opted for it_.
### Dividend income
The taxation of dividend distributions mainly depends on following categories of participation:
  * ‘Qualified shareholding’ if: 
    * it exceeds 2% of the voting rights or 5% of the capital or of the equity in case of securities traded in an Italian or foreign public regulated market
    * it exceeds 20% of the voting rights or 25% of the capital or of the equity in case of securities not traded in an Italian or foreign public regulated market.
  * ‘Non-qualified shareholding’ if: 
    * it does not exceed 2% of the voting rights or 5% of the capital or of the equity in case of security traded in an Italian or foreign public regulated market
    * it does not exceed 20% of the voting rights or 25% of the capital or of the equity in case of securities not traded in an Italian or foreign regulated public market.


Generally, dividend distributions deriving from a ‘qualified shareholding’ are subject to progressive tax rates on 49.72% of dividends distributed (i.e. 50.28% of dividends income is not subject to further taxation). Dividends distributions deriving from a ‘non-qualified shareholding’, such as dividends granted by Italian companies, are subject to final WHT at 26% to be applied at source, on the contrary through the annual Italian tax return.
Moreover, according to the 2018 Financial Law, as of FY 2018, the tax treatment of dividends deriving from qualified shareholdings will be aligned to the one provided for non-qualified shareholdings through the application of a 26% flat tax; a transition period has been provided where dividends distributed from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2022 and referred to profits produced before 31 December 2017 will be taxed according to the old provisions.
The 2018 Italian Budget Law has also introduced for Italian individuals without self-business a final WHT at a 26% rate for dividend distributions deriving from qualified and non-qualified shareholdings (starting from 1 January 2018).
With the answer to the tax ruling no. 454 of 22 September 2022, the Italian tax authorities confirmed the applicability of final WHT at a 26% rate for dividend income deriving from qualified shareholding received starting from 1 January 2023 regardless of the formation period.
The dividends distributed by a foreign entity that are not paid through an Italian resident intermediary shall be included (gross of foreign taxes withheld) in the individual tax return and taxed at a 26% flat rate.
Due to several sentences of the Supreme Court of Cassation, if provided by the Double tax treaty, the individual may have the possibility to ask for the reimbursement of foreign taxes withheld at source, within the measure provided by the applicable Tax Treaty,
Dividends distributed by a foreign entity and paid through an Italian resident broker are subject to tax at a 26% flat rate (net of foreign taxes withheld). In this case, no further action will be required.
### Interest income
Interests are subject to a flat tax rate of 26% to be applied at source.
## Capital gains
For individuals, capital gains are generally taxable, even if they do not arise from speculative intent or from a business.
_See the tax regime for neo-domiciled individuals in the section, which substitutes the income tax on capital gain, provided the individual opted for it_.
### Capital gains tax on securities
The taxable base referred to in the sale of assets (securities, i.e. stocks, bonds, etc.) is the sale price less the purchase price, with all the additional purchase costs (notary fees, taxes, broker fees, etc.).
As per the taxation of dividends, the taxation of capital gains on securities also mainly depends on the following categories of participation:
  * ‘Qualified shareholding’ if: 
    * it exceeds 2% of the voting rights or 5% of the capital or of the equity in case of securities traded in an Italian or foreign public regulated market, or
    * it exceeds 20% of the voting rights or 25% of the capital or of the equity in case of securities not traded in an Italian or foreign public regulated market
  * ‘Non-qualified shareholding’ if: 
    * it does not exceed 2% of the voting rights or 5% of the capital or of the equity in case of security traded in an Italian or foreign public regulated market, or
    * it does not exceed 20% of the voting rights or 25% of the capital or of the equity in case of securities not traded in an Italian or foreign regulated public market.


#### Qualified shareholdings
The capital gains earned by the sale of qualified shareholdings is taxed as follows:
  * Capital gains made before 31 December 2017: 49.72% of capital gains is included in the individual annual gross income (income taxed applying progressive tax rates).
  * Capital gains made between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2018: 58.14% of capital gains is included in the individual annual gross (income taxed applying progressive tax rates).
  * Capital gains made as of January 2019 will be taxed applying a flat tax rate of 26% on the whole capital gains amount. The 2018 Italian Financial Bill introduced a final WHT at 26% both to tax resident and non-tax resident individuals for capital gains deriving from a qualified and a non-qualified shareholding (starting from 1 January 2019).


#### Non-qualified shareholdings
The capital gains earned by the sale of non-qualified shareholdings is taxed applying a flat tax rate of 26%.
### Capital gains tax on the sale of a real estate
The taxable base of the real estate capital gains is the difference between the sale price and the original cost of real estate together with the sum of all the additional purchase costs (notary fees, taxes, etc.).
The capital gain on the sale of real estate is taxed at progressive tax rates or with a flat tax of 26% under certain conditions. 
There are some exemptions, however, and such are applicable on capital gains deriving from the following sales:
  * The sale of a real estate if owned for more than five years.
  * The sale of a real estate, even if owned for less than five years, if it has been used as primary residence for most of the period of ownership (even if owned for less than five years).


## Exempt income
The following are some examples of income exempt from IRPEF:
  * War pensions.
  * Pensions and allowances paid to legally blind, deaf-mute, and invalid individuals.
  * Social pension.
  * Revenues paid by the National Institute for the Insurance against on-the-job injuries (called INAIL) for permanent disability or for death.

## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## Tax credits
An individual who qualifies as Italian tax resident can deduct from gross income tax liability the following main tax credits if all the conditions requested by the Italian tax law are met and if properly documented:
  * Employment tax credits.
  * Family tax credits (as from March 2022 these have been replaced by the '_Assegno Unico Universale_ ').
  * Other tax credits for expenses.


## Employment tax credits
Employment tax credits vary depending on the income:
  * Employment income.
  * Pension income.
  * Self-employment income.


### Employment income tax credit
The employment income tax credit is determined as follows:
Employment income (EUR) | Tax credit amount (EUR)  
---|---  
Up to 15,000 | 1,955 (the tax credit cannot be lower than EUR 690 or EUR 1,380 for fixed-term contracts)  
15,001 to 28,000 | EUR 1,910 + 1,190 x (28,000 - gross income) / 13,000  
28,001 to 50,000 | EUR 1,910 x (50,000 - gross income) / (50,000 - 28,000)  
Above 50,000 | 0  
The tax deduction is increased of EUR 65 if the gross income is between EUR 25,000 to EUR 35,000.
In addition to the classic system of tax deductions provided for by the Italian Tax Code, the Law no. 21/2020 and the Italian Budget Law for FY 2021, in view of a revision of the tax deductions and income support measures, introduced the recognition of a sum by way of additional treatment.
The recognition of a sum by way of additional treatment, which does not contribute to the formation of income and which therefore constitutes a net amount, amounts to 7,1% of the employment income if it not exceeds EUR 8,500 per year, 5,3% if the employment income is in the range between EUR 8,500 and EUR 15,000, 4,8% if the employment income is higher than EUR 15,000 per year
In addition the Italian Budget Law for fiscal year 2025 provided for an additional deduction for the employees with an annual employment income included in the range EUR 20,001 and EUR 40,000 per year.
The amount of the additional deduction is EUR 1,000 if the gross taxable income is between EUR 20,000 and EUR 32,000. The additional deduction is prorated if the gross taxable income is between EUR 32,001 and EUR 40,000 per year. 
### Pension income tax credit
The pension income tax credit is determined as follows:
Pension (EUR) | Tax credit amount (EUR)  
---|---  
Up to 8,500 | (EUR 1,880 x days) / 365 (the tax credit cannot be lower than EUR 713)  
8,501 to 28,000 | EUR 700 + (EUR 1,255 x ratio); Ratio = (EUR 28,000 - gross income) / (EUR 28,000 - EUR 8,500)  
28,001 to 50,000 | EUR 700 x ratio; Ratio = (EUR 50,000 - gross income) / (EUR 50,000 - EUR 28,000)  
Above 50,000 | 0  
### Self-employment income tax credit
The self-employment income tax credit is determined as follows:
Self-employment income (EUR) | Tax credit amount (EUR)  
---|---  
Up to 5,500 | 1,265  
5,501 to 28,000 | EUR 500 + 765 x (28,0000 - gross income)/(28,000 - 5,500)  
28,001 to 50,000 | EUR 500 x (50,000 - gross income) / (50,000 - 28,000)  
Above 50,000 | 0  
## Family tax credits
As a general rule tax credits are granted to resident taxpayers with a dependent spouse, children, and other relatives living with the taxpayer, provided that each dependant’s annual income does not exceed EUR 2,840.51. For children under 24 years of age, the income limit to be considered has been raised to EUR 4,000 from FY 2019.
Family tax credits are rated monthly and are applied as of the month in which the conditions verify and up to the month in which conditions stop.
The family tax credit varies according to dependent spouse and family dependants.
Dependants | Tax credit amount (EUR)  
---|---  
Dependent spouse | EUR 800 is the maximum annual amount allowed, which decreases with the increase in taxable income, up to EUR 80,000.  
Children below three years of age * | EUR 1,220 is the maximum annual amount allowed for each child, which decreases with the increase in taxable income, up to EUR 95,000.  
Children above three years of age * | EUR 950 is the maximum annual amount allowed for each child, which decreases with the increase in taxable income, up to EUR 95,000.  
Other cohabiting dependants (parents and gran parents only) | EUR 750 is the maximum annual amount allowed, which decreases with the increase of the taxable income, up to EUR 80,000.  
* For each child with disabilities, the applicable basic tax credit shall be increased by EUR 400.
For taxpayers with more than three dependent children, the applicable basic tax credit should be increased by EUR 200 for each child.
The child deduction must be imputed at 50% to both parents when none of them is considered as a dependant of the other for tax purposes; where the parents are separated or divorced, the entire deduction shall be imputed to the parent having custody of the child.
From 1 March 2022, the family tax credits for dependent children will apply only for children above 21 years of age and below 30 years of age (as recently amended by the Italian Budget Law for FY 2025)
For children below 21 years of age, there will not be any tax credit in the tax return; however, it will be possible to request for a monthly payment from the Italian social security authorities, and the amount (from EUR 50 to EUR 175 per child) will depend mainly on the 'family economical situation index' (ISEE).
## Other tax credits
Some other expenses entitle the taxpayer to a tax credit. The tax rate is 19% of the total amount paid.
The allowable deductions are prorated for the individuals who earn a gross taxable income higher than EUR 75,000 oer EUR 100,000 per year and in relation to the number of dependents children in the family.
### Mortgage interest credit
Tax credit is granted on interest on real estate mortgage loans issued from banks of the European Union, financial institutions, or other EU entities if they refer to the ‘habitual abode’ in Italy. Other requirements (e.g. year when the contract was signed) must be satisfied to be eligible.
The tax credit is equal to 19% of the mortgage interests paid. The maximum amount on which the tax credit is calculated is EUR 4,000.
### **Medical expenses credit**
The tax credit is equal to 19% of the medical expenses paid for the amount exceeding EUR 129.11 if duly supported by receipts.
### **Education expenses credit**
University expenses are deductible up to an amount equal to the cost charged by public educational institutions fixed by the education authority each year.
For nursery, elementary, secondary, and high school, the total maximum educational expense on which will be calculated the 19% rate is EUR 800  _per annum_ per child. The Italian Budget Law for 2025 increased the maximum amount on which it is allowed to calculate the deduction up to EUR 1,000 _per annum per child_.
School fees for registration of children up to three years old are deductible on the above percentage of the maximum amount of expenses of EUR 632.
### **Life and accident insurance credit**
Life and accident insurance is deductible, only if related to the case of death, invalidity, or non-self-sufficiency, for the maximum amount of EUR 530.
### **Sporting association’s fees credit**
Sporting association’s fees for children between 5 and 18 years old are deductible on 19% of the maximum amount of expenses of EUR 210 per year per child.
### **Rental fees credit**
A fixed amount tax credit, depending on the total income of the taxpayer, for annual rental fees paid for the principal abode is available under certain conditions (this tax credit can be used just for individuals who have gross taxable incomes under EUR 30,987.41).

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
Article 1 of Legislative Decree No. 209 of 27 December 2023, entitled ’Implementation of the tax reform on international taxation‘, published on 28 December 2023 in the Official Gazette introduced significant changes to the connection criteria for determining the tax residency of individuals as provided and regulated by Article 2, paragraph 2, of Presidential Decree No. 917 of 22 December 1986.
According to Article 2 of the Italian Tax Code, an individual is considered an Italian resident for tax purposes if, for the greater part of the fiscal year (i.e. for more than 183 days) taking into account even fractions of days,:
  * the individual is physically present on Italian territory
  * the individual has a ‘residence’ in Italy (habitual abode), or
  * the individual has a ‘domicile’ in Italy (principal centre of social interests, e.g. the family).


If one of the above conditions is met, the individual qualifies as tax resident for Italian tax purposes.
Furthermore, unless proved otherwise, individuals who are registered in the record of the resident population for most of the tax period are also presumed to be residents.
The recent changes to the criteria for the determination of the tax residency result in the exclusive relevance of the ’place where, primarily, personal and family relationships of the person develop‘. Therefore, the Legislature define a precise hierarchy between the connection criteria privileging the personal and family relationships over economic and work-related interests.
An Italian citizen who transfers to a foreign country has to cancel oneself with the Records of the Italian Resident Population and has to register with the Records of the Italian resident abroad, the  _Anagrafe Italiani Residenti Estero_(_AIRE_).
An anti-abuse rule provides that Italian citizens who transfer residence to countries considered as ‘tax havens’ (these are determined through a Decree of the Ministry of Finance), are deemed to be resident in Italy even if they are no longer registered in the Records of the Italian Resident Population, unless otherwise proven by the individuals.
Italian tax residents will be subject to taxation for the whole fiscal year (January through December).
Any provision covered by double tax treaties (DTTs) between Italy and other countries shall apply.
The Italian tax authority recently is focused on the assessment of the tax residence status for Italian citizens who moved their tax residence abroad.
## Potential assessment of the tax residence status for Italian citizens who moved their tax residence abroad
The tax residence status for Italian citizens who moved their tax residence abroad is carried on by the Italian tax authority and registered into the record of Italian residents abroad (so-called ‘AIRE’).
The increased role of the Italian tax authorities in this matter takes origin from:
  * a higher available information background due to the data exchange at the European level and, at an international level, in accordance with the Common Reporting Standards (CRS) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) source with more than 100 countries, and
  * the implementation of a new and more precise database (e.g. the so-called SO.NO.RE, acronym that stands for 'non-resident subjects'); this database collects all the relevant information that allows identification of the actual risk for an individual to be re-qualified as an Italian tax resident because of one's centre of vital interest effectively localised in Italy.

## Individual - Other taxes

## Social security contributions
The social security contribution mainly depends on the employment relationship.
### Employment relationship (staff)
Social security contributions are due by both the employee and the employer.
The Italian employer, in order to pay social security contributions for employees, must register with the Italian Social Security Administration (_Instituto_ _Nazionale Previdenza Sociale_ or INPS).
The total social security rate is around 40% of the employee's gross compensation (the rate depends on the work-activity performed by the company, the number of employees of the company, the employee's position), and is shared as follows:
  * Employer's charge is around 30%.
  * Employee's charge is around 10%.


In general, only around 33% of the total rate is paid into the National Pension Scheme, while the remaining part of the contribution is paid to the following Social Security funds:
  * Unemployment fund.
  * Sickness fund (not applicable for executives).
  * Maternity fund.
  * Temporary unemployment compensation fund (ordinary and extraordinary, not applicable to executives).
  * Social mobility fund (not applicable to executives).
  * Other minor funds.


The social security contributions for employees who registered with INPS after 1 January 1996 without a previous social security enrolment in the mandatory scheme or, under certain conditions, in other EU countries are due up to a maximum amount of EUR 120,607 for the year 2025. 
Over the cap, only minor contributions (about 5%) are due only by the employer.
### Employment relationship (executive)
Social security contributions due from executives (i.e. _dirigenti_) for the year are summarised below.
A commercial executive is required to make the following contributions:
  * INPS (national mandatory pension fund): 9.19% on the income up to a ceiling of EUR 55,448 of income and 10.19% on the excess above the maximum amount**.**
  * _Fondo Mario Negri_(complementary pension fund): 1% is due on a notional annual remuneration of EUR 59,224.54; and EUR 130.00  _per annum_ as professional training charges.
  * _Fondo Mario Besusso_ or FASDAC (medical care fund): 1.87% is due on a notional annual remuneration of EUR 45,940.
  * _Fondo Pastore_(supplementary pension fund): Entity consists of a combination of insurance and investment (not compulsory) and is required to contribute EUR 464.81 _per annum_.


An industrial executive is required to make the following contributions:
  * INPS: 9.19% on income up to a ceiling of EUR 55,448 of income and 10.19% on the excess above the maximum amount.
  * _Fondo Assistenza Sanitaria Industria_ or FASI (medical care fund): A flat contribution of EUR 1,120.
  * _Fondo Previdenza Dirienti_ _Aziende industriali_ or PREVINDAI (additional pension fund): 2%, up to a maximum annual income of EUR 200,000.


### Self-employment relationship
Self-employed individuals who are not value-added tax (VAT) number holders and are not covered by a mandatory private pension fund must be registered with INPS in a ‘separate social security regime’ (_Gestione Separata Inps_), instituted with Law n. 335/95.
The separate social security regime provides for three different rates:
  * Individuals enrolled in other mandatory contribution regimes: Rate is equal to 24%.
  * Individuals with a VAT number enrolled in the exclusive way into the separate social security regime (_Gestione separata INPS_): Rate is equal to 26.07% for FY 2025.
  * All other individuals enrolled in the exclusive way into the separate social security regime (_Gestione separata INPS_): 
    * For who is provided DIS-COLL additional contribution: Rate is equal to 35.03%.
    * For who is not provided DIS-COLL additional contribution: Rate is equal to 33.72%.


All the percentages are applied up to the limit established by the law for the year 2025 equal to EUR 120,607.
The percentages due by the self-employed individuals without VAT are:
  * two-thirds on charge of the company, and
  * one-third on charge of the collaborators.


The payment of the contribution is effected wholly by the company.
For self-employed individuals who are VAT number holders, and who are not covered by a mandatory private pension fund, the percentage is wholly charged to the individuals, and the payment of the contributions follows the same deadline applied for taxes. Individuals, in this case, can charge an amount equal to 4% of the compensation to the customer/client resulting from the invoice for services rendered.
The Budget Law for FY 2023 introduced a specific provision for the individuals who earn self-employment or business incomes.
This provision, so-called Incremental flat tax (_Tassa piatta incrementale_), provides, under certain conditions, a flat tax of 15% to be applied to the portion of income's increases calculated with respect to the three previous years.
From 2024 a specific measure has been introduced to reduce the "litigation" between the Italian tax authority and the taxpayer. The so called CPB (_Concordato preventivo_ _biennale_) applies to the individuals who earn self-employment or business incomes.
### Flat tax scheme for self-employees
The flat tax scheme (_Regime_ _forfettario_) has been introduced by the Law 190/2014. As a general rule, it provides that the taxable income is determined on a lump-sum basis, a flat tax rate of 15%, the exclusion of VAT, IRAP, and ISA and without the application of withholding taxes (WHTs).
The eligibility for the flat tax scheme is subject to the respect of certain criteria and limits.
The Budget Law for FY 2023 increased the annual income threshold to be eligible for the application of the flat tax scheme up to EUR 85,000 (the limit was EUR 65,000 previously). These provisions remain unchanged for FY 2024 and FY 2025.
The Budget Law for FY 2025 allow the self employees who are eligible for the _Forfettario regime_ to have an employment relationship with the same employer. The agreement, which needs to be mandatory signed before the start of the employment relationship, must include a quota of employment (40% or 50% of a full time employee) and a quota of self-employment.
### Collaborators/directors relationship
Generally, collaborators and directors (unless an exemption applies) also have to be enrolled in a ‘mandatory social security regime’ with INPS (_Gestione_ _Separata_)
The social security regime is the same as discussed under the self-employment relationship above for individuals who are not VAT number holders.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
Italian VAT (_Imposta_ _sul valore aggiunto_) applies to the supply of goods and services carried out in Italy by entrepreneurs, professionals, or artists and on importations carried out by anyone. Intra-community acquisitions are also subject to VAT taxation under certain situations.
The Italian standard VAT rate is 22% as of October 2013. Reduced rates are provided for specifically listed supplies of goods and services, such as 4% for listed food, drinks, and agricultural products, and 10% for electric power supplies for listed uses and listed drugs. Intra-community supplies and exports are exempt from VAT.
Specific supplies of goods and services expressly listed in the law are exempt from VAT (e.g. public postal services, hospital and medical care, education, insurance services, specific financial services, supply, leasing of particular immovable property). Other specifically listed transactions are also out of the VAT application scope (e.g. transfers of money, transfers of business parts).
In the case of a taxable person (VAT number holders), input VAT on purchases of goods and services related to business activity generally is allowed for recovery. Special limitations apply in relation to specific items (e.g. cars, entertainment expenses).
The Italian Budget Law for FY 2024 increased from 5% to 10% the VAT rate for children's products (e.g. baby diapers, car seats, and products for nutrition of infants and toddlers).
The filing deadline for VAT returns is 30 April of the next year.
## Wealth tax on real estate properties owned outside of Italy
The Italian wealth tax on real estate properties (_Imposta_ _sul valore degli immobili situati all’estero_ or IVIE) owned outside of Italy by an individual who qualifies as a resident for Italian tax purposes has been introduced in Italy.
The IVIE applies on the value of the real estate (i.e. the purchase cost of the real estate property resulting from the purchase act or the market value in force where the real estate is located).
For real estate owned in a European Union (EU) member state and in a country which is a member of the European Economic Area (EEA) that has an exchange of information agreement with Italy, the wealth tax is based on the cadastral value attributed to the property in the foreign country. In instances where there is a lack of cadastral value, the wealth tax is based on the purchase cost of the property resulting or the market value in force where the real estate is located.
The applicable tax rate, starting from FY 2024, is equal to 1.06% (up to FY 2023, the tax rate was 0.76%).
No IVIE is due if the tax is lower than EUR 200; otherwise, the entire IVIE amount is due.
If the real estate properties are subject to a property tax in the country in which they are located, the individual can deduct said amount paid from the tax due in the Italian tax return.
The mentioned wealth taxes will be determined when the Italian tax return is filed.
_See the tax regime for neo-domiciled individuals in the section, which substitutes the wealth tax on real estate owned out of Italy, provided the individual opted for it_.
## Wealth tax on financial investments owned outside of Italy
The Italian wealth tax on financial investments (_Imposta sul_ _valore delle Attivita` Finanziarie detenute all` Estero_ or IVAFE) owned outside of Italy by an individual who qualifies as a resident for Italian tax purposes has been introduced in Italy.
The taxable base is the value of the financial investments as of 31 December or the end of the holding period. The applicable tax rate is equal to 0.2%.
A change introduced by the Italian Budget Law for FY 2024 increases the IVAFE rate to 0.4% if the financial assets are held in states or territories deemed with privileged taxation identified by the Ministerial Decree of the Ministry of Economy and Finance of 4 May 1999 and subsequent amendments.
It is worth noting that Switzerland is out of the scope of the provision concerning the increase in the IVAFE rate, being no longer included, starting from the 2024 tax period, among the countries and territories listed in the Ministerial Decree of 4 May 1999.
Only for bank accounts, the above-mentioned tax is a flat amount equal to EUR 34.20 for each bank account. This flat amount is not due if the average annual balance of the bank account is lower than EUR 5,000.
The wealth tax will be determined when the Italian tax return is filed.
_See the tax regime for neo-domiciled individuals in the_ _section, which substitutes the wealth tax on financial investments owned out of Italy, provided the individual opted for it_.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
A tax on inheritance and donations was reintroduced in October 2006 after a five-year period during which this tax was abolished. The percentage and exemption limits applicable to transfers of money or assets depend on the beneficiary’s relation with the deceased person or donor.
In summary, in case of transfers made in favour of:
  * the spouse or relatives in a direct line, the inheritance or donations tax will be imposed at 4% on the value of the assets exceeding the tax-free threshold of EUR 1 million (per heir)
  * a sister and brother, the inheritance or donations tax will be imposed at 6% on the value of the transfer exceeding EUR 100,000 (per heir)
  * other family members up to the fourth generation, the inheritance or donations tax will be imposed at a 6% tax rate on the entire value of the transfer, and
  * all other beneficiaries not previously mentioned will be subject to an 8% tax rate to be applied on the entire value of the transfer.


Due to the entering into force of the Legislative Decree no 139/2024 some changes have been introduced with effects from January 1st 2025.
  * the inheritance/gift tax is due on self assessment basis by the taxpayer within 90 days from the filing of the inheritance tax return
  * the inheritance/gift tax is due also on transfers deriving from trusts or other constraints.


## Luxury and excise taxes
The following goods are subject to excise duties:
  * Energy products (e.g. petrol, gas oil, natural gas, coal).
  * Alcohol and alcoholic drinks (e.g. wine, beer, ethylic alcohol).
  * Processed tobaccos (e.g. cigars, cigarettes, tobacco).
  * Electric power.


Excise duties imposed on a product must be verified on the basis of its customs combined nomenclature code.
The tax liability, depending on the products, arises:
  * at the moment of importation or production (and the excise duties must be paid at the moment in which they are released for consumption in Italy)
  * when the excisable goods are used for heating or as fuel, and
  * when the excisable goods are released for consumption or used for own use.


The Italian legislation provides for many exemptions with regards to the use of excise goods.
Furthermore, under certain circumstances, a tax refund is granted to the operator who released the excise goods for consumption, if, afterwards, the products are not consumed in Italy.
## Regional tax on productivity
The regional tax on productivity (IRAP) is generally applied at a flat rate up to 3.9%. This flat rate is applicable to the productive activity exercised. The taxable base is the difference between the compensation received and the direct business expenses, excluding any cost of personnel and interest.
With the Budget Law for FY 2022 the IRAP for self employees and professionals have been abolished.
## Stamp duty
Financial investments owned in Italy by an individual are subject to the Italian wealth tax.
The taxable base is the value of the financial investments at 31 December. The applicable tax rate is equal to 0.2% for FY 2025.
This tax is withheld directly by the bank.
In addition, bank statements are subject to a fixed amount (stamp duty) equal to:
  * EUR 34.20 if the client is an individual with a balance lower than EUR 5,000.
  * EUR 100 if the client is not an individual.


## Property taxes on real estate owned in Italy
The Italian Budget Law for FY 2014 has introduced relevant changes to the municipal tax on real estate owned in Italy. The Italian Budget Law 2020 has abolished the _Imposta municipale_ _unica_ or IUC, which was composed of three different taxes:
  * Real estate property tax (_Imposta_ _municipale propria_ or IMU).
  * Garbage tax (_Imposta sui rifiuti_ or TARI).
  * Indivisible service tax (_Imposta sui_ _servizi indivisibili_ or TASI).


In particular: 
  * the TASI has been abolished
  * the IMU rules have been amended, and
  * the TARI remained unchanged.


In order to determine the taxable base of the IMU, a re-evaluation of the cadastral value of 5% is required; this amount is then multiplied by a certain coefficient (it depends on the kind of real estate and generally it is 160).
Specific tax rates provided from the municipality through a specific measure (so-called '_Delibera_ _Comunale_ ') must be applied to the taxable base.
The basic rate for a principal abode is equal to 0.5%; the municipality may increase or decrease the basic rate to 0.1%.
The basic rate for other real estate is equal to 0.86%, and the municipality may increase or decrease the basic rate to 1.06%.
The basic tax credit equal to EUR 200 and the children tax credit for a maximum amount of EUR 400 are recognised to the taxpayer.
Pro ration is based on the percentage and the time of possession.
Finally, the TARI can be determined on the basis of the medium quantity and quality of waste produced or by productivity coefficients.
The Italian Budget Law for FY 2021 introduced only for 2021 a reduction of 50% of the IMU due (this reduction is 37.5% for 2022) and a reduction of 2/3 of the TARI for pensioners residing abroad, for a single real estate unit for residential use, not rented or given on loan for use, owned in Italy by way of property or usufruct.
## Taxation of crypto-currencies
The Italian Budget Law for FY 2025 make some changes to the taxation of gains deriving from the sale of crypto-assets.
With reference to the tax period 2025 the applicable flat tax rate is 26%. Starting from tax period 2026 gains deriving from the sale of crypto-currencies will be subject to a flat tax of 33%.
In addition, the Budget Law above mentioned cancelled the tax free threshold of EUR 2,000 per tax period.
As a an alternative, the taxpayer can opt for the "revaluation" of the value of crypto-currencies owned at the beginning of relevant tax period (e.g. January 1st 2025), assuming, instead of the cost base or purchase value, the value of crypto-assets on that date. The applicable flat tax rate in case of revaluation is 18%.
Its convenience should be evaluated on a case by case.
## Revaluation of lands and shareholdings
The Italian Budget Law for FY 2025 confirmed the revaluation of shareholdings and lands. 
The revaluation rules have been changed to regulate the tax regime when fully implemented. Most important changes are linked to the temporal reference terms and to the tax rate of flat tax.
The 1st of January of the relevant tax period is the moment in which the land or the shareholding subject to the revaluation need to be owned. 
The 30st of November of the relevant tax period is the deadline to opt for the revaluation and to pay the flat tax.
Tax rate is increased to 18%. The payment can also be made on instalments without the application of instalment's interests.
