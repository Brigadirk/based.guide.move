## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
The following significant changes were recently introduced in the Hungarian tax system. The changes are mainly related to corporate income tax (CIT), personal income taxes (PITs) and related contributions, indirect taxes, and the implementation of global minimum tax.
## Rules of taxation
### Penalties, tax authority measures
In view of the emergency situation, as per Government Decree 181/2024 (VII.8.), the increased default penalty rates introduced from August 1, 2024, will amend the provisions of Act CL of 2017 on the Rules of Taxation as follows from January 1, 2025:
The maximum amount of default penalty will increase from 200,000 HUF to 400,000 HUF for taxable natural persons, and from 500,000 HUF to 1,000,000 HUF for other taxpayers.
### Timeframe of a tax audit initiated concerning a taxpayer, which shall be considered as unreliable
According to the rules in affect prior to the latest update of the respective document, where a taxpayer is considered unreliable during any period audited by the state tax and customs authority, or in a fraction of such period, or during the audit or any part thereof, the time limit for such audit shall be extended by 60 days.
Nevertheless, as of 28 February 2024, if liquidation, dissolution proceedings are commenced at an unreliable taxpayer during an audit in progress, or the liquidation, dissolution proceedings are concluded with continuation of the taxpayer’s activity in an audit in progress, the time limit of audit shall be calculated in accordance with the rules applicable on the start date of the audit.
### New reporting obligation on healthcare providers
As of 1 June 2023, the public administration responsible for healthcare shall provide records on the officially registered data of healthcare providers and their tax IDs to the tax authority by the end of the month following the given quarter.
In case the tax authority establishes a breach of the invoicing obligation of a healthcare provider, the public administration responsible for healthcare is notified electronically within 15 days of the reporting deadline.
### Non-compliant fulfilment of payment services providers’ general obligations under the Value-added Tax (VAT) Act
As of 1 January 2024, the state tax and customs authority may impose a default penalty of up to 5 million Hungarian forints (HUF) on the entity required to keep records, supply data, and retain records in case of non-compliance or late, erroneous, or incomplete compliance with the obligation of keeping records as specified in the VAT Act. However, no default penalty shall be imposed if the entity required to keep records, supply data, and retain records exculpates its non-compliance or late, erroneous, or incomplete compliance by certifying that it has acted as it may be usually expected in the given situation.
### Violation of the rules with regard to cash registers and customer application
As of 1 January 2024, the tax authority imposes a default fine of up to HUF 10 million on the distributor for the distribution of an e-register or customer application without an authorisation or for the distribution of an e-register or customer application other than an authorised one. Moreover, the tax authority may impose a default penalty of up to HUF 500,000 on natural persons and up to HUF 1 million on non-natural persons in the event of a breach of the statutory obligations relating to the mandatory use, distribution, and operation of registers. The tax authority may impose a default fine of up to HUF 1 million on the distributor if it has not attempted to repair the hardware-based e-register within five days of receiving the operator's notification.
As of January 2025 state tax and customs authority shall impose a default penalty amounting up to ten million HUF on the distributor in the case of distributing e-cash registers, buyer applications without a marketing authorization, continued distribution of e-cash registers, buyer applications after withdrawal of the marketing authorization, distribution of e-cash registers, buyer applications differing from the ones authorized, may impose a default penalty amounting to five hundred thousand HUF on the obliged person in the case of natural persons or up to one million forint in the case of non-natural persons, in the case of a violation of obligations determined by legal regulations with respect to the obligatory use, distribution, operation of e-cash registers.
The state tax and customs authority may impose a default penalty amounting to 1 million HUF on the distributor if he has not tried at repair of the hardware-based e-cash register within 5 days from receipt of the operator’s indication by the distributor. In the case of violation, the obligations of servicing hardware-based e-cash registers, the state tax and customs authority may impose a default penalty amounting to 1 million HUF on the distributor, manufacturer.
### Obligation to Issue E-Receipts
As of January 2025, an e-receipt shall be considered issued when admitted to the receipt repository.
### Content of Receipts
**_As of January 2025, receipts shall contain the following details in addition to the already existing obligatory details:_** the description of the goods supplied, the global trade identification number, where applicable, and the quantity of the goods, description of the services rendered, furthermore, the extent and nature of the services rendered, if it can be expressed in some unit of measurement.The percentage consistent with the applied rate as specified under Section 83. If the transaction is exempt, clear indication that the supply of goods or services is exempt from the payment of VAT; Where one of the special arrangements applicable to second-hand goods, works of art, collectors’ items and antiques is applied under the special provisions of Chapter XVI, the words “különbözet szerinti szabályozás - használt cikkek” (“margin scheme - second-hand goods”); “különbözet szerinti szabályozás - műalkotások” (“margin scheme - works of art”) or “különbözet szerinti szabályozás - gyűjteménydarabok és régiségek” (“margin scheme - collector’s items and antiques”) respectively.
### Documents Treated as Receipt
As of January 2025 any document, other than receipts, that contains the information specified below and that amends and refers specifically and unambiguously to the initial receipt shall be deemed equivalent to the receipt.
The documents treated as receipt shall contain at least the following information: the date of issue; a sequential number, which uniquely identifies the document; reference to the initial receipt that is being amended by this document; an indication of the detail that is being amended, and the reason for the amendment, including any revision of numbers, where applicable.
## Corporate income tax (CIT)
### Global minimum tax
On 1 December 2023, the Hungarian Parliament promulgated the law on the introduction of a global minimum tax (GloBE), which transposes European Union (EU) Directive 2022/2523 into Hungarian law. The law follows to a large extent the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) model rules and their commentary, including the Administrative Guidance published so far by the OECD.
The proposed bill contains a full list of Pillar 2 collection mechanisms, including a Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax.
The collection mechanisms will come into force according to the following timetable:
  * Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) from 1 January 2024.
  * Undertaxed Payments Rule (UTPR) from 1 January 2025.
  * Qualified Domestic Deduction Top-up Tax (QDMTT) from 1 January 2024.


### Global minimum tax: new notification obligation
Hungarian constituent entities are obliged to submit a notification form to the Tax Authority regarding their Pillar 2 status. The notification form must be submitted within 12 months from the start date of the tax year beginning in 2024 - by December 31, 2024, for calendar year taxpayers – and every year thereafter.
## Local business tax (LBT)
### Change in the subject of the permanent establishment (PE) definition for air passenger transport entrepreneurs
On 1 January 2024, the definition of PE in The Act C of 1990 on Local Taxes was expanded. As a result, entrepreneurs who perform air passenger transport activities are subject to LBT in the jurisdiction of the local municipality where there is an airport from which these entrepreneur's flights depart, irrespective of not having any fixed establishments there. Additionally, due to the PE triggered for local business tax purposes, airlines would also be subject to innovation contribution, which is calculated as 0.3% of the same tax base.
As of 1 January 2025, the scope of affected entrepreneurs has been narrowed. According to the changes, those entrepreneurs who are resident in a state which is a party to the Convention on International Civil Aviation opened for signature in Chicago on 7 December 1944 are excluded from the scope of the PE definition.
## Value-added tax (VAT)
### The introduction of the Deposit Refund System (DRS)
In connection with the DRS, the range of goods to be introduced as of 1 January 2024 will be metal, plastic, and glass beverage packages with a capacity of 0 to 6 litres (with the exception of milk-based beverage products).
According to the VAT Act, unreturned products shall be regarded as supply of goods. The chargeable event shall occur and VAT shall become chargeable on the last day of the calendar year. The taxable amount means the return fees on products not returned by the date of the chargeable event, and the return fees on unreturned products shall be applied as it contains the VAT payable as commensurate.
According to the new provisions, VAT shall be payable by the taxable person operating a binding return fee scheme.
### Changes in VAT rates and VAT exempt cases
  * The definition of infant formulae under the 5% VAT rate was clarified based on the customs tariff number.
  * The supply of dental prostheses will be exempted from the tax.
  * The activity of transporting injured persons and patients by a service provider carrying out this activity with an official licence and using a vehicle specially equipped for this purpose is now exempt from VAT (until now, only taxable persons who were public service providers could carry out this type of activity exempt from tax).
  * Journals published at least once a year are also included in the 5% VAT rate (previously only journals published at least four times a week were included).
  * Journals published at least four times a week (daily newspapers) are under a 0% VAT rate.


### An increase in the maximum amount of the VAT exemption for members of diplomatic missions and professional consular posts
According to the amendment, the exemption provided for private purposes shall be available to the staff of diplomatic missions and consular posts and to officers of international bodies up to the limit determined according to reciprocity for any calendar year, up to maximum HUF 600,000, unless the international convention expressly provides otherwise.
### New reporting obligation on payment service providers
Starting from 1 January 2024, payment service providers shall keep records of certain intra-Community transactions and report this data to the tax authority. The record-keeping requirement shall apply to payment services provided as regards cross-border payments. A payment shall be considered a cross-border payment when the payer is located in a member state of the Community and the payee is located in another member state of the Community, in a third country, or in a territory considered equivalent to a third territory. Payment service providers shall supply data from their records by the end of the month following the given quarter.
### New exemption for military use
As of 1 July 2022, VAT exemption shall be applicable on the importation of goods by the armed forces (and the civilian staff accompanying them) of member states other than Hungary, when such forces take part in defence effort carried out for the implementation of a Union activity under the common security and defence policy.
### Major changes in the Electronic Road Freight Control System (EKAER)
As of 1 January 2021, the range of product to be reported has narrowed since EKAER numbers need to be requested only in case of transportation of risky products on the road. This means that if a product not included on the list of risky products is being transported on the road, EKAER obligation will not arise. Going forward, as of 1 January 2021, simplified reporting could be made on risky products as well.
New rules are coming into force in terms of sanctions: the 40% penalty on the transported goods might only be assessed in case of incomplete reporting or when the reporting is made incorrectly regarding the weight or value of the goods (other mistakes in the reported data results in a default penalty of HUF 500,000).
As of 1 January 2021, reliable taxpayers are not required to provide EKAER risk deposit; furthermore, no risk deposit is required for requesting EKAER numbers for products with the 5% reduced VAT rate.
Also, from 1 January 2021, individual road exemption can be requested for all traffic directions, and the permit will be valid until revoked.
As the Government Decree 403/2021 was published on 8 July, the scope of products subject to the EKAER reporting has been temporarily re-extended. According to the Decree, from 9 July the transport of raw materials and products of strategic importance for the security of supply of the construction industry are also subject to EKAER reporting.
For the sake of clarity, we note that this newly implemented rule has not extended the scope of risky products, but, in addition to them, it has included among the products to be reported the listed raw materials and products for construction. Also, in relation to these new products to be reported, no EKAER guarantee has to be provided. Please note, however, that although the taxable persons concerned are exempted from providing EKAER guarantee, they will still be subject to penalties for failure to submit an EKAER declaration.
The above-mentioned temporarily extended scope shall be applied until the end of October 2022.
### Place of supply of virtual services
As of 1 January 2025, subsection (1) shall not apply to events and programs where participation takes place virtually, instead where the services defined therein relate to activities which are streamed or otherwise made virtually available, the place of supply shall be the place where the non-taxable person to whom the service is provided is established or, in the absence of an establishment, has his permanent address or usually resides.
### Provisions governing access to tax exemption for taxable persons established in Hungary and applying such exemption in any other Member State of the Community as of January 2025
Section 195/A of the law applies to taxable persons who have their business established in Hungary or reside there. These persons can opt for tax exemption like Article 284 of the VAT Directive in another EU Member State. Key terms like "turnover in the Union" and "turnover in a Member State" are defined for clarity. The tax exemption can be chosen if the person's turnover in the Union is below 100,000 euros, both in the preceding and current calendar years, and the Member State-specific threshold is not exceeded.
The taxable person must notify the state tax and customs authority in Hungary of their choice in advance. Upon receipt, an individual identification number with an "EX" suffix is assigned, provided the conditions are met, within thirty-five working days. Any changes to the initial notification must also be communicated, including any new Member States involved. Notifications and amendments contain detailed information about the taxable person and their turnovers.
Section 195/B outlines the quarterly reporting requirements for those who have opted for the tax exemption, including turnover in Hungary and other Member States. Any exceedance of the 100,000 euros turnover limit must be reported within fifteen working days, along with detailed turnover data.
Section 195/C specifies the use of euros for reporting turnovers and exchange rate conversions if needed.
Section 195/D mandates that notifications and data submissions to the tax authority must be done electronically.
If certain conditions arise, such as exceeding the turnover limit or ceasing activities in a Member State, the state tax and customs authority will deactivate the individual identification number given under Subsection (4) of Section 195/A.
Section 195/F states that if the turnover limit is exceeded, the taxable person cannot opt for the tax exemption again until the end of the following year.
For taxable persons not established in Hungary but applying the exemption in Hungary, Section 195/G sets similar rules, with additional requirements for declaring in their home Member State.
Section 195/H specifies the exemption application process in Hungary based on identification from the home Member State.
Section 195/K details the termination conditions for the individual exemption, including options for reapplying after specific periods if the limit is exceeded or other criteria are not met.
## Social tax
The social tax payable by employers after employment income is 13%.
## Advertisement tax
From 1 July 2019, provisionally until 31 December 2025, the advertisement tax rate is reduced to 0%, and taxpayers subject to the advertisement tax do not have to fulfil their reporting and filing obligations during this period.
## **Environmental protection product fee**
From 2025, the environmental product fee obligation ceases for products that were subject to both the product fee regulation and the Extended Producer Responsibility system, and in the future only other oil products, other plastic products and other chemical products will be subject to the product fee.
Accordingly, the product fee administrative obligation (i.e. the declaration and registration obligation) ceases for packaging/packaging materials (except for plastic bags), electrical and electronic equipment, tires, batteries, advertising carrier paper and office paper.
For these product groups, the obligations prescribed in the Extended Producer Responsibility system, including data provision and payment of the Extended Producer Responsibility fee, must continue to be fulfilled.
## **Registration tax**
Registration tax rates will change from 1 March 2025.
The tax rate will depend on the environmental class and power (kW) of the vehicle, and in most cases, it will increase compared to the previously effective tax rate.
## **Excise duty**
The excise duty rates will increase from 1 January 2025 and will be the following.
  * Fuels (petrol, jet fuel, gas oil [diesel]): HUF 148,760 to HUF 158,800 per thousand litres, depending on the world market price of crude oil and on the type of product.
  * Heating oil: HUF 5,970 to HUF 120,760 per thousand kilogrammes, depending on the purpose of the usage.

# Hungary
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
As a significant development in the area of tax administration in Hungary, a new Act on Rules of Taxation has been introduced with an effective date of 1 January 2018 (new ART). Along with its modified content and structure, the governing rules for tax procedures and tax audits have been set out in a separate new act, the Act on Tax Administration Procedure.
The primary goal of the above revamp is a change in the overall perspective of the tax authority, an aim to create a regulatory environment that is brief, transparent, and easy to follow for taxpayers. In addition, the new Act aims to strengthen the service provider nature of the tax authority. Note that to a large extent this major change is a reshuffle of the rules among different pieces of legislation in order to achieve a more coherent and transparent situation.
## Taxable period
CIT must be calculated by reference to the accounting year, which is either the calendar year or, for company groups, the group’s accounting year.
## Tax returns
Returns must be submitted by the last day of the fifth month following the last day of the accounting year (31 May for a calendar year taxpayer). The tax payable is determined by self-assessment.
Tax returns may be submitted either electronically or in paper format. However, those who are legally obligated to submit monthly tax and contribution returns (e.g. employers and payers) may only submit tax returns electronically.
From 1 January 2021, entities subject to LBT shall file their tax returns with the competent local municipality through the national tax authority. The national tax authority will forward tax returns to the competent local tax authorities in an electronic format only.
## Payment of tax
CIT instalments must generally be paid quarterly or monthly (above HUF 5 million tax payable). The final payment is due by the last day of the fifth month following the last day of the accounting year (31 May for a calendar year taxpayer).
The tax advance top-up liability for CIT purposes was abolished with effect from the tax year starting in 2019.
## Tax audit process
Generally, the tax authority selects the taxpayers subject to tax audit based on certain criteria, which are communicated to the public, and an elaborate risk assessment model. However, in contrary with the previous practice, in general, the rules for tax audits have been simplified in accordance with the new ART (i.e. there are two types of tax audits: [i] general tax audit and [ii] compliance audit, defined by the Act).
During a compliance audit, the tax authority may inspect whether the taxpayer complied with its individual administrative tax obligations prescribed by relevant legislation, and, in addition, may gather data and may inspect the authenticity of economic events concerned.
When carrying out a tax audit, the tax authority inspects whether the taxpayer’s tax assessment and the taxpayer’s obligation to file tax returns have been fulfilled.
A tax audit period can cover any years that are not lapsed (five years after the last day of the calendar year in which the taxes should have been declared or reported, or paid in the absence of a tax return or declaration) and not closed by a re-audit of tax returns. The tax audit starts when a company receives the notice of audit and finishes when that company receives the minutes containing the tax authority’s findings.
The deadline for the completion of the tax audit has also been re-codified. According to the general rule, a tax audit is to be completed within 90-120 days, although in special cases (e.g. related tax audit, request for assistance from foreign tax authorities) can be extended three times by 90 days. In terms of deadlines, shorter deadlines apply to compliance audits.
In order to avoid audits lasting for several years, tax audit deadlines cannot be suspended in special cases either (_see above_), and the audit shall not exceed 365 days.
Once the tax authority has completed the audit process, it issues its minutes. The minutes detail all the findings of facts of the audit and serves as the background of the tax assessment, and the basis on which the tax authority will pass its first-instance resolution. Upon receipt of the minutes, the taxpayer has the opportunity to submit its remarks to the minutes and raise any disagreement with the findings of the audit.
As one of the most important amendments as of 1 January 2018, the rules for the taxpayer to dispose new evidence during tax proceedings have been significantly modified. Upon the receipt of the minutes, the taxpayer is able to submit its remarks to the minutes and present evidence supporting its case within a 30-day deadline (increased from 15 days). In the course of subsequent proceedings (e.g. if a taxpayer submits an appeal regarding the first-instance resolution), taxpayers will not be able to allege any new facts or present any new proof that the taxpayer was already aware of but did not disclose upon the request of the tax authority in its remarks to the minutes.
In case of a dispute, the tax assessment of the tax authority may be appealed and challenged before the second-instance tax authority, which has the right to annul the first-instance resolution and decide on the merits of the case, or to instruct the first-instance tax authority to carry out a new audit if the facts and circumstances have not been appropriately and fully developed.
The decision of the second-instance tax authority is final and binding. Following the receipt of this decision, the company may litigate the case before the courts in Hungary. The court may uphold, amend, or annul the Resolution of Second Instance and, if it is necessary, may order a new process in relation to the tax audit.
## Statute of limitations
In general, the statute of limitations is five years from the end of the calendar year in which the tax return should be filed. Certain self-revisions interrupt the term of limitation.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The tax authority will take more stringent measures against ‘aggressive tax planning’ (tax planning that takes advantage of unintended administrative or legal loopholes) using its international experience and cooperation agreements. The tax authority will also focus on protecting the revenue of the central budget and supporting the competitiveness of the national economy.
The tax authority will also pay more attention to risky taxpayers, risky activities, and priority taxpayers. Furthermore, the tax authority will pay special attention to construction companies, catering companies, the sale of motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts, the black market for excisable products, and fruit and vegetable trade transactions involving potential VAT fraud.
On a monthly basis, the tax authority’s portal forecasts in which county what inspections taxpayers can expect.
## Special taxpayer categories
From 2016, the tax authority classifies the payers into three difference categories: risky, general, and reliable. The taxpayer status is quarterly revised by the tax authority. ‘Reliable’ taxpayers receive benefits, while ‘risky’ taxpayers fall under stricter rules.
Considering the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the national economy, the taxpayer status will not be affected by the foreclosure proceedings started under or within 30 days of a declared emergency period (first declared on 1 March 2020). Also, reliable taxpayers can opt for a 12-month payment relief once per year up to HUF 3 million.
### Reliable taxpayer
The tax authority classifies a taxpayer as ‘reliable’ if all criteria defined are met, including:
  * at least three years of continuous operation (or being VAT-registered)
  * no more than HUF 500,000 net tax debt
  * not being classified as a risky taxpayer
  * the balance of the taxpayer’s total tax liability is positive, and
  * the taxpayer is not under foreclosure procedure started by the state tax authority and was not in the previous four years. 


Further conditions are that in the year in question and in the preceding five years:
  * the tax difference on the taxpayer’s expense should not be more than 3% of the total calculated tax liability of the year in question; however, the total tax difference charged to the taxpayer has to be reduced by the total tax difference credited to the taxpayer
  * the taxpayer is not under bankruptcy or under liquidation procedure, forced cancellation, or enhanced regulatory supervision by the tax authority, and
  * the taxpayer’s tax number is not under suspension or cancellation procedure.


Furthermore, the taxpayer cannot be classified as reliable if the sum of the default penalties in the previous two years before the year in question is more than 1% of the total calculated tax liability of the year in question.
### Risky taxpayer
The tax authority classifies as ‘risky’ those taxpayers that are, amongst others:
  * not under liquidation or forced cancellation, but are
  * publicly listed due to a high tax deficit, tax debt, or
  * employing an unreported workforce, or
  * if the tax authority had to apply business closure measures against the taxpayer repeatedly within a year, or
  * etc.


In general, the classification of a risky taxpayer lasts for one year, but in certain cases may be cancelled in the subsequent quarter if the taxpayer settles its tax deficit, the related penalty and late payment interest, and the tax debt.
## Other rules
In line with the renewed profile of the tax authority as a service provider, new companies may be eligible for assistance as part of a six-month mentoring period. The participation, however, in the mentoring programme is based on the individual decision of the taxpayer. The mentoring programme comprises, amongst others, free information on the taxpayer’s tax obligations and personal consulting sessions with the taxpayer.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
Corporations are residents for CIT purposes if they are incorporated in Hungary, although foreign corporations may also be deemed to be Hungarian residents for CIT purposes if their place of effective management is in Hungary. Tax residents also include the Hungarian trust asset (_see Hungarian trust in the_ _section for further information_).
Foreign entities may carry out business through resident corporations or through branch offices (PEs for tax purposes). Commercial representative offices may be settled for auxiliary activities that do not create a taxable presence.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Hungary treats PEs as ‘distinct and separate enterprises’, and profit is attributed to a PE based on the principles set out in the OECD guidelines.
In the CIT Act, a PE is defined as fixed business premises (machinery or equipment) through which the entrepreneurial activity of an enterprise is partly or wholly carried on, regardless of the title of the taxpayer to those premises. A PE may consist of any of the following: a place of management; offices, including representative offices registered in Hungary; factories and workshops; and mines, crude oil or natural gas wells, quarries, or other places from which natural resources are extracted.
Construction sites (including assembly) and related supervisory activities constitute a PE if they last, in the aggregate, for at least three months in a calendar year. All activities carried out at the same construction site qualify together as a single PE, regardless of whether they are based on separate contracts or were ordered by different persons. Construction sites are defined as sites that represent a unit for economic, business, and geographical purposes.
PEs are also created by the direct utilisation of natural resources by a foreign person. A foreign person (except from real estate funds established in a European Economic Area [EEA] member state and not being subject to any tax that may be substituted for CIT, or being subject to such CIT but no CIT liability arises) is deemed to have a PE in Hungary if it utilises natural resources or immovable property for consideration, including the alienation or capital contribution of any rights related to the immovable property or natural resources.
A non-resident enterprise is considered to have a PE with respect to activities undertaken on its behalf by another person if its agent is authorised to conclude contracts in Hungary on behalf of the non-resident entity and the agent regularly exercises this right or maintains a stock of goods and products from which it regularly makes deliveries in the name of the non-resident entity.
The insurance of risks occurring in Hungary and insured on behalf of the non-resident person by another person constitutes a PE of the foreign insurer, except for reinsurance activities.
As of 1 January 2021, a service PE may be created if a foreign person furnishes services through an employee or other personnel engaged by the foreign person for a period exceeding 183 days in any 12-month period starting or ending in the tax year (with or without interruptions).
An additional provision was also introduced as of 1 January 2021, which states that a foreign company shall be deemed to have a Hungarian PE if its activity meets the PE definition of the relevant DTT. This means that DTTs shall override the rules set forth by the Hungarian legislation with respect to creating a PE in Hungary.
Furthermore, as mentioned above, a foreign taxpayer must also be treated as having a PE if it has a Hungarian branch.
The definition of a PE does not include the following:
  * Establishments used solely for the purpose of storing and presenting the goods or products of a non-resident person.
  * The stockpiling of goods and products of a non-resident person solely for the purpose of storing, presenting, or processing by another person.
  * Establishments used for collecting information, or purchasing goods and products, exclusively for the non-resident person.
  * Establishments used for other activities of a preparatory or auxiliary nature.
  * Activities of independent agents, provided they are acting in their ordinary course of business.


Note that a different definition of a PE is applicable for LBTs, and no definition is available for special taxes.


# Hungary
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
In general, costs and expenses incurred in relation to the taxpayer’s income-generating business activity are deductible for CIT purposes.
Accrued expenses are recognised for taxation purposes in the tax year they affect.
## Depreciation and amortisation
Accounting depreciation that is accounted as expenditure, and thus included in the accounting profit, should be added back to the CIT base. Tax depreciation calculated according to the CDTA reduces the tax base, even if the tax depreciation is higher than the accounting depreciation. The tax depreciation of tangible assets should be calculated using the straight-line method on the basis of the historical value from the time when the asset was first used for business purposes.
Examples of tax depreciation rates include the following:
Assets | Depreciation rate (%)  
---|---  
Computers and other high-tech machinery | 33  
Vehicles | 20  
Other tangible assets | 14.5  
Buildings (long-life structure) | 2  
Rented buildings | 5  
Assets newly acquired since 2003 can be depreciated at 50% annually; these instruments include, among other items, certain machinery and certain IP.
Generally, there is no prescribed amortisation rate for intangibles; the historical value, the residual value, and the useful life should be considered. However, goodwill can be amortised at an annual rate of 10%, provided that the business of the taxable person is in line with its intended purpose and that amortisation of goodwill can also be recognised for accounting purposes. Additionally, extraordinary amortisation might also be recognised for CIT purposes.
In the case of transformations, specific amortisation rules apply.
## Organisational and start-up expenses
Companies are not obligated to capitalise the costs of formation/reorganisation. The capitalisation of these costs is at the company’s discretion, but the company should comply with its accounting policy. Furthermore, only the direct costs of formation/reorganisation that are not classified as investments or renovations and are likely to be recovered ultimately can be capitalised.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are generally deductible if the following conditions are met:
  * Interest incurs in relation to the company’s profit generating activity.
  * Thin capitalisation / interest limitation rules are fulfilled (_see This capitalisation / interest limitation rule in the_ _section_).
  * Interest is in line with the transfer pricing principles (in a related-party setting).


## Bad debt
Under the Act on CIT, bad debts are only deductible for CIT purposes if they are, for example, supported by legally valid third-party documents stating that the receivable cannot be collected. Expenses related to claims that cannot be enforced in court and expired claims are not deductible for CIT purposes.
In addition to the above, 20% of eligible bad debts are deductible from the CIT base if the debt was not settled within 365 days from the due date, provided that proper documentation is available.
## Charitable contributions
Grants made or assets that are transferred without consideration, as well as liabilities assumed or services provided free of charge, will qualify as business expenses if the taxpayer has a declaration from the recipient stating that the recipient accounted the benefit/gift as an income hitting the P&L and its pre-tax profit and its tax base will not be negative without the income received in this regard and the corresponding CIT will be paid on the income. Special rules applies to grants provided to charity organisations and organisations performing no business activity.
Grants will always qualify as non-business expenses if they are provided to a foreign person or foreign resident company.
## Tax base allowance regarding R&D
A tax base allowance is only applicable for R&D activities if the taxpayer carries out basic research, applied research, or experimental research activities within its own scope of activities.
The direct cost of the R&D activity or the amount of depreciation on the research activity (if the cost of R&D activity is capitalised) is deductible when calculating the pre-tax profit. Additionally, an extra deduction is granted from the tax bases in the form of a downward tax base adjustment.
300% of the direct costs of research activity (up to a maximum of HUF 50 million) are deductible from the tax base if the research activity is carried out jointly with a higher education institution, the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, or a research institute established by them.
The same deductibility rule is applicable if a cooperation agreement is concluded with a research institution operating either as a central budgetary organ or as a majority state-owned business organisation.
Taxpayers may also deduct from their CIT base the direct costs of R&D activity carried out with own assets and employees of their related parties if, based on the choice and the declaration of the related party, the deduction was not utilised by the related parties and the R&D also serves the business of the taxpayer who utilises the deduction.
In addition to the R&D tax base allowance available so far, by introducing the global minimum tax a new R&D tax credit entered into force, which is proposed to be a recognised as a refundable tax credit. Companies have a choice between the two types of R&D incentives.
The new R&D tax credit is introduced with certain restrictions compared to the current R&D tax base allowance. The legislator narrows down the range of eligible costs and excludes certain direct costs related to R&D services performed as subcontractors.
It is important to note that the old tax base reduction and the newly introduced tax credit cannot be applied at the same time. If the company opts to apply the newly introduced tax credit, it cannot take into account the tax base reduction item in respect of R&D activities not only in CIT but also in LBT and social contribution tax.
## Employee benefit expenses
Employee benefits and the fringe benefit tax payable on them are tax-deductible.
From 2017, the CIT base may be reduced, up to the amount of the pre-tax profit ('super deduction'), by the acquisition cost, additional acquisition cost, and by the renovation cost of accommodation facilities for workers, as defined by the Act on Personal Income Tax. The CIT base may also be reduced in a given tax year by the rental fee of property rented for the purpose of providing accommodation facilities for workers and by the operational costs of such facilities.
## Bribes, ‘kickbacks’, other illegal payments
Bribes, ‘kickbacks’, and illegal payments are not recognised as business costs for CIT purposes and are non-deductible from the tax base. Legal consequences may arise as well.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are not deductible for CIT purposes.
## Taxes
Taxes are usually deductible for CIT purposes, except for CIT, recoverable VAT, and the income tax of energy suppliers and public utility service providers.
## Net operating losses
Losses can be carried forward according to the following:
Year the tax loss was generated | Period of utilisation  
---|---  
Prior to the tax year starting in 2015 | Without time limitation  
From the tax years starting in 2015 and onwards | During the following five tax years  
Losses carried forward may only be used to offset up to 50% of the tax base calculated without losses carried forward. In the case of acquisition or legal transformation, special additional limitation rules apply.
Note that earlier tax losses must be used first (FIFO principle), and the losses of predecessors are also deductible from the successor company’s CIT base if certain additional conditions are met.
Losses cannot be carried back (except for agricultural companies, who may account for deferred losses by self-revision or by correcting the amount of tax paid in the previous two tax years).
Certain special rules apply to tax loss utilisation by the tax group and by the group members themselves (e.g. losses generated before the establishment of the tax group cannot be utilised by the tax group; they could only be utilised by the individual tax group members).
## Payments to foreign affiliates
There is no general restriction on the deductibility of a consideration due to a foreign entity, provided the payment is a justifiable business cost. General anti-avoidance provisions (abuse of law, substance-over-form) may also result in non-deductibility. If the parties are considered to be related parties under the definition of the CDTA, the Hungarian tax office is entitled to adjust the Hungarian party’s tax base to reflect the market price (arm's-length price) if the parties did not make the adjustment themselves.
Considerations due for services are only deductible if the actual performance of the services is supported and the Hungarian taxpayer can prove that it benefits from the service.
The consideration paid to a CFC is not deductible for CIT purposes unless the taxpayer is able to prove and keeps documentation that it serves the purposes of business operations. _For further details on the CFC rules, see the_ _section_.


# Hungary
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
As of 1 January 2019, taxpayers are able to opt for a group taxation regime for CIT purposes. Group taxation is available to affiliated companies resident in Hungary for tax purposes, provided that such affiliated companies have at least 75% direct or indirect control over each other, have the same year-end, and prepare their financial statements in the same way (as per Hungary GAAP or IFRS).
By opting for group taxation, group members are able to offset their operating losses up to 50% against the positive group tax base if certain conditions are met, as well as apply simpler transfer pricing rules to the intra-group transactions between the CIT group members.
Eligible group companies have to submit an application to the Hungarian tax authority between the first and 20th day of the month before the last month of the tax year in order to benefit from the group taxation regime for CIT purposes in Hungary. The procedural rules regarding group taxation regime are included in the Act on the Rules of Taxation.
As of 24 July 2019, businesses that commence operations during the year are able to join existing corporate tax groups. Such businesses are deemed to become group members on the date on which they become subject to corporate tax in Hungary.
As of 1 January 2022, non-profit companies, social cooperatives, general interest associations of pensioners, and school cooperatives cannot be a member of a corporate tax group.
## Transfer pricing
As an OECD member, Hungary’s legislation is in line with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, acknowledging that the arm’s-length principle is the international transfer pricing standard to be used.
On 11 February 2020, as part of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, a new chapter has been added to the OECD Guidelines on the transfer pricing aspects of financial transactions, which will contribute to consistency in the interpretation of the arm’s-length principle and help avoid transfer pricing disputes and double taxation. In line with this development, the new chapter could also be applied in Hungary.
The latest edition of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines (published on 20 January 2022) includes the revised guidance on the application of the transactional profit method and the guidance for tax administrations on the application of the approach to hard-to-value intangibles agreed in 2018, as well as the new transfer pricing guidance on financial transactions approved in 2020.
If parties qualify as related parties (as defined in the Hungarian CDTA) and the price applied differs from the arm’s-length price, the CIT base must/may be modified by a transfer pricing adjustment. In addition, the foreign PEs of a Hungarian company and the Hungarian head office also qualify as related entities and are subject to transfer pricing regulations.
Taxpayers are required to prepare transfer pricing documentation for every transaction between related parties (including in-kind contributions provided by related parties), subject to certain exemptions.
Transfer pricing documentation is not required to be prepared:
  * For transactions between a resident taxpayer’s PE and a related company if the resident taxpayer under the provisions of an international treaty adjusts the corporate tax base ensuring that it does not include the foreign taxable income.
  * For transactions covered by an advanced pricing agreement (APA) issued by the state tax authority.
  * If the consideration due for goods or services supplied by a third party is recharged in full to a related party.
  * In the case of cash transferred without consideration.
  * If the value of the transaction does not exceed HUF 50 million during the tax year.
  * In the case of individuals, small or micro enterprises, transactions conducted on the stock exchange, or at an officially set price.


Taxpayers are allowed to consolidate transactions for transfer pricing analysis purposes if the consolidation does not jeopardise comparability, and:
  * the subjects of the contracts are identical, all material conditions for fulfilling the contracts are identical and fixed in advance, or the differences in the conditions are not significant, or
  * the contracts are closely related.


In the case of consolidation, taxpayers are required to include arguments for the consolidation (i.e. why the taxpayer believes that criteria of consolidation are met).
When determining transfer prices applied between related companies, taxpayers are allowed to apply traditional transaction methods or transactional profit methods. If the above methods are not applicable, companies may use any other method.
The formal and content requirements as included in Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action 13 were implemented in Hungary in Decree No. 32/2017 of the Ministry for National Economy, which has replaced, as of 1 January 2018, the Decree No. 22/2009 of the Ministry of Finance, the former decree governing the details of the transfer pricing documentation requirements.
According to Decree No. 32/2017 of the Ministry for National Economy, taxpayers have to prepare a Master File and a Local File as transfer pricing documentation. The new rules have to be applied in the documentation to be prepared for financial year (FY) 2018 first.
According to Decree No. 32/2017 of the Ministry for National Economy, the Local File must include, but is not limited to, the following:
  * Functional and risk analysis.
  * Industry and company analysis.
  * Economic analysis (including financial analysis, benchmarking analysis, and the process of selecting the most appropriate transfer pricing method).
  * Copies of APAs and advance tax rulings issued by foreign tax authorities that concern the local company’s documented transactions.


According to Decree No. 32/2017 of the Ministry for National Economy, the Master File must include the following:
  * The organisational structure and the presentation of the group (including the supply chain, inter-company agreements, functional and risk analysis, and business reorganisation, if any).
  * Information about the intangible assets, the financial transactions, the financial performance, and the taxation of the group.
  * A list of APAs and advance tax rulings issued by tax authorities.


In addition to the above, taxpayers are allowed to prepare a so-called simplified documentation for certain low-value adding services if criteria set in the Hungarian legislation are met. Decree No. 32/2017 of the Ministry for National Economy allows the preparation of the simplified documentation.
The transfer pricing documentation does not have to be submitted to the tax authority but has to be available no later than the filing date of the CIT return in any given year; otherwise, a default penalty may be assessed.
As of 1 January 2020, based on an amendment, transfer pricing rules shall be applied in the event of a capital increase as a result of contribution in kind provided by a shareholder who, prior to the contribution, did not have majority ownership in the company but acquires majority ownership through the contribution. The application of transfer pricing rules is also required in case of repurchasing of own shares, or transfer of such shares free of charge.
According to certain articles of the Act LXIX of 2021 on the Amendment of Certain Tax Laws, the competence of the HTA moved to the authority of the Hungarian Ministry of Finance with an effective date of 1 October 2021 in the case of APAs and transfer pricing related mutual agreement procedures (TPMAPs). From 1 October 2021, the Ministry of Finance handles the ongoing APAs and TPMAPs, and any new submission should also be made to the Ministry of Finance. Tax audits and international inquiries, however, continue to be performed by the HTA.
Act XXIV of 2022 on the grounding of the 2023 central budget of Hungary was promulgated in the Official Gazette of Hungary on 27 July 2022, which affects the applicable transfer pricing rules on several points.
The amounts of the default penalty related to the preparation or the record-keeping of transfer pricing documentation increased from the previous default penalty of up to HUF 2 million per documentation to HUF 5 million and, in the case of repeated infringements, from the previous default penalty of up to HUF 4 million per documentation to HUF 10 million.
As part of the modification, the fee for the APA procedure also increased to HUF 8 million in the case of a unilateral procedure and to HUF 12 million in the case of a bilateral or a multilateral procedure.
In addition, when determining the arm's-length price, should the taxpayer take into account data that is stored in a database or obtained from other sources for comparable products, services, or companies, then it is now mandatory to further narrow the elements of the resulting sample to the interquartile range (the use of the interquartile range has so far only been prescribed by the legislator in the presence of certain circumstances as defined in Decree No. 32/2017 of the Ministry for National Economy). Another change is that if the consideration applied by a taxpayer in a transaction concluded with its affiliated company falls outside the arm's-length range, in connection with the arm's-length principle, the adjustment of the profit before tax must be made to the median value of the arm's-length range unless the taxpayer proves that a value within the arm’s-length range other than the median value corresponds best to the transaction under review. In such cases, this value should be taken into account as the arm’s-length price instead of the median value. Therefore, as a general rule, it is no longer sufficient to make the correction only to the nearest value of the arm’s-length range.
The amendment also stipulates that if the consideration applied by a taxpayer in a transaction concluded with its affiliated company is already within the arm’s-length range, it is not possible to modify the profit before tax in connection with the arm’s-length principle.
The changes related to the application of the interquartile range and the modification of the profit before tax were first applied when determining the tax liability for the tax year starting in 2022.
The amendment of Decree No. 32/2017 (X. 18.) of the Ministry of National Economy on the Documentation Requirements Pertaining to Determining the Arm’s-Length Price was published on 28 December 2022, which imposed considerable changes regarding the obligations of taxpayers concerned.
Starting from the tax year of 2022, related-party transactions that do not exceed HUF 100 million at an arm’s-length price are exempt from the documentation obligation.
From the tax year starting in 2023, the Master File and the Local File are considered separate documents, from which the latter must be prepared per transaction or per consolidated transaction. Regarding the Local File, the amendment emphasizes that the Local File consists of a joint section, including taxpayer-level information, as well as a part at a transactional level covering the relevant related-party transaction. According to the amendments to the Decree, the joint, taxpayer-level part must be prepared only once per tax year, with the same information content as before. More detailed information disclosure is required (e.g. disclosure of general ledger accounts, cost centres, cost drivers, etc.) on how the related-party transactions are connected to the annual report.
The consolidation rules have also been amended, the most significant part of which is that procurement transactions and the sales transactions of the products manufactured from the materials procured, as well as transactions affecting expenses and transactions primarily affecting revenues, cannot be consolidated.
Based on the 2022 amendment of Act LXXXI of 1996 on Corporate Tax and Dividend Tax, in addition to the previous documentation obligation related to the determination of the arm's-length price, taxpayers also have to meet a new data provision obligation as part of the annual corporate tax return.
The Decree defines the scope of transactions subject to the data provision, which can be divided into three categories:
  1. Transactions exempt from the data provision: 
     * Transactions not exceeding HUF 100 million at an arm’s-length price.
     * Stock-exchange transactions concluded under the Act on Capital Markets.
     * Transactions applying a fixed price determined by any competent authority.
  2. Transactions subject to limited data provision: 
     * Any transaction that the taxpayer has concluded with a private individual in a capacity other than that of private entrepreneur.
     * The recharge of independent third-party costs in an unchanged amount and value.
     * Liquid assets that are transferred or received without consideration.
  3. Transactions subject to full data provision: 
     * All transactions that do not belong to the above-mentioned limited or fully exempted transactions, including transactions for which a resolution (APA resolution) has been issued in an APA procedure.


The data provision obligation must be fulfilled for corporate tax returns filed after 31 December 2022.
The strict rules on banning tax inspections, which have been in force until recently in relation to APA procedures, also changed such that, except for tax audits focusing on the correctness of the VAT deduction, only tax audits in connection with the arm’s-length price to be determined by the APA procedure are prohibited. The ban on tax inspections applies from the submission of an APA application until the deadlines set by law have expired. This amendment gives the tax authority more leeway with respect to tax audits, since previously it could not conduct any audits in relation to transactions affected by the procedure. In relation to APA procedures, the section of the Act on the Rules of Taxation that prevents taxpayers who are not required to prepare transfer pricing documentation from submitting an APA request was repealed. In accordance with this, for example, members of a corporate tax group are also entitled to initiate APA procedures in connection with transactions concluded among themselves.
Published in the Official Gazette of Hungary on November 28, 2024, there are key updates impacting the transfer pricing regulations. These changes clarify the procedures for legal compliance verification audits, authorizing the tax authority to examine the transfer pricing documentation and data reporting as part of these reviews. Starting January 1, 2025, tax authorities will have 60 days to conduct legal compliance verification audits, focusing on transfer pricing documentation and data reporting.
Finally, the timeline for APA procedures has been extended. The initial 120-day deadline for APA procedures can be extended twice by the Ministry of Finance, each time by an additional 90 days.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
In addition to the above, Hungary has implemented CbC reporting legislation. The new statutory obligation pertains to Hungarian resident companies that were, in the fiscal year preceding the reporting fiscal year, members of a multinational company group with a total annual consolidated group revenue exceeding EUR 750 million (or an amount in HUF approximately equivalent to the same, calculated according to the monthly average Hungarian Central Bank exchange rate for January 2015).
Under the general rule, a Hungarian resident ultimate parent entity must file a CbC report with the Hungarian tax authority within 12 months of the last day of its reporting fiscal year. The ultimate parent entity must also notify the tax authority about the last day of the fiscal year and that it is a reporting entity (i.e. an entity required to file a CbC report).
Hungarian resident entities that do not qualify as reporting entities are required to notify the tax authority about the name and tax residence of the reporting entity.
As a general rule, however, notifications must be made no later than the last day of the reporting fiscal year. Any change in the information reported must be reported within 30 days of such change occurring. The CbC reports and notifications must be submitted electronically.
Failing to submit reports or notifications, late submission, or providing incorrect, false, or incomplete information may be subject to a default fine of up to HUF 20 million.
### Public CbC reporting
On 23 November 2022, the EU Directive on Public CbC reporting has been implemented into the local legislation and published in the Hungarian Gazette.
The Directive is applicable to both EU-headquartered multinational enterprises (MNEs) and non-EU-headquartered MNEs doing business in the European Union through a subsidiary or branch with a total consolidated revenue of more than EUR 750 million.
Based on the legislation, MNEs would be required to disclose the following information broken down by EU member states, non-cooperative jurisdictions, and all other jurisdictions on an aggregated level:
  * Name of the ultimate parent entity or the standalone entity, the financial year concerned, and the currency used in the report.
  * Short description of the activities.
  * Number of employees.
  * Net turnover.
  * Profit before tax.
  * Income tax due.
  * Income tax actually paid.
  * Accumulated earnings.


The Hungarian local legislation requires MNEs in scope to explain the reasons behind any significant differences between the income tax accrued and income tax paid.
Furthermore, the domestic law does not intend to use the opportunity to defer from the disclosure of commercially sensitive information (for a maximum period of five years) and the option to be exempt from website publication.
In line with the EU Directive, the Hungarian legislation would require multinational groups to publicly disclose the above tax-related information for financial years starting on or after 22 June 2024. Accordingly, the first financial year subject to disclosure will be 2025 for companies using fiscal year end of 31 December. The information should be accessible on the public registry of the relevant EU member state and on the company website.
## Thin capitalisation / interest limitation rule
As per the prior years, interest related to liabilities exceeding three times the equity (3:1 debt-to-equity ratio) is non-deductible for CIT purposes. When calculating the ratio, debts from financial institutions shall be disregarded and the amount of liabilities could be decreased by the amount of cash receivables (to exempt back-to-back financing from this rule). On the basis of the prior rules, the non-deductible amount of interest qualifies as a permanent tax base modifying item.
According to the new legislation, which is implemented on the basis of the EU's Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD) and entered into force in 1 January 2019, the non-deductible interest should be calculated using the tax EBITDA, instead of the debt-to-equity ratio. Based on the general rule, the net borrowing costs are deductible up to the higher of 30% of the tax EBITDA or HUF 939,810,000. A major point of the amended law is that any interest paid to financial institutions will also be subject to the thin capitalisation rules.
For this purpose, tax EBITDA means an adjusted corporate tax base, i.e. the current year's tax base modified with the net borrowing costs, tax depreciation, and utilisation of carried forward unused interest capacities/exceeding borrowing costs (if any).
On the basis of EU's ATAD, Hungary implemented certain derogation rules that could result in a higher interest deduction (i) if the taxpayer's standalone equity/asset ratio is higher than the group’s ratio or (ii) the net interest expense/tax EBITDA ratio is higher than the taxpayer's standalone respective ratio.
We note that a grandfathering rule is also introduced, which states that in the case of loan agreements concluded prior to 17 June 2016 the old rules (i.e. thin capitalisation debt-to-equity approach) could be applied until there is no increase in the amount of debt or the maturity date is not prolonged.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Under the new CFC rules, effective from 1 January 2019, a Hungarian taxpayer shall treat a foreign entity as a CFC where the following conditions are met:
  * A Hungarian taxpayer entity alone or together with its related parties holds a direct or indirect interest therein, which entitles for:
    * more than 50% of the voting rights
    * more than 50% of the registered capital, or
    * more than 50% of the after-tax profits.
  * In the foreign entity's given financial year, the actual CIT paid by the foreign entity is less than 50% of the CIT that would have been charged on the entity under the applicable CIT rules in Hungary (i.e. less than 50% of the Hungarian CIT rate of 9% that is 4.5%, unless the foreign entity earns income that would not be subject to tax in Hungary either, e.g. dividend, capital gain).


According to the recent changes, an entity will no longer be automatically exempt from being deemed as a CFC solely on the basis that one of its related parties is listed on a recognised stock exchange.
In order to avoid the qualification as a CFC, the foreign entity must meet the following conditions:
  * its income arises purely from genuine arrangements or series of such arrangements, which the Hungarian taxpayer will need to evidence
  * its accounting pre-profit does not exceed HUF 243,952,500 and its non-trading income does not exceed HUF 24,395,250, or
  * its accounting profits amount to no more than 10% of its operating costs for the tax period.


From 1 January 2021, it shall also be considered whether the foreign entity is tax resident or the PE is located in a 'non-cooperating state' when determining the CFC status of a foreign entity or PE in terms of the Hungarian legislation. The list of non-cooperating jurisdictions is expected to be determined in line with the list issued by the European Council.
## Implementation of hybrid mismatch rules and related anti-avoidance provisions
As of 1 January 2020, the respective provisions of the ATAD II (EU Directive 2017/952) have been incorporated into the Hungarian CIT legislation regarding hybrid mismatches in order to meet the implementation requirements as set out in the Directive.
For this reason, among others, the following were introduced: (i) hybrid mismatch rules under financial instruments, (ii) hybrid payments made to a hybrid entity or to a PE, (iii) hybrid payments made by a hybrid entity, and (iv) double deductions achieved by payments made by a hybrid entity or PE.
In the above cases, the respective costs deductions must be denied, or the income shall be taken into consideration when calculating the tax base.
With effect from 1 January 2022, the respective rules of the ATAD II will be implemented in relation to reverse hybrid mismatches as well.
If a hybrid entity does not qualify as a tax resident in Hungary under the general rules but it has an establishment or a registered office there, it will become a Hungarian tax resident provided that the hybrid entity’s majority owner or shareholder has tax residency in a state that considers the Hungarian hybrid entity as a taxpayer of corporate tax or other equivalent tax.
The income of such a hybrid entity is taxed to the extent it is not taxed by the Hungarian or other country’s tax legislation.
The rules are not applicable for investment funds or other collective investment fund vehicles that have wide, diverse portfolios of securities and whose investors are subject to investor protection regulations in Hungary.
## Introduction of exit taxation rules
As of 1 January 2020, the Hungarian CIT regime introduces exit taxation provisions. The implementation of such rules serves the purpose to be in compliance with the harmonisation requirements of the EU’s Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD I).
Accordingly, a Hungarian taxpayer is subject to 9% CIT at the time of the exit/transfer of its assets and at the amount equal to the positive difference between the fair market value of such assets (to be determined in line with the general transfer pricing guidelines) and the tax book value of those assets, in certain cases (e.g. in the case of transferring the effective place of management to a foreign jurisdiction, transferring assets to its foreign PE).
Note that asset relocations in the frame of a voluntary liquidation procedure is/was also covered by the Hungarian legislation.


# Hungary
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
Foreign companies may establish branch offices in Hungary. A branch office is an organisational unit of a foreign company without legal personality, vested with financial autonomy, and registered in the Hungarian companies register as a branch office of the foreign company. The provisions of the Hungarian Accounting Act apply to branch offices, which must prepare reports using double-entry bookkeeping. Statutory audits are obligatory, except for the branches of corporations whose registered office address is in the European Union.
A branch office is regarded as established when it has been entered into the companies register. A branch office may start operating once the application for registering the branch office has been submitted to the Court of Registration, provided that it indicates ‘under registration’ on its corporate correspondence. Until a branch has been registered, it cannot carry out any activities that are subject to official permission. A branch office is considered dissolved upon its removal from the companies register.
Branch offices are treated as PEs for taxation purposes. They have to determine their tax base according to the general rules applicable to Hungarian companies. The profit for the year (calculated on the basis of the Hungarian accounting system and adjusted by specific provisions of the CDTA) is subject to CIT of 9%. The definition of PE is similar to that in the tax treaties but somewhat broader. For treaty countries, the respective treaty definition applies.
A foreign company’s CIT base is determined for all its domestic PEs (except for branches) collectively and for its branches separately. A branch should account for costs and revenues as if it were independent from its foreign parent company.
For a Hungarian PE, earnings before taxes are reduced by cumulated administrative costs incurred proportionately at the headquarters and any of its PEs, with the maximum proportion defined as the revenues of the PE compared to all revenues of the foreign company.
However, if there is a treaty between Hungary and the other country, the provisions of the treaty have priority over domestic law. Consequently, the provisions of the treaty have to be followed in the first instance, and all costs related to the activity of the branch have to be allocated to the branch, without the above restrictions in domestic law, and all profit realised with respect to the branch must also be allocated to the branch. The allocation method must be consistent from year to year, unless there is a good reason for changing it.
The foreign parent must continuously provide the assets and funds required for the operation of the branch office and the settlement of its liabilities. The employees of a branch office are in a legal relationship with the foreign company, and the foreign parent exercises employer’s rights. A branch is considered to be related to its parent company/headquarters. Consequently, the prices used in inter-company transactions have to be at arm’s length, and the transfer pricing documentation requirements have to be taken into consideration.


# Hungary
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
## Foreign tax credit
Unilateral foreign tax credit is available for income taxes paid abroad, up to the Hungarian tax payable on the creditable income (at a maximum of 90% of income tax paid abroad).
The foreign income has to be classified by country of origin and revenue type. The deducted tax may not exceed the lesser of either the applicable foreign tax or the applicable foreign tax based on the tax treaty between Hungary and the given country.
If there is no available tax treaty, 90% of the tax payable abroad is credited against the tax liability, up to a hypothetical tax liability calculated by using the average Hungarian tax rate. Ordinary tax credit is applicable if so described by a tax treaty. The average tax rate is the CIT rate, reduced by the applicable tax allowances, divided by the tax base.
Indirect costs should be allocated in proportion to the revenue and income of the branch office to the total revenue and income of the whole company.
Special rules apply to the Hungarian CIT group.
## Tax holidays
Tax holidays may be granted, among others, in relation to developments and for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
## Development tax incentive
Development tax incentive may be claimed for a 13-year period (beginning once the investment is completed or from the next year) in the CIT returns over a maximum period of 16 years from the following year of the original application for the incentive. In any given tax year, the tax incentive is available for up to 80% of the tax payable but is limited, in total, to the state aid intensity ceiling.
Claiming the tax relief is subject to a government decision, based on authorisation by the European Commission, if the total amount of state aid required for the investment project exceeds the amount that can be provided at the same county for an investment project with eligible expenses exceeding EUR 110 million. If the investment is below this threshold, taxpayers only need to notify the Ministry of Finance before starting the investment.
Tax incentives are available for investments if:
  * the net present value of the investment is at least HUF 3 billion, or
  * the net present value of the investment is at least HUF 1 billion in certain designated areas and provided that in the four years following the year in which the tax incentive is first utilised the average statistical number of employees (excluding those who are employed in foreign PEs) does not fall below the average statistical number of employees calculated from the data of the three tax years prior to the commencement of the project.


Besides the above, development tax incentives may be granted, provided that certain criteria are met, to companies that invest:
  * at least HUF 100 million at present value in equipment for zoogenic food production
  * at least HUF 100 million at present value in environmental protection projects
  * at least HUF 100 million at present value in the production of films and videos
  * at least HUF 100 million at present value in basic research, applied research, and experimental development projects
  * in a project aiming at job creation
  * at least HUF 100 million at present value in projects started after issuing stock market quoted shares
  * at least HUF 300 million (for medium-sized enterprises) or HUF 200 million (for small-sized enterprises) in projects at present value, or
  * at least HUF 100 million at present value in projects implemented and operated in a free entrepreneurship zone. 


From 2022, medium-sized enterprises are eligible for development tax incentives, provided that the given investment’s present value exceeds HUF 100 million, while the minimum threshold for small-sized enterprises is HUF 50 million.
As mentioned above, tax incentives may also be granted for projects aiming at job creation. In this regard, there is no minimum investment value and there is no additional headcount requirement, although the conditions prescribed in the relevant government decree still must be met.
In addition, the law stipulates that a taxpayer will be required to disclose the details of the investment in their tax returns submitted for the tax year in which the investment is put into operation, including, in particular, the date of completion and the eligible expenses actually incurred at present value.
The legislative rules of that time should be considered when the notification form or the request for a development tax incentive was submitted to the Ministry of Finance in connection with the investment.
### Regional aid map of Hungary
From 1 January 2022, investments of large enterprises in Pest county should be reviewed from a tax incentive point of view as the EU and Hungarian legislation is currently under harmonisation and their interpretation has a high importance. Investments located in Budapest are not eligible for regional investment aid.
Aid intensity is 30% in the Central and Western Transdanubia region effective from 1 January 2022. In most parts of Southern Transdanubia, Southern Great Plain, Northern Great Plain, and a smaller part of Northern Hungary the aid intensity remains 50%. From 2024, in the larger part of Northern Hungary (in Heves and Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén counties), as well as in part of Southern Transdanubia (in Baranya County), the aid intensity is 60%.
### Free entrepreneurship zone
The free entrepreneurship zone contains over 1,200 settlements in the unprivileged areas of Hungary designated by the government and coordinated by the regional business development agency that is comprised of individual regions, separated by public administration, borders, and topographical lot numbers, that are treated jointly for regional development purposes.
## Tax credits on investments to comply with energy efficiency targets
Companies carrying out investments aiming at increasing energy efficiency may be eligible to utilise a CIT incentive as of January 2017.
As a particular feature, the tax incentive, in contrast with the development tax incentive, does not have a territorial restriction, and investments carried out even in the capital of Hungary may be eligible, given that all other conditions are fulfilled. This type of tax incentive may be utilised at up to 70% of the calculated CIT liability decreased by the utilised development tax incentive for other investments (if any).
Investments become eligible for the incentive given that their initial energy-efficiency goals are met according to a certificate issued by energy auditors or auditing organisations listed by the Hungarian Energy and Public Utility Authority subsequent to the installation of the investment. Moreover, prior to the commencement of the project, a preliminary audit has to be carried out (also by an organisation described above) reflecting the rate of possible energy savings on the planned investment or reconstruction.
Investments aiming at renewal/renovation may be subsidised as well.
The rate of energy savings is to be measured considering the starting point/baseline regulations, or, in exceptional cases, against the energy consumption of a similar asset with the lowest energy efficiency (and attainable savings via installing the former) currently available on the market.
The tax incentive may be utilised at up to 45% of the eligible costs (calculated together with other incentives/grants) depending on the given region (but not more than the HUF equivalent of EUR 15 million at present value), which can be increased by 20% for small-sized enterprises, and 10% for medium-sized enterprises. The tax incentive can be used, at the earliest, in the tax year in which the investment is put into operation and in the subsequent five tax years.
The state tax authority will check the compliance with the requirements for the tax allowance at least once before the end of the third tax year following the date of utilising the tax allowance.
As an important limitation, an investment cannot benefit from this type of tax incentive and from the development tax incentive at the same time.
The investment must be maintained during the five years obligatory operation period.
In line with the changes to the general block exemption regulation, as of 1 January 2024, the amendment regulates separately investments and renovations for general energy efficiency purposes and energy efficiency projects in buildings. As regards investments and renovations for general energy efficiency purposes, the amendment provides detailed guidance on alternative investments and renovations that are significant in terms of eligible costs. In the case of energy efficiency projects in buildings, the amendment makes the eligibility for the tax credit conditional on a minimum increase in energy efficiency, measured primarily in primary energy.
In addition, the relevant aid intensities are reduced compared to the current rates. The extent of the reduction will depend on a number of factors, and the new rates of reduction will need to be reviewed on a project-by-project and renovation-by-renovation basis.
## Other tax incentives
### Film and spectator sports incentives
In Hungary, companies are encouraged to subsidise film production and spectator sports through the high rate of tax savings available. As sponsors, companies are able to achieve effective net tax savings of 2.25% of the financial support they provide for film makers or sport clubs. Also, the option of allocating 80% of the monthly or quarterly tax advance payments and 80% of the payable CIT to support sports and film production is available with the maximum tax credit of 7.5%. These two regimes are not applicable in parallel within the same tax year.
From 2017, the period for applying the tax incentive for providing financial support to film productions and sports organisations for popular team sports is extended to include the eighth calendar year (previously it was the sixth tax year) following the year in which the support was provided. The tax incentive might be utilised at up to 70% of the CIT liability. 
Rules for applying sports incentives have been amended as of 1 July 2017. The list of eligible sports, defined as spectator sports, now comprises football, handball, basketball, water polo, ice hockey, and volleyball.
### Tax incentive for SMEs
A tax incentive is available for SMEs (basically, those with less than 250 employees; annual net revenue of a maximum of EUR 50 million; or a maximum annual balance sheet total of EUR 43 million). SMEs that take a loan from a financial institution for the acquisition or production of tangible assets may deduct the total amount of the interest paid on the loan from their tax due without any cap; however, certain limitations should be considered as per EU law.
### Tax incentive for acquiring start-ups
From 2017, pre-tax profits may be decreased by three times the cost of shareholdings acquired in start-up companies, subject to certain requirements. This tax base decreasing item should be utilised in four equal instalments, in the tax year of the acquisition and in the three subsequent tax years, but only up to HUF 20 million per tax year and per start-up company. ‘De minimis’ related limitation should be considered as per EU law.
A start-up company shall mean a legal person registered according to the Government Decree on the Registration of Start-up Companies, and, additionally, the average statistical number of employees in the start-up company is two or more in the tax years when claiming the allowance.

## Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) from a business and tax perspective
Mergers in Hungary are tax-free transformations if they qualify under the definition of preferential transformation set forth by the Hungarian CDTA, which is similar to the one detailed in the EU Mergers Directive.
In the case of a preferential transformation, the predecessor company does not have to amend its tax base by the difference between the tax book value and the accounting book value of the assets. Furthermore, if the transaction takes place at fair market value, then the gain (if any) realised during the revaluation of the assets would also not be subject to CIT at the predecessor. However, in this case, the tax book value of the assets remains unchanged, thus at a later a stage additional tax payment liability may arise at the successor company if the accounting book value of the assets is higher than their tax counterpart.
Furthermore, for the shareholder(s) of the merging entities, the income accounted in excess of the historical value of the shares they acquire in the preferential transformation is also not taxable for CIT purposes for as long as the shareholder holds its participation. Special rules apply to reported participations.
Note though that several formal requirements should be met in order to meet the requirements of the preferential transformation set forth by the CDTA, thus proper planning is required.
In any other case, Hungarian tax implications may arise on the transformation, especially on those transformations that take place at fair market value and/or where real property is transferred. 
## International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adoption
Companies defined in Section 4 of Decision no. 1606/2002/EC (mainly companies listed on the stock exchange) have to prepare their consolidated annual reports according to IFRS. However, non-listed subsidiaries of EU-listed entities are exempt from the preparation of IFRS consolidated financial statements.
In Hungary, IFRS was adopted in a multi-stage procedure. From 1 January 2017, the transition to stand-alone IFRS reports are obligatory for credit institutions, financial enterprises, and listed companies. From 1 January 2018, the adoption of IFRS is also mandatory for cooperative credit institutions and other credit institutions taking part in the integration of cooperative credit institutions and smaller credit institutions. The companies applying IFRS for stand-alone purposes will have to base their tax liability calculations (e.g. CIT, LBT, and energy suppliers’ income tax) on IFRS as well. Companies that prepare IFRS reports at the head office level and/or companies that are subject to mandatory audit in Hungary are also able to opt to use stand-alone IFRS books in Hungary.
## Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) agreement with the United States (US)
Hungary and the United States signed an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) on 4 February 2014 in order to implement the US FATCA. The Hungarian IGA is based on the ‘Model 1 A’ Agreement, which means a reciprocal information exchange between the Hungarian tax authority and the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS). As part of the negotiations regarding the IGA, Hungary can include further entities and accounts into Annex II of the Agreement with exempted or deemed-compliant status compared to the originally issued Model Agreement. Changes to the local legislation for FATCA and IGA purposes have successfully been adopted by the Hungarian Parliament.
The first information exchange between the Hungarian tax authority and the US IRS was in September 2015. Reporting Hungarian financial institutions have to file their report by 30 June each year.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS) agreement within the OECD
The CRS, developed in response to the G20 request and approved by the OECD Council on 15 July 2014, calls on jurisdictions to obtain information from their financial institutions and automatically exchange that information with other jurisdictions on an annual basis. It sets out the financial account information to be exchanged, the financial institutions required to report, the different types of accounts and taxpayers covered, as well as common due diligence procedures to be followed by financial institutions.
The first information exchange between the Hungarian tax authority and the other participating jurisdictions took place in September 2017. Reporting Hungarian financial institutions have to file their report by 30 June each year.
## DAC6 implementation
On 23 July 2019, the provisions of the legislative proposal implementing the Council Directive 2018/822 of 25 May 2018 amending Directive 2011/16/EU as regards mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation in relation to reportable cross-border arrangements (the so-called 'DAC6') has been enacted into the Hungarian legislation. In brief, the DAC6 requires service providers or, alternatively, taxpayers to report on cross-border arrangements that meet either of the hallmarks set out by the Directive. Pure domestic transactions, however, are not in the scope of the DAC6 rules.
The relevant rules are in force from 1 July 2020; however, cross-border arrangements where the first step was executed between 25 June 2018 and 1 July 2020 must be reported too until 28 February 2021. With respect to reportable arrangements, the implementation of which have been commenced in the period from 1 July 2020 up to 31 December 2020, the information should be disclosed by 31 January 2021.
For this reason, previous cross-border arrangements/cross-border transactions are recommended to be reviewed from a DAC6 reporting point of view.
## DAC7 implementation
The new legislation transposes into Hungarian law the amendment of Directive 2011/16/EU on the reporting obligations of digital platforms (DAC7 Directive). The DAC7 data reporting imposes data reporting obligations on companies operating digital platforms, covering the 'active sellers' and their so-called 'relevant activities'. The activities covered by the data reporting are real estate rental, personal services, the supply of goods, and the hiring of means of transport. The law entered into force from 1 January 2023. The data reporting period is one calendar year, and the first DAC7 reporting must be made to the tax authority by 31 January 2024.
## Hungarian trust
Under a Hungarian trust contract, the settlor entrusts the trustee to manage (in its own name but for the benefit for the beneficiary) the assets, rights, and receivables (trust asset) transformed thereto by the settlor. A trust contract cannot have a term longer than 50 years.
The trustee can be either a natural person or a legal entity, and its private fortune is handled separately from the trust asset/fortune. The trustee is liable for the tax administration (tax number, tax returns, etc.) and the bookkeeping of the trust. The Hungarian National Bank keeps an authentic registry of the Hungarian trustees.
The trust asset is subject to Hungarian CIT and LBT and is considered to be tax resident under domestic law (thus, may have access to treaty benefits). If some conditions are fulfilled (i.e. the settlors and beneficiaries are private individuals) and the passive income test is fulfilled, then the trust may opt for a CIT exempt status.
The Hungarian trust is a good business opportunity for companies since it may be inserted into a structure tax neutrally.


# Hungary
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
The CIT base should be calculated by modifying the accounting pre-tax profit by adjustments and deductions as provided by the CDTA. _See Minimum tax base in the_ _section_.
## Capital gains
Capital gains (losses) are treated as ordinary income (losses) for tax purposes. In general, gain on the sale of assets is equal to the sales revenue reduced by the tax book value of the assets for CIT purposes.
If a participation is registered within 75 days, or a certain intangible asset is registered within 60 days, of the acquisition with the tax authority and held continuously for at least one year, capital gains arising from the alienation or contribution in kind of the participation, or the intangible asset, are generally exempt from CIT.
For participation exemption purposes, no minimum quota requirement is determined by law. Shareholdings in controlled foreign companies (CFCs) cannot benefit from the Hungarian participation exemption regime.
## Dividend income
Except in the case of CFCs (_see the_ _section_), dividends received and accounted for as financial income in the given tax year are tax-free, provided that certain conditions are met. Starting from 1 January 2021, the dividend received from a CFC is also exempted to the extent it is associated with genuine arrangements carried out by the CFC.
## Interest income
No specific provision exists in Hungary for interest income; consequently, interest income is taxable for CIT purposes.
## Intellectual property (IP) related income
The IP regime has changed in Hungary. In the transition period, both the old and new regime may be applicable, as follows:
  * The old regime is applicable to IP acquired or produced till 1 January 2016.
  * The new regime is applicable to IP acquired or produced after 30 June 2016.
  * In the case of IP acquired or produced between 1 January 2016 and 30 June 2016, special rules apply.
  * The old IP regime cannot be used after 30 June 2021.


Under the old IP regime, royalty includes gross income derived from (i) the licensing of the use or exploitation of patents, industrial design, and know-how; (ii) the right of use of trademarks, trade names, and business secrets; (iii) permission to use copyrights and similar rights attached to protected work; and (iv) transfers of the property described above (except for trademarks, trade names, and business secrets).
Under the new IP regime, royalty includes the profit (net income) gained through (i) the licensing of the use or exploitation of patents, utility models, plant variety rights, supplementary protection certificates, patented topography of micro-electronic semiconductors or a copyrighted software, or from registration as an orphan medicinal product (together referred to as 'exclusive rights'); (ii) the sale of exclusive rights, or from their de-recognition as non-monetary, in-kind contribution; and (iii) the supply of goods and services connected to the value of exclusive rights.
### Royalty income
50% of the profit (gross income in case of the old regime) arising from royalty is exempt from tax, but up to 50% of the profit before tax. Based on the new regime, further limitations apply (Nexus approach) to the IP asset related tax incentives if the IP asset is acquired from a related party or R&D services to produce the IP asset are rendered by a related party.
### IP reserves
Gain on sale of a non-reported IP asset that is transferred to tied-up reserves and used within five years (three years in the case of the old regime) for the acquisition of another IP asset generating royalty income is exempt from tax.
### Reported IP
Gain on sale of a reported IP asset is exempt from tax. _The details of the exemption are described under Capital gains above_.
## Development reserve
Development reserve may be created at up to 100% of the pre-tax profit (previously it was 50%). From 2021, the annual maximum value of the reserve is abolished. In general, the period within which the development tax reserve can be released, consistently with the cost of investment, is four years. This amount is basically available as a lump-sum tax depreciation for the relevant asset prior to the asset being acquired.
## Unrealised foreign exchange gains/losses
Hungarian taxpayers are able to use foreign currency for bookkeeping purposes. If actual gains or losses are hitting the P/L though, those might have direct tax impact. Note that unrealised foreign exchange gains may be deferred.
## Foreign income
Taxpayers resident in Hungary and foreign entrepreneurs (i.e. PEs) must calculate their CIT base exclusive of any income that is subject to taxation abroad if so prescribed by an international treaty. In any other case, a foreign tax credit is available for income taxes paid abroad (_see Foreign tax credit in the section for more information_).
In Hungary, there are no provisions under which income earned abroad may be tax deferred.


# Hungary
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
Resident taxpayers are subject to all-inclusive or unlimited CIT liability. Non-residents are subject to CIT on their income from their Hungarian branch’s business activities.
From 1 January 2017, the CIT rate is a flat 9% of the positive CIT base. The taxable base is calculated by adjusting the accounting pre-tax profit shown in the taxpayer’s financial statements by the tax base increasing and decreasing items (e.g. tax depreciation, thin capitalisation, provisions, tax loss carry forwards) prescribed in the Act on Corporate Tax and Dividend Tax (CDTA).
## Minimum tax base
Except in the pre-company period and in the first tax year of a company’s existence (or in the first tax year if separate financial statements are not required for the pre-company period), as well as in some other defined cases, certain rules apply if the profit before taxation or the general CIT base (the higher of the two) is below the minimum tax base.
The minimum corporate tax base is calculated as 2% of the total revenue with some increasing and decreasing items (e.g. transactions falling under the EU Merger Directive). In the above case, a company may decide to pay CIT based on the minimum tax base or may declare a statement in the CIT return. The statement provides additional details about the financials of the company, based on which the tax authority decides whether or not to initiate a tax audit.
## Real estate holding companies
The foreign owner of a real estate holding company is subject to Hungarian CIT in the case of the alienation or withdrawal of its shares in the real estate holding company.
The tax base of the foreign owner of a real estate holding company is the positive amount of the consideration minus the acquisition price of the shares less the costs of acquisition. The tax rate is 9%, and the participation exemption regulations do not apply.
A company and its Hungarian taxpayer related parties are defined as real estate holding companies for CIT purposes if:
  * more than 75% of the book value of their assets (on a standalone and/or group level) is in domestic real estate, and
  * they have a foreign shareholder that is not resident in a country that has a double tax treaty (DTT) with Hungary or the treaty allows such capital gains (from real property rich shares) to be taxed in Hungary.


Hungary has concluded numerous tax treaties in the past that provide treaty protection for such transactions; however, renewed treaties usually allow for source country capital gains taxation in such cases.
Domestic shareholders are generally subject to 9% CIT on the above type of transactions; however, they may benefit from the Hungarian participation exemption regime for capital gain taxation purposes.
## Energy suppliers’ income tax
Energy producers and energy distribution system operators are subject to energy suppliers’ income tax. The scope of the definition of 'energy suppliers' also includes mines, universal suppliers, and authorised distributors of electricity and natural gas.
The base of energy suppliers’ income tax is similar to the CIT base, however, with less adjustments applicable to the accounting profits. The tax rate is 41%.
If the energy supplier entity possesses a development tax incentive or a tax incentive in relation to investments aimed at increasing energy efficiency or renewal projects (_see the section_), then it is possible to claim this tax incentive for up to 50% of energy suppliers’ income tax liability as well. Additionally, the settled amount of mining royalty can be claimed for up to HUF 1.5 billion from energy suppliers’ income tax liability.
Special rules apply in this regard for CIT groups.
As of 1 July 2017, an extra tax base deduction is available in connection with the establishment of electric vehicle charging stations, unless the taxpayer has already opted for a CIT base deduction with respect to the investment.
From an accounting point of view, energy suppliers’ income tax falls under the same treatment as CIT (thus it is a non-deductible item for CIT purposes). DTTs also covers this type of tax.
According to the regulation on the extra-profit tax, the scope of taxpayers has been extended with the so-called 'manufacturing producers', namely bioethanol producers, starch and starch product producers, and sunflower oil producers. The new taxable persons are determined on the basis of the TEÁOR number under which an entity performs its activity and the heading of the Combined Nomenclature of the manufactured products.
Manufacturing producers will be subject to the general rules of the energy suppliers’ income tax, with the following main differences. Thus, as a general rule, the tax base is the adjusted pre-tax profit, with the tax rate of 41%.
## Advertisement tax
Advertisement tax applies to certain advertising services, including advertising services made available over the Internet. The tax applies in respect of advertisements that are published in Hungarian, or where the advertisement is not published in Hungarian but is available on a website/webpage that is mainly in Hungarian.
However, currently the advertisement tax rate is 0% in the period from 1 July 2019 up to 31 December 2025, both for primary and secondary taxpayers.
## Extra-profit tax on the producers of petroleum products
The tax base of the extra-profit tax on the producers of petroleum products is the difference between the price of crude oil originating in the Russian Federation and the world market price of crude oil (i.e. the difference between the average daily quotations of Platts Crude Oil Marketwire Brent and the monthly arithmetic average purchase price of crude oil originating in the Russian Federation) multiplied by the number of barrels of crude oil purchased from the Russian Federation during the given month, minus 7.50 United States dollars (USD) per barrel, if positive, with the petroleum product producer applying the official average monthly USD exchange rate of the National Bank of Hungary for the month in question when calculating the tax liability. The rate of the special tax is 95% to be paid by the producer of petroleum products in 2022 through 2025. The amount of special tax payable must be assessed and declared monthly by self-assessment by the 20th day of the month after the month to be reported.
## Surtax on retail tax
Retail tax under the currently in force Act on Retail Tax is payable on the basis of the gross revenues deriving from retail sales in a progressive way. From 2024, taxpayers shall fulfil their tax payment obligation on the basis of an amended tax table, which will generally mean an increased tax burden compared to 2023, except for retailers with gross revenues less than HUF 100 billion. The highest tax rate for this year therefore (including the surtax) almost reaches 5%.
## Local business tax (LBT)
All municipalities are entitled to levy LBT. LBT is deductible for Hungarian CIT purposes and is not treated as ‘income tax’ in the application of the tax treaties.
The LBT base is the total net sales revenue reduced by the cost of goods sold (COGS), subcontractors’ work, material costs, mediated services, and research and development (R&D) costs. These items are deductible under a decreasing scale at taxpayers with larger turnover (with the effect that lower margin businesses may have higher effective LBT rates). In order to prevent tax avoidance, the tax base shall be calculated on a consolidated basis for affiliated entities that have a gross margin (net sales revenue - COGS and mediated services) of less than 50% in Hungary provided the related-party relationship was formed as a result of a demerger carried out after 1 October 2016.
As LBT is payable in each municipality where the taxpayer is active, there are detailed rules to allocate the taxable base among these locations and a separate PE definition is applicable for LBT purposes. PE for LBT purposes shall also include solar power plants. Starting from 1 January 2021, a PE is deemed to exist in the case of construction operations exceeding 180 days. However, other business activities carried out temporarily are not subject to LBT. In general, the allocation is calculated based on a formula comprising tangible asset value (i.e. tax depreciation of the assets) and payroll cost figures.
General service fees, depreciation, and labour costs are typically not deductible for LBT purposes. Interest income, dividend income, and the LBT base of a foreign PE of a Hungarian company are exempt from LBT. Royalty exemptions, on the other hand, have been significantly narrowed down in line with the OECD nexus approach (from mid-2016, with an applicable grandfathering period).
The LBT rate may differ from municipality to municipality but is capped at 2% by law. In the tax year that ended in 2022, the maximum level of the LBT rate was 1% for micro, small, and medium-sized businesses, even if a higher tax rate was set forth in the municipal decree; however, from 1 January 2023, the deducted LBT rate is not applicable.
With effect from the tax year starting from 1 January 2020, in line with other taxes, top-up liability for LBT purposes was abolished. 
From 1 January 2019, local governments have the possibility to introduce tax allowance or tax exemption aimed at encouraging investment projects carried out within the territory of the municipality. Tax advantage may be provided from the LBT payable by the taxpayer for its taxable activities performed within the territorial jurisdiction of the municipality in the year in which the investment project is carried out or, depending on the local government’s decision, also in subsequent years.
From 1 January 2023, the taxpayers can also fulfil their obligation to pay the LBT advance and LBT to the National Tax and Customs Office by transferring it to an account to be made for this purpose for tax payment in US dollars or euros (EUR).
The transferred USD or EUR amount will be credited to the taxpayer's tax account in Hungarian forint based on the Hungarian Central Bank’s exchange rate on the day of the transaction.
### Calculation of LBT for small businesses
The calculation of LBT for small businesses was amended from 1 January 2023. According to the legislation, a company qualifies as a small business if its annual income does not exceed HUF 25 million, or HUF 120 million for a retailer company. The tax applies to the taxable base differentiated according to the income brackets (up to HUF 25 million or HUF 120 million) and the minimum business tax is HUF 50,000. The tax must be paid once a year, and no tax return is required.
### New PE definition
The Act introduces a new PE definition for entrepreneurs who perform air passenger transport activities. From 1 January 2024, these entrepreneurs are subject to LBT in the jurisdiction of the local municipality where there is an airport from which the entrepreneur's flights depart, irrespective of not having any fixed establishments there. The Act also explicitly states that the net sales revenue of the airlines should include the consideration received for the air passenger transport service provided on flights departing from Hungary and the services provided together with it.
From 1 January 2025, those entrepreneurs who are resident in a state which is a party to the Convention on International Civil Aviation opened for signature in Chicago on 7 December 1944 are excluded from the scope of the new PE definition.
In addition to the above rules, the Act also introduces a special calculation method for splitting the LBT base between the Hungarian PEs, if more than one is created.
As many airlines with departing flights from Hungary are not Hungarian tax residents and have no fixed establishment in Hungary that would have qualified as a PE for the purposes of the LBT under the previous rules, the Act will introduce a new levy for non-resident airlines that results in additional tax payment and compliance obligations for these entities in Hungary. Additionally, airlines with fixed establishment in Hungary may also be impacted to the extent they do not already report all of the revenue earned from their Hungarian departing flights for LBT purposes (e.g. because the tickets are not sold through the Hungarian establishment).
Additionally, due to the PE triggered for local business tax purposes, airlines would also be subject to innovation contribution, which is calculated as 0.3% of the same tax base.
## Innovation contribution
Companies defined as such in the Accounting Act, except for micro and small-sized enterprises (MSEs) and branches of foreign entities, are subject to innovation contribution. From 26 August 2022, LBT PEs of foreign entities (including branches) are also required to pay innovation contribution, similar to Hungarian entities. As of 1 January 2019, the MSE thresholds should be calculated on a group level basis, which may significantly widen the number of taxpayers. The tax base of the innovation contribution is, in general, the same as their LBT base. The tax rate is 0.3%.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is payable on sales of goods and the supply of services. VAT is also payable on the importation of goods, on the intra-Community acquisitions of goods, and on the purchase of certain services provided to Hungarian taxable persons by foreign taxable persons.
### VAT rates
The general VAT rate is 27%.
A reduced VAT rate of 18% is applicable for some products (e.g. certain milk, certain dairy products, products made from cereals, flour, and starch). The 18% VAT rate is also applicable to services that grant admission to musical and dancing events.
A reduced VAT rate of 5% is available for new residential property, certain pharmaceutical products, audio books, printed books, newspapers, district heating services, certain live performance activities, commercial accommodation services, certain products of the animal sector (e.g. live and processed large animals, such as pig, sheep, goats, cattle, poultry, eggs), fresh milk, internet access services, local dining services (i.e. meals and non-alcoholic beverages prepared locally in bars and restaurants), fish for consumption purposes, and the edible by-products and meat offal of domestic swine.
The reduced 5% VAT rate on the supply of new residential property will be applicable until 31 December 2024, but under the transitional rule it will apply until 31 December 2028 for long-delayed construction projects for which the building permit has become final on 31 December 2024 or the construction has been notified by that date under the simple notification rules.
As of 1 January 2024, a new 0% VAT rate is introduced on journals published at least four times a week (daily newspapers).
### Immovable-property-related VAT matters
From 1 January 2023, the domestic reverse-charge mechanism is changing regarding construction services supplied in connection with immovable property. According to the new legislation, the reverse-charge mechanism rules are applicable in case the building or the modification of the immovable property must be declared to any (not only building) authority (or in case it requires an authorisation, notification of some sort from an authority).
As of 1 January 2024, the law extends this declaration obligation to the service provider by providing that if the official authorisation or notification to the authority relates to the activity carried out by the service provider in relation to immovable property, the declaration is to be made by the service provider to the recipient of the service.
In case of a real estate where there is a change of function (change of use or change of the number of units of the property), then it is regarded as a new real estate in terms of VAT. In such cases, its supply will be VATable, provided that no more than two years elapse between the issue of the official certificate and the sale.
### Exempted, out of scope transactions
Certain services are exempt from VAT, including, but not limited to, medical, cultural, sporting, and educational services provided as public services. VAT exemption is also available for financial and insurance services. The intra-Community supplies of goods, services, and exports are also treated as exempt transactions.
Generally, the supply of a building or parts of a building, the land on which it stands, and the rental of real estate are VAT exempted. An option is available to apply VAT on the supply or rental of this real estate. VAT exemption cannot be applied to the supply of building plots.
There are some special transactions that may be out of scope of the Hungarian VAT, provided that special conditions are met. These include the acquisition of any contributions in kind, the acquisition of any assets by way of succession, and the transfer of business as a going concern. Regarding the agricultural sector, the conclusion of a farm transfer agreement constitutes a succession under the VAT Act. The predecessor is jointly and severally liable with the successor in title.
### Reverse-charge mechanism
A domestic reverse charge applies between Hungarian taxable persons for the following activities:
  * Services related to immovable property (e.g. construction, maintenance).
  * Sales of certain steel products.
  * Sales of waste materials.
  * Sales of carbon quotas.
  * Sales of real estate and land if the application of VAT was chosen.
  * Sales of certain agricultural products (e.g. maize, wheat, barley, rye).
  * Leasing staff or making available personnel and the use of student-work placement offices in relation to certain construction and other similar works.


### VAT recovery
VAT deduction is available only for the business-related element of purchases that were made partially for non-business purposes.
If a taxpayer has a negative VAT balance in a VAT period, the amount can be recovered, provided that the VAT balance reaches or exceeds an absolute value of HUF 1 million for monthly filers, HUF 250,000 for quarterly filers, or HUF 50,000 for annual filers.
As a general rule, the deadline for remitting VAT reclaims is 75 days, irrespective of the amount concerned. However, if all incoming invoices, regarding which the VAT was deducted in the VAT return, are settled (paid fully to the suppliers) by the due date of the related VAT return, a 30-day deadline can be applied, and a deadline of 45 days might be considered if the amount to be transferred exceeds HUF 1 million. The preferential deadline is applicable for taxpayers qualified as a ‘reliable taxpayer’ by the Hungarian tax authority.
### Special VAT refund procedure
Taxable persons, first in 2020, may request a refund from the tax authority of the input VAT charged to them if they, for reasons beyond their control, are unable to recover it in any other manner, which is contrary to the principle of fiscal neutrality. Requests are possible to be submitted to the tax authority no later than six months prior to the end of the period of limitation concerning the tax to be refunded.
As of 1 January 2021, the rules for the special VAT refund procedure were extended to the output VAT as well if the conditions laid down in the VAT Act are met.
Further to the above, as of 1 July 2021, the rules of the special VAT refund procedure changed slightly as if the occurrence of the reason for the refund request is within six months to the end of the period of limitation or after the period of limitation has lapsed, the taxpayer is entitled to submit this request within one year from the occurrence of the reason for the request.
### Deducting bad debts from the tax base
From 1 January 2020, taxable persons shall be able to retroactively deduct bad debts from their tax base through self-revision. Subject to certain conditions, it shall be possible to reduce the tax base by the net amount of receivables recognised as bad debt. The VAT Act shall specify in detail the claims that may qualify as bad debt under the VAT rules (i.e. the cases in which the above option could be invoked). Under the transitional provisions, taxpayers will first be able to exercise this option in cases in which the date of supply of the goods or services forming the basis of the claim falls after 31 December 2015.
As of 1 January 2021, VAT refunds on uncollectible debts extended to debts owed by non-taxable persons. However, an overly strict interpretation of the eligibility criteria for the VAT refund (e.g. if a debt settlement procedure for private individuals must also be carried out in order to collect the debt) might call into question the utility and cost-effectiveness of this provision.
Starting from 1 July 2021, if the occurrence of the reason for the deductibility of bad debts (e.g. the date when the dab debts become definitively irrecoverable) is after the period of limitation has lapsed, the taxpayer is entitled to deduct bad debts within one year from the occurrence of the reason for the request. As a transitional rule, if the occurrence of the reason for VAT deductibility of bad debts is prior to the entry into force of this rule (which will be 1 July 2021) and the one-year deadline has not been lapsed, the taxpayer can apply for deduction if one submits a request within 180 days after the date of entry into force of this legislation.
Additionally, as of 1 July 2021, the strict requirements in relation to the person receiving the invoices from the applicant of the bad debt deduction request (e.g. the non-paying receiver of the services or goods) will be abolished.
### Directive for refunds of foreign taxable persons
Taxable persons with their establishment in an EU country, other than Hungary, or in Switzerland, Lichtenstein, Norway, Serbia, or Turkey can recover local VAT. The refund applications have to be submitted electronically. Reclaim requests should be submitted to the tax authority of the country where the EU-registered taxable person is established.
### VAT refund reciprocity with the United Kingdom (UK)
Based on the principle of reciprocity, the VAT reclaim procedure is available for taxpayers established in the United Kingdom (taking into account the provisions of the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and the Northern Ireland Protocol).
### Administrative simplification to the VAT refund claims made by a foreign traveller
According to the new rules, the VAT reclaims made by a foreign traveller could be underpinned by a stamped electronic invoice. Going forward, this means that there is no need to present a paper-based invoice to the customs authorities in this procedure, thus the stamped electronic invoices serve as the electronic certificate.
### Reporting obligations
All types of intra-Community transactions have to be reported in the periodic Intra-Community List in Hungary.
Taxpayers registered in Hungary have to submit domestic recapitulative statements regarding incoming B2B invoices. If a domestic recapitulative statement has to be prepared, the VAT return can only be submitted in electronic form. From 1 July 2020, the rules for the supply of data by taxpayers changed significantly, as the former HUF 100,000 reporting threshold was abolished. Under the new regulations, taxpayers’ recapitulative statements are required to include all invoices on the basis of which they exercise the right of deduction of input VAT as well as any document that relates to an invoice that is/was already indicated in the statement and qualifies in fact as an invoice whose effect is taken into account in the given period (e.g. modification or credit invoice).
As of 1 July 2018, taxpayers are required to report to the Hungarian tax authority certain data regarding B2B invoices that are issued by invoicing software and have a VAT content of at least HUF 100,000. Such reports have to be made electronically, through an online connection, using a specific XML file format. As of 1 July 2020, the HUF 100,000 threshold was abolished, and data shall be provided on all invoices issued by the company to a domestic taxable person for domestic transactions. As of 4 January 2021, the range of invoices to be reported further expanded, as the data of issued invoices for which the Hungarian invoicing rules are applicable shall be reported towards the tax authority. The above-mentioned amendment resulted in that Intra-Community and Extra-Community transactions will have to be reported and, with a few exceptions, invoices issued to non-taxable persons. Also, the scope of the data to be reported extended.
An Electronic Road Freight Control System (EKAER) number needs to be requested from the tax authority for specific road shipments. The taxpayers who do not fulfil this reporting obligation can face serious consequences (e.g. if a taxpayer fails to report or reports an incorrect weight or value data, the tax authority is entitled to levy a default penalty of up to 40% of the value of the incorrectly reported goods and also to seize the goods).
### New rules regarding e-commerce
#### Distance services
In line with Council Directive (EU) 2017/2455, additional simplification has been introduced regarding the VAT rules on electronically supplied telecommunication and broadcasting services (‘distance services’) for non-taxable private individuals. If certain conditions are fulfilled, the service provider taxpayer is allowed to determine its VAT liabilities according to the regulation of the member state where it is established instead of the member state of the service recipient, up to a threshold of EUR 10,000, which, as of 1 July 2021, is consolidated with the intra-Community distance sales performed by this taxpayer as well. As a result of this simplification, the service provider taxpayer is able to avoid VAT registration in each of the affected member states of the service recipients.
However, the regulation sets out that the service provider taxpayers still have the right to decide to determine their VAT liabilities according to the rules of the member state of their service recipients instead of applying the new simplification rules. In this case, taxpayers will remain bound to their decision until the end of the second calendar year subsequent to the calendar year of their decision.
The rules apply to supplies performed after 31 December 2018.
#### Distance sales
In accordance with the VAT Directive, the VAT Act defines 'intra-Community distance sales' and the 'distance sale of goods imported from a third country'. Both definitions stipulate that the goods must be supplied to non-taxable persons. Distance sale means a transaction in which a private individual resident in an EU member state buys goods at a distance from a taxable person in another EU member state or from a third country, and the goods are delivered directly to that individual.
The VAT on the supply of goods at a distance must be paid in most cases (i.e. for intra-Community distance sales above a certain threshold) in the member state of consumption (which, in practice, means that the taxpayer selling the goods must register for, declare, and pay VAT in that member state). Therefore, in order to reduce the administrative burden on taxpayers carrying out such activities, the following arrangements and special rules were introduced:
##### Extension of the One-Stop Shop (OSS)
The OSS, which previously applied to telecommunications, broadcasting, and electronically supplied services, is extended to include all other services provided to non-taxable persons in EU member states and also covers the obligation to declare and pay tax on intra-Community distance sales. The use of the OSS is optional, but many taxpayers are expected to opt in since it can significantly reduce the taxpayers’ administrative burden.
In the case of a Hungarian person who chose individual tax exemption status, they cannot act in this capacity in the case of intra-Community distance supplies in another EU member state or of import distance supplies, but they are entitled to deduct the input VAT in relation to these transactions. However, the value of the OSS transactions will be not included of the threshold for the individual tax exemption status. Taxpayers are able to use the system after 1 July 2021, subject to prior registration.
As of January 2025, if at the time of application the taxpayer chooses individual tax exemption in value added tax in accordance with Chapter XIII Subtitle 1 and Subtitle 2 of the VAT Act, the state tax and customs authority shall issue his tax number within fifteen working days, except when under the tax registration procedure it explores impediment of issuing a tax number. The state tax and customs authority shall inform the taxpayer of the existence of such impediment within fifteen working days from the application.
##### Introducing the Import One-Stop Shop (IOSS)
A separate IOSS has been introduced for declaring and paying tax on intra-Community distance sales of goods imported from a third country. In addition to reducing administrative burdens, another advantage of this system is that the goods concerned will be exempted from import VAT.
The conditions for using the IOSS system are stricter: it can only be used for the distance sale of low-value consignments of a value up to EUR 150 (i.e. the duty exemption threshold), and non-resident taxpayers must also usually authorise an intermediary. The intermediary must meet the same requirements as those imposed on financial representatives and will be jointly and severally liable with the taxpayer giving the authorisation for fulfilling the tax obligations.
However, it is important to note that the one-stop shops described above allow tax payments only.
##### Special rules for paying import VAT on low-value consignments
As of 1 July 2021, the VAT Act laid down simplified rules for the payment of import VAT on imports of low-value consignments worth less than EUR 150 if the seller does not use the IOSS.
Under this simplification, as a rule, the person initiating the release of the goods for free circulation should collect the import VAT from the consignee and pay it to the tax authority. However, the above simplification may only be used by taxable persons registered in Hungary who initiate the release for free circulation and hold an authorisation for deferred payment of customs duties.
Under the above simplified import VAT payment, the rate of import VAT is 27% in all cases, regardless of the VAT rate applicable to the imported goods.
In addition, the tax exemption of consignments of a value up to EUR 22 has been abolished.
### Platforms as new quasi-taxpayers
The rules effective as of 1 July 2021 treat platforms and online marketplaces as taxable persons acting as intermediaries in the supply of goods. This change primarily affects platforms, and taxable persons selling through these platforms, rather than the customers.
If certain criteria are met, platforms will qualify for VAT purposes as 'both the buyers and sellers of the goods'. These criteria include facilitating the distance sale of goods imported from a third country with a value not exceeding EUR 150 or facilitating the sale of goods already in the territory of the Community, provided that the seller is not established in the Community.
Under the new rules, taxable online platforms are required to record transactions that have been carried out for non-taxable persons with their participation in the territory of the Community. The purpose of this obligation is to make sure that taxes are paid on supplies of goods and services in electronic commerce. These records must be retained for ten years.
### Group taxation for VAT
The VAT Act allows all companies that have established business presences in Hungary and qualify as related enterprises to form a VAT group. The essence of a VAT group is that its members act under a single VAT number in their transactions (i.e. they issue invoices under a shared VAT number and submit a single, joint tax return) and the supplies of products and services between the members do not qualify as business transactions from a VAT perspective.
In case a member leaves the VAT group, it also qualifies as a succession for VAT purposes.
## Customs duties
Hungarian customs legislation and policies have been fully harmonised with EU legislation.
As of 1 January 2025, the EU customs legislation comprises of the following main regulations:
  * Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the Union Customs Code.
  * Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards detailed rules concerning certain provisions of the Union Customs Code.
  * Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2447 laying down detailed rules for implementing certain provisions of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the Union Customs Code.
  * Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/341 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards transitional rules for certain provisions of the Union Customs Code where the relevant electronic systems are not yet operational and amending Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446.
  * Council Regulation 1186/2009/EEC setting up a Community system of reliefs from customs duty.
  * Council Regulation 2658/87/EEC on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff.


New national customs regulation entered into force as of 1 January 2018 (Act CLII 2017 on Implementing the Union Customs Law). Some of the main changes compared to the previous legislation are as follows:
  * Procedural regulation became an integral part of the national customs law.
  * The procedure of customs audit (e.g. right to comment on the customs authority’s assessment) changed.
  * By the main rule, information (such as declarations, applications, or decisions) will be provided and exchanged electronically between the customs authority and economic operators.


As a general rule, non-compliance resulting in a customs shortfall attracts a customs penalty of 50% of the customs duty deficit.
## Excise duties
The following goods are subject to excise duty:
  * Mineral oils.
  * Alcohol and alcoholic beverages. Any product with an alcohol content of 1.2% or more by volume qualifies as an alcohol product.
  * Beers.
  * Still and sparkling wines.
  * Other still and sparkling fermented beverages.
  * Intermediate alcoholic products.
  * Tobacco products.
  * Energy products (electricity, natural gas, and coal).


As of 1 January 2025, the excise duty rates are as follows:
  * Fuels (petrol, jet fuel, gas oil [diesel]): HUF 148,760 to HUF 158,800 per thousand litres, depending on the world market price of crude oil and on the type of product.
  * Heating oil: HUF 5,970 to HUF 120,760 per thousand kilogrammes, depending on the purpose of the usage.
  * LPG: HUF 0 to HUF 99,730 per thousand kilogrammes, depending on the purpose of the usage.
  * Electricity: HUF 398/MWh.

  * Other still fermented beverages: HUF 11,350 per hectolitre for other fermented beverages, HUF 0 per hectolitre for still wine of an actual alcoholic strength by volume not exceeding 8.5% volume mixed with carbonated water without added flavouring, where the ratio of still wine exceeds 50%.
  * Other sparkling fermented beverages: HUF 18,840 per hectolitre.
  * Intermediate alcoholic products: HUF 29,250 per hectolitre.
  * Cigarettes: HUF 32,300 per thousand pieces and 24% of the retail selling price, but not less than HUF 45,200 per thousand pieces. The tax base per cigarette also depends on the length of the cigarette (without filter). It is double if the length of the cigarette is 8 cm to 11 cm, triple if the length is 11 cm to 14 cm, and so on.
  * Cigars and cigarillos: 14% of the retail selling price, but not less than HUF 5,230 per thousand pieces.
  * Fine-cut and other tobacco: HUF 28,060 per kilogramme.

  * Heated products: HUF 38 per piece.


The European Union’s excise duty and energy tax rules apply in Hungary.
## Building and land taxes
Hungarian municipalities have the right to levy building tax and land tax at their own discretion up to the below caps.
### Building tax
Residential and other buildings may be subject to building tax, which is payable to the local municipality by the entity/individual owning the building on 1 January of the particular calendar year. The building tax should be paid in two instalments, on 15 March and on 15 September each year.
The local government can determine the tax base in either of the following ways:
  * The net floor space of the building expressed in square metres, with a maximum tax rate of HUF 1,100 per square metre; however, the municipalities have the right to increase it by the annual cumulative inflation rate (i.e. the maximum tax rate was HUF 2,018 per square metre in 2021).
  * The adjusted fair market value of the building, with a maximum tax rate of 3.6% of the adjusted market value.


In practice, the net floor space method is more commonly used since establishing the adjusted fair market value is usually problematic.
### Land tax
The owner of the land on the first day of the calendar year is subject to land tax liability. Undeveloped plots of land situated within the area of jurisdiction of a local government, including peripheries, are subject to this tax. The land tax should be paid in two instalments, on 15 March and on 15 September each year.
The local government can determine the tax base in either of the following ways:
  * The actual area of the plot expressed in square metres, with a maximum tax rate of HUF 200 per square metre; however, the municipalities have the right to increase it by the annual cumulative inflation rate (i.e. the maximum tax rate was HUF 367 per square metre in 2021).
  * The adjusted market value of the plot, with a maximum tax rate of 3% of the adjusted market value.


## Stamp duties
The most common types of stamp duties are gift duty and duty on transfers of property for consideration. Stamp duty is levied on movable and immovable property and property rights if they were acquired in Hungary, unless an international agreement rules otherwise.
### Gift duty
In general, gift duty arises on the date when a contract concerning a gift is concluded or, if there is no contract available, on the date when the acquisition without any considerations takes place.
Transfers of movable property, immovable property, and property rights without consideration are subject to gift duty. In these cases, however, in general, gift duty is only incurred if the transaction was formally documented; except for movable property with a market value of more than HUF 150,000, where gift duty must be paid in any event.
The base of the gift duty is the net value of the gift, which is the market value minus any liabilities related to the gift. The general duty rates vary, depending on the type of property: 9% on residential property and 18% on other assets (except vehicles, where special rules apply). In general, the transaction shall be reported to the national tax authority within 30 days.
Transfer of movable assets without consideration and acquisition of claims without consideration, including waiver of claims and assumption of debts, are exempt from gift duty, provided that the recipient is a company. However, this exemption is conditional and subject to review.
### Duty on transfer of property for consideration
The obligation to pay duty on the transfer of certain defined movable and immovable property for consideration arises on the date when the contract on the transaction is concluded.
The acquisition of real estate, property rights, and the acquisition of existing direct or indirect shareholdings in companies that own domestic real estate are subject to transfer tax. In this latter case, transfer tax only applies for acquisitions of existing direct or indirect shareholdings of at least 75% in a company that owns domestic real estate. When calculating this threshold, the book value of properties acquired between the latest balance sheet date up to the date of the transfer shall also be added to the figures of the latest balance sheet.
The transfer tax for the acquisition of real estate property and the direct or indirect acquisition of shareholdings in real estate holding companies is 4% of the fair market value of the real estate owned up to HUF 1 billion and 2% of the amount exceeding HUF 1 billion, up to a maximum of HUF 200 million per real estate (i.e. per plot number).
Reduced rates of 2%/3% apply if the company acquiring the property qualifies as a real estate trading company, or it deals with financial leasing, and the property is sold/leased out within two years. REIFs and REITs may also benefit from a reduced transfer tax rate of 2%. Note that in the case of REIFs and REITs the above HUF 200 million cap per plot number cannot be applied.
Special rules apply to the sale/acquisition of real estate properties rezoned as incorporated lands or the sale/acquisition of shareholdings in an entity owning such lands.
Stamp duties are also levied on certain court procedures (e.g. Court of Registration) and on submissions to certain authorities (e.g. appeals to the tax authority). Stamp duty is, for instance, levied in an amount of:
  * HUF 100,000 on the registration of a private stock company
  * Free of charge on the registration of a limited liability company
  * HUF 600,000 on the registration of a European stock company
  * HUF 100,000 on the registration of any other entity with legal personality (except from European companies)
  * HUF 50,000 on the registration of a branch office, and
  * HUF 50,000 on the registration of a representative office.


According to the new rules, the transfer of real estate between related companies is exempt from the duty on the onerous transfer of property. Under the previous rules, the exemption was subject to the main activity of the acquiring party being the rental or operation of own or rented real estate, or the sale of own real estate. Under the new rules, the exemption is subject to having 50% of the sales revenue from the above-mentioned activities, or from one of them, representing 50% of the total sales revenue, instead of just being the core activity of the acquiring party on a certain date.
## Registration tax
Registration tax is charged on passenger cars, motor homes, and motorcycles before they can be registered and put into service in Hungary. The registration tax is also payable by fleet operators. The registration tax is payable with the first domestic registration via import or intra-Community purchase, or in the case of a conversion, provided that the vehicle is put into service.
The registration tax rate as of 1 January 2025 is applied as follows:
  * Passenger cars: From HUF 45,000 up to HUF 4.8 million, depending on the technical features of vehicles (cc, engine type) and environmental classification.
  * Hybrid cars: HUF 76,000.
  * Purely electrical vehicles, plug-in hybrid electrical vehicles, increased range plug-in hybrid electrical vehicles, and zero-emission vehicles: HUF 0.
  * Motorcycles: From HUF 15,000 up to HUF 230,000, depending on technical features of the motorcycles (cc).
  * Electric and hybrid motorcycles: HUF 0.


The registration tax rate as of 1 March 2025 is applied as follows:
  * Passenger cars: From HUF 45,000 up to HUF 9.72 million, depending on the power (kW) and environmental class of vehicles.
  * Purely electrical vehicles and zero-emission vehicles: HUF 0.
  * Motorcycles: From HUF 45,000 up to HUF 225,000, depending on the power (kW) of the motorcycles.
  * Electrically powered motorcycles: HUF 0.


The applicable registration tax rate shall be modified (i.e. decreased) as per special formula, depending on the age of the vehicle expressed in months.
The registration tax is levied by the Customs Body of the National Tax and Customs Administration.
## Employment-related tax and social security contributions (social tax) payable by employers
The social tax base is the gross income paid to the employee. The tax rate is 13%.
## Mining royalty
Mineral resources and geothermal energy, at the places where they are found in nature, are state property and subject to concession.
The mining company must pay a mining royalty, based on the quantity of the mineral resources extracted under authority permit.
According to the regulation on the extra-profit tax, the rate of the mining royalty increased for tax years 2023 and 2024. The mining royalty is calculated based on the value generated after the quantity of mineral raw material extracted under the official permit. The applicable rate is:
  * 48% for crude oil and natural gas extracted from hydrocarbon fields put into production before 1 January 2008 (with the exceptions included in the Government Decree).
  * 42% for natural gas sold at market price and extracted from hydrocarbon fields put into operation before 1 January 1998 (with the exceptions provided for in the Decree on extra-profit taxes).
  * 36% for crude oil and natural gas extracted during the test phase of production from hydrocarbon fields put into operation after 1 January 2008.


In the case of natural gas extracted from hydrocarbon fields put into operation before 1 January 1998 and sold for the supply of universal service providers, the calculation and the amount of the mining royalty remains unchanged. Moreover, the Government Decree includes further derogations from Act XLVIII of 1993 on Mining. We note that the amount of mining royalty paid in the tax year reduces the amount of energy suppliers’ income tax payable up to a maximum of HUF 1.5 billion (up to the amount thereof).
## Public health product tax
The first domestic distributor of certain products, as well as the acquirer of goods that are brought from abroad and used for the domestic manufacture of own products that will be sold in Hungary, are liable to pay a product tax.
The duty rates from 1 January 2025 are as follows:
  * Beverages (depending on sugar content and tariff number): HUF 8 or HUF 23 per litre* (HUF 105 or HUF 310 per litre* for syrups and concentrates).
  * Energy drink (depending on tariff number, methyl-xanthine, and taurine content): HUF 65 or HUF 390 per litre.
  * Cocoa powder with added sugar (depending on tariff number, sugar, and cocoa content): HUF 40 or HUF 110 per kilogramme*.
  * Other pre-packed product with added sugar (depending on tariff number, sugar, honey, and cocoa content): HUF 65 or HUF 210 per kilogramme*.
  * Salty snacks (depending on tariff number, ingredients, and salt and sugar content): HUF 65, HUF 90, or HUF 390 per kilogramme.
  * Seasonings (depending on tariff number and salt content): HUF 390 per kilogramme or litre.
  * Flavoured beer and alcoholic beverages (depending on tariff number and sugar or sweetener content): HUF 10 or HUF 33 per litre*.
  * Fruit jam (depending on tariff number and sugar content): HUF 260 or HUF 780 per kilogramme*.
  * Delicacies (depending on tariff number and sugar content): HUF 65 or HUF 210 per kilogramme*.
  * Pre-packaged sweet or savoury pasta (depending on tariff number and sugar or salt content): HUF 65 or HUF 210 per kilogramme*.


* Depending on sugar and sweetener content.
## Environmental protection product fee
From 2025, the environmental product fee obligation ceases for products that were subject to both the product fee regulation and the Extended Producer Responsibility system, and in the future only other oil products, other plastic products (plastic bags, artificial flowers, etc.) and other chemical products (soaps, detergents, cosmetics, etc.) will be subject to the product fee (based on customs tariff numbers applicable on 1 January 2024).
Accordingly, the product fee administrative obligation (i.e. the declaration and registration obligation) ceases for packaging/packaging materials (except for plastic bags), electrical and electronic equipment, tires, batteries, advertising carrier paper and office paper.
The following entities are liable to pay the product fee:
  * The first domestic distributor or user for own purposes.
  * In the case of domestically manufactured other crude oil products, the first buyer from the first domestic distributor or user for own purposes.
  * In the case of toll manufacturing, the party that orders the toll manufacturing.
  * The obligor entering the taxable products into inventory.


Product fee rates from 1 January 2025 are as follows:
  * Other crude oil products: HUF 114 per kilogramme.
  * Other plastic products: HUF 387 to HUF 1,787 per kilogramme.
  * Other chemical products: HUF 11 to HUF 57 per kilogramme.


The Tax Body of the National Tax and Customs Administration controls the payment and reporting of the product fee and carries out product fee inspections. The product fee is self-assessed. The product fee returns must be submitted quarterly to the tax authority via its electronic system.
The product fee penalty is generally 100% of the product fee shortfall in cases of non-payment or underpayment.
## Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)
In the framework of EPR, as a general rule, the obliged entities must pay an EPR fee to finance the management of waste from ’circular economy products‘ they put on the market or use for their own purposes (‘collective fulfilment’).
EPR fee rates from 1 January 2025 are as follows:
  * Plastic packaging: HUF 219 per kilogramme.
  * Paper and cardboard packaging: HUF 173 per kilogramme.
  * Metal packaging: HUF 186 per kilogramme.
  * Other packaging: HUF 129 per kilogramme.
  * Wooden packaging: HUF 19 per kilogramme.
  * Textile packaging: HUF 67 per kilogramme.
  * Glass packaging: HUF 77 per kilogramme.
  * Composite packaging: HUF 168 per kilogramme.
  * Single-use and other plastic products: HUF 113 per kilogramme.
  * Temperature exchange equipment: HUF 116 per kilogramme.
  * Screens, monitors, and equipment containing screens with a surface area greater than 100 cm2: HUF 362 per kilogramme.
  * Lamps: HUF 306 per kilogramme.
  * Large equipment (any external dimension more than 50 cm): HUF 124 per kilogramme.
  * Photovoltaic panel (any external dimension more than 50 cm): HUF 63 per kilogramme.
  * Small computer and telecommunications equipment (no external dimension more than 50 cm): HUF 261 per kilogramme.
  * Portable battery, accumulator: HUF 160 per kilogramme.
  * Industrial battery, accumulator: HUF 239 per kilogramme.
  * Vehicle battery, accumulator: HUF 238 per kilogramme.
  * Vehicle: HUF 21 per kilogramme.
  * Tyre: HUF 137 per kilogramme.
  * Office paper: HUF 128 per kilogramme.
  * Paper-based advertisement: HUF 94 per kilogramme.
  * Frying oil and fat: HUF 36 per kilogramme.
  * Textile products: HUF 145 per kilogramme.
  * Wooden furniture: HUF 17 per kilogramme.


The relevant ’circular economy products‘ are listed by customs tariff number for the last six product groups, while in the case of packaging, electrical and electronic equipment, batteries and accumulators, and motor vehicles, the products defined in a separate government decree for the given product group will fall under the scope of EPR.
The obligation also extends to ’circular economy products‘ placed on the market or used for own purposes as accessories or components of other products.
### Transactions subject to the obligation
The obligation to pay the EPR fee is triggered by the following activities:
  * The first domestic sale and free transfer.


  * Sales from abroad to domestic households or other users via distance selling.
  * Removal from a VAT warehouse or product fee warehouse to the domestic territory.


  * Own use (including the final separation of packaging from the product brought into Hungary from abroad, if the packaging becomes waste).


Sales abroad are not subject to the EPR obligation.
Manufacturers established abroad who place a ’circular economy product‘ on the market by means of distance selling are required to fulfil their obligations through an authorised representative with a Hungarian tax number.
Besides the EPR fee payment, the responsible entities will have administrative obligations, such as registration, record-keeping, data submission, and invoice text requirement.
## Environmental load charges
Environmental pollution charges were introduced to protect the natural environment, to reduce its impairment, to encourage the users of the environment to engage in activities aimed at the preservation of the natural environment, and to provide funding from the central budget for environmental protection and nature preservation.
Emitting entities liable to pay charges include those who operate air point-source emitters that are subject to registration, pursue activities subject to a water right permit, or who do not use available public drainage systems and dispose of their sewage water under a water right permit or a permit from the local water management authorities.
Qualifying materials include sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, phosphorous, cyanides, and others.
The load charge is calculated on the basis of the quantity of emitted materials multiplied by the fee rate (and, in certain cases, by vulnerability and sludge disposal factors, taking into account average concentration). Basically, the amount of the fee payable depends on the hazard level of the emitted material (e.g. HUF 50 per kilogram for sulphur-dioxide).
## Food supply chain supervision fee
The purpose of the food supply chain supervision fee is to raise revenue for the operation of a regulatory body tasked with the official supervision of the food supply chain.
The supervision fee is payable by the following natural persons, legal persons, or unincorporated organisations:
  * Persons who place animals on the market that are kept for food production, breeding, or experimental purposes.
  * Persons who place food or fodder crops, seeds, plant products, and planting material on the market.
  * Registered or authorised food businesses.
  * Registered or authorised feed businesses.
  * Persons who manufacture or place on the market veterinary medicines or veterinary medicinal products.
  * Persons who manufacture or place on the market ‘EEC fertiliser’ or other products subject to authorisation.
  * Persons involved in the handling, use, further processing, and transport of animal by-products or placing derived products on the market.
  * Businesses engaged in the transport of live animals.
  * Persons operating facilities for the cleaning and disinfection of vehicles used for transport of live animals, isolation facilities for receiving animals from different stocks, livestock loading ramps, assembly centres, trading sites, feeding and watering stations, rest stations, and livestock fairs.
  * Persons manufacturing and storing plant propagation material.
  * Persons operating a registered or authorised laboratory.
  * Persons placing devices on the market that are used for marking animals.


As of 16 June 2017, any person who is not established in Hungary, but nevertheless engaged in the pursuit of the activities defined by the Food Chain Act, has a FELIR identifier, and is registered by the state tax authority as a taxpayer liable for payment of VAT, is liable to declare and pay the supervision fee.
As the main rule, the annual supervision fee is 0.1% of the total trading revenue (excluding excise duty and public health product tax) derived in the preceding year from these activities.
The taxpayers concerned have to comply with their reporting obligation by 31 May. The annual supervision fee is payable in two equal instalments: the first instalment by 31 July, and the second by 31 January.
## Telecommunication tax
The telecommunication tax applies to telecommunications service providers. The telecommunication tax rate for private individuals is HUF 2 per minute for calls made and HUF 2 per message sent, and for parties other than private individuals is HUF 3 per minute for calls made and HUF 3 per message sent. The monthly cap for calls and sent messages together is HUF 700 per phone number for private individuals and HUF 5,000 per phone number for parties other than private individuals.
**According to the legislation, telecommunication service provider is a natural person, legal entity, or other organisation entitled to provide publicly available telephone services in Hungary (including services enabling sending messages) provided through an electronic telecommunication network.**
## Tax on financial transactions
Payment service providers, credit institutions entitled to provide foreign currency services, special services intermediaries entitled to provide intermediated foreign currency services, and financial institutions that engage in the granting and negotiation of credit and cash loans but do not qualify as payment service providers with a registered seat or branch office in Hungary are subject to tax on financial transactions.
The financial transaction tax applies to the following payment services:
  * Bank transfers.
  * Direct debits.
  * Postal cash payments.
  * Cash payments from payment accounts (including cash withdrawals using a credit card).
  * Cash transfers.
  * Bank card payments.
  * Letters of credit.
  * Cashing cheques.
  * Foreign currency exchanges.
  * Debt repayments.
  * Commissions and banking fees.
  * Other transactions in which the amount of the transaction is deducted from the payment account credit balance.


If certain conditions are fulfilled, no tax will be payable for transactions such as:
  * Technical transfers between accounts held at the same bank, provided that the owner is the same.
  * For investment services, transfers between the payment account and the client account, provided that certain conditions are met.
  * Payments from limited purpose accounts.
  * Cash pool related payment transactions within the same financial service provider.
  * Transactions between financial service providers (including, among others, financial institutions, investment companies, etc.).
  * Payment transactions from social security and family allowance administrative accounts.
  * Unapproved (or approved but incorrectly made) payment transactions and their corrections.


In general, the tax base is the amount of the transaction (debit amount, amount paid, amount of currency sold, etc.). In the case of private individuals, the tax base is the amount of the transaction exceeding HUF50,000. In most cases, the tax rate is 0.45% of the transaction but the amount payable may not be more than HUF 20,000per transaction. This cap is not applicable to transactions in which the duty is payable by Magyar Posta Zrt, or in case of cash withdrawal. In the case of (card) payment transactions initiated by the payer through the payee, a flat-rate tax of HUF 800 per year is payable. Also, if such payment includes transactions executed with the use of a contactless payment feature, the duty payable is reduced to HUF 500 per year.
Investment firms, as well as credit institutions, will become taxable after the purchase of a financial instrument specified in Act CXXXVIII of 2007 on Investment Firms and Commodity Dealers, and on the Regulations Governing their Activities (“Bszt.”) Section 6 a) –c) with an ISIN code issued by KELER Central Depository Private Limited Liability Company for the benefit of a client account or own account. The tax base is the value of the financial instrument that is the subject of the transaction and has been credited to the customer's account, and the tax rate is the 0.45% of the tax base (maximum of HUF 20,000 per transaction). The tax liability arises upon the financial completion of the transaction, and taxpayers are required to declare and pay the tax by the 20th day of the month following the relevant month. The purchase of a financial instrument is exempt from tax if the investment service is provided by the Hungarian State Treasury or the institution operating the Postal Clearing Center or executed on behalf of a private individual (if not acting as a private entrepreneur) not exceeding HUF 20,000 per transaction.
Persons performing money transmission service, credit and loan operation, currency exchange activity, and currency exchange intermediation services in Hungary as cross-border services will also be required to pay a financial transaction fee. If these persons become taxable persons by 1 July 2022, they must request their registration as taxpayers with the Hungarian Tax and Customs Authority by 1 September 2022. If the foreign person becomes a taxpayer after 1 July 2022, the application for registration will have to be submitted by the first day of the month following the month in which the foreign person became a taxpayer.
## Special tax of financial institutions
In Hungary, there is a special tax levied of financial institutions. The tax base of credit institutions is the amended balance sheet total figure calculated from the financial statements of the second tax year preceding the current tax year. However, in the case of other financial institutions, the tax base comprises the interest income and income from fees, charges, and commissions. From 2019, the tax rate is decreased from 0.21% to 0.2% of the tax base exceeding HUF 50 billion in case of the credit institutions. Below HUF 50 billion, the tax rate is 0.15%. The applicable tax rate for financial enterprises is 6.5%.
With effect from 2022, venture capital fund managers and stock exchanges are exempted from the special tax liability of financial institutions.
According to the regulation on the extra-profit tax, credit institutions and financial enterprises are required to pay surtax in 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025 based on their net sales revenue specified in Act C of 1990 - on Local Taxes ('Act on Local Taxes'). The tax base should be determined in different ways depending on the tax year.
In 2022, the tax base of this tax liability was based on the net sales revenue of the preceding tax year of the tax year in question, meaning that the 2022 tax base was the 2021 net sales revenue.
When determining the tax liability for the year 2023, a separate tax base must have been created for the period from 1 January 2023 to 30 June 2023 and a separate tax base for the period from 1 July 2023 to 31 December 2023:
  * For the period from 1 January 2023 to 30 June 2023, the taxable amount is the net sales revenue determined on the basis of the annual accounts for the tax year preceding the tax year (i.e. 2022), as defined in 'Act on Local Taxes', of which 50% must be taken into account.
  * For the period from 1 July 2023 to 31 December 2023, the taxable portion of the tax base must be determined on the basis of the pre-tax profit of the tax year preceding the tax year (i.e. the tax year 2022) instead of the net sales revenue.


For the tax year 2024, the tax base must be determined on the basis of the pre-tax profit of the tax year 2022. Similarly, for the tax year 2025, the tax base must be determined on the basis of the pre-tax profit of the tax year 2023.
The tax rate is 10%; however, the tax rate is also calculated differently for the two parts of the tax base. The tax rate for the part of the tax base determined for the first half of 2023 is 8%, while for the part of the tax base determined for the second half of 2023, a bracketed tax liability is introduced, which means that:
  * the tax rate for the part of the tax base not exceeding HUF 10 billion is 13%, and
  * the tax rate for the amount above this limit is 30%.


Similar to the second half of 2023, the tax rate in 2024 is:
  * the tax rate for the part of the tax base not exceeding HUF 20 billion is 13%, and
  * the tax rate for the amount above this limit is 30%.


The tax rates for 2025 are as follows:
  * the tax rate for the part of the tax base not exceeding HUF 20 billion is 7%, and
  * the tax rate for the amount above this limit is 18%.


These regulations shall be applied by credit institutions and financial enterprises first for the tax year beginning after 31 December 2021 that includes 1 July 2022. In 2022, the surtax shall be declared by 10 October 2022. In 2023, the surtax shall be declared by 10 June 2023. The tax is payable in two equal instalments in 2022 and three equal instalments in 2023 (10 October 2022, 10 December 2022, 10 June 2023, 10 October 2023, and 10 December 2023). In 2024 and in 2025, the surtax shall be declared by 10 June and shall be paid in two equal instalments (10 June 2024, 10 December 2024, 10 June 2025, 10 December 2025). The accounting treatment of this tax liability could cause difficulties for taxpayers, especially for those who prepare their financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The reason for this is that the tax base, the net sales revenue specified in the Act on Local Taxes, allows the deduction of several cost items, such as the interest liability, in addition to certain revenues. In case the taxpayers deem this new surtax as income tax, in lack of other provisions, the amount of tax liability will not be deductible from the CIT base, unlike the LBT and the innovation contribution.
The detailed rules regarding the special tax of financial institutions were published on 8 December 2022 in the Hungarian Official Gazette. According to the rules, the special tax of financial institutions does not have to be paid in the following two cases:
  * When one provided its services as a cross-border service from its registered office in Hungary in the two tax years preceding the tax year.
  * When at least two-thirds of one's annual net fee and commission income and net interest income in the second tax year preceding the tax year comes from foreign currency clients.


## Insurance premium tax
Insurance premium tax is applicable on (i) voluntary vehicle liability insurance policies (CASCO), (ii) property and casualty insurance policies, and (iii) the mandatory vehicle liability insurance (former accident tax) in Hungary.
The insurance tax should be paid by the insurance companies after the gross insurance premium received on insurance policies insuring risks located in Hungary. Insurance companies subject to tax include:
  * insurance companies headquartered in Hungary
  * foreign insurance companies’ Hungarian branches, or
  * insurance companies providing cross-border insurance services if these entities, which are headquartered abroad, render taxable insurance services in Hungary.


The above-mentioned entities should apply three different tax rates. For voluntary vehicle liability insurance policies, the tax rate is 15%; for property and casualty insurance, the tax rate is 10%; and for the mandatory vehicle liability insurance, the tax rate is 23% (capped at HUF 83/day/vehicle).
In the case of the tax base deriving from insurances mentioned in points (i) and (ii), lower tax brackets may apply if the taxpayer’s tax base is less than HUF 8 billion.
We note that this tax should not be paid after life and health insurance.
According to the regulation on the extra-profit tax, insurance companies are required to pay additional insurance surtax between 1 July 2022 and 31 December 2024. The tax base of the surtax is the insurance fee of the various insurance services performed. The tax rates are as follows over the next year and a half in respect of the insurance services specified in Act CII of 2012 on Insurance Tax ('Act on IT') and in Annex 2 of Act LXXXVIII of 2014 on the Business of Insurance ('Act on BoI'):
2022  
---  
Tax base (HUF) | Tax rate (%)  
Activity based on Act on IT | Activity based on Act on BoI  
Up to 1 billion | 4 | 2  
Between 1 billion and 18 billion | 8 | 3  
Over 18 billion | 14 | 6  
2023-2024  
---  
Tax base (HUF) | Tax rate (%)  
Activity based on Act on IT | Activity based on Act on BoI  
Up to 2 billion | 2 | 1  
Between 2 billion and 36 billion | 4 | 1.5  
Over 36 billion | 12 | 5  
2025  
---  
Tax base (HUF) | Tax rate (%)  
Activity based on Act on IT | Activity based on Act on BoI  
Up to 48 billion | 3 | 2  
Over 48 billion | 14 | 6  
With the introduction of the new type of surtax, tax advance rules also apply to insurance companies, in connection with which insurance companies are required to file a tax advance statement by 30 November 2022, 31 May 2023, 31 May 2024, 15 November 2024 and 10 December 2025. The effective surtax must be declared and paid by 31 January 2023, 31 January 2024, 31 July 2024, 31 January 2025, 31 July 2025, 31 January 2026 and 31 July 2026. Taxpayers that become affiliates due to a spin-off or demerger after 1 July 2022 shall jointly determine their tax base, and then their tax liability shall be distributed among the individual taxpayers in proportion to their tax bases.
