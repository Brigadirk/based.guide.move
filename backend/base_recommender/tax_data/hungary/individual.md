## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
## Foreign tax relief
If a DTT does not apply, Hungarian residents are also taxed on foreign-source employment income, but credit is given for foreign taxes paid. The credit may neither exceed 90% of the foreign tax paid abroad nor the Hungarian PIT calculated with the Hungarian tax rate on the foreign income.
Individuals have to make quarterly tax advance payments calculated on the gross income they receive from abroad if they become subject to taxation in Hungary (e.g. they perform their activities in Hungary). 
In the case of income from investments or the sale of property, if the income is foreign sourced, the foreign tax may be fully deducted from the Hungarian tax burden; however, at least 5% Hungarian tax needs to be paid in the absence of a DTT. Where DTTs apply, they usually provide an exemption, rather than credit, for foreign taxes. In the cases of dividend, the DTTs usually apply the credit method.

Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
We would like to highlight that, from 1 January 2024, the double tax treaty (DTT) concluded between the United States (US) and Hungary has been terminated. In this regard, US-sourced incomes of Hungarian tax resident individuals and the Hungarian-sourced incomes of US tax nationals might be subject to double taxation depending on the circumstances and nature of incomes.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
Hungarian personal income tax (PIT) is assessed on the following.
  * Domestic-source income.
  * Foreign-source income, provided to an individual resident in Hungary.


Income derived from employment activity performed in Hungary can qualify as domestic-source income, even if it is paid from abroad. In the case of income paid from abroad, income tax can be due whether or not the income has been transferred (e.g. electronically, by bank-to-bank transfer) or brought into the country in cash.
## Personal income tax (PIT) rate
The PIT rate is 15% in the case of nearly all types of income.
There are three distinct ways how the tax base is calculated. The first one is the consolidated tax base. The consolidated tax base consists of
  * employment income
  * income from independent activity including rental income (90% of the gross income or the gross income reduced by the deductible costs),
  * other income.


In the case of the consolidated tax base, the tax allowances are deductible. The following tax allowances are available:
  * Family Tax Allowance after dependent children,
  * Allowance for Young Couples in First Marriage,
  * Allowance Granted to Mothers Raising Four or More Children,
  * Personal Allowances with a severe disability,
  * Allowance for Young People Under the Age of 25 Years,
  * Allowance for Mothers Under the Age of 30.


The second option of the tax base calculation is applicable in the case of fringe benefits and other specific benefits. In the case of most fringe benefits, the income is subject to personal income tax and social tax that is payable by the employer. The most common, beneficially taxable fringe benefit is the SZÉP Card, a special restaurant and hotel voucher.
All other forms of income elements are taxable separately. Such income elements include income from dividend, interest, controlled capital market transactions, capital gains, sale of movable and immovable property etc.
The income realised from long-term savings accounts is subject to taxation when the account is terminated. The personal income tax rate is 15% if the savings account is terminated in the first three years after the conclusion of the contract and 10% in the next two years. No personal income tax needs to be paid on the realised profit after five years.


# Hungary
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
## Taxable period
In Hungary the tax year is the calendar year. Generally, income is taxed in the year in which the payment or non-cash benefit is actually received.
## Tax returns
Returns must be filed for each tax year by 20 May of the following year. 
All individuals must file separate returns (i.e. husbands and wives cannot file joint returns).
Hungary operates a system of self-assessment of tax. Consequently, individuals can prepare and file their tax returns themselves or review the draft tax returns prepared by the Hungarian tax authority and amend it if necessary.
The Hungarian tax authority prepares draft tax returns based on the date available for them. We note that these draft tax returns may not necessarily include all income that the persons concerned are required to declare. This is because the draft tax returns will be based on data (e.g. on wages paid by a Hungarian-based employer) that is reported to the tax authority during the year. However, not all items of income are subject to interim reporting. Consequently, the draft tax returns should be carefully reviewed and corrected or supplemented if necessary.
Please note that as of 1 January 2024, in case of fringe benefits and other specific benefits, these incomes are reportable by the payers on a quarterly basis until the 12th day of the month following the quarter instead of a monthly basis.
## Payment of tax
Under the general rules, income tax is withheld from salaries and most investment income received from Hungarian payers. For income from non-Hungarian sources, individuals must pay income tax themselves. Taxpayers with income that is not subject to withholding must generally make quarterly tax advance payments (for employment income). Payers are required to report total payments, including benefits and expenses paid or reimbursed (employment income), to the tax authority.
The taxable income and the tax liabilities should be determined and declared in Hungarian forints. There are specific rules to determine the Hungarian forint exchange rate against other currencies.
### Penalties
Late payment penalty is charged on overdue payments if the tax payments are made after the deadline. The amount of the late payment for each calendar day is the 365th of the base rate of the National Bank of Hungary valid on the day of the arrears increased by five percentage points. The late payment penalty is calculated by the Hungarian tax authority on a daily basis.
The tax authority may also levy a tax penalty on taxpayers who claimed any subsidies or tax refunds without eligibility. Penalties in these cases are levied based on the amounts claimed without eligibility.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations for tax returns (i.e. the period during which they can be audited by the tax authority) is five years, starting on 31 December of the year when the return has to be filed (i.e. the period for 2018 Hungarian tax returns, due by 20 May 2019, expires on 31 December 2024).


# Hungary
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
Please note that from 1 January 2025, certain personal tax allowances - the family allowance, the discount for first-time married couples, and the discount for people under 25 will only be available to Hungarian, EEA state, Ukrainian and Serbian citizens in the future. For example, Turkish or Chinese citizens living in Hungary will not be eligible for these discounts / allowances.
## Personal allowances
### PIT allowance for families
In 2025, the amounts of family tax allowance are as follows:
  * HUF 66,670 if there is one dependent child
  * HUF 133,330 if there are two dependent children, or
  * HUF 220,000 if there are three or more dependent children, per month for each child.


The allowance is deductible from the taxpayer's tax base. 15% of the unused amount of the child tax base allowance is to be deducted from the social security contributions (18.5%). As of 1 January 2020, all mothers who are currently raising at least four children, or who have raised four or more children during their lifetime, will be completely exempt from paying the PIT in case of certain types of income specified by law (especially in case of the wage income).
Persons entitled to the child benefit are entitled to apply this allowance regardless of whether they actually receive child benefit payments from the state budget.
The family allowance for families raising chronically ill or severely disabled children is higher. In addition to the existing family tax allowance, an extra allowance of HUF 66,670 per month can be applied for dependants who qualify as chronically ill or severely disabled person. This practically means an additional HUF 10,000 net allowance per dependant per month.
Please note that this allowance is currently expected to increase by 150% from 1 July 2025 and by 200% from 1 January 2026.
### PIT allowance for first-time married couples
Couples marrying after 31 December 2014 are able to decrease their tax bases by a total monthly amount of HUF 33,335, under certain circumstances. One requirement for this tax base allowance is that at least one member of the couple must marry for the first time. The allowance is available for a maximum period of 24 months. There is no age limit on eligibility for this allowance.
### PIT allowance for individuals under age 25
Individuals under age 25 can apply this allowance with respect to certain incomes, but only up to maximum the gross national average income published by the Hungarian Central Statistical Office for the July of the preceding year (HUF 636,700 for July 2024). It practically means that individuals under age 25 can apply the PIT-free allowance but only up to this maximum limit, which is net of HUF 95,505 / month in 2025.
### PIT allowance for mothers under age 30
Mothers under age 30, as of 1 January 2023, young women giving birth, older than age 25 but not older than age 30 when reaching the 91st day of pregnancy, giving birth, or adopting a child, may reduce their consolidated tax base with this allowance. The maximum amount of the tax relief is HUF 95,505 / month in 2025. However, it is important to know that the allowance is only eligible if the woman’s entitlement to the family tax allowance opened after 31 December 2022 in connection with her fetus, biological, or adopted child.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
The consolidated tax base is the taxable gross income received as income from dependent personal services, income from independent personal services, and all other income that is determined as 'other income' in the PIT Act, or for which the PIT Act contains no provision.
## Employment income
The gross income of employees includes all cash remuneration and most personal expenses paid by the employer (e.g. overseas allowances, insurance, pension, tax reimbursements, tax equalisation payments). Housing can still be provided tax-free by either the foreign or the Hungarian company if certain conditions are met.
In recent years, there were more possibilities for companies to provide benefits in kind to individuals with employer taxation; however, the taxation of these kind of benefits has been significantly changed. Most of the benefits that were subject to a zero or low tax rate lost their tax advantage and became taxable in the same way and at the same rate as wage income.
Currently, the Széchenyi Recreational Card (SZÉP Card as per its abbreviation in Hungarian), trade-union-supported recreation, and benefits provided by cooperatives to their members can be provided as ‘fringe benefits’, and only a limited group of benefits can be provided as ‘other specific benefits’ (e.g. private us of company phones, meals on business trips, gift of small value three times a year up to 10% of the minimal wage [HUF 29,080 in 2025]).
In addition to the above from 1 January 2025 housing allowance given to employees under the age of 35 can be considered as ‘fringe benefit’ as well up to maximum HUF 1,8 million annually. Please note that any amount granted in access over the before-mentioned maximum amount is taxable as ‘other specific benefits’.
In case of a ‘fringe benefit’, as per the main rules, the tax base is the fair market value of the benefit on which 15% PIT and 13% social tax are payable by the benefit provider.
In case of ‘other specific benefits’, the tax base is 1.18 times the fair market value of the provided benefit on which 15% PIT and 13% social tax are payable by the benefit provider.
Please note that as of 1 January 2024, in case of fringe benefits and other specific benefits, these income elements are reportable by the payers on a quarterly basis until the 12th day of the month following the quarter instead of a monthly basis.
However, there are still some benefits that could be provided tax free. For example, the kindergarten fees reimbursed by the employer and the non-redeemable tickets/season tickets (excluding vouchers) for cultural and sport events up to the limit of the minimum wage can be provided as tax-free benefits. The use of company cars, bicycles, and e-bikes may also be provided as a tax-free benefit.
A recent addition to these benefits is the tax-exempt gift of bottled wines or their consumption at business lunch, team building events for employees if the wine was purchased from a Hungarian vineyard directly.
In addition to the above, from 1 January 2025, the employer can provide tickets / seasonal passes to zoos and the usage of its own gym tax free to its employees.
### SZÉP card benefit 
According to the general rules, the benefits granted by the employers, up to the recreational amount determined in the PIT Act, are taxable as fringe benefit, whereas the part exceeding this amount is taxable as ‘other specific benefit’. The above-mentioned yearly recreational amount that can be given as a fringe benefit is HUF 450,000 plus 120,000 separated in a sub-account.
After the benefit (granted by the employer to SZÉP Card up to the above-defined recreational amount that can be treated as fringe benefit), 15% PIT and 13% social tax is payable. Please note that the benefit granted in excess of the above-mentioned recreational amount will continue to be taxable as ‘other specific benefit’. In this latter case, the tax base is 1.18 times the fair market value of the provided benefit on which 15% PIT and 13% social tax is payable.
As of 1 January 2023, the previous sub-accounts of the SZÉP Card were eliminated, and their balances were pooled into one sub-account that can be used freely for restaurant, hotel, or entertainment services and activities. However, from 1 January 2025 a new sub-account was created called “Active Hungarians”. The maximum amount that can be given for such purpose is HUF 120,000 on top of the original HUF 450,000 amount and can be used for sport activities.
Also from 1 January 2025, 50% of the SZÉP Card’s balance at 1 January 2025 and of the amount transferred to it in 2025 (maximum 50% of HUF 450,000 in total annually) can be used to pay for home renovation costs. The detailed rules of use of this benefit and the Active Hungarian sub-account are yet to be clarified in a not yet announced government decree.
### Cost reimbursement in connection with remote working
There are two main types of benefits that can be provided tax-free to remote workers:
  * Flat rate financial support for the remote working period:


      * The employer can provide remote workers with a cost reimbursement on a monthly basis in cash tax-free, but only up to the maximum of 10% of the monthly minimum wage. The amount of the minimum wage is HUF 290,800 in 2025. Consequently, the maximum cap of the benefit is HUF 29,080 per month in 2025.
      * HUF 29,080 is the upper limit of the monthly benefit. The actual amount that can be granted tax-free depends on the number of remote working days in the given month. The part of the maximum cap that can be paid tax-free is in proportion to the time of remote working in the given month (even one hour of work remotely per day makes that day a remote working day, so that day can be taken into account when calculating the actual amount of the reimbursement).


  * Alternative tax-free benefits granted by the Personal Income Tax Act in case of remote working (if the flat rate financial support is not used):
    * Reimbursement of the purchase price of the IT equipment that is necessary for remote working.
    * Reimbursement for the monthly Internet subscription fee. The full fee can be reimbursed tax-free regardless of how many working days were spent with remote working in the given month by the employee.
    * Reimbursement for real estate renting cost (if any), as well as heating and electricity costs, but only to the extent that it can be attributed to the remote working.


### Cost reimbursement of commuting to and from work
As of 28 January 2023, the tax-free amount of reimbursement for commuting to and from work has been doubled according to the 16/2023. (I.27.) Government Decree.
According to the applicable provisions of the regulation, in the case of daily commuting to and from work across city limits by car, the employee can receive up to HUF 30 per kilometre tax-free reimbursement from one's employer.
The employer is required to reimburse the cost of commuting to and from work by car up to 60% of HUF 30 per kilometre (i.e. HUF 18 per kilometre) if:
  * there is no public transport between the employee's place of residence and the place of work
  * due to the employee's work schedule, he or she cannot use public transport or only with a long wait
  * the employee is unable to use a public transport vehicle due to mobility limitations or severe disability in accordance with the government decree on the classification and review of severe disability and the rules for the payment of disability support, or


  * the employee has a child who is in nursery care or who studies in a public education institution under the age of 10.


However, it is important to note that the employer remains obliged to reimburse 86% of the cost of commuting by public (intercity, but not local) transport, and may reimburse 100% of such a cost tax-free.
As of 24 March 2023, the range of types of tickets and passes to be reimbursed by the employer in the framework of cost reimbursement of commuting to work was expanded. Thus, the employer reimburses at least 86% of the price of the intercity national pass, intercity county pass, as well as other passes with less territorial validity than the national pass, which are valid in a specific area, and are also suitable and necessary for daily commuting to and from work according to the 91/2023. (III. 23.) Government Decree. Under the new rules, electronically purchased tickets and passes do not have to be printed for the reimbursement process; their electronic version shall also be accepted by the employer.
## Equity compensation
Stock option plans are more and more common in Hungary, mostly at local affiliates of international companies who expand their global plans to Hungary.
Income from stock options must be classified based on the relationship between the provider of the income and the recipient, or based on their relation to any other parties. In general, since the recipients would have an employment relationship with the Hungarian affiliate, the income would be classified as employment income even if the options were provided by their foreign mother company. Taxation of stock options cannot be qualified as non-cash benefits.
Income from stock options is not recognised at the time when the option is granted to the employee, but first when the individual exercises an option (transferable options may be taxed differently). The tax rate applicable is 15%. The income realised may also be subject to social security contributions (18.5%) plus social tax (13%) or just social tax (13%) depending on the individual's social security positions, the provider, and the content of the plan.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are subject to a tax rate of 15%. If certain conditions are not met, an additional 13% social tax is also payable.
The income from capital gains should be reported in the annual tax return, and the taxes on capital gains income have to be paid when the annual tax returns are filed.
## Gains from crypto transactions
The income from crypto transactions includes the profit from capital gains or mining or any other transaction with crypto assets. 
The income has to be determined yearly, and the individual needs to deduct the yearly cost incurred from the yearly gross revenue. Thus, according to the rules, the income is not calculated by transactions but yearly based on the positive and negative cash flow. The tax rate is 15%, and there is no additional tax or social security charge. The income must be calculated by the individual on a yearly basis and must be paid by the deadline for the submission of the yearly tax return.
Tax equalisation is also available since 2022, meaning that if one declared an overall loss on their crypto transactions in the last two years of the subject tax year, that loss can offset the tax payment obligation on the profit realised in the subject year.
## Dividend income
Dividend income is taxable at 15% PIT. An additional 13% social tax is payable on dividend income if certain conditions are not met, but only up to a relatively low cap.
Dividend income should be reported in the annual tax return, and the taxes on foreign-sourced dividend income have to be paid when the annual tax returns are filed.
The tax on income from dividend income can be reduced by credit for foreign withholding taxes (WHTs) on dividends paid from double tax treaty (DTT) countries up to the rate stipulated in the treaty.
## Interest income
Interest income is also subject to tax at 15%.
In certain cases, the tax rate is 0% on interest received from investments that have been kept for at least five years, and 10% on investments that have been kept for three years on a 'long-term investment account'. The qualifying criteria are stipulated in the law.
As of 1 July 2023, a new rule has been introduced in connection with the taxation of interest income. According to the 205/2023. (V.31.) Government Decree, an additional 13% social tax will be payable on interest incomes derived from instruments purchased after 1 July 2023 and earned by private individuals. 
The affected interest incomes are the following:
  * Interest credited on bank deposits and payment accounts.
  * Interest on fixed-term deposits.


  * Interest on publicly traded corporate bonds and foreign government securities, discount treasury bills, and the profit realised on their sale or redemption.


  * The yield of the investment certificates of public investment funds (except for real estate funds) and the profit realised when they are sold or redeemed.


Interest income should be reported in the annual tax return, and the taxes on interest income have to be paid when the annual tax returns are filed.
The tax on income from interest income can be reduced by credit for foreign WHT on interest paid from DTT countries up to the rate stipulated in the treaty.
## Rental income
If a private individual who lets one's property does not qualify as a private entrepreneur, the rental income is taxable as part of the consolidated tax base. Private individuals are able to decrease the rental income they earn by the rental fees they pay for residential property in another municipality, provided that the rental period exceeds 90 calendar days and the costs of living are not reimbursed for them.
The fee charged by the lessor to the lessee for services provided by other persons in relation to the use of the property, purchased from such person (in particular public utility services) in proportion of use, shall not be treated as revenue.
Expenses supported by invoices can be deducted from the rental revenue, and, in this case, individuals can account depreciation against the rental income that they earn. Alternatively, a lump sum of 10% can be deducted.
## Special rules for certain types of equity income
Dividend, interest, or capital gains income from a 'company in a country with low tax rate', or interest income from a 'non-treaty country or non-European Economic Area (EEA), non-Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member state country', are mostly classified as 'other income' and thus part of the gross consolidated tax base. Other income is also subject to 13% social tax.

  * Hungarian national
  * European Economic Area (EEA) national with an EEA registration card issued in Hungary, and spends at least 183 days in Hungary in a calendar year, or
  * third-country national permanently settled in Hungary or a stateless person.


Even if the above criteria are not met, an individual is regarded as tax resident in Hungary if:

## Individual - Other taxes

## Social security contributions
The social security contribution base is the gross income paid to the employee. The employer's contribution rate (so-called 'social tax') is 13% in 2024. The employees' social security contribution rate is 18.5%. 15% of the unused amount of the child tax base allowance can be deducted from the total amount of 18.5% social security contribution obligation.
As of 1 January 2025, the amount of the minimum wage is 290,800 Hungarian forint [HUF] per month, and the guaranteed minimum wage for those employed in jobs requiring at least secondary level qualifications or vocational training is HUF 348,000. Employers (seated in Hungary) are liable for both social security payments and the electronic filing of monthly social security declarations. Non-Hungarian employers have similar obligations; however, if they fail to complete them, the employees will be responsible for these tasks.
As a general rule, dependent persons over 18 years of age are only eligible for healthcare services if they pay healthcare service contributions. Uninsured persons are liable for monthly contributions in the amount of HUF 11,800/month in 2025.
Interest income is subject to 13% social tax that is payable by the individual. The term interest income includes the capital gains of publicly traded bonds and investment fund units, furthermore the profit realised from insurance products.
Dividend income – with the exception of the dividend paid by companies the shares of which are traded on an EEA stock exchange – and certain other private income streams are also subject to 13% social tax. However, the base of this tax is capped at 24 times the minimum wage, and the cap is reduced by other income elements subject to social tax.
From 2025, income realised from long-term savings accounts are also subject to social tax. The tax rate is 13% if the savings account is terminated in the first three years after the conclusion of the contract and 8% in the next two years. No social tax needs to be paid after five years.
### Social tax allowances
Only one type of allowance can be applied on a given employee; however, it is the employer's decision which is the most beneficial based on the given circumstances.
With these allowances, the government intended to reduce the employment cost relating to the employees like jobseekers, jobseeker mothers with three or more young children, individuals with reduced ability to work, researchers, etc.
With employment of the above employees, the employer can apply social tax allowances. The eligibility periods of the allowances and their exact amounts depend on the employee.
### Social security contribution of foreign nationals
In order to determine whether a foreign national should become subject to Hungarian social security contributions, both the local and international rules should be carefully reviewed. One should count with Hungarian social charges typically when the foreign nationals:
  * are employed locally by a Hungarian employer in the territory of Hungary
  * work in Hungary as employees of a non-Hungarian employer and are nationals of a European Union (EU) member state or of a country that has a social security treaty with Hungary but cannot remain covered by the social security system of their home country, or
  * are third-country nationals assigned to Hungary from a non-EEA country and the length of their assignment exceeds two years.


## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is payable on sales of goods and the supply of services at the general rate of 27%. Reduced rates of 18% and 5% are applicable for some goods and services (_see the section in the Corporate tax summary for more information_).
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Hungary.
## Inheritance, estate transfer, and gift taxes
The general inheritance and gift tax rate is 18%, and a preferential 9% tax rate applies to residential property. The transfer of property without consideration between lineal relatives (including the spouse of the deceased) is tax exempt. There is a preferential tax rate for residential property in case of estate transfer tax as well. The estate transfer tax rate is 4% or 2%, depending on the value of real estate. In case the value of real estate is maximum HUF 1 billion, then the tax rate is 4%. In relation to the portion of the value that exceeds HUF 1 billion, the applicable rate is 2%. Nevertheless, the amount of the estate transfer tax cannot exceed HUF 200 million per property.
## Property and land taxes
Hungarian municipalities have the right to levy property tax and land tax at their own discretion until the relevant caps are reached (_see the section in the Corporate tax summary for more information_).
## Company car tax
The measure of the company car tax depends on the power in KW and the environmental classification of the company car.
Company car tax may also be payable if company car costs are borne by a Hungarian company or if individuals use their own cars for business purposes and are reimbursed for the costs.
The use of company cars for private purposes does not incur an additional PIT liability.
On 1 July 2022, the monthly rates of the company car tax increased by 81% to 87%. For example, a car with a Euro 5 engine and 150 hp of power is subject to HUF 20,000 car tax per month.
