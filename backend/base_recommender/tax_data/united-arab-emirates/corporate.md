## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 21 February 2025
**UAE Federal Corporate Tax**
The UAE Federal Corporate Tax (CT) was introduced in December 2022 and applies to taxpayers’ financial years starting on or after 1 June 2023.
UAE CT is applicable across all Emirates and applies to all business and commercial activities, subject to certain exceptions. Transfer pricing rules and documentation requirements are also introduced as part of the UAE CT regime. The Federal Tax Authority (FTA) is responsible for the administration, collection, and enforcement of CT.
**Pillar Two developments in the UAE**
On 9 December 2024, the UAE Ministry of Finance announced updates in relation to UAE CT Law. These include:
Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (DMTT)
Following the issuance of Federal Decree Law No. 60 of 2023, a Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (DMTT) is effective in the UAE for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2025. This strategic step reflects the UAE’s commitment to implementing the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) Two-Pillar Solution, aimed at establishing a fair and transparent tax system aligned with global standards.
The Pillar Two rules require large multinational enterprises (MNEs) to pay a minimum effective tax rate of 15% on profits in every country where they operate. The UAE DMTT will apply to multinational enterprises operating in the UAE with consolidated global revenues of EUR750 million or more in at least two out of the four financial years immediately preceding the financial year in which the DMTT applies. The UAE’s implementation of the DMTT will closely align with the OECD’s GloBE Model Rules.
Further, Cabinet Decision No. 142 of 31 December 2024 introduced the detailed legislation on the UAE DMTT including cases, provisions, conditions, rules, controls, and procedures. It is broadly aligned with the OECD’s Inclusive Framework (IF).
Tax Incentives to Support Growth and Innovation
The UAE continues to enhance its business-friendly environment, reflecting its commitment to national strategic objectives such as strengthening economic competitiveness and improving ease of doing business. To promote sustainable growth, innovation, and investment, the Ministry of Finance is currently considering the introduction of the following Corporate Tax Incentives under UAE CT Law.
To encourage Research and Development (R&D) activities, foster innovation and economic growth within the UAE, an R&D Tax Incentive is being considered. Based on feedback received during public consultations conducted in April 2024, the proposed incentive is expected to take effect for tax periods starting on or after 1 January 2026. The R&D tax incentive will be expenditure-based, offering a potential 30-50% tax credit and will be refundable depending on the revenue and number of employees of the business in the UAE. The scope of Qualifying R&D activities will be aligned to the OECD’s Frascati Manual guidelines and will be required to be conducted within the UAE.
Another incentive being considered is a refundable tax credit for high-value employment activities. This aims to encourage businesses to engage in activities that deliver significant economic benefits, stimulate innovation, and enhance the UAE’s global competitiveness. This incentive is proposed to take effect from 1 January 2025 and will be granted as a percentage of eligible salary costs for employees engaged in high-value employment activities. This includes C-suite executives and other senior personnel performing core business functions that add substantial value to the UAE economy.
The final form and implementation of the above mentioned proposed incentives are subject to legislative approvals.
**Sharjah Emirate Law on Taxation of Extractive and Non-Extractive Activities**
In February 2025, the Emirate of Sharjah announced its law with 20% Emirate level corporate tax on companies engaged in extractive and non-extractive natural resource activities. The Law is not yet available in the public domain.
Under the law, companies subject to its provisions, if they are liable under applicable federal legislation for any type of direct tax (e.g. UAE Federal Corporate Tax), are granted a deduction from the Sharjah tax due under this law equal to any direct federal tax that is proven to have been paid to the state by the company. 
It is yet to be seen how Free Zone entities, taxed under the Federal Corporate Tax Law at 0% as Qualifying Free Zone Persons, will be taxed under this Sharjah tax law.
**Family Foundation**
A UAE based family foundation structure, with an elected tax transparent status, generally prevents the income of the foundation or trust from attracting UAE CT and is a useful vehicle for families to ensure a tax efficient holding structure, proper governance, as well as succession planning.
The Ministerial Decision #261 of 2024 extends the option for a tax transparent status to any underlying legal entity wholly owned and controlled, directly or indirectly, by a family foundation. Whereas a family foundation previously had to hold the assets directly in order for any income they generate to benefit from the structure’s tax transparent status, this amendment allows family foundations to hold assets via a legal entity such as a company without compromising the overall tax efficiency of the structure.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 21 February 2025
The FTA is responsible for the administration, collection, and enforcement of UAE CT, while the MoF will remain the ‘competent authority’ in terms of international tax agreements and the exchange of information for tax purposes.
## Taxable period
A taxable person’s tax period is the financial year (the Gregorian calendar year or the 12-month period for which financial statements are prepared) or part thereof for which a UAE CT return is required to be filed.
A taxable person can make an application to the FTA to change the start and end date of its tax period, or use a different tax period, subject to the following conditions:
  * The change is for liquidation purposes.
  * The change is for aligning the taxable person’s financial year either for tax grouping, financial reporting, or domestic and foreign tax relief purposes.
  * There is valid commercial, economic, or legal reason to change the tax period.
  * The UAE resident person has not yet filed the tax return with the FTA for which they are requesting a change in tax period.
  * The application is made no later than 6 months after the end of the original tax period (i.e. 3 months before the original tax return is due).


It is important to note that a taxable UAE resident person may only change the relevant tax period by means of either extending the current tax period to be a maximum of 18 months or shortening the following tax period to be a minimum of 6 months and a maximum 12 months.
## CT registration, returns, and payments
Every taxable person is required to electronically register for UAE CT with the FTA within a prescribed timeline and obtain a Tax Registration Number (CT TRN), which is different from VAT TRN.
In order to keep the administrative burden on taxpayers to a minimum, the CT Law requires a taxable person to file only one tax return for each tax period.
The filing is done electronically no later than 9 months from the end of the relevant tax period. Any UAE CT payable will also need to be settled within this timeline.
### Tax assessment
A taxable person may be subject to a UAE CT assessment in accordance with the Tax Procedures Law. In case a non-compliance to the CT Law is identified during the assessment, penalties and fines determined per the Tax Procedures Law could be imposed. 
### Financial statements
Taxable persons shall prepare financial statements by applying International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Such financial statements shall be audited (by a UAE licensed auditor) if the taxable person earns revenue exceeding the threshold of AED 50 million during a relevant tax period or if the taxable person is regarded as a QFZP.
In case the revenue does not exceed AED 3 million or through an application in exceptional circumstances to the FTA, the financial statements may be prepared on a cash basis (as opposed to accrual).
### Record keeping
Notwithstanding the provisions of the Tax Procedures Law, a taxable person shall maintain, for UAE CT Law purposes, all records and documents for a period of 7 years following the end of the tax period to which they relate.
### Clarifications and rulings
A person can make an application to the FTA for a Private Clarification regarding any part of the UAE CT Law or for concluding an APA for a transaction or arrangement.
## General anti-abuse rule (GAAR)
In line with international best practice, the UAE CT Law includes a GAAR, which applies to transactions giving rise to a tax advantage where no valid commercial reason exists and where the tax advantage was the main or one of the main purposes of the transaction.
Where the GAAR applies, the FTA can make a determination that one or more specified CT advantages are to be counteracted or adjusted. If such a determination is made, the FTA must issue an assessment giving effect to the determination and can make compensating adjustments to the UAE CT liability of any other person affected by the determination.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 21 February 2025
## UAE tax residency
For the purposes of UAE CT Law, a taxable person shall be either a resident person or a non-resident person.
Juridical persons that are incorporated or otherwise formed or recognised under the laws of the UAE (both in mainland and Free Zones) are considered UAE resident persons.
Foreign juridical persons may also be treated as resident persons for UAE CT purposes where they are effectively managed and controlled (POEM) in the UAE.
Natural persons who conduct business or business activity in the UAE are also viewed as taxable resident persons for UAE CT purposes.
A non-resident person is a person who is not considered a resident person as above and that either:
  * has a permanent establishment (PE) in the UAE,
  * derives state-sourced income (SSI), or 
  * has nexus in the UAE by way of earning income from immovable property in the UAE.


## Permanent establishment (PE)
The definition of a PE is aligned with the definition in the OECD Model Tax Convention. 
A non-resident person would generally be considered to have a PE in the UAE where:
  * it has a fixed or permanent place in the UAE through which the business of the non-resident person, or any part thereof, is conducted,
  * where a person has and habitually exercises an authority to conduct a business or business activity in the UAE on behalf of the non-resident person (this means either the person habitually concludes contracts in the name of the non-resident person or the person habitually negotiates contracts that are concluded by the non-resident person without the need for material modification by the non-resident person), or
  * the non-resident person has any other form of nexus in the UAE as might be specified through a Cabinet Decision.


A fixed or permanent place in the UAE should not be considered a PE if it is used solely for conducting activities of a preparatory or auxiliary nature.
The mere presence of a natural person in the UAE should not create a PE for a non-resident person in the following instances:
  * Such a presence is a consequence of a temporary and exceptional situation,
  * The natural person is employed by the non-resident person and its activities in the UAE are not part of the core income-generating activities of the non-resident person or its related parties.


The UAE CT Law further provides an Investment Manager Exemption, which allows a UAE based investment manager (i.e. a person who provides brokerage or investment management services subject to regulatory oversight in the UAE) to be considered an independent agent when acting on behalf of a non-resident person and thus not create a PE in the UAE for a foreign investor. This is applicable to investment managers who deal in transactions involving, amongst others, commodities, real property, bonds, shares, derivative, securities, or foreign currency.


# United Arab Emirates
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 21 February 2025
Expenditure that is not of a capital nature and is incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the taxable person’s business should generally be tax deductible.
The UAE CT Law disallows / restricts the deduction of certain expenses. This is to ensure that relief can only be obtained for expenses incurred for the purpose of generating taxable income and to address possible situations of abuse or excessive deductions.
Where expenditure is incurred for more than one purpose, a deduction will be allowed for any identifiable part or proportion of the expenses incurred wholly and exclusively for deriving taxable income. Also, an appropriate proportion of any unidentifiable part or proportion of the expenses incurred for the purposes of deriving taxable income that has been determined on a fair and reasonable basis can be claimed for deduction for UAE CT purposes.
## Depreciation and amortisation
The tax depreciation/ amortisation follows the IFRS depreciation/ amortisation, except for capitalised interest which needs to be separately assessed based on interest deduction rules. 
## Interest expenses
There are general interest deduction limitation rules (GIDLR) and special interest deduction limitation rules (SIDLR).
Under the GIDLR, the net interest expense (NIE) (i.e. interest expense less interest income) up to 30% of tax adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) will be deductible. However, this should not apply if the NIE for the relevant tax period does not exceed the threshold of AED 12 million. If this threshold is exceeded, the taxable person may deduct the higher of the threshold or 30% of tax adjusted EBITDA.
The following would be considered as interest:
  * Amounts incurred in connection with raising finance (including guarantee fees, arrangement fees, commitment fees, and any other fees similar in nature).
  * Interest on Islamic financial instruments that is compliant with the Sharia principles or any equivalent instruments or the combination of both,
  * Interest component on forward contracts, futures contracts, options, interest rate and foreign exchange swap agreements, or any other financial derivative instruments.
  * The finance element of finance and non-finance lease payments.
  * Foreign exchange gains.


EBITDA is mainly the taxable income adjusted for the following items:
  * NIE for the relevant tax period (excluding any in relation to qualifying infrastructure projects).
  * Depreciation and amortisation expenditure taken into account in determining the taxable income for the relevant tax period.
  * Any interest income or expenditure relating to historical financial assets or liabilities held prior to 9 December 2022.


If the EBITDA arrived at after the above calculation is negative, the amount of EBITDA to be considered for determining the 30% limit will be AED 0.
The NIE attributed to debt instruments, the terms of which were agreed prior to 9 December 2022, is exempt from the GIDLR. Also, NIE incurred by a qualifying infrastructure project person will not be subject to the GIDLR.
Interest limitation rules do not apply to banks, insurance businesses, and certain other regulated financial service entities. Also, interest limitation rules will not apply to business carried on by natural persons / individuals or any other person that may be determined by a Cabinet Decision.
The NIE amount disallowed for deduction under the interest limitation rules could be carried forward and deducted in the subsequent ten tax periods.
Under the SIDLR, no deduction shall be allowed for gross interest expenditure incurred on a loan obtained, directly or indirectly, from a related party for specific purposes:
  1. A dividend or profit distribution to a related party.
  2. A redemption, repurchase, reduction or return of share capital to a related party.
  3. A capital contribution to a related party.
  4. The acquisition of an ownership interest in a person who is or becomes a related party following the acquisition.


However, this SIDLR is not applicable where the related party lender is subject to CT or a tax of a similar character under the applicable legislation of a foreign jurisdiction on the interest at a rate not less than 9%. 
## Charitable contributions
Donations paid to entities that are non-qualifying public benefit entities will not be considered as deductible for UAE CT purposes.
## Entertainment expenses
Expenses associated with entertainment of customers, shareholders, suppliers, and other business partners, such as meals, accommodation, transportation, admission fees, facilities, and equipment used for entertainment and other expenses specified by a Cabinet Decision, can be deducted up to 50% of the amount incurred.
## Other non-deductible expenses
Dividends / profit distribution and other expenses specified in a Cabinet Decision will not be considered as deductible for UAE CT purposes.
## Net operating losses
The CT Law provides that a business can offset tax losses against the taxable income of subsequent tax periods when computing the taxable income for that period. The set-off during any tax period cannot exceed 75% of the taxable income for the tax period (except in circumstances that may be prescribed in a Cabinet Decision). Any tax loss remainder can be carried forward to a further subsequent tax period indefinitely.
A taxable person cannot claim tax loss relief for losses incurred before the date of commencement of the UAE CT regime, losses incurred before it became a taxable person under the CT Law, and losses incurred from an asset or activity the income of which is exempt or otherwise not taken into account under the CT Law.
UAE CT allows transfer of tax losses between juridical tax resident group entities where there is 75% or more common ownership and where other certain conditions are met, such as having the same financial year and using the same accounting standards and not being an exempt person or QFZP. 
In order to curb transfer of tax losses through transfer of ownership in case of taxable persons that are not listed on a recognised stock exchange, the CT Law provides that the tax losses can only be carried forward and utilised by a taxable person on satisfaction of the following conditions:
  * The same person or persons continuously owned at least a 50% ownership interest in the taxable person from the beginning of the tax period in which the tax loss is incurred to the end of the tax period in which the tax loss or part thereof is offset against taxable income of that period.
  * The taxable person continued to conduct the same or a similar business following a change in ownership of more than 50%.




# United Arab Emirates
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 21 February 2025
UAE group entities may elect to form a tax group provided all the following conditions are met:
  * The parent company, which must be UAE tax resident person (including a foreign legal entity with UAE POEM), directly or indirectly holds at least 95% of the (i) share capital, (ii) voting rights, and (iii) entitlement to profits and net assets.
  * They have the same financial year and prepare the financial statements using the same accounting standards.
  * Neither the parent company nor the subsidiary is an exempt person or a QFZP.


When a tax group is formed, the parent entity will be responsible for the administration, such as submission of one tax return and settlement of the tax liability for the tax group. 
Note that CT Group composition may be different from VAT Group composition for the same group structure as the grouping rules are different. 
## Transfer pricing
The CT Law introduces transfer pricing rules and regulations. The transfer pricing regulations take immediate effect coinciding with the effective date of the corporate tax provisions. 
### Arm’s-length principle
Both cross-border and domestic transactions and arrangements between related parties (including transactions undertaken by Free Zone entities) need to adhere to the arm’s-length standard (i.e. transactions must be undertaken as if they are carried out between independent parties under similar circumstances). 
Furthermore, payments and benefits provided to connected persons should be at market value, which should be determined by applying the arm’s-length standard.
### Transfer pricing methods and their application
In order to determine the arm’s-length nature of the transactions between related parties, the CT Law prescribes five methods, broadly aligned with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. In case the taxable person can demonstrate that none of the prescribed methods can be reasonably applied, the taxpayer is allowed to apply any other method. In alignment with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, appropriate factors must be considered when applying the most appropriate method, namely (i) contractual terms, (ii) characteristics of the transaction, (iii) economic circumstances, (iv) functions, assets, and risks, and (v) business strategies.
### Related parties
The definition of related parties is summarised below:
  * Two or more natural persons related up to fourth degree of kinship.
  * A natural person and a juridical person related by ownership (50% or greater) or control.
  * Two or more juridical persons related by ownership (50% or greater) or control.
  * A person and its PE or foreign PE.
  * Partners in the same unincorporated partnership.
  * Trustee, founder, settlor, or beneficiary of a trust or foundation and its related parties.


In this regard, the term ‘control’ has now been defined as the ability of a person to influence another person, including the ability to:
  * exercise 50% or more voting rights,
  * determine composition of 50% or more of the Board of Directors,
  * receive 50% or more profits, or
  * exercise significant influence over the conduct/affairs of another person.


The CT Law does not provide a clarification on how ’significant influence‘ is interpreted, and it is yet to be seen whether additional guidance will be issued and whether or not reference will be made to the interpretation as per accounting standards.
### Connected persons
Any payment or benefit provided by a taxable person to a connected person should (i) correspond to the market value of the service or benefit and (ii) be incurred wholly and exclusively for business purposes in order for a deduction to be allowed. The market value should be determined by applying the arm’s-length standard. A specific exclusion on this limitation of deductibility applies in the event that the payment or benefit is provided by:
  * a taxable person whose shares are traded on a recognised stock exchange,
  * a taxable person subject to regulatory oversight of a competent state, authority, and
  * any other person to be determined under a separate decision, which is yet to be issued.


The definition of ’connected persons‘ is any of the below:
  * A natural person who directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest or controls the taxable person.
  * A director or officer of the taxable person.
  * Partners in the same unincorporated partnership.
  * Related party(ies) of any of the above.


### Transfer pricing adjustments
The taxable income may be adjusted by the FTA if the results of the transaction between related parties do not fall within the arm’s-length range.
In the event of an adjustment made by the FTA or a taxable person to the taxable income, the authority will make a corresponding adjustment to the taxable income of the related party that is party to the transaction. On the other hand, where an adjustment is made by a foreign competent authority, the taxable person can apply for corresponding adjustment relief. Further guidance is awaited on the exact mechanism of implementation (e.g. potentially through a Mutual Agreement Procedure or other mechanism).
### Advance Pricing Agreement (APA)
The CT Law provides a person the option to make an application for an APA (existing or proposed transactions). Detailed guidance in this regard will be prescribed by the FTA at a later date.
### Transfer pricing documentation
  1. **TP Disclosure Form:**
    1. Threshold 
      1. Related party transactions - Aggregate value (as per financials / market value) exceeds AED 40 million, only transactions where per category value exceeds AED 4 million need to be disclosed.
      2. Connected person transactions - Aggregate value exceeds AED 500,000, only transactions where per category value exceeds AED 500,000 need to be disclosed.
    2. Timeline: Alongside CT return (within 9 months from the end of the relevant tax period).
  2. **Master File and Local File:**
    1. Threshold: Taxable person meeting either of the following conditions:
      1. Constituent entity of a MNE group with a total consolidated group revenue of AED 3.15bn (approx. USD 850m) or more; or
      2. The Taxable Person's revenue in the relevant tax period is AED 200m (approx. USD 55m) or more.
    2. Timeline: Must be submitted within (30) thirty days following a request from the FTA.
  3. **Country-by-Country Report (“CbCR”)**
    1. Threshold: UAE headquartered MNE Group with consolidated revenues above AED 3.15bn.
    2. Timeline: Within 12 months from the end of the reporting year of the MNE Group.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 21 February 2025
Under UAE CT Law, a branch of a non-resident person could be regarded as a PE in the UAE and the income attributable to such branch could be subject to UAE CT.
The UAE does not have a branch profits distribution tax and repatriation of profits between branches and their head offices are not subject to withholding tax (WHT) or other forms of repatriation tax in the UAE.
Separately from the UAE CT, in certain Emirates, branches of foreign banks are taxed under special Bank Tax Decrees/Laws at 20% of their adjusted taxable income. There are certain mechanisms in place to deal with avoidance of double taxation under UAE CT and Emirate tax.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 21 February 2025
## Free Zone tax regime
Companies and branches registered in UAE Free Zones (which are more than 50 in the UAE now) are considered taxable persons under the UAE CT Law and are required to meet normal compliance obligations, including transfer pricing requirements.
However, provided a Free Zone entity meets the conditions to be considered a Qualifying Free Zone Person (QFZP), it should be eligible for a 0% UAE CT rate on its qualifying income. At the same time, the income of a QFZP that is not qualifying income will be taxed at 9% CT rate. 
In order to qualify for the 0% UAE CT rate, a QFZP must meet all of the following conditions:
  * Be a Free Zone person (i.e. a juridical person incorporated, established, or otherwise registered in a Free Zone, including branches).
  * Maintain adequate substance in a Free Zone.
  * Derive qualifying income.
  * Not have made an election to be subject to the standard UAE CT regime.
  * Comply with all transfer pricing rules and documentation requirements.
  * Its non-qualifying revenue does not exceed the _de minimis_ requirements.
  * Prepares audited IFRS financial statements.


Where a Free Zone person fails to meet any of the qualifying conditions set out in UAE CT Law and in the corresponding Decisions, it will be treated as a taxable person subject to 9% CT rate on its full income for the current year and next 4 years. Thereafter, it may retest its QFZP status in the 6th year.
There are comprehensive Ministerial Decision, Cabinet Decision and Guide that thoroughly regulate and explain the QFZP regime.
### Adequate substance
In order to meet the adequate substance test, the QFZP’s core income-generating activities (CIGAs) shall be undertaken in a Free Zone, and the QFZP must maintain adequate assets, adequate number of qualified employees, and incur an adequate amount of operating expenditures.
The QFZP may outsource its CIGAs to a related or third party in a Free Zone, and the QFZP must have adequate supervision of the outsourced activity. In the case of Qualifying Intellectual Property income of a QFZP, CIGAs can be outsourced to any person in the UAE, or any person outside the UAE that is not a related party.
### Qualifying income
Qualifying income includes the following:
  * Income derived from transactions with other Free Zone persons, except for income derived from ‘excluded activities’.
  * Income derived from transactions with non-Free Zone persons, but only in respect of ‘qualifying activities’ that are not ‘excluded activities’.
  * Income derived from the ownership or exploitation of qualifying intellectual property (IP).
  * Any other income, provided that the QFZP satisfies the _de minimis_ requirements.


### Excluded activities
Excluded activities include the following:
  * Transactions with natural persons (subject to certain exceptions under ‘qualifying activities’ related to shipping and aircraft plus fund, wealth, and investment management).
  * Regulated banking, finance, leasing, and insurance activities.
  * Ownership or exploitation of immovable property, except for transactions with Free Zone persons in relation to commercial property located in a Free Zone.


### Qualifying activities
Qualifying activities include the following:
  * Manufacturing or processing of goods or materials.
  * Trading of qualifying commodities.
  * Holding of shares and other securities for investment purposes.
  * Ownership, management, and operation of ships.
  * Regulated reinsurance, fund management, wealth, and investment management.
  * Headquarter, treasury, and financing services to related parties.
  * Financing and leasing of aircraft.
  * Logistics.
  * Distribution of goods or materials in or from a Designated Zone to a customer that resells such goods or materials, or parts thereof, or processes or alters such goods or materials, or parts thereof, for the purposes of sale or resale.
  * Any activities that are ancillary to the activities listed above (i.e. serve no independent function but are necessary for the performance of the main qualifying activity).


The activity of distributing goods or materials must be undertaken in or from a Designated Zone (not ordinary Free Zone), and the goods or materials entering the UAE must be imported through the Designated Zone.
### _De minimis_ requirements
The _de minimis_ requirements will be satisfied where non-qualifying revenue does not exceed 5% of total revenue or AED 5 million, whichever is lower. Non-qualifying revenue is revenue derived from excluded activities or activities that are not qualifying activities where the other party is a non-Free Zone person.
Certain revenue shall not be included in the calculation of non-qualifying revenue and total revenue. This includes revenue attributable to certain immovable property located in a Free Zone (non-commercial property, and commercial property where transactions are with non-Free Zone persons) and revenue derived from the ownership or exploitation of IP. It also includes revenue attributable to a domestic PE or a foreign PE.
### Domestic PE
The Decisions introduce the concept of a domestic PE where a QFZP has a place of business or other form of presence outside the Free Zone in the UAE. Income attributable to a domestic PE should be calculated as if the establishment were a separate and independent person and shall be subject to CT at 9%.
It is important that domestic PE (i) will not disqualify the QFZP income from 0% CT rate on qualifying income or (ii) will not be factored into the _de minimis_ test (as above). A mainland branch of a QFZP is an example of a domestic PE taxed at 9% CT rate.
## Foreign tax credit
A credit is available for foreign taxes paid on a UAE taxable person’s income. The foreign tax credit is limited to the amount of UAE CT due on the relevant net taxable income. Any unutilised foreign tax credit cannot be carried forward or back and will be lost.
## Small business relief
The UAE CT Law provides a temporary (till 31 December 2026) tax relief for small businesses. A tax resident person may elect to be treated as not having derived any taxable income where the revenue for the relevant and previous tax periods does not exceed AED 3 million during each relevant tax year. If such threshold is exceeded, then the taxable person will be subject to UAE CT at the relevant rates as provided under the CT Law.
If a tax resident person applies for ’small business relief‘, certain provisions of the CT Law will not apply, such as exempt income, reliefs, deductions, tax loss relief, and transfer pricing compliance requirements, as specified in the relevant chapters of the CT Law. 
## Transfers within a qualifying group
The UAE CT Law provides tax relief on intra-group transfer of assets or liabilities between taxable persons that are members of the same qualifying group. Taxable persons will be treated as members of the same qualifying group if all the following conditions are met:
  * The taxable persons are tax resident entities, or non-residents that have a PE in the UAE.
  * The taxable persons are at least 75% commonly owned and have the same financial year and prepare the financial statements using the same accounting standards.
  * None of the taxable persons are regarded as an exempt person or a QFZP.


There is a clawback period of two years from the date of initial transfer in the case there is a subsequent transfer of such asset or liability outside the permitted group or where transferor or transferee ceases to be a member of the permitted group.
## Business restructuring relief
Similar to intra-group transfer of assets or liabilities within a qualifying group, the UAE CT Law provides tax relief on mergers, spin-offs, and other corporate restructuring transactions where the whole or an independent part of the business is being transferred in exchange for shares or other ownership interest, provided the following conditions are met:
  * The transfer is undertaken in accordance with the applicable regulations in the UAE.
  * The taxable persons are resident persons, or non-resident persons that have a PE in the UAE.
  * None of the persons are regarded as an exempt person or a QFZP.
  * They have the same financial year and prepare the financial statements using the same accounting standards.
  * The transfer is undertaken for valid commercial or economic reasons.


There is a claw back period of two years from the date of the transfer if there is a subsequent transfer to a third party, or shares or ownership interests received are transferred or otherwise disposed of, and the gains or losses on the initial transfer will be reported in the period in which the subsequent transfer is made to the third-party.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 21 February 2025
With the broader objective of having a simplified yet robust UAE CT regime to reduce the compliance burden for taxpayers, a WHT (currently set at 0%) will apply to certain types of UAE-sourced income derived by non-residents insofar as it is not attributable to a PE of the non-resident. The applicable WHT rate, as well as the categories of income to which WHT applies, may be set out in a decision issued by the Cabinet.
Given the current 0% WHT rate, it is not expected that there will be any registration or filing obligation.
## WHT credit
A credit is available for any UAE WHT suffered by a new UAE taxable person to reduce its UAE CT payable in the same tax period. This WHT credit is limited to the lower of the amount of WHT deducted and the UAE CT due.
Any excess of such WHT credit will be refunded to the taxable person.
## Tax treaty network
UAE national or resident individuals and UAE resident companies have access to an extensive and growing double tax treaty (DTT) network. The DTTs could allow for relief from taxation in DTT partner countries. The DTTs currently in force are listed below based on publicly available information which may not be up to date. A number of other DTTs are at various stages of negotiation and ratification.
Recipient | WHT (%)

Notes
  1. This DTT includes a ‘favoured nation’ clause. If this jurisdiction ever concludes a more favourable treaty WHT rate with a country other than the UAE, then the more favourable treaty WHT rate will automatically apply to the UAE treaty as well. Note that the above-mentioned rates do not reflect the more favourable DTT rates but only the rates presented in the DTT between the UAE and the relevant jurisdiction. The more favourable rates will need to be confirmed separately.
  2. The UAE-Malaysia DTT provides for a reduced rate of 10% where dividend payments are made from a UAE entity to a Malaysian entity. The DTT, however, provides for a lower rate of 0% where payments are made from a Malaysian entity to a UAE entity.
  3. Government institutions only. There is a new UAE-Russia DTT signed in February 2025.

Last reviewed - 21 February 2025
## Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS)
The UAE joined the G20 / OECD Inclusive Framework on BEPS (the 'Inclusive Framework') in 2018. Through joining the Inclusive Framework, the United Arab Emirates has committed to implement, in the immediate to short term, the following 4 BEPS minimum standards Actions:
  * Action 5: Countering harmful tax practices.
  * Action 6: Countering tax treaty abuse.
  * Action 13: Transfer pricing documentation and CbC reporting.
  * Action 14: Improving dispute resolution mechanisms.


The UAE has also committed to implement the other 11 BEPS Actions in the medium to long term.
The UAE has signed and ratified the BEPS Multilateral Instrument (MLI). The key positions that the UAE decided to adopt include:
  * The UAE has chosen to include additional wording in the preamble of its Double Tax Treaties (DTT)s stating that the DTTs should not be used for treaty abuse (BEPS Action 6 minimum standard).
  * The UAE has chosen to include a principal purpose test with the ability to refer to a competent authority for final assessment of the availability of treaty benefits (BEPS Action 6 minimum standard).
  * The UAE has chosen to include additional wording in its DTTs to improve the dispute resolution process through Mutual Agreement Procedures (BEPS Action 14 minimum standard).
  * The UAE has chosen to retain the existing 'permanent establishment' definition in its DTTs, and has not elected to adopt the expanded 'permanent establishment' definition.
  * The UAE has chosen to retain its existing position on the taxation of capital gains realised on real estate rich entities, and has not elected to adopt the proposed 'real estate rich' provisions in its existing DTTs.


In respect of the remaining measures included under the UAE MLI position, the UAE has opted to agree specific changes to its DTTs through bilateral negotiation.
## BEPS 2.0 Pillar Two and DMTT in the UAE
On 9 December 2024, the UAE Ministry of Finance announced updates in relation to UAE CT Law. These include:
**Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (DMTT)**
Following the issuance of Federal Decree Law No. 60 of 2023, a Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (DMTT) is effective in the UAE for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2025. This strategic step reflects the UAE’s commitment to implementing the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) Two-Pillar Solution, aimed at establishing a fair and transparent tax system aligned with global standards.
The Pillar Two rules require large multinational enterprises (MNEs) to pay a minimum effective tax rate of 15% on profits in every country where they operate. The DMTT will apply to multinational enterprises operating in the UAE with consolidated global revenues of EUR750 million or more in at least two out of the four financial years immediately preceding the financial year in which the DMTT applies. The UAE’s implementation of the DMTT will closely align with the OECD’s GloBE Model Rules.
Further, Cabinet Decision No. 142 of 31 December 2024 introduced the detailed legislation on the UAE DMTT including cases, provisions, conditions, rules, controls, and procedures. It is broadly aligned with the OECD’s Inclusive Framework (IF).
**Tax Incentives to Support Growth and Innovation**
The UAE continues to enhance its business-friendly environment, reflecting its commitment to national strategic objectives such as strengthening economic competitiveness and improving ease of doing business. To promote sustainable growth, innovation, and investment, the Ministry of Finance is currently considering the introduction of the following Corporate Tax Incentives under Federal Decree-Law No. 47 of 2022.
To encourage Research and Development (R&D) activities, foster innovation and economic growth within the UAE, an R&D Tax Incentive is being considered. Based on feedback received during public consultations conducted in April 2024, the proposed incentive is expected to take effect for tax periods starting on or after 1 January 2026. The R&D tax incentive will be expenditure-based, offering a potential 30-50% tax credit and will be refundable depending on the revenue and number of employees of the business in the UAE. The scope of Qualifying R&D activities will be aligned to the OECD’s Frascati Manual guidelines and will be required to be conducted within the UAE.
Another incentive being considered is a refundable tax credit for high-value employment activities. This aims to encourage businesses to engage in activities that deliver significant economic benefits, stimulate innovation, and enhance the UAE’s global competitiveness. This incentive is proposed to take effect from 1 January 2025 and will be granted as a percentage of eligible salary costs for employees engaged in high-value employment activities. This includes C-suite executives and other senior personnel performing core business functions that add substantial value to the UAE economy.
The final form and implementation of the above mentioned proposed incentives are subject to legislative approvals.
## Economic substance regulations
### In scope entities
The Economic Substance Regulations (ESR) apply to all UAE Licensees that undertook one or more of the "Relevant Activities" during the ESR Period, i.e. only for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2019 and ending on or before 31 December 2022. 
The "Relevant Activities" are listed below: 
  * Banking Business 
  * Insurance Business 
  * Investment Fund Management Business 
  * Lease-Finance Business 
  * Headquarters Business 
  * Shipping Business 
  * Holding Company Business 
  * Intellectual Property (IP) Business 
  * Distribution and Service Centre Business 


Only the licensees that undertake a "Relevant Activity" and earn income from such "Relevant Activity" during the ESR Period are required to satisfy the applicable economic substance test. The ESR does not apply to non-UAE tax resident entities, investment funds and their underlying holding entities (except for self-managed investment funds), wholly UAE resident owned UAE entities with domestic transactions only (that are not part of a multinational group), and UAE branches of foreign companies that are subject to the corporate tax on all their “Relevant Income” in a foreign jurisdiction.
### Compliance requirements
There are two filing requirements, being:
  * Notification (applicable only to entities that perform 'relevant activities', regardless of 'relevant income' from those 'relevant activities').
  * Substance report (applicable only to entities that perform 'relevant activities' and generate 'relevant income' from those 'relevant activities').


The notification and substance report should be submitted electronically via the MoF online portal within 6 and 12 months of the financial year end of the UAE Licensee, respectively. These filings must be made on an annual basis, if applicable.
### Consequences of non-compliance
In addition to exchanging information with foreign authorities and the ultimate parent and beneficial owners of the UAE Licensee, failure to demonstrate adequate substance would result in administrative penalties (AED 50,000 in the first year of failure, increased to an amount of AED 400,000 for a consecutive year of failure). Additional penalties, such as suspending, revoking, or not renewing the UAE Licensee’s trade or commercial licence, could also apply.
Other administrative penalties include: (i) AED 20,000 for failure to submit the notification; (ii) AED 50,000 for failure to submit the annual substance report, as well as deemed failure to meet the economic substance test; and (iii) AED 50,000 for providing inaccurate information, as well as deemed failure of the economic substance test.
## United States (US) Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
In 2015, the United Arab Emirates signed the Model 1B Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the United States, which came into force in 2016 (US-UAE Model 1 IGA), with the US Internal Revenue Services (IRS) regarding the exchange of information related to US individuals and certain type of US-owned entities, with an effective date of 1 July 2014. 
The domestic legislative provisions to implement FATCA in the United Arab Emirates are set in Cabinet Resolution No. 63 of 2022 (UAE FATCA Regulations).
The exchange of information is conducted on an annual basis, occurring in September of each year, between the UAE competent authority and the US IRS. UAE reporting financial institutions for FATCA purposes need to submit their FATCA returns to their relevant financial regulator (or the UAE MoF for unregulated entities) by 30 June of each year (unless otherwise informed). Filing of nil reports is required under FATCA.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
In 2017, the UAE signed the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) on Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information, and the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (MAC) was signed in 2017.
The exchange of information is conducted on an annual basis, occurring in September of each year, between the UAE competent authority and competent authorities of jurisdictions which have agreed to exchange information with the UAE. 
The domestic legislative provisions to implement the CRS in the United Arab Emirates are set in Cabinet Resolution No. 93 of 2021 (UAE CRS Regulations).
UAE reporting financial institutions for CRS purposes need to submit their CRS returns to their relevant financial regulators (or the UAE MoF for unregulated entities) by 30 June of each year (unless otherwise informed). Filing of nil reports is required under the CRS.


# United Arab Emirates
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 21 February 2025
## Tax base for Emirate level taxes 
For Emirate level income taxes, the tax base is defined in the respective Emirate level decrees, laws, fiscal agreements or fiscal letters. Such tax base may significantly differ from the tax base described below for the purposes of the UAE Federal CT. 
## Tax base for UAE Federal CT 
Under the UAE CT Law, the accounting net profit (or loss) as stated in the standalone financial statements of a business is taken as the starting point for determining its taxable income. The law prescribes a number of key adjustments to the accounting net profit (or loss) in order to compute the taxable income.
The following table sets out the aspects to consider when determining the nature of a taxable person (i.e. resident vs. non-resident) as well as the applicable tax base:
Resident person | Tax base  
---|---  
An entity that is incorporated in the UAE (including a Free Zone entity) | Worldwide income  
A foreign entity that is effectively managed and controlled in the UAE | Worldwide income  
A natural person who conducts a business or business activity in the UAE | Worldwide income only where it relates to business activity within the UAE  
Any other person (may be determined by a Cabinet Decision) | Worldwide income   
Non-resident person | Tax base  
Has a PE in the UAE | Taxable income attributable to the PE  
Derives UAE-sourced income | The UAE-sourced income not attributable to the PE  
Has nexus in the UAE | Taxable income attributable to the nexus  
## Capital gains
There are no separate capital gains provisions under the UAE CT Law. Any gains / (loss) on disposal of capital assets would form part of the taxable income.
## Unrealised gains or losses
Based on the CT Law, a taxable person that prepares financial statements on an accrual basis of accounting can opt for the following:
  * Elect to recognise gains and losses on a ‘realisation basis’ for CT Law purposes for all assets and liabilities that are subject to fair value or impairment accounting under IFRS (i.e. all respective unrealised gains would not be taxable, and conversely, unrealised losses would not be deductible, until they are realised).
  * Elect to recognise gains and losses on a ‘realisation basis’ for CT Law purposes for assets and liabilities held on capital account only. Unrealised gains and losses arising from assets and liabilities held on revenue account, on the other hand, would continue to be included in taxable income on a current basis.


## Exempt income
To avoid instances of double taxation, and recognising the UAE’s position as an international business hub and leading holding company location, the UAE CT regime automatically exempts dividends and other profit distributions received by a UAE taxable person (UAE tax resident, or UAE PE of a non-resident) from a UAE tax resident person (domestic dividends). For other types of investment income, see the Participation Exemption relief below.
### Participation Exemption 
The below rules apply to capital gains and other similar income from UAE tax resident persons, as well as to dividends and other profit distributions and capital gains from foreign juridical persons. 
Dividends, other profit distributions, and capital gains and other similar income are exempt if the ownership interest (referred to as a ‘participating interest’) in a juridical person (referred to as ‘participation’) meets the following tests: 
  * the ownership interest is at least 5%. A participating interest of less than 5% could also qualify for the exemption where the acquisition cost of the ownership interest exceeds AED 4 million,
  * a 12-month uninterrupted holding period (or the intention to hold for 12 months) is in place,


  * the participation is subject to UAE CT or tax in its country or territory of residence at a statutory rate that is not lower than 9%, and
  * not more than 50% of the assets directly or indirectly owned by the participation consist of an ownership interest or entitlements that would not qualify for the participation exemption if these assets were held directly by the taxable person.


The ‘subject to tax’ test would also be satisfied if:
  * A 9% effective tax rate (ETR) is applied on income or profits of the participation,
  * In the event such a 9% ETR is not applicable based on the relevant jurisdiction’s tax regime, a 9% ETR is reached if re-calculated based on the provisions of the UAE CT Law.


### Foreign Permanent Establishment Exemption
A resident person could create a PE in another jurisdiction based on the domestic tax laws of this jurisdiction, subject to any tax treaty. Generally, the income attributed to such a foreign PE will be taxed in that jurisdiction. In such a scenario, the UAE CT Law provides an option to the resident person to elect for an exemption of this income in the UAE. The exemption will be available if the foreign PE is subject to CT or similar taxes at a rate not less than 9% in the foreign jurisdiction. If the resident person opts for this exemption, it will not be eligible to take into account in the UAE the losses, income, expenditure, and foreign tax credits in relation to the foreign PE.
### International transportation exemption
Income earned by a non-resident from operating aircraft or ships in international transportation will not be subject to CT in the UAE if the income earned by a UAE resident person that carries on these activities is exempt from CT in the jurisdiction of the non-resident.
## Partners in an unincorporated partnership
As a general rule, an unincorporated partnership should not be treated as a taxable person, i.e. the partnership is looked through and each partner should be treated as an individual taxable person on its distributive share. Each partner would be responsible for the full UAE CT compliance as if each carrying on independent business subject to UAE CT. Assets, liabilities, income, and expenditure of the partnership should be allocated to each partner in accordance with their distributive share.
The Ministerial Decision No. 261 of 2024 has clarified that a UAE unincorporated partnership shall not be considered a taxable person in its own right unless it is a juridical person.
Partners in an unincorporated partnership can make an irrevocable (save exceptional circumstances) application to the FTA for the unincorporated partnership to be treated as a taxable person, i.e. to be recognised as its own entity subject to UAE CT. Where this application is made, partners remain jointly and severally liable for the partnership’s CT liability. One partner will be appointed as the responsible partner for any UAE CT obligations and proceedings for the partnership.
## Foreign partnerships
Foreign partnerships will be treated as unincorporated partnerships where:
  * the partnership is not subject to any tax of a similar character to UAE CT under the laws of the foreign jurisdiction, and
  * each partner in the foreign partnership is individually subject to tax with regards to its distributive share of any income of the foreign partnership. This condition shall be met if the foreign partnership is not subject to tax in its own right in the foreign jurisdiction.


## Family foundations
The UAE CT Law identifies family foundations, trusts, and similar entities as independent juridical persons that are used to protect and manage the assets of an individual or a family with a separate legal personality.
A UAE family foundation can apply to be treated as a tax transparent unincorporated partnership for UAE CT purposes under certain conditions. Thus, a UAE based family foundation structure, with an elected tax transparent status, generally prevents the income of the foundation or trust from attracting UAE CT and is a useful vehicle for families to ensure a tax efficient holding structure, proper governance, as well as succession planning.
The Ministerial Decision #261 of 2024 extends the option for a tax transparent status to any underlying legal entity wholly owned and controlled, directly or indirectly, by a family foundation. Whereas a family foundation previously had to hold the assets directly in order for any income they generate to benefit from the structure’s tax transparent status, this amendment allows family foundations to hold assets via a legal entity such as a company without compromising the overall tax efficiency of the structure.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 21 February 2025
Under the Emirate-level tax decrees, income tax is payable under a progressive rate system, with rates up to 55%. However, in practice, these tax decrees have not been applied. Instead, branches of foreign banks are subject to income tax at a flat rate of 20% under separate Emirate-level bank decrees. Companies engaged in UAE oil and gas and petrochemical activities are subject to income tax at varying rates under their individual UAE concession agreements or fiscal letters.
The Federal UAE CT Law, which is effective for each taxable person’s new financial year beginning on or after 1 June 2023, is applicable across all Emirates and applies to all business and commercial activities, except to the following exempt persons (subject to conditions):
  * UAE government entity.
  * UAE government-controlled entity.
  * Person engaged in an extractive business in the UAE.
  * Person engaged in a non-extractive natural resource business in the UAE.
  * Qualifying public benefit entity.
  * Qualifying investment fund.
  * Public pension or social security fund, or a private pension or social security fund that is subject to regulatory oversight of the competent authority in the state and that meets any other conditions that may be prescribed by the Minister.
  * Juridical person incorporated in the state that is wholly owned and controlled by certain exempt persons.
  * Any other person as may be determined in a decision issued by the Cabinet at the suggestion of the Minister.


UAE CT is applicable at the following rates:
Taxable income | UAE CT rate (%)  
---|---  
  * Taxable income not exceeding 375,000 UAE dirham (AED).
  * Qualifying income of a Qualifying Free Zone Person (QFZP).*

| 0  
  * Taxable income exceeding AED 375,000.
  * Non-qualifying income of a QFZP.

# United Arab Emirates
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 21 February 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The general VAT rate is 5% and applies to most goods and services, with some goods and services subject to a 0% rate or an exemption from VAT (subject to specific conditions being met).
The 0% VAT rate applies to goods and services exported outside the VAT-implementing Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states, international transportation, the supply of crude oil/natural gas, the first supply of residential real estate, and some specific areas, such as health care and education.
Further, according to Cabinet Decision No. 46 of 2020, a person shall be considered as being ‘outside the state’, and thus fall under zero-rating export of services, if they only have a short-term presence in the state of less than a month and the presence is not effectively connected with the supply.
A VAT exemption applies to certain financial services, as well as to the subsequent supply of residential real estate. Further, transactions in bare land and domestic passenger transport are also exempt from VAT.
Certain transactions in goods between companies established in UAE Designated (Free) Zones (DZs) may not be subject to VAT. The supply of services within DZs is, however, subject to VAT in accordance with the general application of the UAE VAT legislation.
For UAE resident businesses, the mandatory VAT registration threshold is AED 375,000 and the voluntary registration threshold is AED 187,500. No registration threshold applies to non-resident businesses making supplies on which the UAE VAT is required to be charged.
VAT grouping is allowed, provided certain conditions are met. Note that VAT grouping rules are different from UAE CT grouping rules, and such groups may not always align. 
There are specific documentary and record-keeping requirements, such as the requirement to issue tax invoices and submit VAT returns (on a quarterly or monthly basis depending on the allocation by the FTA).
Excess input VAT can, in principle, be claimed back from the FTA, subject to a specific procedure. Alternatively, VAT credits may be carried forward and deducted from future output VAT.
Businesses that do not comply with their VAT obligations can be subject to fines and penalties. There are both fixed and tax-geared penalties.
## Customs duties
All goods imported into the UAE are subject to UAE Customs entry requirements and are dutiable or duty-free in accordance with their classification under the applicable customs tariff of the UAE. The tariff classification also identifies eligibility for special import requirements. 
Generally, a customs duty rate of 5% is imposed on the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) value of imports. Other rates may apply to certain goods, such as alcohol and tobacco, and certain exemptions and reliefs may also be available. Further, the UAE imposes anti-dumping duties on imports of certain goods, such as car batteries, ceramic and porcelain tiles, and hydraulic cement. The anti-dumping duty rates vary depending on the HS codes of the goods and country of export and/or origin. In some cases, the anti-dumping duty is 67.5% of the CIF value of the goods.
The UAE is part of the GCC Customs Union, which removes customs and trade barriers among the GCC member states. Additionally, the UAE grants duty-free access to imports originating in member countries of a number of Free Trade Agreements, such as Singapore, the European Free Trade Association countries (i.e. Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, and Liechtenstein), Israel, India, Turkey, Indonesia, etc.
## Excise taxes
The UAE excise tax rates are:
  * 100% on tobacco and tobacco products, electronic smoking devices and tools, liquids used in electronic smoking devices and tools, and energy drinks.
  * 50% on carbonated drinks and sweetened drinks.


## Municipal or property tax
Most Emirates impose a municipality tax on properties, mostly by reference to the annual rental value. It is generally the tenants' obligation to pay the tax. In some cases, separate fees are payable by both tenants and property owners. For example, in the Emirate of Dubai, the municipality tax on property is currently imposed at 2.5% on annual rental value for commercial properties (paid by property owners) and 5% for residential properties (paid by tenants or by owners based on a market value of rental if not rented).
A registration fee may be levied on transfer of ownership of land or real property. For example, a land registration fee is levied in the Emirate of Dubai at a rate of 4% of the fair market value of the property, payable to the Dubai Land Department. In Dubai, the registration fee may also apply on the direct or indirect transfer of shares in an entity that owns real property.
These levies are imposed and administered differently by each Emirate.
## Stamp taxes
Currently, there are no separate stamp taxes in the UAE.
## Payroll taxes
There is no personal income tax in the UAE.
## Social security contributions
There is a social security regime in the UAE that applies to qualifying UAE and other GCC national employees only. Non-GCC nationals are not subject to social security in the UAE.
For UAE national employees (with the exception of those employed in Abu Dhabi), social security contributions are calculated at a rate of 20% of the employee's gross remuneration as stated in the local employment contract. Social security obligations also apply to employees of companies and branches registered in a Free Zone. Out of the 20%, 5% is payable by the employee, 12.5% is payable by the employer, and an additional 2.5% contribution is made by the government. A higher rate of 26% is applied in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, where the contribution of the employer is increased to 15%, the government’s contribution is increased to 6%, and the employee’s contribution remains 5%. The contributions are subject to a statutory minimum and maximum salary amount (against which the amount of the pension contributions is calculated) of AED 1,000 and AED 50,000, respectively. 
For other GCC nationals working in the UAE, social security contributions are determined in accordance with the social security regulations of their home country.
The employer is responsible for withholding and remitting employee social security contributions together with the employer’s share.
In the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), the DIFC Employee Workplace Savings Scheme (DEWS) has been introduced, replacing the End of Service Gratuity Benefit (EOSG), with the aim of protecting long-term employee savings. The new scheme was rolled out on 1 February 2020, and employers now are required to make monthly contributions to DEWS or an alternative regulated Qualifying Scheme, as opposed to paying a lump sum ‘gratuity payment’ to an employee at the end of their employment. Employers are required to contribute monthly contributions of 5.83% or 8.33% of the employee’s basic salary (the actual percentage is contingent upon the employee’s length of service) into the scheme.
