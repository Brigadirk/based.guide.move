## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Foreign tax relief
Residents are entitled to relief from double taxation under national legislation and effective tax treaties.
Generally, foreign tax paid on income included in the tax base is allowed as a credit against PIT on the basis of documentary evidence of income earned and income tax paid approved by the foreign tax authorities. The tax credit should not exceed the Latvian tax attributable to the income earned abroad.
According to the national legislation, PIT is not applicable on employment income derived and taxed in another EU/EEA member state or in a country that has an effective double tax treaty (DTT) with Latvia. Foreign employment income not taxed attracts Latvian PIT at the progressive rates.
## Tax treaties
Latvia has effective DTTs with 63 countries and continues developing its tax treaty network.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
From January 1, 2025, a package of changes to the application of personal income tax (PIT) has been implemented in Latvia. The main changes include revised PIT rates, a single fixed personal allowance replacing the income-differentiated personal allowance, and an additional 3% PIT rate on the portion of total annual income exceeding EUR 200,000, among other relevant adjustments.
The special royalties regime has been extended until the end of 2027. Under this regime, individuals who are not registered as self-employed and receive payments classified as royalties will continue having 25% withheld from their gross royalties by the payer.
The main principles of taxation for individuals in 2025 can be divided into the following topics:
  * Treatment of paid employees and traders: 
    * Progressive PIT rates are applied as follows: 
      * A 25.5% PIT on income of up to EUR 105,300 per year.
      * A 33% PIT on income above EUR 105,300 per year.
    * In 2025, the income-differentiated personal allowance is replaced by the fixed personal allowance (FPA) of EUR 510 which is applicable to taxpayers regardless of their income level. In 2026, the FPA will be increased to EUR 550 and to EUR 570 in 2027.
    * Individuals receiving an age or disability pension are entitled totheFPA of EUR 1000. If such individuals are employed, there is the option to apply the FPA proportionally, allocating EUR 500 each to earned income and pension income separately.
  * Income from capital and capital gains:
    * A 0% PIT on dividends from income generated after 2017 on which corporate income tax (CIT) or PIT has been withheld, while a 25.5% PIT on other dividends. Dividends from tax havens will attract a 25.5% PIT.
    * A single PIT rate of 25.5% on all types of capital income and capital gains.
  * From 2025, an additional 3% PIT rate has been introduced for the portion of an individual's total income that exceeds EUR 200,000 per year. The tax base includes employment remuneration, income from capital and capital gains,dividendsfrom domestic or foreign companies on which CIT or PIT (or relevant tax) has been withheld, and other sources of income. The additional rate will be applied at the time of submitting the annual tax return for the previous tax year.
  * The National Social Insurance Contributions (NSIC) and Solidarity Tax (ST) rates are split between employer and employee. In 2025, the applicable standard rates are 23.59% (employer part) and 10.5% (employee part).
  * In 2025, the NSIC income cap has been increased from EUR 78,100 to EUR 105,300, with any excess gross taxable income attracting ST.
  * The ST on the slice of taxable gross income exceeding EUR 105,300 has been split between the health insurance budget, the PIT budget, and the state pension budget.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
Latvian residents are liable to Latvian income tax on their worldwide income.
Non-residents are liable to income tax on their Latvian-source income.
## Personal income tax rates
Latvia has a progressive PIT system. Unless the law provides for a different rate, the progressive rate is based on the level of annual income as follows:
  * A rate of 25.5% applies to income up to EUR 105,300.
  * Any income over EUR 105,300 attracts a rate of 33%.


The PIT rate on dividends is 25,5%. However, when a company has already applied CIT to its profits, no PIT is required on dividends paid to individuals (this exemption is not applicable to the 3% additional PIT rate as per below in case total income exceeds EUR 200,000).
This provision applies to dividends from Latvian companies, companies within the European Union (EU) or European Economic Area (EEA), and other entities, except for companies from tax havens and micro-business tax (MBT) payers.
To benefit from a zero PIT rate on dividends, evidence of PIT or CIT paid abroad must generally be presented, except in the case of EU/EEA companies where such evidence is not needed as it is assumed that the tax (PIT or CIT) has been applied at the source by default. Nevertheless, in practical application, tax authorities often request confirmation of tax compliance even for dividends received from these jurisdictions.
The PIT rate for income from capital (including interest) and capital gains is 25.5%.
Starting in 2025, an additional 3% PIT rate applies to the portion of an individual's total annual income that exceeds EUR 200,000. The tax base includes taxable income, which is employment remuneration, taxable income from capital reported on the annual tax return, royalties, and taxable income from capital gains, and on a specific exempt type of income, which is dividends and dividend equivalents received by the individual.
The tax base does not include other exempt income, such as employee benefits, gifts and income from real estate if they meet the PIT Act’s exemption criteria.
The additional rate will be applied at the time of submitting the annual tax return for the previoustax year (e.g. starting from 2026 for 2025 etc.).
The Latvian PIT Act defines cryptocurrency as a capital asset subject to the general capital gains tax rules with the requirement to match capital gain with the capital loss from cryptocurrency to assess annual total gain or loss from the trading in cryptocurrency.
Other capital assets should not be matched and can be set off against each other.
The taxation regime applicable to royalties, currently in force, was not amended as of 1 July 2021 for a transitional period until the end of 2021 as it was initially planned. The taxation approach was supposed to differ for the individuals who are and are not registered as self-employed individuals. However, this special regime has been prolonged and the mentioned changes have been postponed until the end of 2027.
The individuals who are not registered as self-employed persons and payment is treated as royalties, the payer of royalties must apply 25% PIT on the gross royalties via withholding, without applying a notional expense rate.
A controlled foreign company (CFC) regime has been operative in Latvia since 1 January 2013. Income from substantial participation in a CFC located in a tax haven attracts a progressive rate of PIT.
## Micro-business tax (MBT)
Sole traders may apply for MBT payer status. From 2024, micro-enterprise taxpayers, if they obtain income that is object to PIT, are able to apply the differentiated non-taxable minimum and allowance for dependent persons to this income. _See the section in the Corporate tax summary for more information on MBT._ Please note that the MBT regime has been significantly changed as of 2021.
## Local income taxes
There are no local taxes on income, such as municipal taxes.

In case the annual income exceeds EUR 105,300, the tax return should be submitted between 1 April and 1 July of the following year to recalculate PIT and ST. Spouses may not file joint returns.
If a person’s total income from capital gains exceeds EUR 1,000 quarterly, a capital gains tax return should be filed quarterly by the 15th day of the month following the quarter in which relevant income was earned.
If a person’s total income from capital gains does not exceed EUR 1,000 quarterly, a capital gains tax return should be filed by 15 January in the following year.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Personal deductions
Residents may deduct the following non-business expenses:
  * Compulsory NSIC (employee part) paid on income subject to Latvian PIT. NSIC is payable in Latvia and EU/EEA/Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries.
  * Spending on education and medical services (including dental services and scheduled operations), donations to public benefit organisations, and donations to political parties of up to 50% of the person’s annual taxable income, capped at EUR 600 a year for each family member.
  * Contributions to private pension funds and endowment insurance (the policy should mature in at least ten years) at 10% of annual taxable income, capped at EUR 4,000.


A person planning to deduct expenses for completing their children’s interest-related programmes should consider the following factors:
  * These expenses do not apply to any income a micro-business owner derives from the micro-business, any borrowing treated as income, any income from capital (other than capital gains), any income from property, seasonal farm workers’ income, or any business income for which so-called 'patent fees' are paid.
  * These expenses are not deductible if covered out of funds received from public benefit organisations or as a gift.

## Employment income
### Monthly application of PIT by the employer
Employers are required to apply PIT rates according to monthly income thresholds, calculated by dividing the annual income thresholds by 12 as follows:
The employee pays Latvian NSIC. | The employer applies a 25.5% PIT on monthly gross income of up to EUR 8,775. | The employer applies the PIT rate of 25.5% on income exceeding EUR 8,775 and does not apply the 33% PIT. Tax rate difference is then covered by the part of Solidarity tax.  
---|---|---  
The employee holds a foreign A1 certificate, and does not pay Latvian NSIC. | The employer applies a 25.5% PIT to monthly gross income of up to EUR 8,775. | The employer applies a 33% PIT on the excess of EUR 8,775.  
### Application of PIT by individuals annually
A person whose annual income exceeds EUR 105,300 (in 2025) is required to file the annual income tax return. Mandatory filing also applies to individuals who are self-employed or need to pay additional PIT. An individual may voluntarily file a tax return to request a refund of overpaid taxes. Latvian tax authorities have introduced an automated solution for refund of overpaid PIT that came into effect on 1 January 2023 for individuals who have not filed their tax returns if certain criteria are met. Automated refund of overpaid PIT will occur only in specific cases.
Individuals are required to apply progressive PIT rates on their taxable income. In assessing the applicable rates, the entire taxable income, including applicable flat tax rates, should be counted.
From 2025,the portion of individuals’ total annual income that exceeds EUR 200,000is subject to an additional 3% PIT rate. The rate is applicable at the time of submitting the annual tax return for the previous tax year (e.g. starting from 2026 for 2025 etc.) (for more information see section _Personal income tax rates_).
For persons who pay Latvian NSIC and ST on their full income, applying the rate of 33% through the annual income tax return is a formal procedure to compensate them for the additional PIT charge at the expense of ST already paid. Consequently, the effective rate of PIT for persons paying ST on their full income is still 25.5%. Otherwise, individuals not paying NSIC and ST on their entire income are affected, since they are required to pay additional tax.
### Allowances and a fixed personal allowance (FPA)
In 2025, anincome-differentiated personal allowance is cancelled, and the employer is required to apply a fixed personal allowance (FPA) of 510 EUR regardless of their income level.
For PIT purposes, the employer is still permitted to deduct the employee part of NSIC.
If a wage tax book is submitted via the Electronic Declaration System (EDS), a monthly dependent allowance of EUR 250 can be claimed for each dependent in 2025.
In addition, a person with a recognized disability is entitled to additional tax relief as follows:
  * EUR 1,848 per year or EUR 154 per month for individuals classified under disability groups I or II;


  * EUR 1,440 per year or EUR 120 per month for individuals classified under disability group III.


A person recognized as politically repressed or as a member of the national resistance movement is entitled to additional tax relief of EUR 1,848 per year or EUR 154 per month.
## Equity compensation
The PIT Act exempts any income arising on the exercise of stock options, provided the criteria below are met. 
  * The employee has an employment contract with the company or a related company during the minimum vesting period.
  * The stock option plan has a minimum one-year holding (vesting) period.
  * The employer has provided the SRS with statutory information on the terms of the stock option plan within two months after the award date as required by the PIT Act.
  * The company has not issued loans to the employee that have not been paid until the time of exercising the stock options.


The exercise of stock options must take place no later than six months after the termination of the employment relationship between the employee and the company in order to apply the beneficial regime.
If, at the time of exercising stock options, the individual does not have an employment contract with the entity that granted them or with a related entity (e.g. the individual is a leaver), the employer should pay NSIC out of their own pocket at the rate applicable when the employment ended.
## Business income
When calculating taxable operating income, business expenses can be written off as operating expenses. 
The taxpayer’s operating loss can be offset in chronological order against taxable operating income in the next three tax years.
## Capital gains
Capital gains arising from the disposal of capital assets are taxed at 25.5%. Capital assets include real estate, shares, investment fund certificates, debentures, and intellectual property.
However, income from transactions with capital assets that have been initiated but not completed by December 31, 2024, will be subject to the PIT rate of 20% in 2025, 2026, and 2027 (it required submission of the special notification form to the SRS by the end of 2024).
### Real estate
Latvian tax residents (individuals) and non-residents can apply an exemption on income arising on the disposal of real estate in Latvia if:
  * the real estate is held for at least 60 months and registered as the seller's primary residence for at least 12 months before the sale during a period of 60 months
  * the real estate is held for at least 60 months and has been the sole real estate of the taxpayer over the 60 months before the sale, or
  * income arising on the disposal of the sole real estate has been reinvested during the 12-month period after the sale into another real estate of the same function.


## Dividend and interest income
Dividend income, interest income, alienation of bonds, and income from life insurance contracts and private pension funds is taxed at 25.5%. This type of income should still be reported and charged to PIT through the annual income tax return unless such income is paid by a Latvian taxpayer who has already withheld PIT at source.
A 0% PIT applies on dividends paid by a Latvian/EU/EEA company or one from any other country if there is evidence that CIT or PIT has been withheld at source. 
In any case, dividends received from tax havens will attract a 25.5% PIT. Dividends that are paid by MBT payers from profit that has been subject to CIT after 1 January 2021 would be subject to 0% PIT; otherwise, 25.5%.
From 2025,dividends would still be included in the tax base for the additional 3% PIT rate if an individual’s total income exceeds EUR 200,000 per year.
## Income from substantial participation in controlled foreign entities
Income from a substantial participation in controlled foreign entities is subject to a progressive PIT rate. This applies to Latvian tax residents that directly or indirectly hold at least 25% of a foreign entity’s equity, stock, or voting power, or are in any other manner (e.g. by contract) entitled to a substantial proportion of distributed profits or in a position to influence decisions about the foreign entity’s profit distribution policy. An exception applies to a participation in such foreign entities through a public company that is listed on an EU/EEA regulated market.

## National social insurance contributions (NSIC)
As of 1 July 2021, a minimum NSIC object of a minimum wage (EUR 740 for 2025) has been introduced. In case an individual earns less from all NSIC taxable income sources, the employer is responsible for making the contributions on employees’ behalf.
Individuals employed by multiple employers or individuals who are both self-employed and employees must sum their total income to determine whether the income is within the minimum amount.
Since January 2014, income attracting NSIC has been capped. In 2025, the cap is EUR 105,300.
The contribution rates are summarised in this table:
Employment | 2025 (%)  
---|---  
Employment with company registered in Latvia/EU/EEA (split rate):  
Employer | 23.59  
Employee | 10.50  
Employment with company registered in Latvia/EU/EEA (employee eligible for retirement) (split rate):  
Employer | 20.77  
Employee | 9.25  
Foreign national employed by foreign non-resident employer (full rate payable by either employer or employee): | 31.83  
Self-employed | 31.07  
Self-employed (eligible for retirement) | 29.36  
NSIC should be reported and paid quarterly in the case of self-employed persons, whereas monthly contributions are required to be withheld, reported, and paid by Latvian employers.
A 10% NSIC should be contributed by self-employed individuals and payers of royalties, as follows:
  * Self-employed can contribute only 10% NSIC of their actual monthly income if it does not meet the minimum NSIC threshold (less than three minimum monthly wages of EUR 740 in 2025 per quarter) provided they submit a certain application on projected income for the next quarter.
  * The self-employed should contribute an additional 10% NSIC on the difference between their actual monthly income and NSIC income (i.e. the excess) on the quarterly basis, if the contributions are calculated of whole monthly income (as per previous point).
  * A 10% NSIC is payable in addition by a payer of royalty to Latvian-resident individuals (living in Latvia).


## Solidarity tax (ST)
ST has been in place since 1 January 2016. ST is applicable on income that exceeds the maximum income attracting NSIC, i.e. EUR 105,300 a year in 2025, and during the year is payable at the same rate as NSIC: 23.59% for employer and 10.5% for employee. However, the effective ST rate is 25%. Thus, for the contributions made e.g. in 2025, the employer will receive ST refund by September 2026.
The ST paid will be split as follows:
  * 1 percentage point to finance healthcare services, with 0.5 points coming from the employee’s part of ST and 0.5 points from the employer’s part of ST
  * 10 percentage points goes to PIT, and
  * the rest goes into the special budget for state pensions (impersonalised).


The ST Act does not provide for a different split if a person’s NSIC rate is lower than the standard rate. Thus the fixed percentage points apply to all ST payers regardless of their NSIC status and rates used.
The ST payer is also required under the PIT Act to file their annual tax return between 1 April and 1 July of the following year to recalculate ST and PIT.
## Consumptions taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate on supplies of goods and services is 21%. _See the section in the Corporate tax summary for more information_.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Latvia.
## Gift taxes
Gifts in any form from individuals are subject to the progressive PIT rate after applying an annual exemption of EUR 1,425 to the value of the gift. Gifts of up to EUR 100 (including VAT) from the employer are exempt from PIT. Gifts between spouses and relatives up to the third degree are fully exempt. Starting from 1 July 2024, the exemption also applies to gifts between persons who have registered a civil partnership.
## Light corporate vehicle tax (LCVT)
If LCVT is paid by the employer, no taxable car benefit arises for employees. _See the section in the Corporate tax summary for more information on the LCVT_.
