On 26 December 2024, the Royal Gazette officially promulgated the Emergency Decree on Top-up Tax, B.E. 2567 (2024). This decree impacts large multinational enterprises (MNEs) with consolidated financial statement revenues of at least €750 million. This legislation will be effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2025, aligning with global tax standards to ensure Thailand's fiscal sustainability and competitiveness.

## Tax period
The tax year for a company is its accounting period, which must be of 12 months’ duration. However, it may be less than 12 months in the case of the first accounting period after incorporation, the accounting period of dissolution, or after approval for a change in the accounting period has been received from the Revenue Department and the Business Development Department.
## Tax returns
The tax system is one of self-assessment. A company prepares and files its tax returns by the due dates and at the same time pays the taxes calculated to be due. The annual CIT return is due 150 days from the closing date of the accounting period.
A half-year CIT return must be filed within two months after the end of the first six months of an accounting period. The tax is computed on one-half of the estimated profit for the full accounting period, except for listed companies, banks, certain other financial institutions, and other companies under prescribed conditions, where the tax is based on the actual net profit for the first six months.
## Payment of tax
CIT is paid twice in each year at the time of filing the tax returns as above. The balance of the tax due is payable within 150 days from the closing date of the accounting period. Credit is given for the amount of tax paid at the half-year.
## Tax audit process
If, within a period of two years from the date of filing a tax return, the assessment officer has reason to believe that false or inadequate information has been declared in a return, the assessment officer has the power to issue a summons requesting the presence of the person responsible, or a witness, for examination, and to order either of them to produce accounts or other relevant evidence, provided that advance notice of seven days is given. The subsequent examination of the books and records is normally carried out at the company's offices if it is inconvenient to transfer all the documents to the tax office. After completion of the examination, the assessment officer has the power to adjust the amounts previously assessed or included in a return on the basis of the evidence, and issue a further assessment for tax together with penalties and surcharges, or adjust the amount of losses available for carryforward.
Tax audits may cover the previous five accounting periods from the date of filing a tax return with the approval of the Director-General if the assessment officer has evidence of an intention to evade tax or in the case of a claim for a refund of tax. However, under the Civil and Commercial Code, the Revenue Department can assess tax for up to ten years.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations for tax is ten years.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Topics of focus for tax authorities currently include the following:
  * Deductibility of management service fees or expenses allocated to Thailand by foreign affiliates.
  * International inter-company transactions and transfer pricing.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
Corporate residence is determined by the place of incorporation. A company incorporated under the laws of Thailand is a resident company.
A company incorporated abroad is subject to CIT in Thailand if it is considered to be carrying on business in Thailand. The term ‘carrying on business in Thailand’ is broad and, subject to the provisions of a DTT, includes the presence of an employee, representative, or go-between that results in the foreign company deriving income or gains in Thailand.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
## Depreciation, amortisation, and depletion
Deductions for depreciation are allowed as a percentage of cost. If the rate of deduction adopted by a company under its own accounting method is lower than the maximum percentage of cost permitted, a deduction will be allowed only at the rate adopted by the company. The straight-line basis is the method most commonly used by companies, but any generally accepted basis, such as sum-of-the-years-digits or double-declining method, is permitted. The maximum permitted rates are shown below:
Asset | Maximum permitted rate (%)  
---|---  
Buildings:  
Durable buildings | 5  
Temporary buildings | 100  
Cost of acquisition of depletable natural resources | 5  
Cost of acquisition of lease rights:  
If there is no written lease agreement or if there is a written lease agreement containing a renewal clause whereby continual renewals are permitted | 10  
If there is a written lease agreement containing no renewal clause or containing a renewal clause but restricting renewable periods to a definitely limited duration | Percentage rate equals 100 divided by the sum of years of the original and renewable lease periods  
Cost of acquisition of the right in a process, formula, goodwill, trademark, business licence, patent, copyright, or any other right:  
If the period of use is unlimited | 10  
If the period of use is limited | Percentage rate equals 100 divided by the number of years of use  
Other assets not mentioned above, excluding land and inventory | 20  
### Special depreciation methods for certain assets
  * Machinery and equipment for research and development (R&D) may initially be depreciated at 40% of cost, with the remaining balance being depreciated at the above maximum rate of 20% per annum.
  * Computer hardware and software may be depreciated within three accounting periods.


### Special depreciation method for small companies
Companies and juristic partnerships with fixed assets, excluding land, with a value of no more than THB 200 million and with no more than 200 employees are entitled to use the following special depreciation methods:
  * Machinery and equipment may initially be depreciated at 40% of cost, and the remaining balance will then be depreciated at the maximum rate of 20%.
  * Computer hardware and software may initially be depreciated at 40% of cost, and the remaining balance can then be depreciated within three accounting periods.
  * Factory buildings may initially be depreciated at 25% of cost, and the remaining balance will then be depreciated at the maximum rate of 5%.


## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses, such as incorporation expenses and registration fees, are deductible when incurred.
## Interest expenses
Interest on money borrowed for the purpose of acquiring profit or for the purpose of the business is deductible. Interest incurred in respect of the construction or installation of fixed assets that require a period of time before they are ready for their intended use is considered to be capital expenditure and deductible in the form of depreciation.
## Bad debts
Bad debts written off are deductible, provided that they are consistent with the rules, procedures, and conditions prescribed by ministerial regulations.
## Charitable contributions
Donations to specified charities or for public benefit are deductible in the amount actually paid but not exceeding 2% of net profit. Donations for education or sport are also deductible in the amount actually paid but not exceeding 2% of net profit.
## Fines and penalties
Fines, penalties, and surcharges imposed under all tax laws are not deductible.
## Taxes
In general, all taxes are deductible except CIT and VAT (in certain cases).
## Other significant items
Non-deductible expenses include, but are not limited to, the following:
  * Expenses in the nature of provisions.
  * Contributions to any fund (except for registered provident funds).


## Net operating losses
Losses may be carried forward to offset against the profits of the following five accounting periods. The carryback of losses is not permitted. A change in control of a loss-making company does not impact its loss carryforward status.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
A company incorporated in Thailand may claim a deduction for royalties, management service fees, and interest charges, provided they are expended exclusively for the purpose of generating profit or for the purpose of the business and are determined on an arm’s-length basis.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
Group taxation is not permitted in Thailand.
## Transfer pricing
On 21 November 2018, Thailand introduced specific transfer pricing provisions into the income tax law, which apply to accounting periods that started on or after 1 January 2019.
The transfer pricing rules adopt the arm’s-length principle. Revenue officers have the power to uplift or reduce taxpayers’ revenue and expenses to the arm’s-length price. Where transfer pricing adjustments result in a tax shortfall, a secondary adjustment that arises from imposing tax on a constructive transaction, either in the form of a deemed dividend or deemed loan, would also apply.
The legislation also requires mandatory annual transfer pricing reporting for taxpayers belonging to a group of companies (‘applicable taxpayers’). Entities with an annual total revenue of THB 200 million or less are exempt from the transfer pricing information reporting requirements.
There are two levels of transfer pricing information reporting, as follows:
  * Partial disclosure: Applicable taxpayers are required to complete a transfer pricing disclosure form to be submitted online to the Revenue Department at the time of filing the annual tax return.
  * Full disclosure: Applicable taxpayers are also required to prepare full transfer pricing documentation to be maintained for five years from the date of filing the transfer pricing disclosure form. This includes the local file and the master file for larger entities and is to be submitted to the Revenue Department within a prescribed time period (normally 60 days) from the date of the request.


A penalty of up to THB 200,000 for each level of transfer pricing reporting will be imposed in the case where taxpayers fail to comply with the reporting requirements (by way of inaccurate or incomplete disclosure of information).
The detailed content requirements of the transfer pricing documentation were issued on 30 September 2021 and are applicable for accounting periods that started on or after 1 January 2021. The new content requirements are largely in line with those suggested by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) local file requirements. However, transfer pricing documentation must be submitted in the Thai language. It also remains unclear whether Thailand’s transfer pricing documentation now only comprises the local file as there is no mention of the master file.
The content requirements apply to entities for the financial year starting on or after 1 January 2021, but the reporting requirements have been in place since 1 January 2019. What this means is that, for the financial years starting between 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2020, taxpayers may follow either Thailand’s internal guidelines on transfer pricing (Departmental Instruction Paw. 113/2545) when preparing transfer pricing documentation or the OECD local file requirements.
The Revenue Department will use the transfer pricing disclosure form to select audit targets. Once selected, they will request the full transfer pricing documentation for review. In the case where the transfer pricing practices adopted by the taxpayer do not comply with the arm’s-length principle, Revenue officers will make the necessary adjustments and assess additional taxes, surcharges, and penalties.
Although smaller entities with revenue of THB 200 million or less are exempt from the transfer pricing information reporting requirements, they will still be obligated to ensure that their transfer pricing practices are at arm’s length.
Thailand also introduced the country-by-country reporting (CbCR) requirements to be applicable for accounting periods starting on or after 1 January 2021. Multinational enterprises (MNEs) with total consolidated revenues exceeding THB 28 billion carrying on business in Thailand are required to file the CbC report in Thailand if they do not meet the local filing exemption conditions. The Revenue Department also allows a foreign company to designate a Thai entity to be its surrogate parent entity and file a CbC report on behalf of the group, with certain conditions to be met.
The CbC report is required to be filed online within 12 months from the financial year-end in the case where the ultimate parent entity of a Thai MNE is the filing entity and within 60 days upon request in the case where the filing entity falls under the local filing conditions. Each MNE group operating in Thailand and meeting the CbCR threshold must select a representative entity to file a CbC notification online with the Revenue Department.
A fine of THB 2,000 will be imposed on a taxpayer that fails to file the CbC report by the due date.
The transfer pricing rules endorse the use of five transfer pricing methods in determining the arm’s-length compensation for a controlled transaction, which are the comparable uncontrolled price, resale price, cost plus, transactional net margin, and transactional profit split methods.
Other pricing methods may only be used in cases where it can be proven that the five endorsed methods are inappropriate. When another method is adopted, taxpayers must provide written notification to the Director-General of the Revenue Department of the other method within the fiscal period in which it is to be used. Taxpayers are also required to prepare supporting documentation to justify the use of the other method, which should be ready for submission to the Revenue officers upon request.
The regulation on transfer pricing also provides brief guidelines for benchmarking whereby internal comparables (i.e. the same or similar transactions that a taxpayer has with unrelated parties) must be considered before external comparables (i.e. the same or similar transactions between independent third parties).
There remains some ambiguity around the interpretation of ‘relationship’ and ‘control’ under the definition of ‘related parties’ in the main provision. We expect to see more guidance on this interpretation in the pending subordinate regulation.
The Revenue Department will still be able to assess tax on transfer pricing irregularities for periods that started before 1 January 2019 as the statute of limitations in this case is five years. For those periods, the general income tax provisions, which require taxpayers to transact at market price, would be referred to. The transfer pricing documentation should then follow the requirements under the Departmental Instruction Paw. 113/2545 and be prepared and submitted upon request on a voluntary basis.
To resolve, or even avoid, transfer pricing disputes, Thailand accepts Mutual Agreement Procedures (MAPs) to eliminate or mitigate double taxation from cross-border transactions. Only companies or partnerships incorporated in Thailand that engage in intra-group transactions with related parties who are residents of Thailand’s treaty partners are eligible for MAPs or bilateral Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs).
## Thin capitalisation
There are no thin capitalisation rules. However, for certain businesses or as part of the conditions for granting tax incentives, a certain debt-to-equity ratio may be required.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no tax provisions in respect of CFCs.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
Branches of foreign corporations are subject to CIT on locally earned profits only. Branch profits remitted to the foreign head office are subject to an additional tax at the rate of 10%. However, this is a tax on the disposition of profits abroad and is not limited to remittances. For example, a credit of profit to the head office account in the books is held to be a disposition of profit abroad even though no remittance of funds has taken place.

The Revenue Code provides for an additional 100% deduction in respect of expenditure incurred in Thailand on R&D for technology and innovation (including product and process innovation) when hiring government agencies or the private sector, as approved by the Director-General of the Revenue Department.
## Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC)
Under the Eastern Economic Corridor Act (2018) (EEC Act), an EEC project must be located in certain zones within the EEC, which consists of the three Eastern provinces of Rayong, Chonburi, and Chachoengsao. An EEC project will be promoted only if it is engaged in a target industry.
An EEC-promoted company will be granted CIT exemption and/or reduction privileges according to the criteria prescribed by the EEC committee. Currently, the CIT privileges under the EEC Act have not been announced.
Nevertheless, the BOI, under the Investment Promotion Act, has already issued criteria and incentives for promoted activities located in the EEC. The tax incentives are categorised under three zones, as follows:
  * Special industry promotion zone: 
    * Eastern Airport City (EECa).
    * Eastern Economic Corridor of Innovation (EECi).
    * Digital Park Thailand (EECd).
    * Medical Hub Thammasat University (Pattaya) (EECmd).
    * Genomics Thailand (EECg).
    * Tech Park Ban Chang (EECtp).
  * Industrial estate or industrial area within the EEC.


Only eligible activities under categories A1+-A4 (except for those specified in a negative list) and enabling services can be applied for.
Tax incentives* provided by the BOI are as follows:
  * BOI standard incentives.
  * Additional CIT exemption up to two years.
  * CIT reduction of 50% for up to three years after the end of the tax holiday.


* Subject to qualified human resources, the development of R&D activities, and the location of the project.
Note that EEC incentives cannot be utilised together with those under the merit of industrial area development.
The EEC Act also grants a PIT reduction for employees with special knowledge/abilities who work or operate a business in certain zones within the EEC.
Qualified expatriates and Thai employees are granted a flat rate of 17% PIT on their income derived from working for companies carrying on target activities within the EEC.
## International business centre (IBC)
An international business centre (IBC) regime has been launched to replace the previous regional operating headquarters (ROH), international headquarters (IHQ), and international trade centre (ITC) regimes.
The criteria for the establishment and operation of an IBC are as follows:
  * A Thai company incorporated for the purpose of providing management, technical, support, or treasury management services to its associated enterprises or for undertaking the ITC business.
  * Paid-up capital on the last day of each accounting period of at least THB 10 million.
  * Management, technical, support, or treasury management services are provided to its associated enterprises.
  * At least ten knowledgeable and skilled personnel working full time for the IBC or at least five if the IBC acts only as a treasury centre.
  * Expenses for the operation of the IBC paid to recipients in Thailand must be not less than THB 60 million in each accounting period.
  * Other rules, procedures, and conditions that will be prescribed by the Director-General of the Revenue Department.


Management, technical, and support services comprise the following:
  * General management, business planning, and business coordination.
  * Procurement of raw materials and parts.
  * Research and development of products.
  * Technical support.
  * Marketing and sales promotion.
  * Personnel management and training.
  * Financial advice.
  * Economic and investment analysis and research.
  * Credit control and management.
  * Other support services as prescribed by the Director-General of the Revenue Department.


Treasury management services comprise the following:
  * Treasury management of a treasury centre as permitted under the exchange control law.
  * Borrowing and lending in baht of a treasury centre as permitted under the exchange control law.


ITC means the international business of buying and selling goods, which may include the provision of services related to the goods purchased and sold. These services include the following:
  * Procurement of goods.
  * Storage of goods while awaiting delivery.
  * Packing and packaging.
  * Transportation of goods.
  * Insurance of goods.
  * Technical advice and services and product training.
  * The other services as prescribed by the Director-General of the Revenue Department.


Income of the IBC means the following:
  * Income from the provision of management, technical, support, or treasury management services to its associated enterprises.
  * Royalties from associated enterprises arising from a result of R&D carried out in Thailand by the IBC or other entities hired by the IBC, according to the rules, procedures, and conditions prescribed by the Director-General of the Revenue Department.


The following tax benefits are available for 15 accounting periods: 
  * Reduced rates of CIT on qualifying income: 
    * 8% if the IBC has incurred expenditure of at least THB 60 million paid to recipients in Thailand during the accounting period.
    * 5% if the IBC has incurred expenditure of at least THB 300 million paid to recipients in Thailand during the accounting period.
    * 3% if the IBC has incurred expenditure of at least THB 600 million paid to recipients in Thailand during the accounting period.
  * Exemption from tax on dividends derived by the IBC from its affiliates.
  * Exemption from WHT on dividends paid by the IBC to a non-resident company out of profits derived from qualified service income subject to the reduced rate of tax.
  * Exemption from WHT on interest paid by a treasury centre on borrowed funds that are re-lent to affiliates.
  * Exemption from specific business tax on income received by a treasury centre.
  * PIT rate of 15% for expatriate full time employees of the IBC and working for IBC or ITC businesses. If the company undertakes IBC or ITC business as well as other businesses, the revenue derived from the IBC or ITC or both these businesses must not be less than 70% of the company’s total revenue.


In comparison with the previous ROH/IHQ regimes, the IBC regime does not apply different tax rates to offshore and onshore income. As a consequence, there is no longer any requirement for services to be provided to a minimum number of offshore affiliates. There is also no limit to the amount of onshore income that qualifies for the reduced tax rates. The expenditure required to qualify for the reduced tax rates has been significantly increased. However, in the case where an existing ROH/IHQ converts to be an IBC, it can enjoy the reduced tax rate of 8% provided that it meets the original minimum expenditure requirement of THB 15 million. 
If an IBC does not meet the rules and conditions prescribed or does not otherwise qualify as an IBC in any accounting period, the benefits will be revoked on a year-by-year basis. If the company does not meet the conditions for more than one accounting period, or has none of the characteristics for operating as an IBC, the tax benefits will be terminated with effect from the first accounting period.
The taxable profit and loss of an IBC must be computed separately between the IBC and non-IBC businesses and between (i) headquarters and treasury management services, and (ii) royalties. Common expenses are to be allocated based on the proportion of revenue of the IBC and non-IBC businesses.
Tax losses must be maintained separately, as follows:
  * Headquarters and treasury management services.
  * Royalties.
  * Non-IBC business.


Tax returns must be filed separately for (i) headquarters and treasury management services, (ii) royalties, and (iii) non-IBC business.
## Foreign tax credit
A Thai company can use foreign tax paid on business income or dividends as a credit against its CIT liability. However, the credit cannot exceed the amount of Thai tax on the income.

The intergovernmental agreement (IGA) between the United States and Thailand regarding the US FATCA was signed on 4 March 2016.
The Director-General of the Revenue Department of Thailand, as the Competent Authority of Thailand, and the Competent Authority of the United States of America have signed the Competent Authority Arrangement (CAA) between the Kingdom of Thailand and the United States of America to support the implementation of the FATCA agreement. As a result, Thailand is now able to exchange information according to the FATCA agreement. Entities required to report can now report financial account information in accordance with the FATCA agreement through the International Data Exchange Service (IDES) from 27 June 2024.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
Thailand has joined the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes (Global Forum) under the OECD. This move aims to enhance transparency in international tax administration and prevent tax evasion or avoidance.
As part of this commitment, Thailand has signed the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information (MCAA CRS) and began the automatic exchange of financial account information according to the CRS in September 2023.

## Inventory valuation
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market price. Any recognised method of ascertaining the cost price may be used, but a change in the method may only be made with the prior approval of the Director-General of the Revenue Department.
## Capital gains
There is no specific legislation governing capital gains. Except as noted below, all capital gains earned by a Thai company are treated as ordinary revenue for tax purposes. Capital gains on the sale of investments derived from or in Thailand by a foreign company not carrying on business in Thailand are subject to a tax of 15%, withheld at source by the purchaser, unless otherwise exempt under a DTT.
The following gains earned by a foreign company not carrying on business in Thailand are also subject to 15% WHT:
  * Difference between the redemption price and the initial sale price of bonds issued by the government, state enterprises, and specified institutions.
  * Gains on the transfer of bonds issued by the government, state enterprises, and specified institutions.


Capital gains received by a Thai company and a foreign company carrying on business in Thailand from the sale of fund units in a fixed income mutual fund are exempt from tax. This is subject to the condition that the cost of the investment and expenses in relation to the exempt income are not claimed as tax deductible expenses.
## Dividend income
Dividends received by a company listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand from another Thai company are exempt from tax provided that the shares are held for at least three months before and three months after the dividend was received. 
Dividends received by a non-listed company from another Thai company are also exempt from tax provided that the company receiving the dividend holds at least 25% of the total shares with voting rights, without any direct or indirect cross-shareholding, and has held the shares for at least three months before and three months after the dividend was received. However, if the shares are held for this period but the 25% shareholding and cross-shareholding conditions are not met, only one-half of the dividend is exempt from tax. 
In the case of an amalgamation (merger) or an entire business transfer (EBT), the new or surviving company can include the period of ownership of any predecessor company that was part of the amalgamation or EBT when counting the above three-month period.
Dividends received from foreign investments are exempt from tax if the Thai company receiving the dividends holds at least 25% of the shares with voting rights of the company paying the dividends for a period of not less than six months before the date on which the dividend was received and the dividend was derived from the net profit in the foreign country taxed at a rate of not less than 15%. In the event that a ‘special law’ in a particular foreign country provides a reduced tax rate or exemption for the net profit, the limited company that receives the dividends is still eligible for the tax exemption.
The share of profits received by a Thai company or a foreign company carrying on business in Thailand from an unincorporated joint venture carrying on business in Thailand is exempt from tax.
In addition, the following profit sharing from mutual funds is exempt from tax:
  * Profit sharing received from a fixed income mutual fund by both Thai and non-Thai corporate investors. 


  * Profit sharing derived from an investment in other mutual funds established as juristic persons (excluding property funds) by a Thai company is exempt from tax (100% exemption for a listed company and 50% exemption for a non-listed company), provided that the Thai company has held the fund units for three months before and after the distribution of the profit sharing. 


### Stock dividends
Stock dividends are taxable to the recipient as ordinary income.
## Interest income
Interest is taxable as income on the accrual basis.
## Royalty income
Royalties are taxable as income on the accrual basis.
## Foreign income
Companies incorporated in Thailand are taxed on worldwide income. The foreign income received by a company incorporated in Thailand is taxable on the accrual basis. Double taxation is relieved by way of a credit against the tax chargeable in Thailand (_see Foreign tax credit in the section_).

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
Companies incorporated in Thailand are taxed on worldwide income. A company incorporated abroad (i.e. a company organised under foreign laws or a foreign company) is taxed on its profits arising from or in consequence of the business carried on in Thailand.
The corporate income tax (CIT) rate is 20%.
A foreign company not carrying on business in Thailand is subject to a final WHT on certain types of assessable income (e.g. interest, dividends, royalties, rentals, and service fees) paid from or in Thailand. The rate of tax is generally 15%, except for dividends, which is 10%, while other rates may apply under the provisions of a double tax treaty (DTT).
## Rates for companies with low paid-in capital and income
Companies and juristic partnerships with paid-in capital not exceeding 5 million Thai baht (THB) at the end of any accounting period and income from the sale of goods and/or the provision of services not exceeding THB 30 million are subject to tax at the following rates:
Net profit (THB) | Tax rate (%)  
---|---  
0 to 300,000 | 0  
300,001 to 3 million | 15  
Over 3 million | 20  
## Petroleum income tax
International oil companies can engage in exploration and production activities in Thailand under a concession, a production sharing contract, or a service contract.
Taxation on income from petroleum operations is imposed on petroleum concessionaire companies and production sharing producers by the Petroleum Income Tax Acts (PITA). Petroleum companies under a service contract are not taxed under the PITA but under the Revenue Code.
Companies taxed under the PITA are exempt from taxes and duties on income imposed under the Revenue Code and under any other laws. The exemption applies provided that the company pays taxes and duties on income subject to the PITA or on dividends paid out of income subject to the PITA.
Petroleum companies under a concession are taxed at the rate of 50% of their annual net profit from petroleum operations, including profit from the transfer of their concession interests and other activities incidental to the petroleum operations. Deductions are allowed for ‘ordinary and necessary’ business expenses, as well as depreciation of capital expenditure, petroleum royalties, and other charges. Certain types of expenses are specifically disallowed for deduction, including interest.
A production sharing producer is taxed at the rate of 20% of its annual net profit derived from its petroleum business, including profits derived from the transfer of interests in the nature of rights, annuity, or any other recurring income as a consequence thereof.
Petroleum companies subject to PITA, including companies that have entered into a production sharing contract, can adopt (with the permission of the Director-General) a foreign functional currency for preparing its accounting books and records and keep them in a foreign language. Where this is adopted, the foreign functional currency must be used when calculating the net profit subject to petroleum income tax.
## Local income taxes
There are no local government taxes on income in Thailand.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard rate of VAT is 10%, but the rate is currently reduced to 7% until 30 September 2025 (unless further extended by the government). VAT is levied on the sale of goods and the provision of services. Exports are zero-rated, while a number of goods and services are exempt (e.g. basic groceries, education, healthcare, interest, leasing of immovable property, sale of real estate).
Non-resident electronic service providers and electronic platform operators who receive income of more than THB 1.8 million per year from providing electronic services to non-VAT registered customers in Thailand must register for VAT, file VAT returns, and pay VAT (without deducting input tax) via the Revenue Department’s online system. These taxpayers are not required to issue tax invoices or prepare input tax reports. The following are the key conditions for VAT collection:
  * Digital services are provided from abroad.
  * Services are provided by electronic means and are used by a customer in Thailand.
  * The customer in Thailand is not a VAT registrant.


## Specific business tax
Specific business tax is collected at fixed rates on the gross revenue of certain businesses not subject to VAT, such as commercial banking, similar financial businesses, and the sale of immovable property, which are taxed at 3%, and life insurance, which is taxed at 2.5%.
The rate of specific business tax has been reduced to 0.01% for certain revenue derived by commercial banks and finance, securities, and credit foncier businesses, as well as businesses that have regular transactions similar to commercial banking.
An additional 10% of the tax is levied as municipality tax.
## Customs duties
### Basis of taxation
Customs duties are imposed under the Customs Act and the Customs Tariff Decree and are collected on both imports and a limited number of exports. Classification of imports is based on the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System (the so-called 'Harmonised System'). Thailand has adopted the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Harmonised Tariff Nomenclature (AHTN) 2022, which is based on the Harmonised System 2022, as its import tariff nomenclature. 
Duties are levied on a specific or an _ad valorem_ basis, whichever is higher, and the applied _ad valorem_ duties range between 0% and 80%. Exemptions from import duties are available on particular items of goods as prescribed in the Customs Tariff Decree. Preferential duty rates are available on imported goods from countries that have a preferential free trade agreement (FTA) with Thailand.
Currently, Thailand has FTAs with the following countries:
  * ASEAN member states (Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Brunei)
  * Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP, which includes ASEAN member states plus China, Korea, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand)
  * Australia
  * Chile
  * India
  * Japan
  * New Zealand
  * Peru


Also, as a member of ASEAN, Thailand has preferential trade agreements with the following countries:
  * Australia and New Zealand
  * China
  * Hong Kong
  * India
  * Japan
  * Korea


Generally, the value of imports is based on their cost, insurance, and freight (CIF), whereas exported goods are based on their free on board (FOB) amount.
Thailand has implemented the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Valuation Agreement. The primary basis for the customs value is the transaction value, which is the price actually paid or payable for the goods when sold for export, subject to adjustments for certain elements that are considered to form a part of the value for customs purposes or that can be deducted from the value of the imported goods (e.g. the cost of transportation after the importation, duties, and taxes associated with the import).
Elements that may need to be added include royalties and licence fees that are related to the goods and paid as a condition of sale, proceeds from subsequent resale in the importing country, and the value of goods or services supplied by the buyer, such as design or development fees related to the imported goods. If the declared price is evidently low or is unlikely to be the true value of the goods, Thai Customs will likely dispute the declared price.
### Customs controls and procedures
Customs procedures for goods arriving in Thailand in any manner are similar to those existing in most other countries. An importer is required to file an entry form together with other requisite documents, including a bill of lading, invoice, and packing list via the e-Customs system.
Customs duties are due upon the arrival of the vessel carrying the imported goods, and goods may be stored in a customs warehouse for up to 45 days with no submission of an import entry and 60 days in the case of submission of an import entry. Landing and storage charges must be paid before the goods are released.
### Customs incentives schemes
Various customs incentives schemes, each with its own specific conditions and duty privileges, are available, including the following:
  * Duty and tax compensation (tax coupons).
  * Duty drawback for imported raw materials used in export production (Section 29 of the Customs Act).
  * Duty drawback for re-export in the same state.
  * Free zones (Customs or Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand Free Zones).
  * Manufacturing bonded warehouses.
  * General bonded warehouses.
  * Board of Investment (BOI) promotion.
  * Preferential import duties under FTAs.


### Offences and penalties
Although, technically, an offence against the customs law is a criminal offence, in practice, legal procedures are usually concerned with the recovery of tax arrears and fines. Offences include non-compliance with customs procedures, false declarations, and the most serious offence of smuggling and evasion of customs duties. Statutory penalties are as prescribed by the relevant provisions of the Customs Act. Where Customs and the offender agree to settle the case at the Customs level (i.e. waiver of prosecution), the penalties would be in accordance with the settlement criteria as prescribed by the Director-General of the Customs Department. Currently, we understand that a duty evasion offence would typically be settled with a fine of from 50% to 200% based on the duty shortfall per the import entry. The VAT penalty would also be applied proportionally based on the duty fine. Duty and VAT surcharges (capped at the amount of the shortfall) are applied in this respect as well.
For import licensing errors, the settlement criteria would be the surrendering of the goods or a fine in lieu thereof based on the value of the goods. For offences related to smuggling, the penalties are based on a multiple of the value of the goods.
## Excise tax
### Basis of taxation
Excise tax (ET) is a form of consumption tax that is imposed on the sale of a selected range of services and goods (whether manufactured locally or imported) that are considered ‘luxuries and/or having environmental impacts’. The tax liability arises on locally manufactured goods when leaving the factory and at the time of importation for imported goods.
The excise tax calculation is based on both _ad valorem_ rates (a percentage of the suggested retail price [SRP]) and/or specific rates (based on the quantity or weight of the goods). The excise tax formula varies depending on type of excise taxable products, for example:
  * (SRP x ET rate) is applicable for motor vehicles, motorcycles, and cosmetic products.
  * (Specific rate x quantity) is applicable for petroleum oil products.
  * (SRP x ET rate) + (specific rate x quantity) is applicable for non-alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
  * (SRP x ET rate) + (specific rate x quantity x degree of pure alcohol) is applicable for alcoholic beverages.


### Taxable goods and services
Goods/services | Ad valorem rate (%) | Specific rate  
---|---|---  
Petroleum and petroleum products | 0 | THB 0 to THB 6.5 per litre or kilogram  
Certain non-alcoholic beverages | 0 to 14 | THB 0 to THB 44 per litre

In addition to the excise tax, an interior tax is also levied by the Excise Department at the rate of 10% of the excise tax payable. Other taxes, such as the health tax, Thai Public Broadcasting Service tax (TPBS tax or TV tax), and the elderly fund tax, may apply to certain specified products in the categories of cigarettes and alcoholic beverages.
The manufacturer of the products must file a return and remit the tax due prior to taking the goods from the factory or bonded warehouse. If a VAT liability arises before the goods are taken out of these locations, the manufacturer must file a return and remit the excise tax to the Excise Department within 15 days from the end of the month.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is levied on 28 different types of documents and instruments, including contracts for hire of work, loans, share transfers, leases of land or buildings, and insurance policies. The rate of stamp duty varies depending on the type of document but ranges from THB 1 per THB 1,000 of value on most contracts and agreements to a fixed amount per instrument on most commercial and other documents.
Most instruments subject to stamp duty that are in the form of e-instruments are required to be filed and have the stamp duty paid in cash via the Internet. In this case, the filing of the return and payment can be made before the execution of the instrument or within 15 days from the date following that on which the instrument was executed. 
Failure to pay the stamp duty and affix the stamps on a timely basis is subject to a surcharge ranging from 200% to 600% of the duty payable. Unstamped documents or instruments are not admissible as evidence in a civil lawsuit.

## Local taxes
### Land and building tax
An individual or juristic person who owns or possesses land or buildings is subject to the land and building tax. Condominium units and rafts are included within the definition of buildings.
The tax base is the value of the land, building, or condominium unit as appraised for the collection of fees by the relevant government authority for registrations under the Land Code.
The tax is levied on an annual (calendar year) basis, and the local municipal authority will send a tax assessment letter to the taxpayer before the end of February each year. The taxpayer must pay the tax so assessed before the end of April each year.
The statutory maximum tax rates range from 0.15% to 3%, depending on the purpose of use. However, the actual rates to be applied each year are published in a royal decree, although a municipal administrative body is empowered to prescribe tax rates higher than those published in the royal decree provided that the rates do not exceed the statutory maximum rates. 
### Signboard tax
Signboard tax is levied annually on certain commercial signs or billboards at varying rates according to the size and language used. There are higher rates imposed for text that moves or changes. The rates per 500 square centimetres are THB 5 to THB 10 if all words are in Thai, THB 26 to THB 52 if both Thai and foreign words are used, and THB 50 to THB 52 if only foreign words are used or if the Thai words are below the foreign words.
