## Taxable period
The tax year commences on 1 January and ends on 31 December.
## Tax returns
Enterprises are required to file and pay provisional income taxes on a monthly or quarterly basis within 15 days following the end of each month/quarter, and file and settle their annual income tax return within five months after the end of the tax year, together with an audit certificate of a registered public accountant in China. Information on related-party transactions must be filed with the annual income tax return.
## Payment of tax
Enterprises are required to file and pay provisional income taxes on a monthly or quarterly basis within 15 days following the end of each month/quarter.
Settlement of annual tax payment is due, in conjunction with the annual income tax return, within five months after the end of the tax year.
## Tax audit process
There is no fixed audit cycle in China. Tax audit targets are selected pursuant to certain criteria.
## Statute of limitations
For unintentional errors (e.g. calculation errors) committed by the taxpayer in its tax filing, the statute of limitation is three years and extended to five years if the amount of tax underpaid is CNY 100,000 or more. For special tax adjustments, such as transfer pricing adjustments, adjustments under CFC rules, adjustments under the general anti-avoidance rules, the statute of limitation is ten years. There is no statute of limitation for tax evasion, refusal to pay tax, or defrauding of tax payment.
## Recent focus of Chinese tax authorities
Since 2009, the Chinese tax authorities have strengthened their tax administration on transfer pricing and income derived by non-TREs. The STA has released a number of tax circulars addressing the tax administration of transfer pricing, foreign contractors and service providers, WHT on passive income, etc.
Under the CIT Law, non-TREs are subject to CIT on the capital gain derived from the disposal of equity investment in Chinese companies. In addition, the transfer has to be effected at fair value so that any gain shall be recognised for tax purpose at the time when the transaction takes places (unless the transaction qualifies for deferral tax treatment provided under the tax regulations). The Chinese tax authorities have, in recent years, challenged and clawed back CIT on several equity transfer cases whereby non-TREs disposed of their equity investment in China to related parties at cost or below 'fair value'. In addition, they have become more knowledgeable on valuation theories and methodologies and are applying them in reviewing valuation reports in order to ascertain the fair value of equity transfer transactions for tax purposes.
In addition, the Chinese tax authorities have geared up their efforts in recent years to scrutinise investment structures involving intermediate holding companies incorporated in low-tax jurisdictions. One of their focuses is on the indirect equity transfer of Chinese companies by non-TREs. The income derived by a non-TRE from the disposal of a non-Chinese company is not taxable under China’s domestic income tax law. However, if the Chinese tax authorities are of the view that the non-TRE transferor has used an abusive arrangement to indirectly transfer the equity of the Chinese company (i.e. interposing and disposing of the special purpose vehicle for no reasonable commercial purpose, but just for avoidance of China withholding income tax), it may re-characterise the equity transfer based on the 'substance over form' principle and disregard the existence of the special purpose vehicle. Once the special purpose vehicle is disregarded, the transfer would be effectively a transfer of the underlying Chinese company’s equity, and the transfer gain would be China source and subject to China withholding income tax. In early 2015, the STA issued a circular that sets out new guidance on the assessment of indirect transfer of China taxable properties by non-TREs. This guidance extends the scope to capture all ‘China taxable properties’, including not only equity investment in Chinese companies but also immovable properties located in China and assets of an establishment or place of a foreign company in China. It also provides clearer criteria on how to assess ‘reasonable commercial purpose’ and introduces ‘safe harbour’ scenarios.
The STA has also released circulars relating to the claiming of treaty benefits by non-TREs and interpretation of certain articles and terms in the tax treaties, such as dividends, royalties, beneficial ownership, etc. Aggressive tax planning (including, but not limited to, tax-avoidance and treaty-abusive arrangements) not supported by reasonable commercial purposes and substance will be subject to scrutiny by the Chinese tax authorities. Non-residents and their withholding agents are required to file certain prescribed forms and other supporting documents when performing tax filing to justify their claims for the tax treaty benefits. The tax position taken by the non-residents or withholding agents are subject to examination by the Chinese tax authorities after the tax filing.
The STA issued a Departmental Interpretation Note (DIN) in 2010 for the tax treaty concluded between China and Singapore. It is the first time the STA has introduced a set of technical views, interpretation, and practice guidelines for the implementation of a tax treaty in such a comprehensive manner. More importantly, this set of interpretation is also applicable to other tax treaties concluded by China if the provisions of the relevant articles in those tax treaties are the same as those in the China/Singapore tax treaty. Thus, it is likely to have a wide impact to tax residents of other countries/regions that have entered into tax treaties with China.
For transfer pricing investigation, increasing scrutiny has been imposed on outbound related-party remittance, such as service fees and royalty payments. Specifically, in addition to the arm’s-length nature of the service fees and royalty transactions, the Chinese tax authorities may also require taxpayers to demonstrate the commercial substance of the overseas service provider or intangible property owner. The Chinese tax authorities are also stringent on activities for the decision-making, monitoring, control, and compliance purposes of the group, and may challenge the service remittance for group finance, tax, human resources, and legal activities, which is different from common positions taken by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Another focus of the Chinese tax authorities in transfer pricing investigation is location-specific advantages (e.g. location saving of Chinese low-cost resources, market premium of Chinese market). As such, the Chinese tax authorities often expect a different transfer pricing policy in China, which will pose difficulties on multinational groups who implement a consistent transfer pricing policy around the world.
## General anti-avoidance rules (GAAR)
There is a GAAR provision in the CIT law allowing the Chinese tax authorities to make adjustments to taxable revenue or taxable income where business arrangements, structures, or transactions are entered into without reasonable commercial purpose and result in a reduction, exemption, or deferral of tax payment. The Chinese tax authorities may initiate a GAAR investigation if they suspect that an enterprise undertakes any of the following arrangements: abuse of preferential tax treatments, abuse of tax treaties, abuse of corporate structure, use of tax havens for tax avoidance purposes, or other arrangements that do not have a reasonable commercial purpose.
The STA released the Administrative Measures on GAAR in late 2014. The Administrative Measures provides comprehensive guidance on the implementation of GAAR, including elaboration on certain principles, adjustment methods, procedures throughout the GAAR life cycle, and relevant documentation requirements.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Enterprises established in China are always TREs. A foreign enterprise with a place of effective management in China is also regarded as a TRE.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
An 'establishment or place' is defined in the CIT regulations as an establishment or place in China engaging in production and business operations, including the following:
  * Management organisations, business organisations, and representative offices.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Generally, an enterprise is allowed to deduct reasonable expenditures that actually have been incurred and are related to the generation of income.
## Depreciation of fixed assets
Fixed assets with useful lives of more than 12 months must be capitalised and depreciated in accordance with the CIT regulations. Generally, depreciation is calculated by the straight-line method. Production-nature biological assets, such as livestock held for breeding and commercial timber, also have to be capitalised and depreciated using the straight-line method.
Under the straight-line method, the cost of an item, less its residual value, is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. Residual value should be reasonably determined based on the nature and usage of the asset. The CIT law provides minimum useful lives for the following assets:
Assets | Years  
---|---  
Buildings and structures | 20  
Aircraft, trains, vessels, machinery, mechanisms, and other production equipment | 10  
Appliances, tools, and furniture etc. related to production and business operations | 5  
Means of transport other than aircraft, trains, and vessels | 4  
Electronic equipment | 3  
Production-nature biological assets in the nature of forestry | 10  
Production-nature biological assets in the nature of livestock | 3  
Shorter tax depreciation life or accelerated depreciation is allowed for particular types of fixed assets (e.g. fixed assets that need to be replaced more frequently due to advancement of technology, fixed assets that suffer from constant vibration or severe corrosion).
New fixed assets acquired by companies engaging in manufacturing industries and new fixed assets and equipment acquired specifically for R&D purposes may be depreciated over a shorter period or under an accelerated depreciation method.
Where a shorter depreciation period method is applied, the minimum depreciation period cannot be less than 60% of the minimum depreciation period as prescribed in the CIT Law; where an accelerated depreciation method is applied, the double-declining-balance method or sum-of-years-digits method can be used.
The following capital expenditure may be expensed-off in one lump sum in the year of acquisition:
  * Newly acquired instruments and equipment for the purpose of R&D activities by all enterprises, with unit value not exceeding CNY 1 million, and newly acquired instruments and equipment used in both R&D and operating activities by small-scale and thin-profit manufacturing enterprises, with unit value not exceeding CNY 1 million may be expensed in one lump sum for CIT.
  * From 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2027, newly acquired fixed assets, other than real estate properties, with unit value not exceeding CNY 5 million may be expensed in one lump sum for CIT.
  * Newly acquired fixed assets (excluding real estate properties) and intangible assets by enterprises in Hainan (from 2020 to 2024) and Hengqin with unit value not exceeding CNY 5 million may be expensed in one lump sum for CIT.


## Amortisation of intangibles and goodwill
A deduction is allowed for amortisation of intangible assets, such as, but not limited to, patents, trademarks, copyrights, and land-use rights. Generally, intangible assets have to be amortised over a period of not less than ten years. For an intangible asset obtained through capital contribution or assignment, it can be amortised according to the useful life prescribed in the laws or agreed in the contracts, if any. However, acquired goodwill is not deductible until the invested enterprise is entirely transferred or liquidated.
## Organisational and start-up expenses
Organisational and start-up expenses are tax deductible fully in the first year of operation.
## Research and development (R&D) expense
From 1 January 2023, 200% of the eligible R&D expenses incurred by enterprises are tax-deductible. For R&D expenses that have formed intangible assets, the tax amortisation shall be based on 200% of the cost of the intangible assets.
From 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2027, 220% of the eligible R&D expenses incurred by integrated circuit enterprises and enterprises manufacturing industrial mother machines are tax-deductible. For R&D expenses that have formed intangible assets, the tax amortisation shall be based on 220% of the cost of the intangible assets.
From 1 January 2022, 200% of funds contributed by enterprises to non-profit scientific and technological R&D institutions, higher education institutions, or governmental natural science funds for basic research purposes are deductible.
## Asset loss
Asset loss (including bad debt loss) may be deductible in the tax year during which such loss is incurred, provided that supporting documents are maintained for inspection by the in-charge tax bureau.
## Interest expenses
Interest on loans generally is tax-deductible. For interest expenses on borrowings from non-financial institutions by a non-financial institution, the portion that does not exceed the commercial rate is deductible. The tax deduction of interest paid to related parties is subject to the thin capitalisation rule under the CIT law (_see the section for more information_).
## Reserves and provisions
Provisions for asset impairment reserves (e.g. bad debt provisions) and risk reserves generally are not tax-deductible unless otherwise prescribed in the tax rules. Financial institutions and insurance companies may deduct certain provisions and reserves, subject to the caps specified in the relevant tax circulars.
## Contingent liabilities
The CIT law does not specifically address the deductibility of contingent liabilities. According to the general principle of the CIT law, contingent liabilities are liabilities that an enterprise has not actually incurred and thus shall not be tax-deductible.
## Charitable donations
Charitable donations are tax-deductible at up to 12% of the annual accounting profit, and any excess amount in the current year can be carried forward and deductible in the following three years. From 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2025, donation for poverty alleviation purpose to targeted poverty-stricken areas can be fully deducted. Non-charitable donations, as well as sponsorship expenditures that are non-advertising and non-charitable in nature, are not deductible.
## Wages and staff welfare expenses
Reasonable wages and salaries of employees incurred by an enterprise are tax-deductible. Directors’ fees are also tax-deductible. As an incentive to encourage the hiring of handicapped people, 200% of the actual salary expenses paid to handicapped staff are deductible.
Basic social security contributions, including basic pension insurance, basic medical insurance, unemployment insurance, injury insurance, maternity insurance, and housing funds, that are made by an enterprise in accordance with the scope and criteria as prescribed by the state or provincial governments are deductible.
Commercial insurance premiums paid for investors or employees shall not be tax-deductible unless they are paid for safety insurance for workers conducting special types of work.
Staff welfare expenses, labour union fees, and staff education expenses are tax-deductible at up to 14%, 2%, and 8% of the total salary expenses, respectively.
## Entertainment expenses
Entertainment expenses are tax-deductible up to the lesser of 60% of the costs actually incurred and 0.5% of the sales or business income of that year. The excess amount must not be carried forward to and deducted in the following tax years.
## Advertising expenses and business promotion expenses
Advertising expenses and business promotion expenses are deductible at up to 15% (30% for certain enterprises in the cosmetics, medicine, and beverage industries) of the sales (business) income of that year unless otherwise prescribed in the tax regulations. Any excess amount is allowed to be carried forward and deductible in the following tax years. Advertising expenses and business promotion expenses incurred by the tobacco industry are entirely not tax-deductible.
## Fines and penalties
Fines, penalties, and losses arising from confiscation of property are not deductible for CIT purposes.
## Taxes
CIT payments and surcharges that are imposed on overdue taxes are not deductible for CIT purposes.
## Net operating losses
Generally, tax losses can be carried forward for no longer than five years starting from the year subsequent to the year in which the loss was incurred. Loss carryback is not permitted.
Tax loss can be carried forward for ten years for enterprises in the following industries:
  * High/new tech enterprises (HNTEs).
  * Small and medium-sized technology enterprises (technological SMEs).
  * Qualified integrated circuit production enterprises with a line-width less than 130 nanometres (inclusive).


From 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2026, tax loss can be carried forward for 13 years for HNTEs or technological SMEs registered in Nansha of Guangzhou, provided that the HNTE or technological SME is engaged in the high-tech key industries in the Catalogue for CIT Preferential Treatments of Nansha.
## Payments to affiliates
Management fees for stewardship are not deductible, but services fees paid for genuine services provided by affiliates in China or overseas and charged at arm’s length should be deductible. Other payments to affiliates, such as royalties, are also tax-deductible, provided that the charges are at arm’s length.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Group taxation is not permitted under the CIT law unless otherwise prescribed by the State Council.
## Transfer pricing
All enterprises are required to conduct transactions with related parties on an arm’s-length basis. The Chinese tax authorities are empowered to make adjustments to transactions between related parties that are not conducted at arm’s length and result in the reduction of taxable income of the enterprise or its related parties using the following appropriate methods: comparable uncontrolled price method, resale price method, cost plus method, transactional net margin method, profit split method, and other methods (e.g. cost approach, market approach, income approach) that are consistent with the arm’s-length principle. In June 2016, the State Taxation Administration (STA) issued a circular that imposed new transfer pricing compliance requirements in China, including annual reporting forms for related-party transactions (RPT forms), country-by-country (CbC) reporting, and transfer pricing documentation, all of which contain substantial changes to the previous rules. Specifically, the transfer pricing documentation requirement has adopted a three-tiered approach, including a master file, local file, and special issue file (i.e. cost sharing agreement special issue file and thin capitalisation special issue file).
The STA also issued a revised circular on advance pricing arrangements (APAs) in October 2016, which provides process and requirements for an enterprise to apply for an APA as well as the situations where an APA application will be prioritised or declined.
The STA issued a circular in March 2017 to renew the Chinese rules on the procedures of transfer pricing investigation and mutual agreement procedures (MAPs). This circular empowers the Chinese tax authorities to collect financial information of overseas related parties under the transfer pricing audit for value chain purpose. In addition, this circular reiterates and reinforces the Chinese tax authorities’ focus on outbound related-party remittance, such as service fees and royalty payments (_see Recent focus of Chinese tax authorities in the section for details_).
The CIT law also contains a few tax avoidance rules, such as a thin capitalisation rule (_see below_), a CFC rule (_see below_), and general anti-avoidance rules (GAAR) (_see the section_).
## Thin capitalisation
The CIT law has a thin capitalisation rule disallowing interest expense arising from excessive related-party loans. The safe harbour debt/equity ratio for enterprises in the financial industry is 5:1 and for enterprises in other industries is 2:1. However, if there is sufficient evidence (e.g. a thin capitalisation special issue file) to show that the financing arrangement is at arm’s length, these interests may still be fully deductible even if the ratios are exceeded.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Under the CFC rule, the undistributed profits of CFCs located in low-tax jurisdictions with an effective income tax rate of less than 12.5% may be taxed as a deemed distribution to the TRE shareholders. The Chinese tax authorities have published a list of countries (i.e. a 'white list') that they do not regard to be low-tax jurisdictions.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Under the CIT law, a branch of a non-TRE in China is taxed at the branch level. If there is more than one branch, they can select its main office in China to conduct consolidated CIT filing, which requires the overall tax payable to be calculated and adjusted on a consolidated basis but with tax payment settled separately at the respective branches’ locations.


# China, People's Republic of
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
The CIT law adopts the ‘Predominantly Industry-oriented, Limited Geography-based’ tax incentive policy. Key emphasis is placed on ‘industry-oriented’ incentives aiming at directing investments into those industry sectors and projects encouraged and supported by the state. The tax incentive policies mainly include the following and are applicable to both domestic and foreign investments.
## Tax reduction and exemption
CIT may be reduced or exempted on income derived from the following projects:

From 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2030, newly established encouraged enterprises in the Kashgar Special Economic Zone and Horgos Special Economic Zone | Exemption for 5 years | Starting from the first income-generating year  
Notes
  1. ‘2 + 3 years tax holiday’ refers to two years of exemption from CIT followed by three years of 50% reduction of CIT.
  2. ‘3 + 3 years tax holiday’ refers to three years of exemption plus three years of 50% reduction of CIT.
  3. ‘5 + 5 years tax holiday’ refers to five years of exemption plus five years of 50% reduction of CIT.
  4. Certified animation enterprises that produce self-developed animation products are eligible to enjoy the same CIT incentives as encouraged software enterprises.


For income derived from the transfer of qualified technology in a tax year, the portion that does not exceed CNY 5 million shall be exempted from CIT and the portion that exceeds CNY 5 million shall be allowed a 50% reduction of CIT.
A CIT exemption applies to the dividend derived by a TRE from the direct investment into another TRE, except where the dividend is from stocks publicly traded on the stock exchanges and the holding period is less than 12 months.
A CIT exemption also applies to the income derived by recognised non-profit-making organisations engaging in non-profit-making activities.
## Reduced tax rate
The CIT rate may be reduced under certain conditions for different industries (_see the section for more information_).
## Reduction of revenue
Where an enterprise uses resources specified by the state as its major raw materials to produce non-restricted and non-prohibited products, only 90% of the income derived is taxable.
## Offset of certain venture capital investment
For a venture capital enterprise that makes an equity investment in a non-listed small to medium-sized new/high tech enterprise or a start-up technology enterprise for more than two years, 70% of its investment amount may be used to offset against the taxable income of the venture capital enterprise in the year after the holding period has reached two years. Any portion that is not utilised in that year can be carried forward and deducted in the following years. A Chinese corporate partner of a venture capital in the form of a limited partnership is also eligible for such incentive.
## Investment tax credit
Enterprises purchasing and using equipment specified by the state for environmental protection, energy and water conservation, or production safety purposes are eligible for a tax credit of 10% of the investment in such equipment. Any unutilised amount can be carried forward and creditable in the following five years.
## Other incentives
There are also tax incentives in relation to the deduction of expenses and cost (e.g. additional R&D deduction, shorter tax depreciation period, and accelerated depreciation). _See the section for more information_.
## Foreign tax credit
A TRE is allowed to claim foreign tax credit in relation to foreign income tax already paid overseas in respect of income derived from sources outside China on a country-basket basis or under the comprehensive method. The creditable foreign tax also includes foreign income tax paid by qualified CFCs. However, the creditable amount may not exceed the amount of income tax otherwise payable in China in respect of the foreign-sourced income. In addition, there is a five-year carryforward period for any unutilised foreign tax.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Non-TREs without establishments or places of business in China shall be subject to a WHT at 10% on gross income from dividends, interest, lease of property, royalties, and other China-source passive income unless reduced under a tax treaty.
If a non-TRE shareholder uses dividends distributed from a China TRE to make direct investment into China or acquire a China TRE from third parties, the non-TRE shareholder is eligible for WHT deferral treatment on the dividends, provided that certain conditions are met. The non-TRE shareholder shall report and settle the deferred tax if it later recoups the investment through equity transfer, equity buyback, liquidation of the China TRE, etc.
Dividends distributed by a foreign investment enterprise out of its pre-2008 profit to non-TRE shareholders are still exempted from WHT.
WHT rates under China’s tax treaties with other countries/nations are as follows (as of 31 December 2024):

# China, People's Republic of
## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
## Choice of business entity
According to the Foreign Investment Law of the People’s Republic of China and its detailed implementation rules, from 1 January 2020, foreign investors (including foreign individuals, enterprises, and other organisations) may directly or indirectly invest in China. Foreign investors shall assess whether their investment projects are restricted, prohibited, or encouraged in China before they make the investment decisions. Foreign companies, enterprises, or individuals may establish foreign-invested enterprises, partnerships, or representative offices in China. Certain foreign financial institutions, including banks and insurance companies, may, subject to approval, set up branches in China. For certain foreign invested industries and projects, approval is needed from the relevant Chinese government authorities.
## Exchange controls
Foreign exchange transactions are administered by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) and its branches. The regulatory administration on foreign exchange transactions of an enterprise depends on whether the transaction is a current account item or a capital account item. Current account items refer to ordinary transactions within the context of international receipts and payments, including, but not limited to, balance of payments from trade, labour services, and unilateral transfers. Capital account items refer to items of increase or decrease in debt and equity due to inflow or outflow of capital within the context of international receipts and payments, including, but not limited to, direct investment, all forms of loans, and investment in securities. Generally, a payment that falls under the category of a current account may be remitted overseas if supported with proper contracts, invoices, and tax payment/exemption certificates. In the past, most of the transactions under the category of capital account items had to be approved by the SAFE. Since the end of 2012, the SAFE has relaxed the administration of certain capital account items so that approval is no longer needed for a few types of transactions.
## Intellectual properties
Patents, trademarks, and copyrights are governed by separate laws and administered by separate governmental bodies. The government encourages the development and transfer of intellectual properties. The transfer of qualified technology and qualified technical services are exempted from VAT.
## Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activities
Both Chinese domestic and foreign investors increasingly are using M&A transactions to establish or expand their Chinese operations.
The MoF and the STA jointly released several circulars that address the CIT treatment for six forms of restructuring transactions, namely, change in legal form, debt restructuring, equity acquisition, assets acquisition, merger, and spin-off. The general principle is that enterprises undergoing corporate restructuring should recognise the gain/loss from the transfer of relevant assets/equity at fair value when the transaction takes place. However, if certain prescribed conditions are satisfied, the parties involved could opt for special tax treatments, which are essentially tax deferral tax treatment. In other words, recognition of gain/loss of the transferor from transfer of assets/equity can be deferred with respect to the equity-payment portion; and the transferee may take over the transferor’s tax basis of the acquired assets/equity. Such special tax treatments are only available to a very few specific types of cross-border transactions.
## Development of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) in China
In late June 2014, the Chinese government reached an agreement in substance with the United States (US) on the terms of a Model 1 Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA). However, as of 31 December 2024, the China-US IGA has not been signed, and the financial institutions in China have not started implementing FATCA.
## Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) and the Multilateral Instrument (MLI)
China has been actively involved in the BEPS project as a partner of the OECD and one of the G20 members. After the final reports on all the 15 action plans were endorsed in 2015, China has implemented and localised the BEPS action plans on a needed basis.
China imposed new transfer pricing compliance requirements, including annual reporting forms for related-party transactions (RPT forms), country-by-country (CbC) reporting, and transfer pricing documentation, all of which contain substantial changes to the previous rules.
China entered into the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) for the Automatic Exchange of Country-by-Country Reports in 2016. 
China also entered into the Multilateral Instrument (MLI) in June 2017, and, on 25 May 2022, China ratified the MLI and deposited its instrument of ratification to the OECD. For Mainland China, the MLI has taken effect from 1 September 2022. Some important positions of China in relation to the articles in the MLI are as follows:
  * Covered tax agreement: China puts all of its existing tax treaties (excluding China’s three tax arrangements with Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan) into the covered agreement, except for eight effective tax treaties with Angola, Argentina, Chile, Republic of Congo, India, New Zealand, Rwanda, and Spain, as well as one not-yet-effective tax treaty with Kenya.
  * Hybrid mismatches: The MLI requires that the competent authorities of the contracting jurisdictions shall consider the place of effective management, the place where it is incorporated or otherwise constituted, and any other relevant factors, and endeavour to determine by mutual agreement the entity’s tax residence. China has adopted this provision.
  * Treaty abuse: China adopts the principle purpose test (PPT) provision but does not adopt the simplified limitation of benefits (LOB) test. The threshold period for enjoying treaty benefit on capital gain from the transfer of property-rich companies is three years instead of the one-year period provided in the MLI.
  * China opts out of all the provisions in the avoidance of PE section and the arbitration clause for MAPs.


## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
China entered into the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information. In May 2017, the relevant Chinese authorities jointly issued the Administrative Measures on Due Diligence Procedures for Non-residents’ Financial Account Information in Tax Matters (the Measures) to implement CRS in China. Financial institutions established in China are required to carry out due diligence procedures on financial accounts starting from 1 July 2017. China completed the exchange of the first round of financial account information by September 2018.


# China, People's Republic of
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Taxable income is defined as ‘gross income in a tax year after deduction of non-taxable income, tax exempt income, various deductions, and allowable losses brought forward from previous years’. The accrual method of accounting should be used.
Gross income refers to monetary and non-monetary income derived by an enterprise from various sources, including, but not limited to, the sales of goods, provision of services, transfer of property, dividends, interest, rentals, royalties, and donations.
Non-taxable income refers to fiscal appropriation, governmental administration charges, governmental funds, and other income specified by the central government.
## Inventory valuation
Inventory must be valued according to costs. In computing the cost of inventories, the enterprise may choose one of the following methods: first in first out (FIFO), weighted average, or specific identification.
## Unrealised gain or loss due to changes in fair value
An unrealised gain or loss due to changes in the fair value of financial assets, financial liabilities, and investment properties held by an enterprise is not taxable/deductible for CIT purpose. The gain/loss is taxable/deductible only when the asset/liability actually is disposed of or realised.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are treated in the same way as ordinary income of a revenue-nature for a TRE.
## Dividend income
An exemption exists for CIT on dividend derived by a TRE from the direct investment into another TRE except for where the dividend is from stocks publicly traded on the stock exchanges and the holding period is less than 12 months.
Dividends derived by a non-TRE from China are subject to a 10% withholding tax (WHT). Starting from 1 January 2018, if a non-TRE shareholder uses dividends distributed from a China TRE to make direct investment into China or acquire another China TRE from third parties, the non-TRE shareholder is eligible for WHT deferral treatment on the dividends, provided that certain conditions are met. The non-TRE shareholder shall report and settle the deferred tax if it later recoups the investment through equity transfer, equity buyback, liquidation of the China TRE being invested, etc.
Dividends distributed by a foreign investment enterprise out of its pre-2008 profit to its non-TRE shareholder(s) are exempted from WHT.
## Interest income
Interest income is treated as ordinary income.
## Rental income
Rental income is treated as ordinary income.
## Royalty income
Royalty income is treated as ordinary income.
## Partnership income
Partnerships registered in China are not subject to CIT. The income of a partnership is taxable at the partners’ level.
## Unrealised exchange gains
Unrealised exchange gain (loss) from the year-end translation of assets (liabilities) denominated in foreign currency generally is taxable (deductible).
## Foreign income
The worldwide income of a TRE and its branches both within and outside China is taxable. There are no provisions in the CIT law that allow foreign income directly earned by the TRE to be deferred for tax purposes. The CIT law contains a controlled foreign company (CFC) rule under which the unremitted earnings of a foreign company controlled by Chinese enterprises may be taxable in China (_see the section for more information_). A foreign tax credit is allowed for foreign income taxes paid on foreign-source income.
Enterprises engaged in tourism, modern service, and high-tech industries in the Hainan Free Trade Port (from 2020 to 2024) and Hengqin are exempted from CIT on the income generated by new overseas direct investment.

The VAT refund rate for exported services is the same as the applicable VAT rate. For exported goods, the VAT refund rates range from 0% to 13%. There is a prescribed formula for determining the amount of refund, under which full refund of input VAT is not available to many exported goods and the exporter will suffer different degrees of export VAT costs.
In addition, certain taxable activities, including a few types of sale of goods, services, and cross-border transactions, are applicable to the VAT exemption treatment. In that respect, the relevant input VAT incurred cannot be credited or refunded.

Import and export customs duty is levied on goods that are allowed to be imported into or exported based on the relevant customs regulations. The Consignee of imported goods, consignor of export goods, and owner of entry articles are parties held liable for paying customs duties.
The customs classification of import and export goods is the base for the customs supervision, customs taxation, and customs statistics. In 2022, along with the revisions of the classified catalogue in ‘International Convention for Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System’ made by World Customs Organisation (WCO), large scale adjustments have been made to China’s import and export tariff system.
Import duty is charged in _ad valorem_ , specific, compound, or sliding terms, etc. _Ad valorem_ duty is charged based on the customs valuation of the goods. The dutiable value of the goods is multiplied by an _ad valorem_ duty rate to arrive at the amount of duty payable. Duty collection on an _ad valorem_ basis is the main taxation measure used by most countries, including China. The dutiable value of import and export goods is the taxable value determined by the Customs to levy _ad valorem_ duties on the import and export goods, which is the base to value and levy customs duties payable of import and export goods and import links taxes payable of the import goods.
Import duties are categorised as normal tariff rate, Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariff rate, contractual tariff rate, preferential tariff rate, tariff-rate quota (TRQ) rate, and temporary tariff rate.
The Country of Origin of imported goods also plays a part in determining the applicability of a number of other trade policies, such as TRQ, preferential tariffs, anti-dumping duty, anti-subsidy duty, etc.
Import and export goods are reduced with or exempted from customs duties, import VAT, and consumption tax according to state regulations.
The importation of raw materials under processing trade is bonded, and customs duty, import VAT, and consumption tax exemption is allowed on the part to be re-exported after processing.
