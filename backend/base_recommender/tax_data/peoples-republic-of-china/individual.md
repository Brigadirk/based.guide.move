## Foreign tax relief
Foreign taxes paid on non-China-source income may be claimed as a credit on the China tax return, but only to the extent of the IIT payable on the same category of income derived from the same country. Unused excess credits are non-refundable and can only be carried forward for a maximum of five years. Documentary evidence of the tax payment (e.g. tax payment certificate, tax clearance certificate) to substantiate claims of foreign tax credits is required by the Chinese tax authorities.
## Tax treaties
As of 31 December 2024, China has concluded tax treaties/arrangements with 114 countries/regions.
As of 31 December 2024, China has signed tax information exchange agreements with Argentina, Bahamas, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey, Liechtenstein, and San Marino.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Residents are generally subject to China individual income tax (IIT) on their worldwide income. Non-residents are generally taxed in China on their China-source income only (_see the section for more information_).
An individual is taxed in China on one's income by category. China's IIT law groups personal income into 9 categories.
The 9 categories of income are:
  1. Employment income (i.e. wages and salaries). 
  2. Remuneration for labour services. 
  3. Author's remuneration. 
  4. Royalties. 
  5. Business income. 
  6. Interest, dividends, and profit distribution. 
  7. Rental income. 
  8. Income from transfer of property. 
  9. Incidental income. 


Each income category has its own tax rate(s), allowable deductions, etc.
For residents, employment income, remuneration for labour services, author’s remuneration, and royalties are combined as 'comprehensive income' for aggregate tax calculation purpose on an annual basis. Income from the other categories is taxed separately by category on a monthly or transaction basis.
For non-residents, income from each of the 9 categories is taxed separately on a monthly or transaction basis.
## Personal income tax rates
### Comprehensive income tax rates
For residents, calculation of IIT on annual comprehensive income is based on progressive tax rates (_see Table I below_) using the following formula:
(Annual taxable income x Tax rate) - Quick deduction
#### Table I
Annual taxable income (CNY*) (1) | Tax rate (%) | Quick deduction (CNY)  
---|---|---  
0 to 36,000 | 3 | 0  
Over 36,000 to 144,000 | 10 | 2,520  
Over 144,000 to 300,000 | 20 | 16,920  
Over 300,000 to 420,000 | 25 | 31,920  
Over 420,000 to 660,000 | 30 | 52,920  
Over 660,000 to 960,000 | 35 | 85,920  
Over 960,000 | 45 | 181,920  
* renminbi
Notes
  1. Annual taxable income after deducting the standard basic deduction, specific deductions, specific additional deductions, and other allowable deductions (_see the section for more information_). 


For non-residents, IIT on employment income, remuneration for labour services, author’s remuneration, and royalties is calculated by each category on a monthly or transaction basis at the below progressive tax rates (_see Table II below_).
#### Table II
Monthly taxable income (CNY) | Tax rate (%) | Quick deduction (CNY)  
---|---|---  
0 to 3,000 | 3 | 0  
Over 3,000 to 12,000 | 10 | 210  
Over 12,000 to 25,000 | 20 | 1,410  
Over 25,000 to 35,000 | 25 | 2,660  
Over 35,000 to 55,000 | 30 | 4,410  
Over 55,000 to 80,000 | 35 | 7,160  
Over 80,000 | 45 | 15,160  
### Business income tax rates
Income earned by individuals from privately-owned businesses, sole proprietorship enterprises, or partnerships is generally subject to IIT at progressive rates from 5% to 35%, as follows:
Annual taxable income (CNY) | Tax rate (%)  
---|---  
0 to 30,000 | 5  
Over 30,000 to 90,000 | 10  
Over 90,000 to 300,000 | 20  
Over 300,000 to 500,000 | 30  
Over 500,000 | 35  
### Tax rates for other personal income
A flat rate of 20% is applied on the remaining categories of income, including incidental income, rental income, interest income, dividends, and capital gains, unless specifically reduced by the State Council.
## Local income taxes
There are no local taxes on personal income in China.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
## Taxable period
China's tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December, but tax filing is generally administered on a monthly basis.
## Tax returns
For employment income, the employer is obligated to file the provisional or final withholding IIT returns with its tax authority on a monthly basis.
For other categories of income, the tax return, either provisional or final, has to be filed on a monthly, annual, or transaction basis, depending on the specific circumstances.
Certain types of residents must file an annual reconciliation tax return on comprehensive income (_see Withholding requirements below for more information_). The filing period for the annual reconciliation tax return is between 1 March and 30 June of the following year.
There is no joint tax return in China. Husbands and wives are assessed and taxed separately.
Tax returns must be filed on a timely basis. Extensions to file may be granted under 'special circumstances' only.
## Withholding requirements
The payer of income is usually obligated to withhold the IIT payable upon payment of taxable income to the payee. Where the payer fails to withhold the full amount of IIT payable, it is the payee who is ultimately liable for the IIT payable and responsible for filing of the tax return and settling the IIT payable with the tax authority.
### Provisional tax withholding on comprehensive income paid to residents
The payer of employment income, remuneration for labour services, author’s remuneration, and royalties made to residents is generally obligated to perform provisional tax withholding on such income by adopting the required withholding method.
#### Employment income
Monthly provisional tax withholding amount is calculated on an accumulative basis with the annual tax table on comprehensive income (_see Table I in the section_). Eligible personal deductions are generally allowed (accumulative monthly amount) in calculating the monthly provisional withholding tax.
The taxpayer can also choose to claim specific additional deductions on one's own through the annual reconciliation tax filing instead of having them included in the monthly provisional withholding tax calculation by the employer.
#### Remuneration for labour services, author’s remuneration, and royalties
Provisional tax withholding on the above income paid to residents is calculated on a monthly or transaction basis. The following deductions are allowed when calculating the taxable income for provisional tax withholding purpose:
  * If the gross receipt is not more than CNY 4,000, a deduction of CNY 800 is allowed.
  * If the gross receipt exceeds CNY 4,000, a deduction of 20% is allowed.
  * A further deduction of 30% is allowable for author’s remuneration.


Provisional tax at a flat rate of 20% should be withheld from the taxable income of author’s remuneration and royalties.
For income derived from labour services, provisional tax is calculated and withheld based on progressive tax rates ranging from 20% to 40% as below:
Taxable labour service income (CNY) | Provisional withholding tax rate (%)  
---|---  
0 to 20,000 | 20  
Over 20,000 to 50,000 | 30  
Over 50,000 | 40  
### Actual tax withholding on employment income, remuneration for labour services, author’s remuneration, and royalties paid to non-residents
Payer of employment income, remuneration for labour services, author’s remuneration, and royalties made to non-residents is generally obligated to withhold IIT by each income category on a monthly or transaction basis at the progressive tax rates in Table II (_see Table II in the section_). Such tax withholding is considered actual and final.
### Self-reporting requirement
The following types of individuals are obligated to self-report their income to the tax authorities:
  * A resident who derives comprehensive income and is required to perform an annual reconciliation tax filing.
  * An individual who derives taxable income on which the withholding agent does not perform tax withholding and filing.
  * An individual who derives income from outside China.
  * An individual who derives taxable income but does not have a withholding agent.
  * A non-resident who derives employment income from two or more sources within China.
  * An individual who applies to de-register Chinese household due to emigration.


Residents deriving comprehensive income are generally required to file an annual reconciliation tax return in case of the following:
  * A resident who derives comprehensive income from two or more sources with an annual amount exceeding the total of the standard basic deduction (i.e. CNY 60,000) and the specific deductions.
  * A resident who derives remuneration for labour services, author’s remuneration, and/or royalties and whose annual comprehensive income exceeds the total of the standard basic deduction (i.e. CNY 60,000) and the specific deductions.
  * A resident whose provisional tax withheld from comprehensive income is below the final tax payable thereon.
  * A resident who claims tax refund on comprehensive income.


For the tax years 2019 to 2027, residents whose annual comprehensive income or IIT underpaid on comprehensive income is less than the stipulated threshold can be exempted from the annual reconciliation tax filing if the withholding agents have fulfilled their responsibility of withholding the correct amount of IIT. The stipulated threshold is annual comprehensive income not exceeding CNY 120,000 or IIT underpaid not more than CNY 400.
## Payment of tax
Generally, the withholding IIT return should be filed and IIT payable should be settled by the 15th day of the month following the income receiving month.
For employment income, the employer is obligated to withhold and settle the IIT payable generally within 15 days after the end of each month.
A surcharge of 0.05% per day for all taxes, including IIT, will be assessed on delinquent payments, pursuant to the China Tax Administration and Collection Law.
## Audit cycle
There is no fixed audit cycle in China. Tax audit targets are selected pursuant to certain criteria.
## Statute of limitations
For unintentional errors (e.g. calculation errors) committed by the taxpayer/tax withholding agent in the tax filing, the statute of limitations is three years and extended to five years if the amount of tax underpaid is CNY 100,000 or more. There is no statute of limitations for tax evasion, refusal to pay tax, or defrauding of tax payment.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
  * Non-employment income derived by individuals with real estate investment, mining resources investment, private equity, and investment through trust.
  * Tax compliance in fast developing industries, such as live-streaming platforms, and key areas, such as share transfer by high-income or high-net-worth individuals.
  * Employment income (including share-based incentives) derived by individuals in high-income industries.
  * Reconciliation of staff expenses with IIT withholding for employers in high-income industries.
  * Tax evasion via illegal offsetting of employment income by _fapiaos_ (receipts), such as non-taxable fringe benefits for foreign employees that are not properly implemented.
  * Enhancing the database of foreigners' earnings by country, industry, and grade for detection of cases of under-reporting.
  * More effectively use of the information exchange provision in the income tax treaties to recover IIT on offshore income earned by those individuals who are subject to IIT on their worldwide income.
  * Reviewing IIT compliance in relation to deemed permanent establishment/fixed base in order to detect abuse of tax treaty benefits by foreign individuals.

## Personal deductions from employment income for non-residents
When calculating taxable employment income for non-residents, IIT law only allows the standard basic deduction of CNY 5,000 per month.
## Charitable contributions
If an individual makes charitable contributions to qualified domestic non-profit organisations, such contributions are generally deductible to the extent of 30% of one's taxable income reported. This deduction is applicable to all categories of income.
## Remuneration for labour services, author's remuneration, and royalties
A deduction equal to 20% of the gross receipt is allowed when determining the income from labour services, author's remuneration, and royalties. A further deduction of 30% is allowable for author’s remuneration.
## Rental income
The following deductions are provided for rental income:
  * If the amount received in a month is not more than CNY 4,000, a deduction of CNY 800 is allowed.
  * If the amount received in a month exceeds CNY 4,000, a deduction equal to 20% of the gross receipt is allowed.


## Business deductions
There are specific and complex tax rules to address the deductions available for income derived from the operation of privately-owned businesses, sole proprietorship enterprises, and partnerships. Certain deduction caps are similar to those applicable to companies that are subject to corporate income tax.
In addition, for individuals who derive both comprehensive income and business income during the tax year, the standard basic deduction of CNY 60,000, specific deductions, specific additional deductions, and other allowable deductions (i.e. personal deductions applicable to comprehensive income) are allowed to be deducted from either income category provided that no double deduction is claimed.
## Income from the transfer of property (capital gain)
For sales of property, the original cost of the property and reasonable expenses incurred are deductible from the sales proceeds to arrive at the taxable income.
## Losses
Generally, capital losses are not allowed to be set off against other income or carried forward to other years.
Losses from privately-owned business and sole proprietorship enterprise can be carried forward for five years.

## Treatment of partnerships
Partnerships established in China are not taxable entities. The income of a partnership is taxable at the partners' level. The corporate partners and individual partners are subject to corporate income tax (CIT) and IIT, respectively, on the taxable income so allocated. In other words, the taxpayers are the corporate partners and individual partners, instead of the partnership.
## Anti-avoidance rules
Anti-avoidance rules are introduced into the IIT Law taking effect since 1 January 2019. The tax authorities are provided legal basis to perform tax adjustment in case of transactions against arm’s-length principles, controlled foreign company (CFC) arrangements in tax havens, as well as arrangements deriving inappropriate tax benefits without reasonable commercial substance.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
There are 9 categories of income (_see the section for more information_). All types of income shall be grouped under the relevant category.
## Employment income
Employment income includes wages/salaries, awards, bonuses, hardship and foreign-service allowances, etc. It can take the form of cash, benefits in kind, marketable securities, and any other forms of economic benefits. On the other hand, reimbursements of business-related expenses to employees and certain non-taxable fringe benefits provided to foreign individuals, if the amounts are reasonable and supported by valid receipts, are not taxable.
Chinese social security contributions made by the employer in accordance with the Social Security Law are not taxable for IIT purposes.
Overseas social security contributions made by the employer, regardless of whether they are made on a voluntary or mandatory basis, are subject to IIT. IIT on these contributions is normally imposed when the contribution is made instead of at the time of cash withdrawal and/or distribution.
Statutory pension income received after retirement in accordance with the Social Security Law is tax exempted income.
## Equity compensation
Income derived by employees from equity plans upon exercise/vesting is generally treated as employment income in nature. Where applicable, equity plan income may be allocated between China and non-China sources. Depending on the features of the plan (e.g. equity holding interest relationship between the listed company and the employee's employing entity, completion of the required record filing procedure), equity plan income may be eligible for favourable tax calculation treatment.
## Labour service income
Labour service income refers to gross income derived by individuals from independent services such as design, medical practice, legal practice, accounting, consulting, etc.
## Business income
In China, an individual may engage in the following types of businesses: privately-owned business, sole proprietorship enterprise, and partnership enterprise. These three types of business entities are taxed at the individual investor/partner level rather than the entity level. Qualified expenses and costs are allowed to be deducted from the gross business income to arrive at the net taxable income (_see the section for more information_).
## Income from the transfer of property (capital gain)
Income from the transfer of property includes income from transfer of securities, shares, real estate properties, shares of partnership interest, etc. The cost basis of the property and reasonable expenses incurred are deductible from the sales proceeds to arrive at the taxable income.
## Dividend income
Dividend income is taxed on the gross amount received, without deductions.
## Interest income
Interest income is taxed on the gross amount received, without deductions. Interest income received from bank deposits in China is currently not taxable.
## Rental income
Rental income refers to income derived through the leasing of buildings, granting of rights to land usage, machinery and equipment, motor vehicles, ships, and other property.
## Income from intellectual property (IP)
Royalties are subject to the progressive tax rates of 3% to 45% applicable to comprehensive income but may be reduced under a tax treaty/arrangement.
Income derived from the transfer of IP is considered capital gain and subject to the flat tax rate of 20%.
Author's remuneration is subject to the progressive tax rates of 3% to 45% applicable to comprehensive income.
Certain income derived by foreign individuals in relation to IP is not taxable in China, depending on the individual's physical presence in China (_see the section for more information_) and the source of the income.

## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Dividend income is generally taxed at 20% unless otherwise provided for in the applicable income tax treaty. Dividend income derived from shares traded on the Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Beijing Stock Exchanges is entitled to 50% or 100% tax reduction, depending on the length of holding. 
Capital gains from transfer of shares traded on the Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Beijing Stock Exchanges are generally exempt from IIT. 
Interest on government bonds and finance bonds issued by the Chinese Government, as well as bank deposit interest income, is currently exempt from IIT.
Income of diplomatic representatives, consuls, and other personnel of foreign embassies and consulates is also exempt from IIT.
China's domestic law states that those foreign individuals who stay in China for no more than 90 days within a tax year may be exempted from IIT on their China-sourced employment income provided such income is paid or borne by a non-China entity (_see the section for more information_).
Tax incentives are available for eligible talents deriving comprehensive income (or employment income, remuneration for labour services, author's remuneration, and royalties in case of non-resident taxpayers) or business income from specific regions, such as the Hainan Free Trade Port (from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2024), the nine cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2027), and the Guangdong-Macao In-Depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin (from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2025). IIT refund or rebate can be claimed for any IIT paid or withheld in excess of that calculated at the reduced effective tax rate or specific cap.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
China-domiciled individuals and non-China-domiciled individuals who reside in China for 183 days or more in a tax year are considered residents for IIT purpose. Residents in general are subject to IIT on their worldwide income.
Non-China-domiciled individuals who reside in China for less than 183 days in a tax year are considered non-residents for IIT purpose. Non-residents in general are subject to IIT on their China-source income only.
China-domiciled individuals are those who habitually reside in China because of their legal residency status, family, or economic ties in China.
Chinese nationals, excluding residents of Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan who are normally considered as non-China-domiciled individuals, are generally considered to have a domicile in China.
Foreign individuals and residents of Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan are generally taxed in accordance with their physical presence in China, as follows:
  * Foreign individuals who reside in China for less than 183 days will be taxed only on their China-source income (_see the section for more information on China-source income_).
  * Foreign individuals who reside in China for 183 days or more in a tax year but not more than six consecutive years will be subject to tax on both their China-source income and their foreign-source income. However, as a concession, foreign-source income is taxed only to the extent of income paid and/or borne by a China entity or individual.
  * Foreign individuals who reside in China for 183 days or more per year for over six consecutive years will be subject to IIT on their worldwide income from the seventh consecutive year onward if they reside in China for 183 days or more during the year. The 'six-year' count is reset if the foreign individual spends more than 30 consecutive days outside of China during any tax year. 
  * Foreign individuals who travel to China and derive income from an overseas employer with no permanent establishment in China will be tax exempt if they do not physically stay in China cumulatively for more than 90 days in a calendar year. If the individual is a tax resident of a country/region that has concluded a tax treaty/arrangement with China, the 90-day threshold is extended to 183 days during a calendar year or any 12 consecutive months, depending on the applicable tax treaty/arrangement.


The following categories of income, regardless of whether the payments are made within China or not, are considered China-source income:
  * Income derived from employment or contracted labour services performed within the territory of China.

An individual is usually a small-scale VAT taxpayer subject to the VAT rate of 3%. However, individuals engaged in privately-owned business may be recognised as general VAT taxpayers as long as certain criteria, such as sales amount, etc., have been met. Unlike general VAT taxpayers, small-scale taxpayers are not allowed to claim input VAT credits for the VAT paid on their purchases.
Individuals are exempt from VAT if the income derived is below certain thresholds. The provincial level tax bureaus are authorised to determine the exact thresholds within the following ranges:
  * Monthly sales amount of no more than CNY 100,000 for registered VAT payer.
  * Sales amount of no more than CNY 300 or CNY 500 per transaction/day if the individual is subject to VAT on a transaction basis and not a registered VAT payer.

Import duty is charged in  _ad valorem_ , specific, compound, or sliding terms, etc.  _Ad valorem_ duty is charged based on the customs valuation of the goods. The dutiable value of the goods is multiplied by an  _ad valorem_ duty rate to arrive at the amount of duty payable. Duty collection on an  _ad valorem_ basis is the main taxation measure used by most countries, including China. The dutiable value of import and export goods is the taxable value determined by the Customs to levy  _ad valorem_ duties on the import and export goods, which is the base to value and levy customs duties payable of import and export goods and import links taxes payable of the import goods.
Import duties are categorised as normal tariff rate, Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariff rate, contractual tariff rate, preferential tariff rate, tariff-rate quota (TRQ) rate, and temporary tariff rate.
The Country of Origin of imported goods also plays a part in determining the applicability of a number of other trade policies, such as TRQ, preferential tariffs, anti-dumping duty, anti-subsidy duty, etc.
