## Foreign tax relief
Tax residents are allowed to credit foreign taxes paid in respect of the income received abroad against their Ukrainian PIT liabilities if it is provided by a DTT between Ukraine and the relevant foreign state. An official confirmation, issued by the relevant foreign tax authority and legalised/stamped with Apostille, is compulsory for claiming a foreign tax credit in Ukraine.
The amount of foreign tax credit is limited to the amount of Ukrainian tax that would arise from the same income in Ukraine (i.e. at 18%). Credit against military tax is not allowed.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
Note that Ukrainian legislation is constantly undergoing changes and developments; consequently, taxpayers should seek expert advice wherever possible.
## Main legislation changes
The major tax reform in Ukraine was implemented in January 2016. The main changes related to individuals and effective from 2017-2021 are the following:
  * The personal income tax (PIT) rate of 18% is applicable to all kinds of passive income received by individuals, with the exception of dividends paid under certain conditions, unless specified otherwise in the Tax Code.
  * Ordinary dividends paid by non-residents, mutual investment funds, and non-payers of corporate income tax (CIT) in Ukraine are taxed at 9%.
  * The maximal monthly base for unified social contribution (USC) is 15 times (20 times starting from 1 January 2025) the minimal wage set for the respective period (month) of the year. The minimal base for income received at the main place of work is one minimal wage (the minimal wage is 7,100 Ukrainian hryvnias [UAH] starting from January 2024, UAH 8,000 starting from 1 April 2024).
  * Added a possibility for individuals to postpone tax payments in respect of income arising as a result of forgiven debt related to residential mortgage.
  * A tax deduction is allowed not only with respect to secondary and higher educational expenses, but also for expenses incurred in relation to pre-school, extracurricular, and school education. The total amount of the tax deduction charged to the taxpayer in the reporting tax year may not exceed the amount of the annual general taxable income of the taxpayer calculated as a salary.
  * Currency exchange differences are added to calculation of individual’s investment profit, etc.
  * Starting from 2021, private entrepreneurs have a right not to pay mandatory monthly USC if they are simultaneously employed at their main place of work based on a labour contract and their employer pays USC on their behalf in the amount not less than the minimal USC established by the law.


## 2020 tax legislation updates
In 2020, the Ukrainian government passed a law amending the tax legislation of Ukraine. Below we provide the list of main changes/clarifications in respect of taxation of individuals:
  * Investment income from foreign sources is taxed according to the rules established for taxation of investment profit/loss.
  * In case of sale or acquisition by the taxpayer of investment assets to/from non-residents that are related parties or non-residents registered in the states (territories) included in the list approved by the Cabinet of Ministers (e.g. whose CIT rate is 5% or more lower than in Ukraine, countries with which Ukraine has not concluded international agreements on the exchange of information), income and expenses on such transactions are determined: 
    * in the amount not lower than the usual price, in case of sale, and
    * in the amount not higher than the usual price, in case of purchase.
  * The entry into force of the controlled foreign company (CFC) took place 1 January 2022. Its main statements are: 
    * Tax residents who are controlling persons for a foreign company will have to determine their share of the profits of such company in accordance with the rules of the Tax Code of Ukraine, declare it in the annual declaration of property status and income, and pay tax at the following rates: 
      * 9% if the individual actually receives the allocated funds (directly or through the chain of indirect ownership) and such distribution took place before the submission of the CFC report.
      * 18% in other cases. Recalculation of the tax (from 18% to 9%) and refund of part of the paid tax is possible provided that the individual actually receives the allocated funds and submits an adjusting annual tax return before the end of the second calendar year following the reporting year.
    * Under certain conditions, the amount of PIT may be reduced by the amount of taxes paid by the CFC.
    * The CFC profit received as dividends from legal entities of Ukraine is taxed at the rates of 5% or 9% (from mutual investment institutions or business entities that are not CIT payers). In this case, such amount is not taken into account when determining the portion of the CFC profit and is not subject to further taxation during its actual payment in favour of the controlling person. Dividends previously taxed at the level of a Ukrainian company are not subject to re-taxation.


_For more details on new CFC rules adopted by the Ukrainian government and how the taxable profit is determined, please refer to the section of the Corporate tax summary_.
## 2021 tax legislation valid since 1 January 2022 
  * The following points regarding the right for a tax refund appliance and its administration are clarified / added: 
    * The right to a tax refund with respect to education / medical expenses is granted not only to parents but also to guardians and fiduciaries, including parents-educators.
    * For 2021 and 2022, the tax refund included the full cost of assistance to medical institutions, as well as the cost of treatment and purchase of medicines and / or medical devices needed for the treatment of acute respiratory disease COVID-19, vaccination costs for the prevention of acute respiratory disease COVID-19, as well as the cost of insurance payments paid to the resident insurer under insurance contracts in case of acute respiratory disease COVID-19, for the taxpayer and members of the taxpayer's family of the first degree of kinship.
    * It is stipulated that the controlling authorities may not request from taxpayers information, with the aim to prove expenses, contained in databases to which it has direct access.
  * For determination of investment profit, one is allowed to deduct the value of investment assets that was declared by a taxpayer in a one-time (voluntary) special declaration.
  * A new procedure is introduced for taxation of payments from a foreign institution without the status of a legal entity: 
    * Income from distribution of profits from trusts and other foreign institutions without the status of a legal entity (not CFC) is taxed at 9% PIT rate.
    * The individual recipient of such payments is required to submit together with the annual tax return copies of set documents in connection with receipt of such income.
  * Minimum tax liability introduced for taxpayers who are owners, tenants, and users on other conditions (including emphyteusis) of land plots classified as agricultural land, not leased (subleased) by such persons and not transferred to emphyteusis or other use on the basis of agreements concluded and registered, respectively, to the legislation. Minimum tax liability is determined by a controlling authority based on the registration address of such taxpayers (taxpayers registered as private entrepreneurs determine such tax obligation themselves).
  * Remuneration (within certain limits) received by IT specialists under a special contract from a company registered as a  'resident of Diia City' is taxed at a 5% PIT rate. In addition, dividends received from a company that operates under the Diia City regime may be exempt from taxation under certain conditions.

    * Income from sale of inherited property is taxed at a 5% PIT rate starting for the second and consequent objects, irrespective of the number of years of its ownership.
    * Income from the sale of third and consequent real estate objects is subject to an 18% tax rate but may be reduced by the certain types of documented costs of purchasing real estate located in Ukraine.

#### Changes related to the introduction of martial law
The following exemptions for PIT and military tax for income paid by a Ukrainian donator have been introduced:
  * Charitable aid to military servicemen and other individuals directly engaged in military operations against the military aggression of the Russian Federation, as well as current or former residents of localities with military operations and/or those displaced as a result of military operations in such localities.
  * Non-targeted charitable aid to individuals affected by military aggression of the Russian Federation in Ukraine.


Income provided as funds or goods (including additional benefits) to a taxpayer (and family members of first relationship degree) are not included into their total taxable income for 2022 and 2023 year, and following years until 31 December of the year when martial law will be cancelled, if: 
  * provided at the expense of budget funds of foreign countries and their state funds, as well as from foreign companies and organisations that, in accordance with the legislation of the relevant foreign jurisdiction, carry out charitable activities, and
  * the person (taxpayer) suffered as a result of the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine and exercised the right to temporary protection in accordance with the legislation of such a foreign state.


Receipt of such non-taxable funds or goods (including additional benefits) do not require filing of the annual tax declaration by itself. If a taxpayer received other income that requires filing a tax declaration, then such receipt of funds or goods should be included in the tax return as non-taxable income.
## Military tax
A temporary 1.5% military tax on personal income was introduced in August 2014. This will be effective until the reformation of the Ukrainian Military Forces is completed and affects all taxable income of residents and non-residents in Ukraine. The tax base is not capped. Ukrainian employers and other tax agents are responsible for tax withholding.
Military tax from income not received from a tax agent should be paid on a self-assessment basis within the deadlines for PIT. It cannot be relieved using a double tax treaty (DTT).
In accordance with Law 4015-IX, which came into force on 1 December 2024, the military tax rate has been increased or introduced for new categories of taxpayers and is the following:
  1. For individuals: Increased from 1.5% to 5%; the tax base is the same as the PIT base.
  2. Introduced for private entrepreneurs-physical persons registered on the first, second, and fourth groups of the simplified regime: 10% of a monthly amount of minimum salary set as of 1 January of the reporting year (UAH 7,100 for 2024 year, UAH 8,000 for 2025 year) applies on a monthly basis.
  3. Introduced for taxpayers registered on the third group of the simplified regime: 1% from the gross taxable income (i.e. revenue).
  4. For individuals on military service and employees of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Security Service of Ukraine, Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine, Defense Intelligence of Ukraine, National Guard of Ukraine, State Border Guard Service of Ukraine, State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine, and State Special Transport: 1.5% from the PIT base.


Starting from the 1 January of the year following the year when martial law will be cancelled, the military tax rate for individuals will be 1.5%.
Private entrepreneurs-physical persons registered on the first, second, and fourth groups of the simplified regime pay military tax not later than the 20th day (inclusive) of the current month. The controlling authority calculates the advance payments. Advance payment of military tax could be done for the whole tax (reporting) period (quarter, year) but not more than by the end of the current reporting year.
Taxpayers who are registered on the third group of the simplified regime pay military tax within ten days after the deadline for filing a tax declaration for the reporting quarter.
Payers of the military tax listed in points (ii) and (iii) above declare military tax in their tax return of a payer of single tax. The penalties that apply to the violation of military tax payment for private entrepreneurs are the same as for violations of unified tax payment for a respective group.


# Ukraine
## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
Residents are taxed on their worldwide income, subject to the restrictions set forth by any applicable DTT.
Non-residents are subject to Ukrainian tax only in respect of their Ukrainian-source income (this, for example, includes income received by the individual from their employer, either resident or non-resident, in relation to employment exercised in Ukraine) or, under conditions, investment profit from operation with non-Ukrainian investment assets if the issuers own Ukrainian subsidiaries.
The same tax rates generally apply to tax residents and non-residents (with certain exceptions).
## Personal income tax rates
The standard tax rate of 18% applies to income received as salary and other benefits under employment and civil agreements, foreign income, and other income not covered elsewhere.
Taxable income received from abroad is subject to a tax rate of 18%, with some exceptions.
The 18% rate also applies to all passive income (e.g. interest, dividends, royalties, investment profit), unless specified otherwise by a special article (_see the section_). Dividends paid by resident CIT payers (except mutual investment institutions) are taxed at 5%. Dividends paid by non-residents, mutual investment funds, and non-payers of CIT in Ukraine are taxed at 9%. Dividends that are 'not ordinary dividends' are taxed like salary (i.e. at 18%).
Income earned by tax non-residents from sources in Ukraine should be subject to tax under the same order and rates as those for tax residents, unless otherwise specified by the Tax Code.
## Military tax rates
A temporary 1.5% military tax on personal income was introduced in August 2014. This is effective until the reformation of the Ukrainian Military Forces is completed. The completion should be confirmed by the respective decision of the Parliament.
Tax base for the military tax is the same as for PIT (with some exceptions) and is not capped.
Ukrainian employers and other tax agents are responsible for tax withholding. Military tax from income not withheld by a tax agent should be payable on a self-assessment basis within the deadlines for PIT.
For the updates introduced by the Law 4015-IX, dated 10 October 2024, please refer to _Military tax_ _in the section_. 
Income of individuals accrued for the periods before the Law 4015-IX came into force ( i.e. before 1 December 2024) shall be taxed at the military tax rate in effect prior to the entry into force of this Law (i.e. 1.5%), regardless of the date of their actual payment (grant), except for cases expressly provided for by the Tax Code of Ukraine.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
## Taxable period
The reporting period for individuals follows the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Every individual is taxed on their own income. Tax shall be deducted at the source in most cases. There is no aggregation of income for spouses, and returns are to be filed separately by married persons.
An individual is obligated to file a tax return with the local tax authorities (where the individual resides/is registered in Ukraine) if they receive income during the year:
  * from sources that do not qualify as tax agents (e.g. foreign income), or
  * in the form of investment profit or some other cases specified by the legislation.


Additionally, tax residents, including those whose income was subject to final taxation at the source, also have the right to file a tax return if they wish to claim a tax credit (deduction) in respect of certain expenses incurred during the year and/or claim a foreign tax credit in Ukraine.
The standard annual filing deadline is 30 April of the year following the reporting year. It can be extended to 31 December based on an application from the taxpayer if the documents for a foreign tax credit need to be obtained from a foreign jurisdiction.
If a person plans to depart Ukraine, the tax resident must submit a ‘departure tax declaration’ no less than 60 days prior to their departure and settle the tax due based on an assessment issued by the tax authorities. Theoretically, filing a departure tax return does not allow an individual to avoid filing an annual tax return.
Private entrepreneurs under the general tax regime are obligated to file tax returns by 30 April of the year following the reporting year and should declare all kinds of income (i.e. from entrepreneurial and non-entrepreneurial activities).
Private entrepreneurs registered for a simplified tax regime are obligated to report the amount of income received and tax paid during the reporting period on a quarterly or annual basis. Also, monthly reporting may apply under the martial law regime.
## Payment of tax
Tax in respect of employment or other income paid by a tax agent (i.e. a Ukrainian entity or a representative office of a foreign company in Ukraine) must be withheld at the source. The tax is payable at the time of the income payment. When the income is received in-kind or from the cash desk, the tax is payable within three banking days.
If income is accrued but not paid, the common approach is that the tax has to be transferred to the Treasury within 20 calendar days after the month when such accrual took place.
Tax liability due on a submitted tax return must be paid by the individual on a self-assessment basis by 31 July of the year following the reporting year, irrespective of whether the filing extension was applied for or not. Tax liability additionally calculated by the tax authorities should be paid by the deadline indicated in the tax assessment issued by the tax authorities. Some specific deadlines also exist in rare cases (e.g. quarterly payments of PIT and military tax from rental income that is not received from a tax agent).
The 2024 tax payment deadline is 31 July 2025.
PIT should be paid in Ukrainian local currency, hryvnia. There is no mechanism for payment of PIT in foreign currency, or directly from abroad.
Overpayment of PIT should be returned to the taxpayer within 60 calendar days from the date of filing the tax return. Upon a taxpayer's request, the overpayment may be offset against future tax liabilities.
Private entrepreneurs under the general tax regime are obligated to pay an advance tax in four instalments throughout the year. The final tax payment is due based on the tax return.


# Ukraine
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
## Personal deductions
A registered resident taxpayer may claim a so-called ’tax deduction’ from the annual taxable income for a limited amount of documented expenses paid to Ukrainian institutions in the reporting year for the expenses described below.
The total deduction may not exceed the amount of taxable income received in the form of salary (in practice, salary received from Ukrainian tax agents). Amounts not deducted from the income of the reporting year cannot be carried forward. All expenses should be properly documented.
### Charitable contributions
Donations to registered Ukrainian charities and not-for-profit organisations are deductible in an amount that is not higher than 4% of the taxpayer's taxable income.
### Education expenses
Education expenses include the pre-school, extracurricular, school, secondary professional, or higher education of a taxpayer and his/her family members (i.e. spouse, parents, children) or guardians and fiduciaries, including parents-educators, in Ukrainian institutions. The total amount of the tax deduction charged to the taxpayer in the reporting tax year may not exceed the amount of the annual general taxable income of the taxpayer calculated as a salary.
### Insurance premiums
Limited premiums for voluntary long-term life insurance or non-state pension insurance for the benefit of a taxpayer and their immediate family members (i.e. spouse, parents, children) are deductible. For 2024, the deductible amount is limited to UAH 4,240 per month for a taxpayer. Limit for the payment related to the taxpayer's immediate family members is half of the above monthly limit.
### Mortgage interest expenses
A limited amount of interest on a qualified mortgage is deductible, provided it is used to finance the acquisition of a taxpayer’s ’main place of residence’ (i.e. the apartment/house where the taxpayer is registered).
## Business deductions
Private entrepreneurs registered under the general tax regime may deduct business expenses and depreciation charges, subject to the rules established by the Tax Code.

## Pension duty
Pension duty is payable by individuals upon purchase of passenger cars prior to the first registration of the vehicle in Ukraine. The tax base is the value of the vehicle. For 2023, depending on the value of the vehicle, the following rates apply (based on the minimum subsistence level; the subsistence minimum for 2024 and 2025 is UAH 3,028):
  * Value up to UAH 499,620: 3%.
  * Value above UAH 499,620, but not more than UAH 878,120: 4%.
  * Value above UAH 878,120: 5%.


Pension duty is also payable by individuals who acquire real estate (with the exception of Ukrainians who acquire residential premises for the first time) at 1% of the asset's value.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
## Employment income
All income received from employment in monetary form or in kind during a calendar year is subject to PIT. This includes all basic pay, overtime pay, supplemental pay, awards and bonuses, compensation for unused vacation, all other monetary amounts, and additional benefits granted by employers to employees.
Taxable income of foreign nationals who are residents of Ukraine is determined in the same order as for Ukrainians.
## Income from disposal of property
Proceeds from the sale of real estate (a house, a flat, or a share of such a house/flat/cottage, or an unfinished construction of such asset) is exempt from taxation if it is the first disposal for the year and the asset was in the individual’s possession for more than three years (the latter condition does not apply to sales of inherited property). A 5% rate (for tax residents) and 18% rate (for tax non-residents) apply to subsequent sales of immovable property during the calendar year. Commercial property does not qualify for the aforementioned exemption. The tax must be paid before notarisation of the sale-purchase agreement.  _See 2021 tax legislation valid since 1 January 2022 in the section for recent amendments_.
Proceeds from sales of movable property are generally taxed at 5%. One sale per calendar year of a car, a motorcycle, or a scooter is exempt from taxation. A 5% rate applies to the second sale of such assets during a calendar year for tax residents, an 18% rate applies to the third and subsequent sales during the same calendar year. An 18% rate applies to incomes from the disposal of movable property received by tax non-residents.
Note that the tax authorities may disagree with the applicability of the above-mentioned exemptions to tax non-residents.
In addition, the 5% military tax applies to such income if it was taxed with PIT.
## Dividend income
Dividends received from a Ukrainian legal entity CIT payer (other than a collective investment arrangement) are subject to PIT at a 5% rate. Dividends paid by non-residents, mutual investment funds, and non-payers of CIT in Ukraine are taxed at 9%, as well as distribution of profits, including accumulated profits from previous periods, from foreign formations without the status of a legal entity (starting from 2022).
Dividends that are 'not ordinary' are taxed at 18% PIT.
In addition, the 5% military tax applies to such income (as well as any other income taxable with PIT).
## Interest income
Bank interest, as well as most other passive income, is subject to 18% PIT starting from 1 January 2016. In addition, the 5% military tax applies to such income.
Banks and credit unions are required to withhold PIT and report to the tax authorities the total amount of interest income and tax withheld during a given period without providing any information on the individuals or their bank accounts.
## Exempt income
Generally, all income received or accrued for the taxpayer (or paid to third parties for the benefit of the individual) in any form is taxable, with some minor exceptions:
  * Accommodation provided by an employer to an employee free-of-charge if its provision is an essential condition for the performance of an employee’s labour function and is ether set by the labour contract, approved by a ’collective agreement’ (an agreement between personnel and the employer), or established by the law, within specified limits. The apartment or a house should belong to the employer.
  * Premiums paid by an employer-resident in respect of non-state pension and/or voluntary medical insurance of its employees within a limit equal to 30% of the employee’s monthly salary.
  * Amounts paid by legal entities or individuals to Ukrainian specific educational institutions for the taxpayer's education and training/retraining, within specific limits and conditions. The maximum monthly exemption is three times the minimal salary set as of 1 January of the reporting year for every completed or partially completed month of such education (starting from January 2024, the maximum is UAH 21,300; for 2025, the maximum is UAH 24,000). 
  * Alimony received from residents or non-residents.
  * Interest income from current bank accounts that is used solely for the receipt of salaries, scholarships, pensions, social aids, and other social payments received by individuals.
  * Interest from securities issued by certain state bodies of Ukraine.
  * Shares received from the capitalisation of undistributed profits, provided that allocation of shares between shareholders of the Ukrainian resident entity remains unchanged.
  * One-off material aid may be exempt from PIT and military tax in the amount not exceeding UAH 3,470 _per_ _annum_ for 2022, UAH 3,760 _per_ _annum_ for 2023, and UAH 4,240 _per_ _annum_ for 2024 and 2025.
  * In-kind gifts are exempt from PIT and military tax in the amount not exceeding UAH 1,775 for 2024 and UAH 2,000 for 2025. Application of the limit may require developing an approach by the company (if it is monthly, annual, or for each gift, as legislation is not clear).
  * Funds provided to individuals or their immediate family members for medical treatment purposes are exempt from PIT and military tax without limitations. The use of the funds for medical purposes must be documented/proven.
  * Income provided as funds or goods (including additional benefits) to a taxpayer (and family members of 1st relationship degree) are not included into their total taxable income for 2022 and 2023 year, and further years until 31 December of the year when the martial law will be cancelled, if: 
    * provided at the expense of budget funds of foreign countries and their state funds, as well as from foreign companies and organisations that, in accordance with the legislation of the relevant foreign jurisdiction, carry out charitable activities, and
    * the person (taxpayer) suffered as a result of the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine and exercised the right to temporary protection in accordance with the legislation of such foreign state.
  * Income in the form of funds and/or property received as part of the implementation of an experimental project to create favourable conditions for ensuring the effective consumption of electric energy by the population under the conditions determined by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.


The USC made by an employer per Ukrainian tax legislation is not included in the taxable income of the individual. Contributions made to foreign pensions and/or social security funds are considered as an individual's additional taxable income.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
Residents are individuals who have their place of abode in Ukraine. When an individual has a place of abode in another country as well, such an individual is deemed to be a resident of Ukraine if they have a permanent place of abode (domicile) in Ukraine.
If the individual has a domicile in another country as well, they are deemed to be a resident of Ukraine if they have a centre of vital interests in Ukraine. A sufficient, but not exclusive, ground for determining the country of an individual’s centre of vital interest is the place of permanent abode of the individual’s family members.
In the event that the individual’s centre of vital interests cannot be determined, or if the individual has no domicile in any country, they are deemed to be a resident of Ukraine if they stay in Ukraine at least 183 days during the tax year (calendar year).
If residency status cannot be determined based on the above rules, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident of Ukraine if they are a citizen of Ukraine.
Registered freelancers and private entrepreneurs also qualify as Ukrainian tax residents and are subject to Ukrainian tax on their worldwide income.
Non-residents are individuals who do not qualify as residents of Ukraine.

## Unified social contribution (USC)
The USC basic rate (the contribution of a company that pays employment income/remuneration under civil agreements to individuals) is 22% of the gross remuneration.
The taxable base subject to the USC is capped per individual per month. Starting from 2018, the cap is set at 15 times the minimal wage set for the respective month (e.g. UAH 106,500 starting from 1 January 2024, UAH 120,000 starting from 1 April 2024). 
According to Art. 39 of the State Budget Law for 2025, dated 19 November 2024, which comes into force on 1 January 2025, the USC cap will be set at 20 times the minimum salary (i.e. UAH 160,000 from 1 January 2025).
The minimal USC contribution is 22% of the minimal wage set as of the first day of the month of the salary payment (e.g. UAH 1,562 starting from 1 January 2024, UAH 1,760 starting from 1 April 2024).
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
As of 1 January 2024, there are four VAT rates: 20%, 14%, 7%, and 0%.
The rate of 20% applies to almost all transactions subject to VAT except specific transactions subject to 14%, 7%, and 0% VAT.
The rate of 14% applies on transactions for the import and supply of certain agricultural products (products of plant origin, such as corn, soybeans, sunflower seeds, and certain other goods) in Ukraine.
The reduced rate of 7% applies to supply and import of registered medicines and specific medical goods, as well as medicines, medical goods, and medical equipment allowed to be used in clinical trials. It is also applied to several services of culture, tourism, and creative industries and supply of tickets to sporting events of international and Ukrainian level.
The 0% VAT rate applies to the export and re-export of goods and some other specific transactions (basically, it is a mechanism for providing exemption with credit).
_See the section in the Corporate tax summary for more information on VAT_.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Ukraine.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There is no gift or inheritance tax in Ukraine. However, income received as an inheritance or gift is subject to PIT at the following rates:
  * 0% if received from a resident’s family members (spouse, child, parent, brother/sister, grandparent, and grandchild).
  * 5% if received from resident testators/donor other than those mentioned above.
  * 18% if received from or by a non-resident testator/donor, irrespective of the relations with such testator/donor.


In addition, a stamp duty is payable by individuals, both Ukrainian and foreign nationals, on transfers of certain properties (e.g. real estate, cars) located/registered in Ukraine, whether the transfer is by way of gift or through inheritance.
## Real estate tax (RET)
Starting from 1 January 2015, almost all residential and non-residential property owned by individuals are subject to RET.
The tax base is determined based on the size of the total area of a real estate asset. There is a specific partial RET exemption for residential property for individuals, whereby the first 60 square metres for flats or 120 square metres for single residential dwellings are not subject to RET (180 square metres for different types of immovable property). Local governments may provide additional exemptions. Exemptions do not apply to assets (i) that exceed more than five times the area of potential exemption and/or (ii) used to generate income.
The RET rate is set by local governments but generally cannot exceed 1.5% of the minimal salary set on 1 January of the reporting year per square metre (for 2020, the maximum is UAH 70.85 per square metre; for 2021, the maximum is UAH 90 per square metre; for 2022, the maximum is UAH 97.50 per square metre; for 2023, the maximum is UAH 100.50 per square metre; for 2024, the maximum is UAH 106.50 per square metre; for 2025 the maximum is UAH 120 per square metre).
If the taxpayer has one or more residential properties with the total area of one asset being more than 300 square metres (for an apartment) or 500 square metres (for a house), the amount of calculated tax will be increased by UAH 25,000 per year for each such asset.
The tax must be paid by individuals within 60 days upon receipt of a tax assessment issued by tax authorities.
Tax non-resident individuals are allowed to rent out their property located in Ukraine only through Ukrainian tax agents.
## Transport tax
A local transport tax is charged on owners of passenger cars with an average market value exceeding 375 minimal salaries as of 1 January of the reporting year (i.e. UAH 2,662,500 for 2024, UAH 3 million for 2025) and less than five years old.
The Ministry of Economic Development and Trade of Ukraine is required to publish (on an annual basis, before 1 February of the reporting year) on its website a list of vehicles that are subject to the transportation tax (including brand, model, year of production, engine displacement, fuel type).
A tax of UAH 25,000 for each car per year should be paid by the car owner.
