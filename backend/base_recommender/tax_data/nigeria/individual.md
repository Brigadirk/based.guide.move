## Tax Appeal Tribunal (TAT) upholds the six-year limitation period for the issuance of tax assessments by authorities and rules that tax authorities can delegate tax investigation functions to third parties
Lafarge Africa Plc (‘Lafarge‘ or ’the Company‘) was subjected to a tax investigation by the Ogun State Internal Revenue Service (OGIRS) spanning 2010 to 2014. OGIRS issued separate assessments at different times between 2019 and 2020. In January 2021, OGIRS issued another revised assessment, asserting its connection to the previous estimated income.
The Company appealed to the TAT, contending that OGIRS had violated the terms of the settlement agreement established after the 2020 assessment. Furthermore, the company challenged the 2021 assessment, arguing that it exceeded the prescribed six-year limitation period specified in section 55 of the Personal Income Tax Act (PITA). In addition to these objections, the company asserted that OGIRS had unlawfully delegated its responsibilities to a private entity, thereby rendering the assessment invalid.
The TAT ruled that the law imposed a six-year limitation period for the issuance of assessments against a taxpayer after the expiration of the relevant year of assessment, except where the taxpayer had committed fraud, wilful default, or neglect. There was no binding agreement between the Company and the tax authority to restrict the tax authority from issuing additional or revised assessments. There is no statutory restriction on the delegation of the power of tax investigation.
## TAT rules that an employer who defaults in its agency role to the government is liable to penalty and interest
In 2017, the Lagos State Internal Revenue Service (LIRS) audited a Nigerian company (NigCo) for the 2011 - 2016 Years of Assessment. The LIRS assessed the company to outstanding pay-as-you-earn (PAYE), withholding tax (WHT), development levy, and business premises levy liabilities plus penalty and interest. NigCo objected to the assessment, and the matter was eventually taken to the TAT.
The TAT ruled that NigCo did not comply with the relevant provisions of the PITA and the Regulations in delivering its agency responsibilities; consequently, NigCo is liable to the tax liability (including penalty and interest) assessed by the LIRS.
This judgement re-emphasises the agency role of employers and the consequences of non-compliance with tax laws, which could be business disruptions and liabilities as high as the unpaid tax plus 31%.
## State tax authorities impose fines of 5 million Nigerian naira (NGN) per month for failure to verify Tax Clearance Certificates (TCCs)
Section 85(2) of PITA requires ministries, agencies, and banks to verify the TCC of individuals on specific transactions. These transactions include application for foreign exchange, government loans, and election into public office, amongst others, as specified in the Act. PITA imposes a non-compliance fine of NGN 5 million or imprisonment for three years or both, upon conviction.
Further to this requirement, several state tax authorities have started demanding certain taxpayers (especially banks) to pay the non-compliance fine of NGN 5 million from 2005 and within seven days of receipt of the assessment. Also, the tax authorities take the view that the NGN 5 million fine is on a monthly basis.
## The LIRS issues Public Notices on capital gains tax (CGT) and personal income tax (PIT) on the sale of securities
The LIRS has issued Public Notices pursuant to recent tax law changes, highlighting compliance requirements from taxpayers and other relevant parties resident in the state.
The relevant tax law changes include:
  * The Capital Gains Tax Act historically exempted gains on the disposal of Nigerian government securities, stocks, and shares from CGT. The Finance Act 2021 has amended the CGT Act to introduce CGT on the disposal of shares, subject to certain conditions.
  * The Minister of Finance (MoF) issued a Notice effective from 2 January 2012 exempting interest and other income earned from government, corporate, and supranational bonds from PIT. The MoF Notice highlighted that the exemption was for a period of ten years (i.e. until 1 January 2022), except for Federal Government bonds, which will continue to be exempt. The ten-year period has now lapsed, and the LIRS communicated that the exemptions have expired.


## The LIRS launches Service Charter
On 28 July 2021, the LIRS released a Service Charter highlighting the LIRS’s mode of operations and services to be provided to taxpayers and other stakeholders. The Charter also underscores the rights, obligations, and expectations of the LIRS and its stakeholders, with the aim of enhancing effective customer-friendly service delivery. The Charter is designed to serve as a guide regarding the general administration of taxes by the LIRS and is expected to boost trust and accountability between the LIRS and its stakeholders, especially taxpayers.
## Expatriates to obtain Nigeria’s National Identity Number (NIN)
Section 16 of the NIMC Act defines registrable persons to include Nigerian citizens, permanent residents, and foreigners who are legally resident in the country for a period of two years or more. Below are the list of requirements for expatriates to obtain a NIN:
  * International passport.
  * Residence permit (CERPAC form/card).
  * Bank Verification Number (BVN).

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 16 September 2024
Individuals resident in Nigeria are taxable on their worldwide income.
In the case of employment, a non-resident person is liable to tax in Nigeria if the duties of employment are wholly or partly performed in Nigeria, unless:
  * the duties are performed on behalf of an employer who is in a country other than Nigeria,
  * the remuneration of the employee is not borne by a fixed base of the employer in Nigeria, and
  * the remuneration of the employee is liable to tax in that other country under the provisions of the avoidance of double taxation treaty (DTT) with that other country.


Foreign persons earning business profits from Nigeria are taxed under Section 6 of the PITA once a fixed base/taxable presence is created, subject to existing treaties.
Section 6(A) of the PITA introduces the significant economic presence (SEP) rules to the taxation of non-resident individuals, executors, or trustees carrying on a trade or business comprising technical, professional management, or consultancy (TPMC) services to persons resident in Nigeria. The MoF may, by order, define what constitutes SEP for this purpose. The MoF has yet to define what constitutes SEP for this purpose.
## Personal income tax rates

Next 500,000 | 19  
Next 1,600,000 | 21  
Above 3,200,000 | 24  
Note that employees who earn not more than the national minimum wage (NGN 30,000 till 30 April 2024 and NGN 70,000 effective 1 May 2024) are no longer liable to tax or deduction of monthly PAYE.
## Minimum income tax
Where a taxpayer has no taxable income because of personal reliefs and allowances or total income produces a tax lower than the minimum tax, a minimum tax rate of 1% of the total income is payable.
## Capital gains tax (CGT) on termination benefits
Income that qualifies as termination benefits (compensation for loss of office) in line with the Capital Gain Tax Act will be subject to CGT on the portion of the income above NGN 10 million (_see Capital gains tax in the section_).

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 16 September 2024
## Employment income
Employers can pay or provide, among other items, basic salaries, housing allowances, transport allowances, utilities, lunch allowances, leave allowances, club subscriptions, clothing allowances, leave passage, insurance premiums, and certain reimbursements to their employees. The entire list is fully taxable except for reimbursements supported with third party invoices/receipts and reasonable relocation expenses.
Employers may also provide cars and accommodation for their staff. If a company provides accommodation for an employee, the employee is taxed on the annual ratable value of the accommodation. If a car is allocated for an employee's use, 5% of the cost of the car will be treated as benefit-in-kind that will form part of the employee's taxable income.
The provision of canteen meals for staff is generally not treated as part of the employee's taxable income. Reimbursements, such as car maintenance, are tax exempt to the extent that the expenses have been incurred and there is no element of profit to the employee.
## Capital gains
The cost of the chargeable asset and the associated cost of disposal are deducted from the sales proceeds to determine the chargeable gains, which are subject to CGT at 10%. _See Capital gains tax in the section for more information_.
## Investment income
Dividends, interest, rent, or royalties derived and brought to Nigeria in convertible currency through government approved channels and paid into a local account in an approved bank is exempt from Nigerian tax.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 16 September 2024
## Pension contributions
The Pension Act signed on 1 July 2014 provides that employers with at least 15 employees are required to participate in a contributory pension scheme for their employees. The minimum contribution under the Act is 18% of monthly emolument (with a minimum contribution of 10% by the employer and 8% by the employee). If the employer decides to bear all the contribution, the minimum contribution is 20% of monthly emolument. Mandatory and/or voluntary contributions by the employers and employees to schemes approved by the Pension Act are deductible for tax purposes.
The Act also requires every employer to take out life insurance coverage for its employees.
## National Housing Fund (NHF) contributions
NHF contributions are applicable to Nigerian employees earning a minimum of NGN 30,000 _per annum_ (national minimum wage and above). The employer is required to deduct 2.5% of the monthly income from employees and remit it to the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria within one month of deduction. Private sector employees are now excluded from compulsory compliance with this obligation and may hence forth contribute the requisite 2.5% of their monthly income to the NHF voluntarily.
## Capital gains tax (CGT)
Gains accruing to a chargeable person (individual or company) on the disposal of chargeable assets shall be subject to tax under the Capital Gains Tax Act at the rate of 10%. There is no distinction between long-term and short-term gains and no inflation adjustment to cost for CGT purposes.
All forms of assets, including options, debts, goodwill, and foreign currency, other than those specifically exempt, are liable for CGT.
The law amends the CGT Act to impose tax at 10% on gains from the disposal of shares in a Nigerian company worth NGN 100 million or above in any 12 consecutive months, except to the extent that the proceeds are reinvested in the shares of any Nigerian company. CGT will accrue proportionately on the portion of sales proceeds not reinvested in the above manner. Regulated securities lending transactions are exempt from CGT as well as government securities and gain on trading shares.
CGT is applicable on the chargeable gains received or brought into Nigeria in respect of assets situated outside Nigeria.
Capital losses are not allowed as an offset against chargeable gains accruing to a person from the disposal of any assets. 
CGT will apply on compensation of loss of office that exceeds NGN 10 million.
There is a requirement to self-assess and remit CGT due no later than 30 June and 31 December of the same year upon the disposal of a chargeable asset.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate is 7.5% (increased from 5% on 1 February 2020).
Zero-rated items include non-oil exports, goods and services purchased by diplomats, and goods and services purchased for use in humanitarian donor funded projects.
Exempt items include plants and machinery for use in export processing zones or free trade zones, basic food items, medical products and services, pharmaceutical products, books and educational materials, and exported services.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Nigeria.
## Property taxes
Property taxes in Nigeria are usually levied annually by the state government with varying rates depending on the state and the location of the property within the state. The two major property taxes are governor’s consent fee and land registration fee. In Lagos (which is the economic hub of Nigeria), governor’s consent fee, land registration fees, and other levies payable to the state give rise to a total levy of 15% of the transfer value of the land. Also, Right of Occupancy fee and tenement rates are chargeable by state and local government authorities.
## Excise taxes
Excise duty is applicable on beer and stout, wines, spirits, cigarettes, and tobacco manufactured and sold in Nigeria and imported into Nigeria at rates ranging from 5% to 20%. The excess duty on services is yet to be implemented.
