## Deduction at Source (Withholding) Regulations 2024
The Federal Ministry of Finance (MoF) has recently issued the Deduction at Source (Withholding) Regulations 2024 (the ’Regulations‘ or ’WHT Regulations‘), effective 1 July 2024, except for the rules applicable to the gaming sector, which are billed to commence on 1 October 2024. These Regulations have introduced a number of changes to the withholding tax (WHT) regime in Nigeria. The gazetted version of the WHT Regulations is yet to be released, hence the tax authorities are yet to implement the provisions.
## Windfall tax on Nigerian banks
The Nigerian government is proposing a 70% tax (‘windfall tax‘) on realised profits made by Nigerian banks from exchange transactions in the 2023 - 2025 financial years (FYs). This proposal has sparked some debate considering the many practical concerns that it raises. One of such issues is that it retrospectively applies the tax on profits from FY 2023, which the banks already filed and paid by June 2024.
## Federal High Court (FHC) nullifies the requirement to pay security deposits before appeal at the Tax Appeal Tribunal (TAT) and the courts
The (FHC of Nigeria recently struck down provisions that required taxpayers to pay security deposits before filing appeals at the TAT and the courts. These provisions, found in various rules and Practice Directions, were deemed to infringe upon taxpayers' constitutional right to fair hearing and were consequently declared null and void.
The FHC's decision highlighted the importance of the right to appeal as a constitutional right and criticised the deposit requirements for imposing an undue burden on taxpayers. The offending provisions were struck down, allowing taxpayers to file appeals without payment of any deposit.
While the ruling is lauded for upholding taxpayers' rights, questions remain regarding the interpretation of relevant laws and the standardisation of deposit requirements that still exist in the FIRS Establishment Act. The constitutionality of rules of court and practice directions also remains contentious, indicating potential further legal challenges.
Overall, the ruling provides clarity on taxpayers' rights in Nigeria's tax dispute resolution process and underscores the need for transparent and fair procedures in tax administration.
## Federal Government waives value-added tax (VAT) and customs duties on gas and gas equipment
In December 2023, the MoF released a Circular on fiscal incentives for the gas sector that waives VAT and customs duties on gas and gas equipment. This Circular is in line with the Presidential Gas for Growth Initiative, which aims to improve the investment climate in Nigeria and to increase the utilisation and supply of gas in the domestic market. The Circular contains incentives and directives to the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) and the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS).
## The FIRS postpones commencement of the automated collection of VAT on imported goods purchased through digital platforms
The FIRS has postponed its intended commencement of the automated collection of VAT on imported goods purchased through digital platforms.
The 2020 Finance Act amended the VAT Act to require non-residents that make taxable supplies of goods and services to Nigerian customers to register and account for VAT on supplies to Nigeria. Following this amendment, the FIRS issued Guidelines on Simplified Compliance Regime for VAT for Non-Resident Suppliers on 11 October 2021, with an effective date of1 January 2022with respect to supply of services and intangibles and 1 January 2024 for goods. 
The FIRS had initially planned to roll out the regime with respect to supply of goods by non-resident suppliers by 1 January 2024; however, the FIRS has decided to postpone it to afford more time to develop a seamless process and collaborate more effectively with key stakeholders (e.g. the NCS). Pending any next steps, the FIRS has stated that the existing guidelines for services and intangibles provided by non-resident suppliers continue to remain in effect. 
## The FIRS and Lagos State Internal Revenue Service (LIRS) agree to establish joint audit and investigation framework
The FIRS and LIRS signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to establish a Joint FIRS and LIRS Audit and Investigation Team (JAIT or ’the Team‘) on 6 February 2023. The JAIT implementation committee organised a sensitisation meeting on 10 August 2023 to educate stakeholders on the guidelines for successful implementation of the collaborative framework. The objective of the MoU is to harmonise the tax procedures between the FIRS and LIRS, foster collaboration, promote exchange of information, and reduce time and cost for relevant stakeholders. There are perceived concerns about the likelihood of success of the JAIT initiative, considering the short-lived nature of a similar policy introduced in 2017 that aimed to harmonise audits among the FIRS and all the State Internal Revenue Services (SIRSs). However, carrying out a pilot with only the FIRS and LIRS under the JAIT is more practical. 
## The FIRS issues assessments to international petroleum tankers and transport vessels
In a recent turn of events, the FIRS has begun to issue assessments to companies operating ocean-going petroleum tankers, based on intelligence obtained from regulators. The letters have been addressed to International Petroleum Vessel Companies (IPVCs) deemed to have ’conducted business‘ in Nigeria. In the assessment letters, the FIRS either apply a 6% tax plus a 10% penalty and 19% interest on perceived freight income earned by the IPVCs from periods as early as 2011 or assume a treaty rate, which is lower in most cases. In some of those assessments, the FIRS includes a tax on demurrage and detention charges earned on vessels chattered. There are no public details of how the income earned by the IPVCs was determined.
The FIRS stated that if the IPVCs assessed fail to submit their tax returns or make payments, it will be considered as tax evasion. The FIRS also mentioned that they are prepared to activate international cooperation mechanisms with foreign jurisdictions to enforce the tax payments.
International shipping companies need to evaluate whether they are required to register and pay taxes in Nigeria and determine the extent of their revenue subject to Nigerian tax. This is now more critical, considering new tax law amendments that require international shipping companies with Nigerian operations to submit their Tax Clearance Certificates (TCCs) upon request by the regulators.
## Highlights of Nigeria’s 2023 Fiscal Policy Measures
The Federal Government has approved the Fiscal Policy Measures 2023 (FPM 2023). The FPM 2023, which is dated 20 April 2023 with an effective date of 1 May 2023, replaces the Fiscal Policy Measures 2022 (FPM 2022) and comprises:
  * Supplementary Protection Measures (SPMs) for the implementation of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Common External Tariff (CET) 2022 to 2026
  * an import prohibition list, applicable only to certain goods originating from non-ECOWAS member states
  * changes in excise duty rates on certain items, such as tobacco and alcoholic beverages
  * introduction of green taxes on single- use plastics and certain categories of vehicles, and
  * reduced import duty rates on certain manufacturing items available to verifiable manufacturers.


There are some concerns around the matters included in FPM 2023. The Federal Government needs to consider suspending the FPM 2023 and engage stakeholders to address the various concerns raised, clarify potential ambiguities, and prepare detailed regulations to accompany the FPM before implementation.
## The FIRS has introduced new changes to TaxPro Max VAT filing procedure
The FIRS has announced new updates to the VAT filing procedures on the TaxPro Max system. The aim is to increase the efficiency of the input VAT claim, sales adjustment entries, and output VAT filing procedures. The changes take effect from the April 2023 filing period.
The FIRS is seeking to seamlessly match output VAT collection to the input VAT claimed by businesses and promote transparency in VAT compliance. To educate the public on the process and the increased data requirements to file a complete VAT return, the FIRS released illustrative videos on YouTube, documented guides, and also held a sensitisation event on 18 April 2023 targeted at various stakeholders.
The FIRS mentioned that the changes are in their pilot phase, but there is absolute commitment from management towards full implementation and adoption by taxpayers.


# Nigeria
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 16 September 2024
## Taxable period
The taxable period is the fiscal year, which runs from 1 January to 31 December.
## Tax returns
Companies are required to register for tax and file their audited accounts and tax computations with the FIRS within six months of their financial year-end on a self-assessment basis or 18 months after incorporation (whichever comes first). A company may file an application for extension of filing tax returns for up to two months at the discretion of the FIRS.
Upon registration, a company is issued a TIN, which serves as the company's file number for all federal taxes and future correspondence with the FIRS.
The company must file the following documents with the tax authority on an annual basis:
  * Tax computation for the relevant year of assessment.
  * The audited financial statements for the respective period; this should be in conformity with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
  * A duly completed and signed self-assessment form for CIT.
  * Evidence of remittance of the income tax liability (partly or in full).


PPT/HCT is payable on an actual year basis. Estimated tax returns must be filed within two months of the fiscal year. Actual tax returns should be filed within five months after the end of the accounting period, that is, not later than 31 May.
### Assessment
Nigerian companies file their tax returns based on a self-assessment system where the taxpayer prepares its annual returns and determines its tax liability. However, the FIRS may apply a best of judgment (BOJ) assessment where it is of the opinion that the tax returns filed are deliberately misstated or where no returns are filed within the stipulated period.
## Payment of tax
### CIT
A company that files its self-assessment within six months after the accounting year-end can apply to the FIRS in writing to pay its income tax in instalments. The maximum number of instalments the FIRS may approve is three. Such application must go with a portion of the tax liability. It is due on or before the due date for filing.
Large companies are granted a bonus of 1% against income tax of future tax years (2% for medium companies) where the income tax is paid 90 days before the due date for filing.
Assessments are made on a preceding year basis. This means that the financial statements for a period ended in 2017 will form the basis for the 2018 year of assessment.
### PPT/HCT
Payments with respect to PPT/HCT in any accounting period of 12 months are made in 12 instalments, with a final 13th instalment (if there is an underpayment). The first instalment for the year is due by the end of March.
### Penalty for non-compliance
Failure to file CIT returns attracts a penalty of NGN 25,000 for the first month and NGN 5,000 for each subsequent month of default. Late payment of CIT attracts a 10% penalty and interest at the commercial rate.
Late submission of PPT returns attracts an initial penalty of NGN 10 million and NGN 2 million for each day such failure continues, while late payment of tax attracts a penalty of 5% of the tax not paid.
## Tax audit process
Generally, the tax authority will commence a desk examination of a taxpayer's returns immediately after filing. This may be followed by a tax monitoring exercise whereby tax officers visit taxpayers to conduct an interview and on-site high-level review of their tax affairs.
Random or specific tax audit may be carried out usually within six years of filing tax returns. In unusual cases, a back-duty tax investigation may be conducted for more than six years, especially where a tax fraud or wilful default is suspected.
In the past, tax audits took a long time to conclude, usually between three to five years. However, the tax authorities are seeking ways to improve the average turnaround time.
In 2018, the Joint Tax Board issued a collaborative framework for cooperation between the FIRS and the state tax authorities. This indicated that there is now clear movement in improving collaboration after many years of simply discussing the concept.
## Statute of limitations
The tax authority may carry out a tax audit and issue an additional assessment within six years from the relevant tax year. However, the limitation does not apply in the event of a fraud, wilful default, or neglect by the company.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The tax authorities are currently exploring ways to generate more tax revenue. As a result, certain areas of taxation, such as tax collection, increasing the tax base, transfer pricing (most especially pricing for commodities, intangibles, etc.), tax transparency, filing of tax returns by PEs, and review of tax incentives and waivers have become a central focus for tax authorities.
There has been increased scrutiny by the FIRS on related-party transactions as a way of preventing taxpayers from shifting profits away from Nigeria. It is expected that transfer pricing audits are expected to be an area of focus in the next one to two years.
Further, for non-resident entities that create a PE in Nigeria, the tax authorities are focused on ensuring that they file full tax returns, including audited accounts, as opposed to filing on a deemed-profit basis. It is expected that the expenses of these PEs will be scrutinised for tax deductibility.
The tax authorities at the federal and state levels are sealing up companies, putting up non-compliance stickers, and holding principal officers of organisations to public scrutiny and prosecution under the tax law for non-compliance in terms of tax default or failure to make timely payments or to file tax returns. On a related note, the Lagos state government has set-up a rapid tax prosecution unit to prosecute tax evaders with considerations to a jail term.
The FIRS has started writing to banks to appoint them as collection agents of taxpayers considered to be in default of tax payments. In order to achieve this, the FIRS is directing the relevant banks to freeze the accounts of the taxpayers to prevent them from drawing funds from the accounts. This practice has been put on hold based on case law, which was decided against the FIRS and the banks.
The Finance Act 2020 amended Sections 25 & 26 of the FIRS Establishment Act, granting the FIRS powers to:
  * deploy proprietary or third-party payment processing companies or digital platforms as agents to collect taxes due on international transactions in the supply of digital services
  * deploy technology to automate the tax administration process, including assessment, collection, and information gathering, provided that it gives the taxpayer a notice of 30 days, and
  * receive assistance in the collection of revenue claims or other tax matters relating to agreements between Nigeria and other countries or bodies.


The FIRS has released the TaxPro-Max platform for tax compliance. TaxPro-Max becomes the channel for filing naira-denominated tax returns. It is expected that this platform will be updated for foreign currency returns in the near future.
The Finance Act 2021 provided that the FIRS is the only tax authority to account for taxes due to the Federal Government.


# Nigeria
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 16 September 2024
A company is considered resident in Nigeria if such a company is registered or incorporated under the Companies and Allied Matters Act. This means that a company formed outside Nigeria under the laws in force in the foreign territory will be considered as a non-resident company for CIT purposes.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Fixed base is not defined but is generally considered to be a location with a degree of permanence. The following would generally not be considered to be a fixed base:
  * The use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage or display of goods or merchandise.
  * The use of facilities solely for the collection of information.


Other activities that could trigger a tax presence in Nigeria include a dependent agency arrangement, execution of a turnkey project, artificial arrangements between related parties, or digital companies that have a significant economic presence (as determined by the Minister of Finance) and management, technical, consultancy, and professional services that create significant economic presence (as determined by the Minister of Finance).


# Nigeria
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 16 September 2024
Expenses are deductible for CIT purposes if they are wholly, reasonably, exclusively, and necessarily incurred for the business or trade.
## Depreciation
Capital allowances are calculated on a straight-line basis. Capital allowances claimable in any year are restricted to two-thirds of assessable profits for all companies, except companies in the manufacturing, agricultural, and upstream and midstream gas sectors, which are excluded from this restriction.
The following are the capital allowance rates on fixed assets (qualifying expenditures):
Qualifying expenditure | Initial allowance (%) | Annual allowance (%)  
---|---|---  
Building (industrial and non-industrial) | 15 | 10  
Furniture and fittings | 25 | 20  
Plant expenditure (1) | 50/95 | 0/25  
Mining expenditure | 95 | 0  
Plantation equipment | 95 | 0  
Motor vehicle (2) | 50/95 | 0/25  
Ranching and plantation expenditure | 30 | 50  
Housing estate expenditure | 50 | 25  
Research and development (R&D) | 95 | 0  
Notes
  1. 95% initial allowance for plant used in agricultural production; others 50%.
  2. 95% initial allowance is granted for motor vehicles used for public transportation if the company has a fleet of at least three buses; all other motor vehicles 50%.


The initial allowance is first deducted, and the balance is written off on a straight-line basis over a fixed period, depending on the rates of annual allowance. There is a requirement that assets not yet disposed of cannot be fully written off in the books. A nominal amount of NGN 10 per asset must be retained in the books till the assets are disposed of. However, where 95% has been claimed as an initial allowance, the 5% balance is the value that must be maintained in the books until the final disposal of the asset.
When assets are sold, the proceeds over the tax written-down value are taxed at 30% to the extent of the allowances already claimed.
Capital expenditure incurred on the development or acquisition of software or other electronic applications are now qualifying expenditures eligible for capital allowance claim. However, the applicable capital allowance rate was not included. In practice, the capital allowance rate for plant expenditure is adopted.
The law restricts the claim of capital allowances to the portion of qualifying assets used for generating taxable income. Capital allowance on assets that are partially used for generating taxable income will be prorated except where the proportion of non-taxable income is less than 20% of the company’s total income. For small and medium companies, the law provides that capital allowances for each year, together with any unabsorbed capital allowances brought forward, will be deemed to be utilised. However, such companies can carry forward the tax residue (tax written down values) of qualifying assets to subsequent periods when it may become taxable.
Pioneer companies are exempt from these amendments during their pioneer period.
## Goodwill
There is no tax deduction for goodwill.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses are not specifically stated as non-deductible in the tax law, but, in practice, they are usually not allowed by the tax authority. This is based on the assumption that start-up expenses are not directly attributable to any taxable income of the company, which is a fundamental condition for tax deductibility of expenses.
## Interest expense
Interest on money borrowed and employed in producing taxable income is a deductible expense. There is currently no thin capitalisation regulation in Nigeria, but general anti-avoidance rules are usually applied to limit deductible interest on related-party loans.
The Finance Act (through the introduction of a new seventh schedule) provides a limitation (30% of EBITDA) on interest expense on foreign connected party debt (which includes debt guaranteed either implicitly or explicitly). Excess interest can be carried forward for up to five years. 
## Bad debt
Bad debt incurred in the course of trade is deductible.
## Charitable contributions
Donations are deductible, subject to the provisions of the law.
## Fines and penalties
Any punitive payments for default or violation of law are expressly not deductible for CIT purposes. 
## Taxes
Any tax on income or profit is not deductible except where such tax was paid on profit earned outside Nigeria. In this case, if the source country has no DTT with Nigeria, the foreign tax paid is allowed as a deduction for CIT purposes. State and local taxes (business rates) and levies may be deducted from taxable income.
The Finance Act provides that taxes borne on behalf of another person are not tax deductible.
## Other significant items
Other deductible expenses include the following:
  * Sum payable by way of interest on capital borrowed and used to generate taxable profits.
  * Rent for the period.
  * Expenses incurred in respect of salary and wages.
  * Expenses incurred for repair of assets.
  * Liability incurred for purpose of trade.
  * R&D costs.


## Net operating losses
Losses can be carried forward indefinitely. Losses made from one line of business cannot be relieved against another line of business. Losses cannot be carried back.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments considered to be artificial are not deductible for CIT purposes. Royalties, management fees, and technical fees required between connected parties are to conform with the Transfer Pricing Regulation.


# Nigeria
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 16 September 2024
There are currently no provisions for group taxation, group relief, or group filing of tax returns in Nigeria. Each legal entity within a group is treated as distinct and separate for CIT purposes.
## Transfer pricing
The transfer pricing regulations are applied in a manner consistent with the arm’s-length principle in Article 9 of the United Nations (UN) and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Tax Conventions on Income and Capital and the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multi-national Enterprises and Tax Administrations. However, where there are inconsistencies between the model conventions and the local legislation, the provisions of the relevant local tax laws shall prevail.
The rules cover all transactions between ‘connected taxable persons’, which is broadly defined to include individuals, PEs created by head offices, subsidiaries, associates, partnerships, joint ventures, and trusts to the extent that they participate directly or indirectly in the management, control, or capital of another, or both of which have common control, management, or shareholders. Specifically, the rules apply to sale and purchase of goods; lease or sale of tangible assets; licensing, transfer, or use of intangible assets; provision of services; lending or borrowing of money; manufacturing arrangements; and any transaction that may affect profit and loss or any other incidental matter.
The rules are applicable to both domestic and cross-border related-party transactions.
## Thin capitalisation
Nigeria does not have thin capitalisation rules. However, interest deductibility rules were introduced based on the Finance Act 2019. This restricts interest deductibility to 30% of EBITDA. Excess interest can be carried forward for up to five years. The rules cover connected party debt, including third party debt guaranteed implicitly or explicitly by a connected person.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no specific CFC rules in Nigeria.


# Nigeria
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 16 September 2024
Except in rare circumstances, it is illegal for a non-resident company to operate through a branch in Nigeria. The Nigeria-source income of a non-resident company is taxable (_see the section for more information_).


# Nigeria
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 16 September 2024
Nigeria has various tax incentives intended to encourage investment in key sectors of the economy, as follows.
## Tax holidays
Pioneer companies investing in specified industrial activities may, on application, be granted a tax holiday for three years initially, which may be extended for up to two years upon satisfaction of specified conditions. Examples of economic activities that may be granted a tax holiday include glass and glassware manufacturing, manufacturing of fertilisers, and steel manufacturing.
A new company that engages in the mining of solid minerals is exempt from tax for the first three years of its operation.
Small or medium sized companies engaged in primary agricultural production are eligible for an initial tax-free period of four years, which may be extended for an additional two-year period, subject to satisfactory performance.
## Rural location incentives
Certain incentives are available to companies located in rural areas. The incentives take the form of tax reductions at graduated rates for enterprises located at least 20 kilometres from available electricity, water, and tarred roads. This incentive has been deleted effective 1 September 2023. However, there is scope to claim the incentive for expenditure incurred on or before the effective date.
## Export incentives
Export processing zones (EPZs) and free trade zones (FTZs) are locations within Nigeria designated by the government as free areas where export trade activities can be carried on free of tax and foreign exchange restrictions.
A company that is engaged in an approved manufacturing activity in an EPZ and incurs expenditures in its qualifying building and plant equipment is entitled to 100% capital allowance in that year of assessment.
In addition, a company that is 100% export oriented but located outside an EPZ will enjoy a three-year tax holiday, provided the company is not formed by splitting up or reconstruction of an already existing business and the export proceeds form at least 75% of its turnover.
Profits of companies whose supplies are exclusively inputs to the manufacture of products for export are exempt from tax. Such companies are expected to obtain a certificate of purchase of the input from the exporter in order to claim tax exemption.
Where plant and machinery are transferred to a new company, the tax written down value of the asset transferred must not exceed 25% of the total value of plant and machinery in the new company. The company should also repatriate at least 75% of the export earnings to Nigeria and place it in a Nigerian domiciliary account in order to qualify for a tax holiday.
Profits of any Nigerian company in respect of goods exported from Nigeria are exempt from tax, provided that the proceeds from such exports are repatriated to Nigeria and are used exclusively for the purchase of raw materials, plant, equipment, and spare parts. This exemption does not apply to companies in the oil and gas industry (upstream, midstream, and downstream).
In order to streamline the administration of permissible taxes within the tax-free zones, the Oil and Gas Free Zone Authority (OGFZA) has established the Free Zones Tax Administration (FZTA) Unit with effect from January 2015. Going forward, all tax matters relating to the free zones will be coordinated by the FZTA.
The tax exemption for FTZ companies is subject to such companies filing income tax and transfer pricing (where applicable) returns to the FIRS.
## Export Expansion Grant (EEG) Scheme
The EEG Scheme grants the Export Credit Certificate (ECC) as an incentive that can be used to settle all federal government taxes, such as VAT, WHT, CIT, etc. It can also be used to purchase government bonds and repay government credit facilities and debts due to the Assets Management Company of Nigeria (AMCON).
To encourage export of value added and processed/manufactured products, exporters are divided into four categories with maximum applicable EEG rates as indicated below:
  * Fully manufactured products: 15%.
  * Semi-manufactured products: 10%.
  * Processed/intermediate products: 7.5%.
  * Merchants/primary agricultural commodities: 5%.


## Gas utilisation incentives
Companies engaged in gas utilisation are entitled to:
  * A tax-free period for up to five years.
  * Accelerated capital allowance after the tax-free period.
  * Tax-free dividends during the tax-free period.


Investors in gas pipelines can obtain an additional tax-free period of five years.
On 28 February 2024, his Excellency, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR, signed three Executive Orders as part of the Federal Government of Nigeria’s commitment to improve the investment climate and position Nigeria as the preferred investment destination for the Petroleum Sector in Africa. The Executive Orders (hereinafter referred to as the Orders) became effective 28 February 2024.
Under one of the Orders, the Oil and Gas Companies (Tax Incentives, Exemption, Remission, etc.) Order 2024, a gas company shall be granted a 25% investment allowance on actual qualifying expenditure on plant and equipment incurred on any new and ongoing project. The allowance shall be granted as an allowable deduction from the assessable profits of the company from the year of purchase of the relevant plant and equipment. The allowance shall not be considered in ascertaining the residue of qualifying expenditure incurred on such plant and equipment. A company shall only be granted the allowance upon the expiration of the tax-free period granted under section 39(1) of the Companies Income Tax Act.
## Tourism incentives
25% of the income derived from tourism by hotels in convertible currencies is exempt from tax if such income is put in a reserve fund to be utilised within five years for expansion or construction of new hotels and other facilities for tourism development. This incentive has been deleted effective 1 September 2023. However, there is scope to utilise reserved funds prior to the effective date of the Act until the funds are fully utilised or the five years limit has elapsed, whichever occurs first.
## Interest incentives
Interest accruing on deposit accounts of a non-resident company is tax-exempt, provided the deposits are made by transfer of funds to Nigeria on or after 1 January 1990 and the depositor does not become non-resident after making the deposit while in Nigeria.
Interest on foreign-currency domiciliary accounts is also tax-exempt.
Interest on any foreign loans, and interest on any loan granted by a bank for the purpose of manufacturing goods for export, is exempt from tax as follows:
Repayment period | Moratorium | Exemption (%)  
---|---|---  
Over 7 years | Not less than 2 years | 70  
5 to 7 years | Not less than 1.5 years | 40  
2 to 4 years | Not less than 1 year | 10  
Interest on any loan granted by a bank to a company engaged in primary agricultural trade, fabrication of local plant and machinery, or as working capital to any cottage industry is 100% tax free if the loan has a moratorium of not less than 12 months and the rate of interest is not more than the base lending rate at the time the loan was granted, refinanced, or otherwise restructured.
## Investment allowances
An investment allowance of 10% on the cost of qualifying expenditures in respect of plant and machinery is available as a deduction from assessable profits in the year of purchase. This incentive has been deleted effective 1 September 2023. However, there is scope to claim the incentive for expenditure incurred on or before the effective date.
There is no restriction to the full claim of capital allowance in any year of assessment for companies in the mining, manufacturing, and agricultural sectors, and upstream and midstream gas operations.
## Road Infrastructure Development and Refurbishment Investment Tax Credit Scheme
Participants in the Road Infrastructure Development and Refurbishment Investment Tax Scheme are entitled to recover the cost incurred by them in the construction or refurbishment of eligible roads as credit against CIT payable. Participants are also entitled to a single uplift, equivalent to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Monetary Policy Rate plus 2% of the project cost. This uplift will not be taxable in the hand of the participant. The tax credit can be carried forward to subsequent years until it is fully utilised. A participant may sell or transfer its tax credit to other companies, as a form of security or otherwise.
## Foreign tax credit
Nigeria does not grant automatic tax credits to Nigerian companies for foreign tax on income derived from other countries. The Nigerian tax laws already provide for tax exemption for dividends, interest, and royalties.
Foreign tax credits are only granted based on the provisions of existing DTTs and partial credits as applicable to Commonwealth countries. In this regard, full tax credits are usually provided for in the DTTs. Tax credits for members of Commonwealth countries are granted at up to half the Nigerian CIT rate.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 16 September 2024
WHT is applicable on specified transactions as indicated below. There is no distinction between the WHT rates for resident companies or individuals and non-resident companies or individuals.
Types of payment | WHT for companies (%) | WHT for individuals (%)  
---|---|---  
Dividends, interest, and rents | 10 | 10  
Directors fees | N/A | 10  
Hire of equipment | 10 | 10  
Royalties | 10 | 5  
Commission, consultancy, technical, service fees | 10 | 5  
Management fees | 10 | 5  
Construction (roads, buildings, and bridges) | 2.5 | 5  
Contracts other than sales in the ordinary course of business | 5 | 5  
The period for filing WHT is 21 days after the duty to deduct arose for deductions from companies.
The penalty for failure to deduct or remit tax is 10% of the amount not deducted/remitted.
Note that companies are required to submit, in electronic form, a schedule of all their suppliers for the month showing the tax identification number (TIN), address of the suppliers, the nature of the transaction, WHT deducted, and invoice number.
## Double tax treaties (DTTs)
Nigeria has DTTs with the countries listed in the table below. Nigeria also has tax treaties with Kenya, Mauritius, and Poland; however, these treaties have not been ratified by the Nigerian National Assembly. The tax treaties with South Korea, Spain, and Sweden are still in the process of being ratified.

## The OECD Multilateral Instruments
On 17 August 2017, Nigeria became a signatory to the OECD’s Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) (‘Multilateral Instrument’ or ‘MLI’) and the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement for the Common Reporting Standard (CRS MCAA).
## The MLI
Nigeria signed the MLI and also submitted its MLI position listing DTTs with 19 treaty partners for amendment. These include the agreements that are already in force and those that are not yet in force (e.g. DTTs with Korea, Mauritius, United Arab Emirates). Also, of the 19 agreements, 13 treaty partners (including Belgium, Canada, China, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom) have all listed their DTTs with Nigeria for amendment under the MLI. Nigeria and its treaty partners will need to subsequently agree on any parts of their proposals that do not match. Subsequent to this, each partner will then need to undertake the local domestication process to ensure that the changes become law.
## The CRS MCAA
The CRS MCAA allows signatory countries to obtain financial information from financial institutions and automatically exchange the information with other jurisdictions that have signed up to the convention. Notably, the CRS MCAA will allow jurisdictions to exchange the following information:
  * Name, address, and tax identification number of taxpayers.
  * Taxpayer’s account number.
  * Name of the reporting financial institution.
  * The taxpayer’s account balance at the end of the reporting period.


Nigeria became the 94th jurisdiction to join the CRS MCAA. Some of the other signatories to the CRS MCAA include Bermuda, Cayman Islands, China, France, Germany, Mauritius, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
The FIRS issued the Income Tax (Common Reporting Standard) Regulations in 2019 (CRS Regulations).
This follows Nigeria’s signing of the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (MAC) and the MCAA on the Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information, signed by Nigeria on 17 August 2017.
Fundamentally, the CRS Regulations and the various agreements signed by the FIRS will allow it to receive specified information on the bank accounts held by Nigerian tax residents in up to 105 countries. In exchange, the FIRS will be obligated to provide similar information to these other countries. 
The CRS Regulations have an effective date of 1 July 2019 and require qualifying Nigerian Financial Institutions to submit an electronic information return (i.e. a return that reports specified financial account information of certain persons) to the FIRS on an annual basis. 
The information is to be provided in respect of 'reportable accounts', which, subject to certain exemptions, are the Nigerian accounts of persons who are resident for tax purposes in a foreign country with which Nigeria has signed the relevant exchange of information agreement.
Other relevant provisions include:
  * First reporting year: Starting from the 2019 calendar year.
  * Filing deadline for information return: 31 May of the year following the calendar year to which the returns relate.
  * Penalties for non-compliance: 
    * Failure to comply with duty or obligation imposed by the CRS Regulations: NGN 10 million in the first instance, in addition to NGN 1 million/month.
    * Failure by a financial institution to file information return: NGN 10 million in the first instance, in addition to NGN 1 million/month.
    * Furnishing false or incorrect information: NGN 5 million.
    * Failure by a financial Institution or any person to comply with the FIRS requirement in the exercise of its powers: NGN 1 million in the first instance, in addition to NGN 100,000/month.
    * Failure by a financial institution to keep records in accordance with the Regulations: NGN 1 million in the first instance, in addition to NGN 100,000/month.


## Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP)
The FIRS has issued guidelines on accessing the MAP in Nigeria. The guidelines provide guidance to taxpayers on the process for accessing the MAP as a means of dispute resolutions as contained in the various avoidance of DTTs between Nigeria and other countries.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 16 September 2024
The following income is subject to CIT in Nigeria:
  * Profits accruing in, derived from, brought into, or received in Nigeria in respect of any trade or business.
  * Dividends (extended to include compensating payment arising from Regulated Securities Lending Transaction), interest (extended to include compensating payment arising from Regulated Securities Lending Transaction), royalties, discounts, charges, or annuities.
  * Rent or any premium arising from the right granted to any person for the use or occupation of any property, where applicable.
  * Any source of annual profits or gain not falling within the preceding categories.
  * Fees, dues, and allowances (wherever paid) for services rendered.
  * Any amount of profits or gains arising from the acquisition or disposal of short-term money instruments like treasury bills, treasury or savings certificates, debenture certificates, and treasury bonds.


## Inventory valuation
The first in first out (FIFO) valuation method is commonly used. Average and standard cost methods are also allowed, but last in first out (LIFO) is not permitted. Other than the accounting requirement in the local generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), there are no special statutory provisions for inventory valuation.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are not subject to CIT but may be subject to CGT. _See Capital gains tax in the section for more information_.
## Dividend income
Dividends received by a Nigerian resident company from another Nigerian resident company are taxable at source (_see the section for more information_) and not subject to further tax.
Dividends received from non-resident companies are taxable except if repatriated into Nigeria through government-approved channels (i.e. any financial institution authorised by the Central Bank of Nigeria to deal in foreign currency transactions).
Dividends received from small manufacturing companies are exempt for CIT purposes during the first five years of operation. Dividends from investments in wholly export-oriented businesses are also exempt. Dividends paid to Unit Trusts and Real Estate Investment Companies are exempt from WHT.
### Stock dividends
Stock dividends (bonus shares) are subject to WHT similar to cash dividends addressed above but are not included in the taxable income of the recipient company.
## Interest income
Interest received by a Nigerian company is liable to tax at the relevant CIT rate, with tax withheld at 10% available as an offset against the final tax liability.
Interest on Federal Government bonds is tax exempt. Interest on foreign currency domiciliary accounts is also exempt.
Interest payable to a non-resident investor is liable to WHT at 10%, which is the final tax. Recipients who are resident in a country with a DTT with Nigeria enjoy a reduced rate of 7.5% (where it is stated expressly in the DTT).
## Royalty income
Royalties received by a Nigerian company are liable to tax at the relevant CIT rate. WHT at 10% is available as an offset against the final CIT liability.
Royalties received by a Nigerian company from non-resident payers are taxable except if repatriated into Nigeria through government-approved channels.
Non-resident companies who receive Nigerian royalties are subject only to WHT at 10%, which is reduced to 7.5% if a treaty is in place with Nigeria (and where it is stated expressly in the DTT).
## Other significant items
The following entities' income or profit is exempt for CIT purposes:
  * Statutory or registered friendly societies.
  * Co-operative societies registered under any ecclesiastical or charitable establishments of a public character.
  * Profit of a company established within an EPZ or FTZ (_see the section_).
  * Profit of a registered trade union.
  * Export profits, as long as proceeds are invested in raw materials, spare parts, and plant and machinery (_see Export incentives in the section_).
  * Small company's profit.


## Foreign income
A Nigerian resident company is taxable on its worldwide income. On the other hand, a non-resident company is subject to tax only on income derived from Nigeria.
Dividends, interest, rents, and royalties earned abroad and brought into Nigeria through government-approved channels are exempt from Nigerian tax; otherwise, the income is taxable at the CIT rate applicable based on the classification of the company (i.e. small, medium, or large) and tertiary education tax at 3%. Government-approved channels mean the Central Bank of Nigeria and any bank or financial institution authorised to carry out foreign exchange transactions.
Taxable foreign income earned by a Nigerian tax resident entity cannot be legally deferred.


# Nigeria
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 16 September 2024
Resident companies are liable to corporate income tax (CIT) on their worldwide income while non-residents are subject to CIT on their Nigeria-source income.
The CIT rate is 30% for large companies (i.e. companies with gross turnover greater than 100 million Nigerian naira [NGN]), assessed on a preceding year basis (i.e. tax is charged on profits for the accounting year ending in the year preceding assessment).
Investment income paid by a Nigerian resident to a non-resident is sourced in Nigeria and subject to WHT at source, which serves as the final tax.
In respect of business profits, a non-resident company (which is not tax resident in a treaty country) that has a fixed base or a permanent establishment (PE) in Nigeria is taxable on the profits attributable to that fixed base. Non-resident digital companies (which are not tax resident in a treaty country) that have a significant economic presence (SEP) will be subject to income tax in Nigeria on profit attributable to the taxable presence in Nigeria.
A foreign entity involved in digital transactions will be deemed to have created an SEP in Nigeria and is therefore liable to tax if it:
  1. derives income of NGN 25 million or equivalent in other currencies from Nigeria in a year
  2. uses a Nigerian domain name (.ng) or registers a website address in Nigeria, or
  3. has purposeful and sustained interactions with persons in Nigeria by customising its digital platform to target persons in Nigeria (e.g. by stating the prices of its products or services in naira).


For the purposes of (i) above, revenue derived from Nigeria includes that in respect of:
  * Streaming or downloading of digital contents.
  * Transmission of data collected about users in Nigeria.
  * Provision of goods or services directly or through a digital platform.
  * Intermediation services that link suppliers and customers in Nigeria.


Activities carried out by connected persons shall be aggregated to determine the NGN 25 million threshold (where applicable).
Any company covered under any multilateral agreement to which Nigeria is a party will be treated in accordance with those agreements from the effective date in Nigeria.
Non-resident companies providing professional, consultancy, management, and technical (PCMT) services to Nigeria residents will be subject to tax at 10% final tax where such company has an SEP in Nigeria.
A foreign entity providing technical (including training, advertising, supply of personnel), professional, management, or consultancy services shall have an SEP in Nigeria in any accounting year if it earns any income or receives any payment from a person resident in Nigeria or a fixed base or agent of a foreign entity in Nigeria.
As such, it is required to register for CIT and file its tax returns. Any WHT deducted at source from its Nigeria-source income is available as offset against the CIT liability save for non-resident companies carrying out PCMT services where the WHT paid at 10% is deemed to be final tax.
## Small company rates
The CIT rate is 0% for companies with gross turnover of NGN 25 million or less.
## Medium company rates
The CIT rate is 20% for companies with gross turnover greater than NGN 25 million and less than NGN 100 million.
## Real Estate Investment Companies
Real Estate Investment Companies approved by the Securities Exchange Commission to operate as a real estate investment scheme in Nigeria will be exempt from income tax on rental income, and dividend income earned in a financial year will be exempt from income tax provided that at least 75% of such income is distributed within 12 months. For the purposes of the CIT Act, A Real Estate Investment Company is a company (including a Real Estate Unit Trust) duly approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
## Petroleum profit tax (PPT)
PPT is a tax on the income of companies engaged in upstream petroleum operations _in lieu_ of CIT.
The PPT rates vary as follows:
  * 50% for petroleum operations under production sharing contracts (PSC) with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).
  * 65.75% for non-PSC operations, including joint ventures (JVs), in the first five years during which the company has not fully amortised all pre-production capitalised expenditure.
  * 85% for non-PSC operations after the first five years.
  * 30% for upstream gas profits.


Following the enactment of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021, holders of a Petroleum Prospecting Licence and Petroleum Mining Lease will be subject to both CIT at 30%, and Hydrocarbon Tax (HCT).
HCT rates are as follows:
  * 30% for converted/renewed onshore and shallow offshore Petroleum Mining Lease.
  * 15% for onshore and shallow onshore Prospecting Petroleum Licence and Marginal Fields.
  * Deep offshore is exempt from HCT.


This means that the highest headline tax rate for companies in the upstream oil and gas industry will be 60%.
Current Oil Mining Licence and Oil Prospecting Licence holders will continue to be taxed in line with the Petroleum Profits Tax Act (PPTA) unless a conversion contract is executed in line with the provisions of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021.
## Tertiary education tax
Tertiary education tax is imposed on every Nigerian company at the rate of 3% of the assessable profit for each year of assessment. The tax is payable within two months of an assessment notice from the FIRS. In practice, many companies pay the tax on a self-assessment basis along with their CIT.
For companies subject to PPT under the PPTA, tertiary education tax is to be treated as an allowable deduction. For other companies, income/profit taxes are not deductible in arriving at taxable income. Tertiary education tax is not tax deductible for companies subject to income tax under the Petroleum Industry Act 2021.
Non-resident companies and unincorporated entities are exempt from tertiary education tax.
## Minimum tax
Minimum tax is payable by companies having no taxable profits for the year or where the tax on profits is below the minimum tax. However, companies in the first four calendar years of business, companies engaged in primary agriculture business, or small companies are exempt from minimum tax.
Minimum tax payable is calculated as 0.5% of gross turnover less franked investment income.
For non-life insurance companies, minimum tax is calculated as 0.5% of gross premium.
For life insurance companies, minimum tax is calculated as 0.5% of gross income.
## Alternative tax on distribution
There is a tax on distribution where a company pays a dividend in excess of its taxable profit. Certain profits should be deducted from the dividend that is compared to the taxable profit, including dividend income that has suffered WHT, profits exempt under the Companies Income Tax, Capital Gains Tax, Petroleum Profit Tax, Industrial Development (Income Tax Relief) Act, and retained earnings that had suffered tax previously.
## Alternative tax on deemed profit
The law allows the FIRS to assess and charge companies to tax on a fair and reasonable percentage of turnover under the following circumstances:
  * When the trade or business produces no assessable profits.
  * When the trade or business produces assessable profits that, in the opinion of the Board of the FIRS, are less than might be expected to arise from that trade or business.
  * When the true amount of the assessable profits of the company cannot be ascertained.


The above provision of the law also applies to foreign digital companies deriving profits from Nigeria.
## Local income taxes
CIT is payable only to the federal government. State governments collect income taxes of individuals and unincorporated entities, while local governments are only allowed to collect levies and rates but not income tax.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 16 September 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate is 7.5% (increased from 5% on 1 February 2020).
Zero-rated items include goods and services purchased by diplomats and goods purchased for use in humanitarian donor-funded projects. Exempt items include plants and machinery for use in export processing zones (EPZs) or free trade zones (FTZs), basic food items (based on a specific list), medical products and services, pharmaceutical products, books and educational materials, and exported services. 
MTN, Airtel, government agencies, banks, and oil and gas companies are required to deduct at source VAT charged by their suppliers and remit it to the tax authority. All other organisations are required to collect VAT charged on their invoices from their customers for filing and payment to the tax authority.
The Finance Act 2019 has introduced a reverse-charge mechanism for services from which no tax invoice was received. VAT returns are filed on a cash basis.
The FIRS has implemented a platform for auto tracking and remittance of VAT known as FIRS VAT-Collect. Some of the users of the system are domestic airlines (for instant remittance of VAT on their ticket sales) and other retailers.
Non-resident digital companies (as appointed by the tax authorities) rendering services to Nigerian customers are required to charge, collect VAT, and remit to the FIRS in the currency of transaction.
## Customs duties
Customs duties in Nigeria are levied only on imports. Rates vary for different items, typically from 5% to 35%, and are assessed with reference to the prevailing Harmonised Commodity and Coding System (HS code).
Airlines registered in Nigeria and providing commercial air transport services are entitled to duty-free importation of their aircraft, engines, spare parts, and components, whether purchased or leased.
The Customs Service announced the duty waiver covering items such as husked brown rice, grain sorghum, millet, maize, wheat, and beans. The waiver is effective from 15 July 2024 through 31 December 2024.
## Excise duties
Excise duty is applicable on beer and stout, wines, spirits, cigarettes, and homogenised tobacco manufactured in or imported into Nigeria at 20%.
Excise duties on tobacco and alcoholic beverages have increased effective 1 June 2022, whilst excise duties have been introduced on non-alcoholic beverages and all services. The new regime applies only to tobacco and its products (such as cigarettes), alcoholic beverages (beers and stouts, spirits, and wines), non-alcoholic beverages, and telecommunication services (only) as follows:
### Tobacco
From 1 June 2022, in addition to the 30% _ad valorem_ rate, a specific rate of NGN 4.2 will be paid on each cigarette stick (NGN 84 per pack of 20 sticks).
In 2023, the specific rate will increase to NGN 4.7 per stick (NGN 94 per pack of 20 sticks). In 2024, the specific rate will increase to NGN 5.2 per stick (NGN 104 per pack of 20 sticks).
### Beer and stout
With respect to alcoholic beverages, no _ad valorem_ rate is applicable.
In 2022, NGN 40 per litre is payable on beer and stout. In 2023 and 2024, NGN 45 per litre and NGN 50 per litre will be payable, respectively.
### Wines
From 1 June 2022, in addition to the 20% _ad valorem_ rate, a specific rate of NGN 50 per litre will be paid.
In 2023, the specific rate will increase to NGN 60 per litre. In 2024, the specific rate will increase to NGN 70 per litre.
### Spirits
From 1 June 2022, in addition to the 20% _ad valorem_ rate, a specific rate of NGN 50 per litre will be paid.
In 2023, the specific rate will increase to NGN 65 per litre. In 2024, the specific rate will increase to NGN 75 per litre.
### Non-alcoholic, carbonated, and sweetened beverages
Excise duty will apply to non-alcoholic, carbonated, and sweetened beverages (including fruit juices and energy drinks) at a specific rate of N10 per litre.
### Telecommunication services
The Finance Act 2020 provides a framework for levying excise duty on telecommunication services provided in Nigeria at rates to be determined by the President. The Fiscal Policy Measures and Tariffs Amendments 2022 introduced excise duties of 5% on postpaid and prepaid telecommunication services. This is yet to be implemented.
## Property taxes
Property taxes in Nigeria are usually levied annually by the state government with varying rates depending on the state and the location of the property within the state. The two major property taxes are governor’s consent fee and land registration fee. In Lagos (which is the economic hub of Nigeria), governor’s consent fee, land registration fees, and other levies payable to the state give rise to a total levy of 3% of the fair value of the land.
Also, Right of Occupancy fee and tenement rates are chargeable by state and local government authorities.
## Stamp duties
Under the Stamp Duty Act, stamp duty is payable on any agreement executed in Nigeria or relating, whatsoever, to any property situated in or to any matter or thing done in Nigeria. Instruments that are required to be stamped under the Stamp Duties Act must be stamped within 40 days of first execution.
Stamp duty is chargeable either at fixed rates or _ad valorem_ (i.e. in proportion to the value of the consideration), depending on the class of instrument. Stamp duty is imposed at the rate of 0.75% on the authorised share capital at incorporation of a company or on registration of new shares.
All deposit banks and financial institutions are required to charge stamp duties of NGN 50 on every eligible transaction above NGN 10,000. There are exemptions for transactions between accounts held by the same bank customer and for salary accounts.
The 2020 Finance Act has modified section 89(3) of the Stamp Duties Act to remove electronic transfer from the scope of stamp duty and introduced an electronic money transfer levy, which is applicable on electronic receipts or electronic transfer for money deposited in a financial institution, on any type of account. The applicable levy is NGN 50 on any transfer of NGN 10,000 or more.
## Capital gains tax (CGT)
Gains accruing to a chargeable person (individual or company) on the disposal of chargeable assets shall be subject to tax under the CGT Act at the rate of 10%. There is no distinction between long-term and short-term gains and no inflation adjustment to cost for CGT purposes.
All forms of assets, including options, debts, goodwill, and foreign currency, other than those specifically exempt, are liable for CGT.
The gains on the disposal of shares in a Nigerian company are subject to CGT, subject to certain exemptions (i.e transactions valued above NGN 100 million or where the gains are reinvested in a Nigerian company within a 12-month period or where the transaction is related to a regulated securities lending transaction).
CGT is applicable on the chargeable gains received or brought into Nigeria in respect of assets situated outside Nigeria.
Capital losses are not allowed as an offset against chargeable gains accruing to a person from the disposal of any assets.
There is a requirement to self-assess and remit CGT due no later than 30 June and 31 December of the same year upon the disposal of a chargeable asset.
In relation to compensation for loss of office, only the excess above NGN 10 million is chargeable to CGT at 10%. The employer is required to deduct and remit the CGT within the time specified for the payment of PAYE tax.
## Police Fund Levy
The Act imposes a levy of 0.005% on the 'net profit' of companies ‘operating business’ in Nigeria. This levy will be paid to the FIRS. This requirement is for five years, till 23 June 2024.
## Payroll contribution
Under the Employee Compensation Act, all employers were required to contribute 1% of their payroll cost in the first two years of commencement of the Act (2010 to 2012). Subsequently, assessments were expected to be issued by the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund, the body empowered to administer and implement the Act. In practice, a contribution of 1% of payroll continues to apply.
## Pension contributions
Employers with at least 15 employees are required to participate in a contributory pension scheme for their employees. The minimum contribution is 18% of monthly emolument (with a minimum contribution of 10% by the employer and 8% by the employee). If the employer decides to bear all the contribution, the minimum contribution is 20% of monthly emolument. Mandatory and/or voluntary contributions by the employers are deductible for CIT purposes.
## National Housing Fund (NHF) contributions
NHF contributions are applicable to Nigerian employees earning a minimum of NGN 30,000 _per annum_. The employer is required to deduct 2.5% of gross income from employees earning more than NGN 30,000 _per annum_ and remit it to the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria within one month of deduction. The levy is voluntary for employees in private employment.
## Information technology levy
A company with an annual turnover of NGN 100 million or more is required to pay 1% of its profit before CIT as information technology tax. This levy is deductible for CIT purposes when paid (typically in the year of assessment following that in which the payment was made).
This tax is applicable to:
  * Banking and other financial activities, including capital and money market operators, mortgage institutions, and micro-finance banks.
  * Insurance activities, including brokerage.
  * Pension fund administration, pension management, and related services.
  * GSM service providers and telecommunication companies.
  * Cyber and internet services providers.


## National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure Act (NASENI Act) levy
NASENI was established in 1992 under the NASENI Act to contribute to science and technology advancement in Nigeria. Prior to the Finance Act 2021, the Act imposed a levy of 0.25% of the turnover of commercial companies. However, there was no clarity on the modalities for administering the levy, and it was not assessed in practice.
The law now empowers the FIRS to collect the levy and provides that the levy is now to be computed at 0.25% of the profit before tax (as against turnover) of commercial companies in the banking, mobile communication, ICT, aviation, maritime, and oil and gas sectors. Companies with annual turnovers below NGN 100 million are not liable.
## Cabotage levy 
The Coastal and Inland Shipping (Cabotage) Act restricts the use of foreign vessels in domestic coastal trade with the purpose of promoting indigenous tonnage, to establish a cabotage vessel financing fund, and for related matters. The levy is applied as a 2% surcharge of the contract sums earned by vessels engaged in coastal trade in Nigeria.
## Levy on contracts awarded in the upstream oil and gas sector
The Nigerian Content Development Act was introduced to increase the level of Nigerian participation in the oil and gas industry. The Act imposes a levy of 1% on every contract awarded in the upstream oil and gas sector of the economy. Any violation of the Act is liable for a fine of 5% of the contract value and may result in outright cancellation of the contract.
