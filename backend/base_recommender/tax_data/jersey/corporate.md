## Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Pillar Two
The OECD has designed a framework to introduce a global minimum tax for large multinational enterprise (MNE) groups, known as Pillar Two. This framework would only apply to certain MNE groups that have annual revenue of 750 million euros (EUR) or more in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Ultimate Parent Entity (UPE) in at least two of the four fiscal years immediately preceding the tested fiscal year. The Pillar Two Model Rules provide two complementary measures, the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) and the Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR), whereby jurisdictional profits taxed at less than an effective rate of tax of 15% would be targeted for additional taxation. These measures encourage low tax jurisdictions to implement a Domestic Minimum Tax (DMT) so that such top-up taxes are collected by the jurisdiction in which they arise, rather than different jurisdictions under the IIR or UTPR.
On 22 May 2024, the Government of Jersey announced that its domestic minimum tax would take the form of a new standalone multinational corporate income tax which would be aligned with the OECD GloBE Model Rules.
Draft legislation introducing Jersey’s ‘Multinational Corporate Income Tax’ (“MCIT”) was published on 14 August 2024. As expected, this is largely aligned with OECD GloBE Model Rules, adopting many of the definitions directly into Jersey’s domestic law.
The draft MCIT legislation was adopted by the States of Jersey on 22nd October 2024, with the law coming into effect for accounting periods starting on or after 1 January 2025.
For accounting periods starting on or after 1 January 2025, in-scope Jersey companies and branches of multinational groups will pay an effective tax rate of 15% under the new MCIT.
Jersey will not be enacting a UTPR at this time.
## Economic substance
### Companies
Jersey introduced economic substance legislation for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Jersey tax resident companies carrying on relevant activities will be required to meet an economic substance test.
Relevant activities are defined as any of the following businesses:
  * Banking
  * Insurance
  * Fund management
  * Finance and leasing
  * Headquarters
  * Shipping
  * Holding company
  * Intellectual property holding
  * Distribution and service centre


Self-managed funds are required to demonstrate they have substance in Jersey for any financial period that commences on or after 1 January 2021. Self-managed funds are always treated as having received income from the relevant activity of fund management, so the gross income test does not apply.
There are financial penalties in the case of failure to meet the economic substance test. In the first financial period up to 10,000 British pounds sterling (GBP), in the second period up to GBP 100,000. After the first penalty, the Comptroller may provide the Minister for Treasury and Resources with a report on the company, and the Minister may apply to the court for an order of winding up. There is provision for appeal against penalty determinations.
The requirements for companies with regards to the economic substance test dictate that they must be directed and managed in Jersey, undertake their core income generating activities (CIGA) in Jersey, and have adequate employees, expenditure, and physical assets in Jersey.
### Partnerships
On 29 June 2021, a law extending Jersey's economic substance regime to partnerships was passed. The economic substance requirements will apply to a Jersey 'resident partnership' undertaking a 'relevant activity' unless it is exempt.
The exemptions are detailed as follows:
  * 'Domestic exemption': These are partnerships with activities only within Jersey that are also not part of a multinational group
  * 'Individual exemption': These are partnerships with only Jersey tax resident partners already subject to tax in Jersey
  * 'Collective investment funds'
  * 'Place of effective management (POEM) outside of Jersey': Those partnerships with a POEM in a qualifying jurisdiction (i.e. with a tax rate higher than 10% for a company or individual) or if the partnership is required to comply with a similar economic substance test in that jurisdiction.


Partnerships in existence before 1 July 2021 are in scope of the law for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2022. Partnerships formed on or after 1 July 2021 are in scope from the date of formation.
The law is broadly aligned with the company economic substance regime, summarised above, although there are points of divergence particularly relating to exemptions and sanctions for failing the economic substance test.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 08 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year is the calendar year. Companies are assessed on income earned in respect of the financial year that ends within the applicable calendar year of assessment.
## Tax returns
The system relies on the filing of a return of information with the Jersey tax authority, which then raises an assessment (in the case of companies taxed at 10% or 20% on all or part of their income).
The 2019 tax return form included a number of changes from the previous year. These changes were required for the full implementation of economic substance rules and to collect the additional data needed by the government of Jersey to maintain and improve levels of tax compliance. For the 2019 tax return and subsequent periods, all companies will be required to submit an electronic copy of their accounts alongside their company tax return.
There is a filing deadline for the corporate return of midnight on 30 November following the year of assessment and a late filing penalty of GBP 300. Where a return remains outstanding after three months, a penalty of GBP 100 will be imposed every month the return remains outstanding, up to a maximum of nine months.
Jersey resident partnerships, as defined under the economic substance regime, will be required to file a 'combined notification' with effect from the 2022 year of assessment, due on 30 November following the year of assessment. The combined notification requires declarations in respect of tax and economic substance.
Prior to the 2022 year of assessment, the corporate tax filing deadline was 31 December following the year of assessment.
## Payment of tax
For companies, tax is payable in arrears during the calendar year following the year of assessment.
The Jersey tax payment system changed with effect from the 2019 year of assessment. For the first time, a separate category of payment dates was set for large remitters. A large remitter is broadly defined as a company whose tax liability exceeds GBP 500,000 for each of the two years preceding the year of assessments in respect of which the payment is being made. An instalment payment is required by 31 March and the balance is due by 30 September (in the year following the year of assessment).
All other companies are required to make an instalment payment by 31 May, and the balance is due by 30 November (in the year following the year of assessment).
Tax paid late will be subject to interest and a late payment surcharge. 
## Tax audit process
There is no formal tax audit process in Jersey.
## Statute of limitations
If the Comptroller discovers profits have not been fully assessed, the Comptroller can issue an amended/additional assessment at any time not later than two years after the expiration of the year of assessment. If the error involves fraud, wilful default, or neglect, then the assessment can be revised at any time.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The Jersey Taxes Office is currently focusing on tax compliance reform.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 08 January 2025
A company is regarded as tax resident in Jersey if it is incorporated in Jersey or if it has its place of central management and control in Jersey. However, a Jersey incorporated company that is managed and controlled elsewhere will not be regarded as a Jersey resident, provided certain conditions are satisfied.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Under domestic legislation, a PE, in relation to a company, includes a branch of the company, a factory, shop, workshop, quarry, or a building site, and a place of management of the company; however, the fact that the directors of a company regularly meet in Jersey shall not, of itself, make their meeting place a PE.
For a definition of PE contained in Jersey’s double tax agreements (DTAs), the relevant clause and agreement should be reviewed. In general, it may include a branch, management, or other fixed place of business, but not an agency, unless the agent has, and habitually exercises, a general authority to negotiate and conclude contracts or has a stock of merchandise from which the agent regularly fills orders.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 08 January 2025
Normally, business deductions are allowed if they are incurred wholly and exclusively for trade purposes.
## Depreciation and depletion
Capital allowances are available using the diminishing-balance method on machinery and equipment, including vehicles, at a rate of 25%. For this purpose, all such assets are pooled, and the allowance is calculated by reference to the value of the pool.
On disposal of an asset, the lower of cost and sale proceeds of the asset is deducted from the pool. A balancing charge is levied if the proceeds exceed the balance of the pool.
Motor vehicles over a certain value and greenhouses are subject to special rules and are not pooled with other assets.
By concession, an alternative is to claim the full cost of replacement in the year of replacement.
Capital allowances are not applicable to buildings or the depletion of natural resources.
## Goodwill
Goodwill expenditure is non-deductible for Jersey income tax purposes.
## Start-up expenses
Once a company has commenced its trade, start-up expenditure will be deductible for tax purposes if it is not capital in nature and has been incurred wholly and exclusively for trade purposes.
## Interest expenses
Interest expense will be deductible if it is incurred for the purposes of a trade or is paid in connection with a loan taken out for a qualifying purpose. Interest relief may be restricted if the interest exceeds the amount that could reasonably be expected to be charged on a commercial basis.
## Bad debts
Trading bad debts are normally deductible for Jersey income tax purposes unless they relate to a general provision.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions are generally non-deductible for tax purposes, unless the contribution itself provides a benefit to the trade (i.e. marketing).
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are generally non-deductible for tax purposes.
## Taxes
Local income tax paid is not deductible in computing taxable income. ISE fees paid are a tax-deductible expense.
## Net operating losses
No distinction is drawn between different types of income or losses arising from different trades or sources, apart from Jersey property income, which is separately streamed.
Unrelieved losses may be carried forward and used to offset profits in future accounting periods. Alternatively, losses can be group relieved to group companies in the same income tax rate band.
There are only very limited circumstances where a company can obtain relief for carrying back losses.
Where a company has sustained a loss, this loss can be carried forward indefinitely and can be set off against future profits in respect of the same trade.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
There are no withholding taxes (WHTs) on patent royalties paid by Jersey companies to non-residents.
## RegTech Super-Deduction
In support of the Budget for Innovation, eligible companies, charged to Jersey income tax as financial services companies (i.e. at 10%) and registered with the Jersey Financial Services Commission under the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999, are now able to receive a 150% deduction on eligible expenditure. This includes computer hardware, software (including software subscriptions and licences), and training that is delivered by an external provider on such hardware or software. The eligible activities broadly include the prevention of financial crime, management of data, and other activities required by the Jersey Financial Services Commission.
There are anti-avoidance provisions for connected parties to prevent manipulation of this new relief.


# Jersey, Channel Islands
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 08 January 2025
Group taxation is not permitted in Jersey. However, there are provisions for group relief between group companies subject to the same rate of tax. It is not possible to relieve losses between two companies taxed at different rates. It is not possible for group companies to relieve losses from Jersey property rental income. Also, it is only possible to relieve losses from Jersey property development profits and from quarrying activities against profits arising from the same activities.
## Transfer pricing
There are no specific rules in relation to transfer pricing in Jersey. There is, however, a general anti-avoidance provision in Jersey tax law. It may be applied by the Comptroller of Revenue if a transaction or a combination or series of transactions is entered into for the avoidance or reduction of Jersey income tax. In addition, interest relief may be restricted where the interest incurred exceeds the amount that could reasonably be expected to be charged on a commercial basis.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting regime
Jersey has formally committed to the OECD model of CbC reporting and has already put in place the relevant implementing regulations for entities with accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2016. In addition, Jersey has signed up to the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) to assist with the sharing of relevant information in relation to CbC reporting, as well as broadly adopting the OECD’s CbC reporting implementation package, to facilitate its implementation of this BEPS minimum standard.
Multinationals having global revenues of EUR 750 million or more are required to file annual reports to tax authorities at three levels. The first element is a ‘country-by-country report’ that gives a detailed picture of business results for each country where the business operates (including things like number of employees, revenues, pre-tax profit, and taxes paid). Companies will also need to give an overall picture of their global business, aggregating data from all of the countries where one operates. In addition, companies will be required to report separately to each country where they operate with business and tax information about the local entities and operations in that country.
The disclosure of this business information will be accessible, through automatic information exchanges, to tax authorities wherever they have a presence (subject to certain conditions). Groups will need to consider how to explain their operational purpose of business arrangements, which may include tax advantages.
The deadline for submission of the CbC report to the Jersey tax authority is within 12 months of the end of the accounting period to which it relates.
Where there is no reporting obligation, there is a requirement to notify the Comptroller of Revenue of the name of the entity that is undertaking the reporting and to provide certain other information. An entity must notify the Comptroller by the last day of relevant accounting period if it is a constituent entity.
## Thin capitalisation
There are no specific rules in relation to thin capitalisation in Jersey.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Jersey has no CFC legislation.

## Intergovernmental agreements (IGAs)
On 13 December 2013, the Jersey authorities signed an IGA with the United States to facilitate tax reporting under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) regime. The Jersey authorities also signed a similar IGA with the United Kingdom on 22 October 2013. The IGA with the United Kingdom is sometimes known as UK FATCA. This is because the information exchanged under the UK IGA is similar to that exchanged with the United States under FATCA.
## Tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs)
The Jersey tax authorities are committed to being tax transparent, with an increased emphasis on agreeing to further DTAs and TIEAs. Jersey has signed TIEAs with 38 countries and is negotiating DTAs with several other jurisdictions (_see Foreign income in the section for a description of DTAs that have been signed_).
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
Jersey adopted the global CRS on Automatic Exchange of Information on 1 January 2016. The first reporting took place in 2017.
## Mandatory Disclosure Regime (MDR)
On 9 September 2020, the government of Jersey passed legislation introducing MDR aligned to The OECD Model Mandatory Disclosure Rules for CRS Avoidance Arrangements and Opaque Offshore Structures.
At the time of writing, despite the law having been made, it has yet to be brought into force. Although a date is yet to be confirmed, it is expected to be implemented in due course and Revenue Jersey have expressed a commitment to giving industry six months notice.
Once in force, the law will require promoters, service providers, and, in some circumstance, users of CRS avoidance arrangements and opaque offshore structures to provide the Comptroller of Revenue with information about those arrangements and structures within a 30-day window of, broadly, the arrangement being made available.
It is intended that information relating to users resident in other jurisdictions will be exchanged with the tax authority of that jurisdiction in accordance with the terms of the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on the automatic exchange regarding CRS avoidance arrangements and opaque offshore structures, also ratified by the States of Jersey on 9 September 2020.

## Inventory valuation
Inventory is valued at the lower of historical cost or net realisable value. The last in first out (LIFO) method is not permitted. Generally, there are no material differences between accounts prepared on a normal accounting basis and those prepared on a tax basis.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are not subject to tax in Jersey.
## Dividend income
Any dividends received will be dealt with under the Income Tax Law, as amended.
Under the current rules, a financial services company receiving a dividend from which tax has been deducted by another Jersey company is entitled to a tax credit. The calculation of the tax credit available to a financial services company under these circumstances has been amended so as to limit the credit to the lower of the tax deducted from the dividend or the gross dividend at the rate of 10%.
Where a Jersey company is in receipt of a dividend that is paid out of capital profits, it should be exempt from tax only if they are ‘realised’ capital profits.
### Stock dividends
Stock dividends are not taxed as income.
## Interest income
Interest income forms part of taxable income and is taxed at the rate applicable to the company.
## Royalty income
Royalty income forms part of taxable income and is taxed at the rate applicable to the company.
## Rental income
Income from Jersey real estate, including rental income, property development profits, and income from exploiting Jersey land (e.g. quarrying activities), is subject to tax at 20%.
## Foreign income
Income tax is levied on foreign branch income when earned and on foreign dividends, interest, rents, and royalties. Double taxation is mitigated by either the granting of unilateral relief to the extent of taxing foreign income net of foreign taxes or by treaty relief, which gives credit for foreign tax. Concessional credit relief might be granted in certain limited circumstances upon application.
Jersey currently has DTAs with Australia, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Faroes, Finland, France, Germany, Greenland, Guernsey, Hong Kong, Iceland, Isle of Man, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Mauritius, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Qatar, Rwanda, Seychelles, Singapore, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. The scope varies from agreement to agreement, but most are of limited scope.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 08 January 2025
Resident companies are generally taxed on their worldwide income. A permanent establishment (PE), e.g. a branch of a company, is taxed on profits attributable to the PE. Non-resident companies are taxable on Jersey real estate income.
Companies are liable to income tax at a rate of 0%, 10%, or 20% on taxable income. The general rate applicable is 0%; the 10% and 20% rates apply to certain companies/income streams as explained in this section. The tax rate applies to the company as a whole, the only exception being Jersey-source real property income, which is taxed at 20% regardless of the classification of the real property holding company.
Certain Collective Investment Funds and Securitisation Vehicles can elect to be exempt from tax on income, other than income from Jersey land or property, for an annual fee of GBP 500.
### 10% rate
The 10% rate applies to Jersey financial services companies. A company is defined as a financial services company, under Article 123D of the Income Tax (Jersey) Law 1961, if:
  * it is registered under the Financial Services (Jersey) Law 1998 to carry out investment business; trust company business; fund services business as an administrator, custodian, or registrar in relation to an unclassified or unregistered fund; or general insurance mediation business as described in either class P or class Q in Part 3 of the Schedule to the Financial Services (Financial Service Business) (Jersey) Order 2009
  * it is registered under the Banking Business (Jersey) Law 1991
  * it holds a permit under the Collective Investment Funds (Jersey) Law 1988 as an administrator, registrar, or custodian
  * it holds either a Category A or Category B permit under the Insurance Business (Jersey) Law 1996, or
  * it is a company trading in the provision of credit facilities to customers by way of making any advance or granting of any credit, including (but not limited to): 
    * the provision, in connection with the supply of goods by hire purchase, leasing, conditional sale, or credit sale, of credit in instalments for which a separate charge is made and disclosed to the customer, and
    * any assignment to the company of an advance or credit repayable by the customer to a person other than the company.


### 20% rate
The 20% tax rate applies to Jersey-based utility companies, such as telephone, gas, and electricity companies. Additionally, income from Jersey real estate, including rental income, property development profits, and income from exploiting Jersey land (e.g. quarrying activities) is subject to tax at 20%. Companies involved in oil importation and supply are also taxed at 20%.
As of 1 January 2022, a company in the cannabis industry (i.e. one that cultivates cannabis plants, processes cannabis plants for any purpose, or distributes, sells, or further processes cannabis plants that have been cultivated or processed) is also subjected to the 20% tax rate.
Large corporate retailers are also in scope of the standard 20% tax rate. A 'large corporate retailer' is a company that meets the following tests:
  * 60% of its trading turnover is from retail sales to customers in Jersey, and
  * retail sales to customers in Jersey are equal to or greater than GBP 2 million _per annum_.


'Retail sales' does not include wholesale supplies or the provision of services.
Where the taxable profits of a 'large corporate retailer' are less than GBP 500,000 _per annum_ , the company is subject to tax at 0% on all of its profits.
Where the taxable profits of a 'large corporate retailer' are GBP 750,000 or more _per annum_ , the company is subject to tax at 20% on all of its profits.
Where the taxable profits of a 'large corporate retailer' are more than GBP 500,000 but less than GBP 750,000 _per annum_ , a tapering provision will apply. The effect of the tapering provision for 'large corporate retailers' with taxable profits of between GBP 500,000 and GBP 750,000 _per annum_ is to reduce the effective rate of tax on a sliding scale from 0% up to 20%.
### 0% rate
The 0% rate applies to all entities that are not exempt, financial services entities, large corporate retailers, cannabis businesses or utility companies, including fund managers who do not hold any of the permits mentioned above.
## Local income taxes
There are no parish or local government taxes on income.

## Goods and services tax (GST)
The standard rate of GST is 5%.
Companies with taxable supplies of more than GBP 300,000 _per annum_ are required to register for GST.
From 1 July 2023, where retailers trading outside Jersey sell goods to consumers in Jersey (online, through brochures, magazine sales, or others) and where the value of such sales by any retailer to consumers in Jersey exceeds GBP 300,000 _per annum_ , such retailers will have to register and account for Jersey GST on all these sales.
### International service entity (ISE) status
To address the difficulty of irrecoverable input tax in the financial services sector, and to mitigate the administrative cost of GST for exporters in general, Jersey has introduced the concept of an ISE. Where an entity qualifies for this status:
  * it will not be required to register for GST
  * services to it will be zero-rated (i.e. treated as an export) where the supply exceeds GBP 1,000, and
  * input tax on purchases of less than GBP 1,000 may be reclaimed.


ISE status is automatically available to a wide variety of service providers and administered entities based in Jersey, upon application and payment of the relevant fee, including licensed banks, licensed trust service providers, licensed fund administrators, fund managers, and managed managers.
Other entities not automatically eligible under one of the categories above, including companies, partnerships, trusts, unrecognised funds, and special purpose vehicles, may still obtain ISE status if they fulfil certain criteria.
The ISE may, at the election of the company, be included on a list maintained by the Comptroller of Revenue. The list will refer either to the entity itself or (e.g. for administered entities) a class of entities as submitted by the administrator.
## Customs duties
A common customs tariff may apply to goods imported from outside the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom (UK), Guernsey, or the Isle of Man. The amount is dependent on what the goods are and where they are imported from.
## Excise taxes
An excise duty tax is payable on imported items, such as alcohol, tobacco, and fuel, at varying rates.
## Property taxes
Taxes on properties in Jersey include income tax on Jersey-source property income, stamp duty on Jersey real estate, and rates levied by each parish.
### Enveloped Property Transaction Tax (EPTT)
EPTT came into force on 4 April 2022.
This is the tax equivalent to stamp duty on the transfer of property that is 'enveloped' (e.g. held within a company), and the rate of EPTT charged will align with the rate of tax charged under the Stamp Duty Law.
EPTT is levied on the transfer of a significant interest in immovable residential or commercial enveloped properties in Jersey, and the scope includes where the property is owned outright or where it is held under a contract lease.
There are a number of thresholds and exemptions that apply, including where a transaction has been subject to land transaction tax (_see below_).
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is payable on the purchase or transfer of Jersey real estate, with varying rates. Mortgages secured by a charge over Jersey real estate are subject to stamp duty at rates of up to 0.5% of the amount borrowed. Higher rates of stamp duty apply on the purchase of Jersey residential properties that are not a person's 'main residence'.
No stamp duty is payable on the transfer of shares except in certain circumstances where those shares confer a direct or indirect interest in Jersey real estate.
## Land transaction tax
A land transaction tax applies when shares in companies are transferred and the ownership of which confers a right of occupation of residential real estate in Jersey. The amount of land transaction tax payable is equal to the stamp duty that would have been suffered if the real estate were held directly.
## Payroll taxes
Employers are required to deduct tax from salaries paid to employees and remit this to the tax authority to settle the employees’ tax liability. Under the Income Tax Instalment System (ITIS), the tax authority issues each employee with an effective rate notice to pass to their employer indicating the deduction rate. If no such notice is provided, the default rate of deduction applied is 22%.
## Social security contributions
Employers are responsible for paying employer social security contributions at a rate of 6.5% on each employee’s gross earnings, up to the monthly standard earnings limit of GBP 5,800 for 2025 (GBP 5,450 for 2024). Employer social security contributions of 2.5% apply to employees’ earnings above the standard earnings limit, up to a monthly upper earnings limit of GBP 26,442 for 2025 (GBP 24,850 for 2024).
A long-term care fund has been set up to help those who need long-term care.
Income taxpayers pay into this fund with a long-term care contribution. Those not liable for income tax do not have to pay the contribution.
