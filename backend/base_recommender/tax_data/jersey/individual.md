## Unilateral relief on overseas employment income
Jersey residents who earn employment income by virtue of working in another jurisdiction may be chargeable to tax on this income in the other jurisdiction. If Jersey has a double tax agreement (DTA) with this jurisdiction, the taxpayer will receive a credit against their income tax assessment for the tax already paid overseas.
A new relief has been introduced for employment income received from working in another country with which Jersey does not have a DTA. This will allow Jersey residents receiving employment income from these jurisdictions to receive a tax credit for the lower of the foreign tax paid or the tax charged at the standard rate (20%) in Jersey on the income.
## 60-day tax exemption for business travellers
A new tax exemption has been introduced for short-term business visitors. The Jersey income of individuals travelling into Jersey on business for 60 days or less in a year will be exempt from income tax in Jersey. The 60-day threshold is cumulative, meaning workers can come and go throughout the year, as long as a total of 60 days in Jersey is not exceeded.
Additionally, businesses that only employ short-term business visitors are not required to register with Revenue Jersey. Employers that have a mixture of Jersey employees and short-term business visitors will not be required to file monthly returns, or make deductions, in respect of the short-term business visitors. These measures are designed to ease administrative pressures for employers.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 08 January 2025
Individuals who are resident and ordinarily resident in Jersey are liable to Jersey income tax on their worldwide income; however, individuals who are resident but not ordinarily resident in Jersey are taxed on Jersey-source income, and overseas income is subject to tax to the extent that it is remitted to Jersey.
A person who is not resident in Jersey is liable to Jersey income tax on Jersey-source income, except for some specific exemptions, including Jersey bank interest, interest received from a Jersey resident company, profits and earnings of the office of the director of a company, and dividends received from Jersey companies to the extent they are paid out of profits taxed at 0% on the company.
## Personal income tax rates
Tax is payable at the rate of 20% on net income after allowances.
## Alternative tax calculation
In Jersey, an alternative means of computing tax liability by reference to a marginal rate is undertaken automatically by the tax authorities. For the marginal rate calculation, the exemption limit is deducted from the taxpayer's income along with any relevant additions to the exemption limit, _as listed in the section_. Tax is then computed at the marginal rate of 26%. The taxpayer’s liability is based on the lower of the tax payable at the 20% rate and tax calculated using the marginal rate.
## Taxation of wealthy immigrants
There is a high value resident (HVR) programme in Jersey, which is a route to residency for high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) looking to live and work in Jersey. The programme grants a housing licence, which allows HNWIs to rent any property or buy property. The HVR programme also offers a favourable tax regime for HNWIs. The HVR programme is by application and will not automatically be granted. Economic and social factors will be considered as part of the application.
All Jersey property income will be subject to tax at 20%. For other income, the first 1,250,000 pounds sterling (GBP) is subject to tax at 20% and the balance at 1%.

## Taxable period
The Jersey tax year is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Tax returns are issued in January following the end of the tax year. The filing deadline for these returns is 31 May for paper filing and 31 July for electronic filing. A penalty of GBP 300 is imposed on returns filed late. Where a return remains outstanding after three months, a penalty of GBP 50 will be imposed every month the return remains outstanding, up to a maximum of nine months. 
There is a joint tax return filing for married couples. Jersey is currently transitioning to a model of independent taxation, with the first group of Islanders moved from 1 January 2022 and an aim of everyone being transitioned by 1 January 2026.
## Payment of tax
Jersey income tax is calculated and collected via an income tax assessment. These are issued by the taxes office following the submission of the tax return form. The tax payment deadline is 30 November. Any tax unpaid at that date is subject to a surcharge of 10%. New legislation introducing late payment interest is expected imminently, and we are awaiting its enactment to confirm what rate this will be at. 
For payment on account taxpayers, the first payment on account for the next year of assessment is made on 30 November alongside any balancing payment due. The second payment on account is due the following 31 May. This is based on the previous year's liability. For a person with no employment earnings, the amount payable is 50% of the previous year's liability. For a person whose earnings comprise 25% or less of their total income, the percentage is 40%.
There is a withholding tax (WHT) scheme in place that applies to employees. This is known as the Income Tax Instalment System (ITIS). Broadly, employees who had been on the island since before 2006 had ITIS deducted on a prior-year basis; however, for employees who have arrived on the island from 1 January 2006, ITIS was deducted on a current-year basis. Individuals who pay tax under the ITIS may also be required to make a balancing tax payment in December; however, the payment on account regime will not apply.
Prior year basis taxpayers are currently being transitioned into current year basis. Broadly, affected taxpayers' 2019 liabilities were 'frozen', with payments from 2020 applied against current year liabilities. Two different payment options exist to settle the frozen 2019 liabilities.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 08 January 2025
## Personal deductions
  * Pension contributions made to approved schemes are allowable up to the lower of GBP 50,000 or relevant earnings. However, relief is restricted for individuals whose income is GBP 150,000 or more by the withdrawal of GBP 1 of relief for every GBP 1 of income above GBP 150,000.
  * Professional subscriptions.
  * Interest relief is available for loans taken out for a 'qualifying purpose'. Interest paid on a mortgage on a principal private residence is deductible for those paying the marginal rate of taxation, up to a maximum of GBP 7,500, subject to certain conditions. This relief is slowly being phased out and will be unavailable from 2026 onwards.


## Personal allowances
Jersey residents are currently entitled to various personal allowances. These allowances are time apportioned for individuals who arrive in, or depart from, the island part way through the tax year. Non-residents are not entitled to Jersey personal allowances.
Allowances for 2025 are as follows:
**Allowances** |  **GBP**  
---|---  
Child allowance (per child) |  3,850

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 08 January 2025
## Employment income
A resident and ordinarily resident individual is subject to Jersey income tax on the full amount of the emoluments received from one’s employment, including benefits in kind, and regardless of where the duties are performed. Special rules apply in the years of arrival and departure. Where a Jersey non-resident performs duties in Jersey, the emoluments attaching to these duties may be assessable in Jersey. However, non-resident directors are exempt from Jersey income tax on directors' fees.
## Attributable earnings
There are rules relating to intermediary services vehicles (ISVs). These apply where a Jersey resident individual provides services to a client via a company and, were it not for the company, the individual would be considered an employee of the underlying client. In this situation, the company will be an ISV. The measures ‘look through’ the ISV and tax the individual as if they were receiving income directly from the client. The income is referred to as 'attributable earnings'.
The individual is able to deduct one’s remuneration, employer social security contributions, and any tax deductions one would normally be entitled to as an employee from one’s attributable earnings.
The proposals do not apply if the total income from clients in the ISV is less than GBP 45,000.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are not subject to tax in Jersey.
## Investment income
Jersey residents are liable to Jersey income tax at a rate of 20% on their worldwide investment income, regardless of where that income arises. Non-residents are liable to Jersey income tax at a rate of 20% on their investment income arising in Jersey, subject to the concession that applies to bank interest.
## Jersey distribution provisions
The definition of ‘distribution’ for Jersey tax purposes is very wide, encompassing almost any situation where a shareholder receives value from the company. It includes dividends, liquidations, share buybacks, repayments of loans made by shareholders to companies, transfers of assets from companies to shareholders, transfers of liabilities to companies etc.
However, repayment of loans made on a commercial basis to a trading company or a company within a trading group will not be regarded as a distribution.
Where a Jersey individual shareholder owns over 2% of the ordinary share capital of a Jersey company, the distribution is taxable. To the extent a distribution can be matched to the Jersey shareholder’s share of ‘specified profits’, this amount will be taxed on the individual with no tax credit (other than 10% company tax paid on profits). ‘Specified profits’ are, broadly, accumulated tax-adjusted profits from 2009 onwards not already taxed as dividends, deemed dividends, or attributed profits. This will include future profits as they arise.
Any amount of the distribution that cannot be matched with ‘specified profits’ will be treated as a ‘normal’ dividend and the treatment will follow the nature of the profits/reserves being distributed.
Note that there is an option to elect for a simplified alternative to treat all distributions as taxable.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 08 January 2025
In general terms, any of the following constitute residence status for tax purposes:
  * Spending a period, or periods, equal in the whole to six months on the island in any one tax year.
  * Maintaining a place of abode on the island, available for use, if the individual then stays there for one night.
  * Visiting the island year on year for a substantial period or periods of time. The Jersey tax authorities would normally regard average annual visits of three months as 'substantial'.


The concept of ordinarily resident is related, _inter alia_ , to the place where the person is habitually resident.
Residency rules in Jersey are currently being reviewed, with a number of existing concessions recently legislated for and broader changes anticipated in the future.
