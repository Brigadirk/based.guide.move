## Corporate income tax (CIT) rate for foreign companies reduced to 35%
The CIT rate applicable for foreign companies (for incomes other than identified streams of income, such as royalty or fee for technical service [FTS]) was 40% (plus applicable surcharge and cess). Finance Act, 2024 has amended the domestic tax law provisions to reduce the applicable CIT rate on foreign companies to 35% (plus applicable surcharge and cess).
## Abolishment of angel tax
The angel tax provisions were introduced by the Finance Act, 2012 to tax a company on the issue of shares for a consideration higher than the fair market value (FMV), as prescribed under the income tax rules. This was extended to include investments from non-resident investors in 2023.
Finance Act, 2024 has abolished the angel tax for all categories of investors with effect from 1 April 2024.
## Taxation of buyback of shares brought on equal footing with dividend
In 2013, the Indian government introduced special provisions relating to tax on distributed income of a domestic company from the buyback of shares. Therefore, an Indian company was subject to tax at the rate of 20% on the distributed income on the buyback of shares. This scheme of taxation was in line with the then dividend distribution tax (DDT), under which any dividend distribution was taxed in the hands of the distributing Indian company. In 2020, DDT was removed, and the dividend was made taxable in the hands of shareholders.
A sunset clause has been inserted in the extant provision under which the aforesaid tax was levied making it inapplicable from 1 October 2024. Therefore, the aforesaid 20% tax shall not be applicable to any buyback that takes place after 30 September 2024.
Further, as per the Finance Act 2024, the proceeds from buyback have now been treated as deemed dividend, on a gross basis. The cost of acquisition of shares bought back is to be treated as capital loss in the hands of the shareholder and allowed to be set off against any capital gains. The withholding tax (WHT) provisions applicable on dividend income have also been amended to provide that taxes shall also be required to be withheld at the rate of 10% for such deemed dividend. The amended provisions are applicable with effect from 1 October 2024.
## Rationalisation of capital gains tax provisions
Finance Act, 2024 has rationalised the capital gains tax regime. These amended provisions are applicable for transfers made on or after 23 July 2024. The provisions amended by Finance Act, 2024 have been provided as follows:
  * Period of holding for determining nature of capital gains:
    * All capital assets are to be treated as long-term capital assets if they are held for a period of more than 24 months.
    * All listed securities are to be considered as long-term capital assets if they are held for more than 12 months.
  * Applicable tax rate:
    * Tax on short-term capital gains on transfer of listed securities that are subject to securities transaction tax (STT) shall be levied at 20%.
    * Tax on long-term capital gains on all assets shall be levied at 12.5%. The benefit of indexation while computing long-term capital gains has been abolished.
    * The exemption limit on long-term capital gains on transfer of listed securities is increased to 125,000 Indian rupees (INR).
  * Income on transfer, redemption, or maturity of unlisted debentures or unlisted bonds on or after 23 July 2024 is to be deemed as short-term capital gains.


The indexation benefit, which allows shareholders to adjust their purchase price for inflation, has been removed for all taxpayers except individuals and Hindu undivided families (HUFs).
The aforementioned amended provisions are applicable for transfers made on or after 23 July 2024.
## Reduced period of limitation for re-assessment proceedings under income tax
The provisions related to re-assessment proceedings under domestic tax laws were substantially revamped in 2021. Besides the procedure, the general limitation period for initiating the re-assessment proceedings was significantly reduced to three years.
However, in certain cases, this timeline could be extended to ten years if the tax authorities possess documentary evidence that there is an escapement of income. To further rationalise these provisions, _vide_ Finance Act 2024, the time period for initiating the re-assessment proceedings in the above-mentioned specified cases is reduced to five years from ten years.
## Indian government notifies lower royalty and FTS tax-rate in India-Spain Double Tax Avoidance Agreement (DTAA)
The Ministry of Finance has issued a notification on 19 March 2024 permitting the benefit of the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) clause under the India-Spain DTAA. The Indian government amended the India-Spain DTAA by importing a lower tax rate of 10% for royalty and FTS from the India-Germany DTAA. The lower tax rate shall be applicable from financial year 2023/24 corresponding to tax year 2024/25.
## Government notifies list of payments to International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) units on which no taxes are required to be withheld
The Indian government has notified the list of payments made by any payer to the IFSC units on which no taxes are required to be withheld by the payer. The list includes 14 different kinds of IFSC units where taxes are not required to be withheld by the payer on various payments, subject to fulfilment of conditions prescribed in the said notification. This notification is effective from 1 April 2024.
## Abolishment of equalisation levy applicable on non-resident e-commerce operators
Finance Act, 2020 had amended the provisions related to the equalisation levy to provide that non-resident e-commerce operators, providing e-commerce supply or services beyond a specified threshold, shall be required to pay equalisation levy at the rate of 2%.
Finance Act, 2024 has now abolished the equalisation levy on non-resident e-commerce operators with effect from 1 August 2024.
It may be noted that the equalisation levy at the rate of 6% continues to apply on specified services, i.e. on online advertisement, any provision for digital advertising space, or any other facility or service for the purpose of online advertisement, which includes any other service as may be notified by the Central Government in this regard.
## Relief to eligible start-ups
The domestic tax laws provide certain tax deductions to eligible start-ups, provided such eligible start-up is incorporated on or before 31 March 2023. The sunset clause of 31 March 2024 has now been extended to 31 March 2025.
Further, eligible start-ups can now carry forward and set off the losses for a period of ten years as compared to the earlier limit of seven years.
## Tax Amnesty Scheme, 2024
In order to settle the pending disputes, Finance Act, 2024 has introduced the Direct Tax Vivad se Vishwas Scheme, 2024 (Scheme). The disputed tax matters pending till a specified date can be settled under the Scheme by paying disputed taxes. The Scheme provides that no interest or penal implications shall arise in the hands of the taxpayer for the matters settled under the Scheme. The scheme is applicable with effect from 1 October 2024.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
## Taxable period
In India, the tax year begins on 1 April and ends on 31 March.
## Tax returns
Accounts for tax purposes must be made up to 31 March. For persons having business/professional income, the income tax return is required to be filed electronically on or before 31 October of the succeeding tax year. In case the transfer pricing provisions are applicable, the due date for filing of the tax return is on or before 30 November.
In case a taxpayer desires to revise its filed return of income, it would be eligible to do so only up to 31 December of the year following the tax year or before the completion of assessment, whichever is earlier. Updated tax returns can be filed within 24 months from the end of the tax year.
Further, to claim certain tax incentives/deductions, taxpayers have to furnish their tax returns on or before the due date specified for filing the tax returns.
### Quarterly WHT returns
Quarterly statements of taxes withheld are required to be filed electronically with the tax authorities on or before 31 July, 31 October, and 31 January for the first three quarters of the tax year and on or before 31 May following the last quarter of the tax year.
### Obligation to submit tax return for assets located outside India
A resident taxpayer having any asset (including financial interest in any entity) located outside India or signing authority in any account located outside India is mandatorily required to furnish a tax return.
### Exempting non-resident from filing tax returns in certain conditions
A relief is granted to non-resident taxpayers/foreign companies by exempting them from filing a return of income in India whose total income consists of royalties or fees for technical services. 
Thus, non-resident taxpayer companies will not be required to furnish their tax returns in India if the following conditions are satisfied:
  * Their total income consists only of dividends, interest, royalties, or fees for technical services.
  * Taxes have been deducted at the rates prescribed under the Income-tax Act from such incomes.


However, relief may not be available to non-residents whose taxes will be deducted at the beneficial rates provided under the respective tax treaties. This is effective from 1 April 2020 and will accordingly apply to tax year 2020/21 onwards.
## Payment of tax
Tax is payable in advance (if tax payable for the year exceeds INR 10,000) in specified instalments for every quarter on or before 15 June, 15 September, and 15 December for the first three quarters of the tax year and on or before 15 March for the last quarter of the tax year. Any balance of tax due on the basis of the return must be paid on a self-assessment basis before the return is filed. A tax return will be treated as defective if the tax liability along with interest is not paid on or before the date of submission of the tax return. Interest levied for default in payment of advance tax is computed beginning from the first day of the year following the tax year to the date of the assessment order.
## Tax Assessment – Timelines
### Assessment timelines
Timelines for issuance of notice and passing order under the Indian Income-tax Act are as follows:
Compliance | Timeline  
---|---  
Processing of tax return (intimation). | Nine months from end of relevant financial year.  
Selection of tax return for assessment. | Three months from end of financial year in which tax return is filed.  
Completion of assessment for tax year 2022/23 and onwards*. | 12 months from end of relevant tax year.  
* Where the case is referred to the transfer pricing officer, the timelines are extended by 12 months.
### Reassessment timelines
  * Three years from the end of the relevant tax year.
  * Five years from the end of the relevant tax year where the Tax Officer has evidence of income escaping assessment, represented in the form of assets, amounting to INR 5 million or more.
  * Notice for reopening to be issued only where Tax Officer has ‘information’ suggesting that the income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment and after obtaining prior approval of specified authority.


## Topics of focus for tax authorities
### Faceless assessment
With a view to roll out e-assessment across the country so as to impart greater transparency and accountability, the Central Government was empowered to notify a scheme for scrutiny assessments to achieve the desired purpose. The scope of e-assessment has been extended to include best judgement assessment and reassessment as well. Further, similar e-proceedings have been introduced in respect of:
  * Proceedings before Commissioner (Appeals).
  * Imposition of penalty under the Income-tax Act.


## General Anti Avoidance Rule (GAAR)
GAAR provisions were introduced by the Finance Act, 2017 and have been applicable since 1 April 2017. These provisions empower the tax department to declare an ‘arrangement’, or any part or step thereof, entered into by a taxpayer with the main purpose of obtaining tax benefit to be an 'Impermissible Avoidance Agreement' (IAA), the consequence of which would be denial of tax benefit under the Income-tax Act or under the applicable tax treaty.
For GAAR provisions, an IAA means the main purpose of which is to obtain a tax benefit, and it:
  * creates rights and obligations not at arm’s length
  * results in abuse/misuse of provisions of this Income-tax Act (directly/indirectly)
  * lacks/is deemed to lack commercial substance, or
  * is carried out in a manner that is not ordinarily employed for _bona fide_ purposes.


The following are consequences if an arrangement is regarded as an IAA:
  * Disregard/re-characterise the arrangement.
  * Disregard corporate structure.
  * Deny tax treaty benefit.
  * Reassign place of residence/situs of assets or transactions.
  * Reallocate income, expenses, relief etc.
  * Re-characterise equity-debt, income-expense, relief, etc.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
A company is treated as a resident of India in any previous year if:
  * it is an Indian company, or
  * its PoEM in that year is in India (_see below_).


## Place of effective management (PoEM)
Presently, a foreign company is considered resident in India if the control and management of its affairs is situated wholly in India.
To bring to tax those companies that are incorporated outside India but controlled from India, the condition of PoEM has been introduced. PoEM is an internationally recognised concept accepted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
A foreign company will be regarded as a resident in India if its PoEM is in India in that year. Since ‘residency’ is determined for each year, PoEM is also required to be determined on a year-to-year basis. The concept of PoEM is one of substance over form. The term PoEM has been explained to mean a place where key management and commercial decisions that are necessary for the conduct of the business of an entity as a whole are, in substance, made. To provide clarity and address certain concerns for implementation of determination of residency of a foreign company on the basis of PoEM, the Indian Revenue Department has issued a circular laying down guidelines. The guidelines laid down the concept of determination of PoEM based on bifurcation of companies engaged in active business outside India and other companies. The circulars clarify that the PoEM provisions will not apply to a foreign company having turnover or gross receipts of INR 500 million or less in a tax year.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
A PE is defined in India as a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on or through an agent who habitually exercises an authority to conclude contracts or regularly delivers goods or merchandise or habitually secures orders on behalf of a non-resident.
## Business connection
The scope of 'business connection' was amended under the Income-tax Act to align with the modified PE Rule as per the Multilateral Instrument (MLI).
'Business connection' includes business activities carried on by a non-resident through dependent agents. The scope of 'business connection' under the Income-tax Act is similar to the provisions relating to Dependent Agent Permanent Establishment (DAPE) in India’s tax treaties. The amendment provides that business connection shall also include any business activities carried through a person who, acting on behalf of the non-resident, habitually concludes contracts or habitually plays the principal role leading to conclusion of contracts by the non-resident. It further states that the contracts should be:
  * in the name of the non-resident
  * for the transfer of the ownership of, or for the granting of the right to use, property owned by that non-resident or that the non-resident has the right to use, or
  * for the provision of services by that non-resident.


Further, as per the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 'significant economic presence' would also constitute a 'business connection' in India.
The term 'significant economic presence' has been modified, and the applicability of same has been deferred to FY 2021/22.
'Significant economic presence' means:
  * any transaction in respect of any goods, services, or property carried out by a non-resident with any person in India, including provision of download of data or software in India, if the aggregate of payments arising from such transaction or transactions during the previous year exceeds INR 20 million, or
  * systematic and continuous soliciting of business activities or engaging in interaction with 300,000 users in India.


However, only so much of income as is attributable to such transactions or activities will be deemed to accrue or arise in India. It is also proposed that the transactions or activities will constitute significant economic presence in India, whether or not the non-resident has a residence or place of business in India or renders services in India.
The income tax return forms applicable to companies (including foreign companies) have been updated for FY 2021/22 explicitly including disclosure of significant economic presence status of a foreign company in India during FY 2021/22.


# India
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
Expenses that are revenue in nature are, by and large, allowed as a deduction to businesses and professionals if they are:
  * incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the business or profession
  * not in the nature of a personal expense, and
  * not in the nature of a capital expense.


## Depreciation
Depreciable assets are grouped in blocks, and each block is eligible for depreciation at a prescribed rate. The Indian Revenue Department clarified that with effect from 1 April 2017 the block of assets that are entitled to more than 40% depreciation will now be restricted to 40%. However, a higher depreciation rate of 45% is allowed for certain assets under the 'plant and machinery' block on satisfaction of certain conditions. Hence, the depreciation rate available in case of different blocks of assets ranges from 0% to 45%, depending upon the classification.
## Goodwill
The government of India, in the Finance Act, 2021, has excluded 'goodwill of a business or profession' from the definition of block of asset. By virtue of this amendment, goodwill of any nature shall not be considered as a depreciable asset for the purpose of tax amortisation under the India Income-tax Act. 
## Expenses incurred before the commencement of business
Certain specified expenses are incurred by taxpayers either before the start-up of a business or after the commencement of a business, in connection with extension of the industrial undertaking, or in connection with setting-up a new unit. One-fifth of such expenditure is allowed as a deduction each year, over a period of five years.
## Interest expenses
Any interest paid by a taxpayer on capital borrowed for the purposes of the taxpayer’s business or profession is tax-deductible without any limit. However, if such interest is paid to certain related persons (non-resident associated enterprise), then, the interest expense will be restricted to 30% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA). Excess interest expenditure disallowed in that year can be carried forward for eight years and would be available for set-off. If the capital is borrowed for acquiring a capital asset, then interest liability pertaining to the period until the time the asset is used cannot be allowed as a tax-deductible expense and will have to be added to the cost of such asset. 
There are some specific guidelines for interest deduction being prescribed in ICDS.
## Expenditure incurred on corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities
Expenditure incurred by a taxpayer on CSR activities mandated under the Companies Act, 2013 is not allowed as a deduction for tax purposes under the Income-tax Act. However, if contributions are made to any prescribed charitable institutions, then deduction may be examined _._
## Expenses allowable on actual payment basis
Certain expenses, such as, but not limited to, employees’ provident fund dues (i.e. retirement benefit funds), bonus to employees, interest payable to financial institutions and banks, and payments to be made to micro, small, and medium enterprises are allowed as tax-deductible expenses only on actual payment. Tax disallowances are attracted if certain payments are delayed beyond their due dates under the respective laws.
## Bribes, kickbacks, illegal payments
Expenditure incurred by a taxpayer that is illegal is deemed not to have been incurred for the purposes of the business or profession, and no deduction of such expenditure will be allowed. The Finance Act, 2022 has restricted the deductibility of the expenditure that is in relation to an offence or is prohibited by the law. It has been provided that the expenses incurred in connection with an offence or violation of any law (in India or outside India), including expenditure incurred for compounding of any offence, will not be allowed as a business expenditure. It is further provided that any benefit or perquisite paid to a person in violation of any laws, rules, and regulations governing such person’s conduct will not be allowed as business expenditure.
## Fines and penalties
The Income-tax Act provides for deductibility of fines, penalties, and interest as follows: 
  * Fine or penalty will not be tax deductible if charged under any statute.
  * Contractual penalty is allowed as a deduction.


## Taxes
All taxes (tax, duty, cess, or fees by whatever name called) relating to business (other than income tax) incurred during the tax year are usually deductible only in the year of payment. The Finance Act, 2022 has clarified that the term ‘tax’ includes surcharge and education cess, with retrospective effect from 1 April 2005.
## Net operating losses
Losses can be carried forward and set-off against income from subsequent year(s) for periods set out in the following table:
Types of losses | Time limit  
---|---  
Unabsorbed depreciation | Perpetually  
Business losses (other than speculation business losses) | 8 years  
Speculation business losses | 4 years  
Capital losses | 8 years  
There are no provisions in India for carrying losses back to earlier years.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Indian companies can claim deduction for payments on account of royalties, and for interest and fees for technical or management service provided by foreign affiliates, so long as they are not capital in nature. Such payments are deductible in the year the requisite WHT is paid into the government treasury.


# India
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
Group taxation is not permitted under the Indian tax law.
## Transfer pricing
### Transfer pricing on international transactions
The Indian transfer pricing regulations (ITPR) stipulate that income arising from ‘international transactions’ between ‘associated enterprises’ should be computed having regard to the ‘arm’s-length price’. Furthermore, any allowance for expenses or interest arising from any international transaction is also to be determined having regard to the arm’s-length price. The expressions ‘international transactions’ and ‘associated enterprises’ have been defined in the ITPR.
The ITPR also contain the concept of ‘deemed international transaction’ whereby a transaction between an enterprise and a third party (whether based in India or overseas) would be subjected to transfer pricing regulations in case there exists a prior agreement in relation to such a transaction between the third party and the associated enterprise of the transacting enterprise or if the terms of such a transaction are determined in substance between the third party and the associated enterprise of the transacting enterprise.
The ITPR also define a certain class of transactions undertaken by a taxpayer with its domestic related parties and whose aggregate value exceeds INR 200 million as specified domestic transactions to which the transfer pricing provisions apply.
Initially, the ITPR prescribed five methods for computation of arm’s-length price. These are broadly in line with OECD Guidelines. A sixth method, termed as the ‘other method’, was notified in 2012. Taxpayers are required to adopt the most appropriate method for determining the arm’s-length price.
Taxpayers are also required to maintain a comprehensive set of prescribed information and documents relating to international transactions and specified domestic transactions that are undertaken between associated enterprises, on an annual basis, within the prescribed timelines. Taxpayers being a constituent entity of an international group shall also keep and maintain such information and documents (essentially master file and country-by-country [CbC] report) in respect of the international group. Further, taxpayers are required to obtain an Accountant’s Report (certificate) from an independent accountant certifying the nature and amount of international transactions. The certificate needs to be filed one month in advance of the income tax return. The burden of proving the arm’s-length character of the transaction is primarily on the taxpayer. On 1 October 2020 and on 5 March 2024, the CBDT notified certain changes in the form of the certificate, including expanding the coverage of specified domestic transactions in certain cases.
The taxpayer is required to comply with the above requirements on an annual basis.
The ITPR adopts an arithmetic mean of comparable prices as the arm's-length price, with a flexibility of deviation from the percentage that is notified by the Central Government as +/- 1% for wholesalers and +/- 3% for others. The CBDT has also prescribed rules for use of range for determining arm’s-length price, which is discussed subsequently. Where the transfer pricing officer is of the opinion that the arm’s-length price was not applied, the officer may re-compute the taxable income after giving the taxpayer an opportunity to be heard. Stringent penalties are prescribed in cases of failure to comply with the provisions of the ITPR.
### Notified Jurisdictional Area (NJA)
The Indian government is empowered to declare a country/territory with which there does not exist an effective mechanism for exchange of information as an NJA.
Any transaction between a taxpayer and a person located in an NJA or a transaction entered into by a taxpayer wherein one of the parties is located in an NJA will be covered under the ITPR. However, the benefit of the +/- 3% range and the option to be covered under the Safe Harbour Rules would not be available in this case.
### Safe Harbour Rules
Safe Harbour Rules were notified in 2013. These rules prescribe who the eligible taxpayers are, which are the eligible international transactions, the target operating margin, procedural aspects, timeline for audit, etc. Thereafter, these Safe Harbour Rules were also extended to certain domestic transactions. Safe Harbour Rules also cover attribution of profits to a PE.
The Safe Harbour Rules were initially applicable for a maximum of five tax years beginning with tax year 2013/14.
Thereafter, in June 2017, the CBDT made amendments to the Safe Harbour Rules reducing the target operating margins for most of the eligible international transactions. Further, the revised Safe Harbour Rules introduced receipt of low value-adding intra-group services to the list of eligible transactions subject to certain thresholds. Also, there were certain modifications made to the definitions of certain terms _vis-à-vis_ in the original Safe Harbour Rules. The revised Safe Harbour Rules are applicable for a maximum of three tax years beginning with tax year 2017/18 with the taxpayers having an option to apply the original Safe Harbour Rules or the revised Safe Harbour Rules for the tax year 2017/18, whichever is more beneficial. Subsequently, the CBDT notified certain amendments to the Safe Harbour Rules in December 2023, including the expansion of the scope of intra-group loan transactions covered within the ambit of the Safe Harbour Rules and modifications to the definitions of certain terms.
Where a taxpayer has opted to be covered under the Safe Harbour Rules and the transfer price declared has been accepted by the tax authorities, then such a taxpayer cannot invoke proceedings under a Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP).
In May 2020, the CBDT notified that the revised Safe Harbour Rules applicable for tax years 2017/18 to 2019/20 will continue to apply for tax year 2020/21. The CBDT, on 24 September 2021, notified to extend applicability of Safe Harbour Rules for tax year 2021/22 as well. On 17 June 2022, the CBDT further extended the applicability of Safe Harbour Rules to tax year 2022/23. Again, _vide_ a notification dated 9 August 2023, the CBDT extended the applicability of the Safe Harbour Rules to tax year 2023/24.
It is pertinent to note that no Safe Harbour Rules have yet been notified for the subsequent tax year. We will have to wait for any further notification from the Indian Revenue Department in this regard.
### Advance pricing agreements (APAs)
An APA is an arrangement between the taxpayer and the tax authorities covering transactions, with a view to pre-empt potential transfer pricing disputes. The CBDT has notified detailed rules providing the procedures and necessary forms for application/administration of APAs.
The rules provide for constitution of an APA team, which shall consist of an income tax authority and experts from economics, statistics, law, and other necessary fields. APAs can be applied to existing, as well as proposed, transactions. Further, APAs entered into after 1 April 2020 can also cover attribution of profits to PEs.
The rules have provided for both unilateral and bilateral/multilateral APAs. In cases where a bilateral APA negotiated between competent authorities is not acceptable to the taxpayer, the taxpayer may, at its option, continue with the process of entering into a unilateral APA without benefit of an MAP.
The salient features of the procedure laid down for APAs are application for APA, withdrawal of APA, defective application, procedure, compliances post-APA, cancellations of APA, and revisions and renewal of APA.
The legislation has provisions of roll-back of APAs for four years prior to the first year covered under the APA.
### Rules prescribing the use of ‘range’ and multiple year data
The CBDT has notified the rules prescribing the scheme for the usage of the ‘range’ concept and multiple year financial data for determining the arm’s-length price. These rules are applicable to international transactions and specified domestic transactions.
The rules envisage the applicability of the ‘range’ concept only where the arm’s-length price determination is done using either the transactional net margin method, resale price method, cost plus method, or comparable uncontrolled price method. Furthermore, the rules in connection with the applicability of the ‘range’ concept, _inter alia_ , prescribe the adequate number of external comparables and the methodology for computing the upper and lower percentile. In case the number of external comparables identified is not adequate, the ‘range’ concept will not apply and the concept of arithmetic mean will continue to apply.
The multiple year data can only be used if the most appropriate method selected for benchmarking purposes is either transactional net margin method, resale price method, or cost plus method. Further, multiple year data entails use of data for the year under consideration (current year) and data for up to two preceding financial years. Data for the current year is compulsorily to be considered. If the data for the current year is available and is not comparable on account of either qualitative or quantile reasons, the comparable cannot be considered.
### Master file and country-by-country (CbC) reporting documentation as per base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS)
The government has introduced three-layered transfer pricing documentation requirements in line with the international standard as per the BEPS Action Plan 13. Taxpayers are required to prepare a master file, local file, and CbC report from financial year 2016/17. The CBDT has notified the final rules for maintaining and furnishing of transfer pricing documentation in the master file and CbC report.
As per the rules, the master file shall be applicable to every Indian taxpayer (called as a constituent entity or CE) part of an international group (whether inbound or outbound) having an annual consolidated turnover of over INR 5 billion in the preceding accounting year of the parent company and meeting certain other thresholds of the quantum of aggregate value of international transactions. Again, the Indian taxpayer must furnish the master file with the prescribed authority (i.e. Director General of Income-tax [Risk Assessment]). For Indian CEs with parent companies resident outside India, the master file must be furnished even if it is filed by the parent entity in its home country or by a designated entity in its home country. In case there are more than one constituent entities of an international group that are required to file the master file in India, the international group can designate any one of its constituent entities to file the master file on behalf of other constituent entities. Earlier, a designated entity could only file the master file on behalf of the Indian resident constituent entities, and non-resident constituent entities were required to file separate master files for compliance in India. However, the CBDT issued a notification on 5 April 2021 clarifying that the master file is required to be filed by any one of the constituent entities, designated for the same, for both resident and non-resident entities.
The documentation prescribed by the rules in respect of the master file is largely in line with OECD’s final BEPS Action Plan 13 report; however, there are certain additional information requirements, like the description of the functions, assets, and risks (FAR) analysis of all CEs within the group that contribute at least 10% of revenues or assets or profits of the group; detailed description of the financial arrangements of the group, including the names and address of the top ten unrelated lenders; and a list of all entities of the international group engaged in development and management of intangible property, along with their addresses. Further, every CE has certain master file related filing requirements even if such CE does not undertake any international transactions.
The CbC report is applicable only for taxpayers having an annual consolidated group turnover of over INR 64 billion (increased from INR 55 billion with effect from 1 April 2021 through a notification issued by the CBDT on 5 April 2021) in the preceding accounting year of the parent company. A parent entity of an outbound international group or an alternate reporting entity of an inbound international group, resident in India, must file the CbC report with the prescribed authority. For Indian CEs with parent companies resident outside India, the CbC report must ordinarily be filed by the parent entity in its home country or by an alternate reporting entity/a designated entity in its home country. The Indian tax authorities will access the CbC report through mutual exchange of information agreements with such country, failing which the Indian subsidiary will be required to furnish the report. However, if the parent entity is not obligated to file the CbC report in its home country or if there is no mutual exchange of information agreement signed between India and the parent entity’s country or territory, or there has been a systemic failure of the country or territory and such failure has been informed to the Indian CE by the prescribed authority, then the Indian CE will be required to furnish the report.
In case there are multiple entities of the same international group resident in India, one of the entities will have to be identified as the designated entity for filing the master file as well as for other communication in respect of the master file and the CbC report. Further, the rules have prescribed various forms for intimations to be filed with the prescribed authority and filing of the master file and CbC report with the prescribed authority at various dates. The due date for filing the master file is the specified due date for filing the annual tax returns. In case of CbC report, every parent entity or the alternate reporting entity, resident in India, will have to file the CbC report within a period of 12 months from the end of the said reporting accounting year of the parent entity. In case the Indian CE or the designated Indian CE is required to file the CbC report with the prescribed authority for reasons as discussed above, then the timeline is within a period of 12 months from the end of the international group’s reporting accounting year unless there has been a case of systemic failure, in which case the timeline is within six months from the end of the month in which said systemic failure was informed.
Significant penalty provisions will apply for non-compliance and furnishing of inaccurate information.
Further, on 27 June 2018, the CBDT issued an instruction relating to appropriate use of CbC report information. This instruction provides clarity on certain fundamental aspects of use of such information by the Indian tax authorities.
### Restrictions on interest deduction
The BEPS Action Plan 4 recommends alternate approaches for countries to limit tax base erosion through interest deductions and other financial payments. Provisions have been introduced in the Income-tax Act that seek to limit the interest deduction of Indian companies or PEs of foreign companies in India. Taxpayers engaged in banking or insurance business are specifically excluded. Further, it is clarified that interest on loan extended by a PE of a non-resident bank is also excluded. Recently, _vide_ the Union Budget 2024, finance companies located in an International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) have also been excluded from the purview of limitation on interest deduction. 
The provision will apply to interest or similar expenses paid (including those paid on existing debt) to (i) overseas associated enterprises or (ii) third-party lenders for whom the underlying debt is backed by an implicit or explicit guarantee or equivalent deposit from overseas associated enterprises.
Any interest paid for the year under consideration in excess of 30% of the EBITDA of the taxpayer will be treated as excess interest. Excess interest disallowed in a year will be eligible for carry forward up to eight consecutive years, subject to the above limits. The provision will, however, not apply to interest paid or payable up to INR 10 million.
The provisions that limit the interest deductions have largely adopted the ‘Fixed Ratio Rule’ proposed as a best practice approach under BEPS Action Plan 4, however, with some differences. It is relevant to note that the provisions do not correspondingly limit the WHT liability or taxability of the non-resident associated enterprise on the interest income. The provisions apply from tax year 2018/19 onwards.
### Secondary adjustment
To align the ITPR with the OECD Guidelines and international practices, provisions have been introduced in the ITPR for a secondary adjustment. The secondary adjustment is an adjustment in the books of account of the taxpayer and its associated enterprise to reflect that the actual allocation of profits between the Indian taxpayer and its associated enterprise are consistent with the transfer price determined as a result of primary adjustment. This is intended to remove the imbalance between the cash account and actual profit of the Indian taxpayer.
The secondary adjustment is required only where a primary adjustment to the transfer price occurs in one of the following circumstances:
  * Where adjustment has been made on one’s own by the taxpayer in one’s income tax return.
  * Adjustment made by the Assessing Officer has been accepted by the taxpayer.
  * Arising due to the APA signed.
  * Application of Safe Harbour Rules.
  * Settlement arrived at under the MAP route.


However, an exception has been made according to which such secondary adjustments shall not be carried out by the taxpayer if the amount of the primary adjustment made in the case of a taxpayer does not exceed INR 10 million.
According to this provision, excess money arising from primary transfer pricing adjustments not repatriated into India within the prescribed time limit will be deemed as an advance made by the Indian taxpayer to its associated enterprise. Time limits have been prescribed having regard to the circumstance leading to the primary transfer pricing adjustment. The effect of the advance is given by way of an imputation of interest on such advance. The imputed per annum interest on such advance will be computed at the one-year marginal cost of fund lending rate of the State Bank of India as on 1 April of the relevant previous year plus a spread of 325 basis points in cases where the international transaction is denominated in Indian rupees. In cases where the international transaction is denominated in foreign currency, the interest will be computed at six-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as of 30 September of the relevant previous year plus a spread of 300 basis points. This interest will be imputed till such time as the excess money arising due to primary transfer pricing adjustments is repatriated into India.
The provisions relating to secondary transfer pricing adjustment are generally applicable for primary transfer pricing adjustments made from tax year 2017/18 onwards.
Further, it has been clarified that this interest will be computed on excess money or part thereof. Further, the excess money may be repatriated from any of the associated enterprises of the taxpayer that is not a resident of India. These amendments are effective retrospectively from 1 April 2018 (i.e. for tax year 2018/19 onwards).
Also, it has been clarified that the provisions of this section are applicable to APAs signed on or after 1 April 2017. Further, no refund of taxes paid till date under the pre-amended section will be allowed.
Moreover, to simplify the implementation of these provisions, an option has been introduced to taxpayers to either pay tax on the imputed interest every year until the excess money arising due to primary transfer pricing adjustments is repatriated into India or pay a one-time tax on the excess money or the part thereof at 18% plus surcharge of 12% and cess of 4%. Interest will have to be paid till the date of payment of the additional tax. Further, no credit will be given for this additional tax paid, neither will a deduction be allowed under any provision of the Act, in respect of such amount on which the tax has been paid. This has been effective from 1 September 2019 onwards. The aforesaid is in line with the internationally accepted best practices.
#### Significant development
Minimum alternate tax provisions have been amended to provide for adjustment for increase in book profit of the previous year due to inclusion of income of past year/years pursuant to an APA or secondary adjustment. The Tax Officer shall make the aforesaid adjustment and recompute the book profit of past year/years and the tax payable, if any, for the previous year, provided an application in this regard is made by the taxpayer and having regard to other conditions/provisions prescribed.
### Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP)
India has the MAP process in place as a dispute resolution mechanism under the DTAAs. There are specific provisions within the Indian Tax Law for the same. With a view to align the MAP process with the OECD BEPS Action 14 Minimum Standard and provide more clarity around the MAP process, the Indian government amended the MAP rules in May 2020 with specific procedures for filing MAPs and notification to the foreign competent authority, along with an aim to resolve the MAP cases within an average timeline of 24 months. Further, in August 2020, the CBDT issued detailed guidance around procedural and technical aspects, acceptance/denial of MAPs, and the implementation of MAPs. On 10 June 2022, the CBDT released an updated version of the guidance on MAP wherein it clarified the interplay between MAP and the Direct Tax Vivad se Vishwas Act, 2020. It also elaborated on the MAP applicant’s responsibility to make true and complete disclosure during the MAP process.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
Tax incentive provisions normally have conditions applicable for the period within which the preferred activity should be undertaken and the period for which the tax incentive is available. It may also be necessary to fulfil certain other conditions, such as ‘forming’ of a ‘new’ undertaking.
## Tax framework for start-ups in India
With a view to providing an impetus to start-ups and to facilitate their growth in the initial phase of their business, a deduction of 100% of the profits and gains derived by an eligible start-up from a business involving innovation development, improvement of products, processes, or services, or a scalable business model with a high potential of employment generation or wealth creation will be available.
The benefit of 100% deduction of the profits derived from such business will be available for a period of three consecutive years out of ten years beginning from the year the start-up is incorporated.
Eligible start-up companies can carry forward losses and set off against income of a year if they satisfy either of the following two conditions: (i) at least 51% of beneficial shareholders in the year on incurrence of loss continue to hold shares in such start-up in the year of set-off, or (ii) the same shareholders in the year of incurrence of loss continue to hold their shares in such start-up in the year of set-off (irrespective of their percent of holding). Further, only the losses incurred during the period of ten years beginning from the year in which such company was incorporated may be used for set-off.
‘Eligible start-up’ means a company or an LLP engaged in the business mentioned above and which fulfils the following conditions, namely:
  * it is incorporated on or after 1 April 2016 but before 1 April 2025
  * the total turnover of its business does not exceed INR 1 billion in any tax year(s) prior to which the deduction was claimed, and
  * it holds a certificate of eligible business from the Inter-Ministerial Board of Certification as notified in the Official Gazette by the Central Government.


## Other reliefs to start-ups
### Capital gain exemption to individual/Hindu undivided family (HUF) on investment in start-ups
Currently, the law, subject to certain conditions, provides for capital gains exemption to an individual/HUF on sale of a residential property (a house or a plot of land), provided that the net consideration received is invested for subscription of equity shares of eligible companies (including eligible start-ups) and such funds are utilised by the eligible companies for purchase of new assets.
### Compliance with the notification of exemption
Currently, notified companies (start-up companies) are exempted from taxability of consideration received for issue of shares, in excess of the FMV of such shares, subject to fulfilment of certain specified conditions.
Exemption will be withdrawn if the company fails to comply with any of the specified conditions and the income will be liable to tax in the year of such failure.
## Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)/Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs)
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has enacted regulations relating to two categories of investment vehicles, namely REITs and InvITs.
Pass-through status is provided to REITs in respect of income earned from renting, leasing, or letting out any real estate asset owned directly by the REITs. Thus, rental income is exempt in the hands of REITs. On distribution of rental income, REITs are required to withhold tax at the rate of 10% on income distributed to resident investors and at rates in force on income distributed to non-resident investors. Tax is not required to be withheld by tenants on payment of rent to the REITs.
The interest paid by special purpose vehicles (SPVs) to business trusts (BTs) (where BT holds controlling interest in SPV) is taxable at the investor level (as against the BT itself) when the BT distributes such amounts. Interest income to non-resident investors is taxable at a lower rate of 5% (plus applicable surcharge and cess), whereas residents are taxable at the applicable tax rates.
Dividends distributed by SPVs to the BTs are exempt in the hands of the BTs (where BT holds controlling interest in SPV). Further, dividends distributed to investors by REITs/InvITs are exempt in the hands of the unitholder if the SPV distributing such dividends to the REIT/InvIT does not opt for a lower corporate tax regime (i.e. the 22% tax rate exclusive of surcharge and cess).
Any capital repayment of debt by a BT should be taxable as income from other sources in the hands of unitholders at the applicable rates (with effect from 1 April 2023).
The prescribed mechanism to compute taxable amount (distributions representing capital repayment of debt) is provided below:
Taxable amount = A - B - C
(If taxable amount is negative, it shall be deemed to be zero)
A = Aggregate distributions representing capital repayment of debt (including distributions representing capital repayment of debt in the current year or previous years to existing unitholder or to a unitholder who held the unit in earlier years).
B = Amount at which such unit was issued by the BT.
C = Amount charged to tax under this clause in any earlier years.
Cost of acquisition of units of BT shall be reduced by capital repayment of debt that is not chargeable to tax under the heading ‘income from other sources’. Any capital repayment of debt prior to 1 April 2023 shall reduce the cost of acquisition of units of the BT.
Capital gains (e.g. on sale of shares of SPVs) (other than gains chargeable under relevant provisions of the Income-tax Act) are taxable in the hands of BTs at the maximum marginal rate. Any other income is taxable at the maximum marginal rate at the BT level. Onward distributions of such income are exempt in the hands of the investors.
Transfer of units of BTs through stock exchanges are liable to STT, and long-term capital gains (period of holding > 36 months) over and above of INR 100,000 on such sale of units will be chargeable to tax at the rate of 10% (plus surcharge and cess). A lower rate of 15% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is applicable to short-term capital assets. Taxability of capital gains arising to sponsors on exchange of shares in SPVs with units of BTs is deferred to the time of disposal of such units by the sponsor. The applicability of MAT on gains arising from the swap of shares of the SPV for units of BT is deferred to the stage when the units are transferred by the BT. No capital gains tax exemption is available on the swap of other assets with units of BTs.
If a person receives tax exempt dividend on units of a BT within three months before the record date and transfers these units within nine months after the record date, loss on sale of such units, if any (to the extent of exempt dividend), shall be ignored for the purpose for computing income.
If a person receives bonus units of a BT within three months before the record date and transfers these units within nine months after the record date, loss on sale of such units, if any, shall be ignored for the purpose for computing income. Further, the loss ignored shall be considered as the cost of acquisition for the bonus units received.
## Tax incentives for undertakings other than infrastructure development undertakings
If certain conditions are met, a tax holiday is permitted on the profits earned by an undertaking engaged in any of the following:
  * Integrated business of handling, storage, and transportation of food grains.
  * Commercial production or refining of mineral oils.
  * Processing, preservation, and packaging of fruits or vegetables.
  * Operating and maintaining a hospital in a rural area.


The tax holiday periods range from five to ten years, and the percentage of the rebate is 30%, 50%, or 100% in initial years and 30% in the later years. The number of years constituting ‘initial’ and ‘later’ years varies from sector to sector.
## Tax incentives for development of affordable housing projects
A developer is eligible to claim 100% of deduction of the capital expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of development of projects qualifying as affordable housing projects as per specified criteria. However, the said deduction can be availed only on fulfilment of certain conditions. Some of the key conditions are:
  * The developing company should not be formed by way of splitting-up or reconstruction of an existing business.
  * The developer should invest in new plant and machinery only, provided up to 20% of total plant and machinery can be previously used machinery.
  * Deduction will be allowed on all capital expenditure except for land, goodwill, and financial instruments.
  * Deductions in respect of specified capital expenditure will not be allowed if incurred for the purpose of acquisition of asset for payment (individual or aggregate) exceeding INR 10,000 per day unless such payment was made by an account payee cheque/draft or through an electronic clearing system through a bank account.
  * Depreciation will not be allowed if deduction is claimed in respect of expenditure on specified business.
  * Specified deductions and lower tax regime as per the Income-tax Act will not be allowed.


## Tax incentives for exports
Export profit from a new undertaking, satisfying prescribed conditions and set up in an SEZ, is eligible for tax exemption of 100% for the first five years, from the year in which manufacturing commences, followed by a partial tax exemption of 50% for the next five years. A further tax exemption of 50% of the export profit for five years is also available after that, subject to an equal amount of profit being retained and transferred to a special reserve in the books of account. The said exemption is available on commencement of eligible business between 1 April 2006 and 31 March 2020.
The Government has further extended the above due date of 31 March 2020 to 30 June 2020, provided that the letter of approval is issued by the SEZ authorities on or before 31 March 2020.
## Tax incentives for offshore banking units in an SEZ
A scheduled bank, or any bank incorporated by or under the laws of a country outside India, that has an offshore banking unit in an SEZ with a specified income that is subject to prescribed conditions is eligible for a tax exemption of 100% of the specified income for five consecutive years beginning from the year in which the permission under the Indian Banking Regulation Act, 1949 or permission or registration under the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (15 of 1992) or any other relevant law was obtained and of 100% of the specified income for five consecutive years thereafter for the tax year commencing on or after 1 April 2023.
## International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) tax incentives 
The following tax incentives are provided under the Indian domestic tax laws for units set up in an IFSC: 
  * A unit in an IFSC with specified income and subject to prescribed conditions is eligible for a tax exemption of 100% of the specified income for 10 years (at the option of the unit) out of 15 years beginning from the year in which the permission under the Indian Banking Regulation Act, 1949, permission/registration under the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, or permission/registration under the International Financial Services Centres Authority Act, 2019 was obtained.

    * Deduction of income arising from the transfer of an aircraft or a ship, leased by an IFSC unit, if the unit commences its operations on or before 31 March 2025.
  * A finance company undertaking specified activities and satisfying certain conditions shall be exempted from the application of thin capitalisation provisions provided under the domestic tax law.
  * Venture capital schemes set-up in an IFSC shall no longer be called upon to explain the source of funds under the income tax law.


## Tax Incentives for specified fund
The following incomes received by a specified fund (which refers to a specified Category III Alternative Investment Fund and investment division of a banking unit of a non-resident located in an IFSC) are exempt from tax:
  * Income earned on transfer of specified capital assets, on a recognised stock exchange located in any IFSC, and where the consideration for such transaction is paid or payable in convertible foreign exchange.
  * Income earned as a result of transfer of securities (as defined in SCRA or as notified by the Central Government) other than shares in a company resident in India.
  * Income from securities issued by a non-resident (not being a PE of a non-resident in India) that does not accrue or arise in India.
  * Income from a securitisation trust chargeable under the heading 'profits and gains of business or profession', to the extent such income is attributable to units held by a non-resident (not being the PE of a non-resident in India).


## Safe harbour for offshore funds managed from India
To encourage the location of offshore fund managers in India, a specific regime has been laid down. In the case of an eligible investment fund, fund management activity carried out through an eligible fund manager acting on behalf of such fund will not constitute a business connection in India. An eligible investment fund will not be treated as resident in India merely because the eligible fund manager undertakes fund management activities in India. Offshore funds and fund managers are required to satisfy certain conditions to be eligible for the regime. Certain conditions are not applicable to funds set up by the government of a foreign state or the Central Bank of a foreign state, a sovereign fund, or such other funds as may be notified by the Government of India and subject to fulfilment of conditions as may be specified. Further, the special regime will be applied in accordance with guidelines and in such manner as the administrative board may prescribe. Further, in respect of eligible investment fund and eligible fund manager located in an IFSC, the Central Government may relax one or more conditions in the future by way of a notification.
## Patent Box Regime
To encourage companies to locate high-value jobs associated with the development, manufacture, and exploitation of patents in India, the government has introduced a concessional taxation regime for income from patents. Accordingly, income by way of royalty in respect of a patent developed and registered in India earned by an eligible taxpayer will be subject to tax at the rate of 10% (plus surcharge and cess) on a gross basis with no allowance of expenditure incurred on royalty income.
An eligible taxpayer means a person resident in India, who is the true and first inventor of the invention, and whose name is entered on the patent register as the patentee.
## Foreign tax credit
_See Foreign income in the section for a description of the foreign tax credit regime_.

Notes
  1. Payments have different threshold limits. The payer is only required to withhold tax if the total payment within a tax year to a single person (except where specified otherwise) is above the limits specified above.
  2. The threshold limit for WHT for non-specified type of interest is INR 5,000, except in the case of interest received from a bank or deposit with post office, for which it is INR 10,000. This threshold limit is increased to INR 50,000 in case of interest provided by a co-operative society, and INR 40,000 if recipient of interest is a senior citizen (i.e. age of more than 60 years).
  3. Where the cash has been withdrawn by any person who has not filed return of income for three immediately preceding financial years, the threshold of INR 10 million will be read as INR 2 million and tax will be deducted at 2% on amount exceeding INR 2 million but not exceeding INR 10 million and 5% on amount above INR 10 million.
  4. The definition of ‘royalty’ also includes consideration for use of, or right to use, computer software. Transfer of all or any rights in respect of any right, property, or information includes transfer of all or any right to use computer software (including granting of a licence), irrespective of the medium through which such a right is transferred and irrespective of whether any right or property is located in India. 
  5. Tax at 2% is to be withheld in case the company is engaged in business of operation of call centres.
  6. Finance Act, 2024 has amended the rate to 2% with effect from 1 October 2024.
  7. Finance Act, 2024 has amended the rate to 0.1% with effect from 1 October 2024.


Important point for consideration:
Finance Act, 2021 has prescribed a levy of higher tax deducted at source (TDS) and tax collected at source (TCS) on non-filers of income tax returns. Accordingly, higher TDS will be applicable to those having interest income, dividend income, annuity pensions, and income from capital gains. However, this higher TDS will only apply to a specified category of non-filers of returns. Further, this new section shall not apply where the tax is required to be deducted in case of salaries, provident fund, winning from lottery, winning from horse rates, income received from a securitisation trust, or cash withdrawal exceeding INR 2 million. As per the provisions under the Indian Income-tax Act, the higher TDS rate applied will be the higher of:
  * twice the rate specified in the relevant provision of the Indian Income-tax Act
  * twice the rate or rates in force, or

  * The payer is obligated to report specific information in the prescribed form (whether or not such payment is chargeable to tax).
  * Where taxes are withheld as per the rates provided above with respect to dividend, interest, royalty, or FTS and there is no other income chargeable to tax in the hands of the non-resident, then compliance obligations relating to filing of return of income by such non-resident in India are not required.


## Tax deducted at source (TDS) on purchase of goods
The Finance Act, 2021 has introduced the provisions related to TDS on purchase of goods, which is applicable from 1 July 2021. The salient features are the following:

Finance Act, 2024 has amended the provisions to include the scope of nil or lower WHT certificate for TDS on purchase of goods.
## Tax collected at source (TCS) on sale of goods
The Finance Act, 2020 has introduced provisions for TCS on sale of goods at the rate of 0.1% on transactions for sale of goods exceeding INR 5 million effective from 1 October 2020. These provisions are applicable only if the turnover/gross receipts of the seller in the immediately preceding year do not exceed INR 100 million. Further, where PAN/Aadhar is not provided by buyer, tax will be collected at the rate of 1%. This provision will not apply where the seller exports goods out of India or the buyer is importing goods into India or the said transaction is already covered under any other provision of tax laws.
## TCS on Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) and on purchase of overseas tour program package
The Finance Act, 2024 has amended the provisions whereby the rate at which tax is required to be collected on the following was reduced from 20% to 5%:

Notes
  1. The treaty tax rates on dividends are not relevant for dividends received up to 31 March 2020 since, under the earlier Indian tax legislation, most dividend income from Indian companies that is subject to DDT is exempt from income tax in the hands of the recipient. However, this scenario has changed since the DDT is abolished and tax is now levied in the hands of the recipient of dividend income with effect from 1 April 2020.
  2. 10% for the use of or right to use any industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment; and in other cases: 
    1. During the first five years of the agreement: 
       * 15% if the payer is the government or specified organisation.
       * 20% in any other case.
    2. Subsequent years: 15% in all cases.
  3. If at least 10% of capital is owned by the beneficial owner (company) of the company paying the dividend or interest.
  4. In absence of specific provision, it may be treated as business profits or independent personal services under respective tax treaties, whichever is applicable.
  5. The Ministry of Finance has issued a notification on 19 March 2024 permitting the benefit of MFN clause under the India-Spain tax treaty. The Indian government amended the India-Spain tax treaty by importing a lower tax rate of 10% for royalty and FTS from the India-Germany tax treaty. The lower tax rate shall be applicable from financial year 2023/24 corresponding to tax year 2024/25.
  6. If royalty relates to copyrights of literary, artistic, or scientific work.
  7. If at least 25% of capital is owned by the beneficial owner (company) of the company paying the dividend.
  8. If at least 25% of capital is owned by the company during at least six months before date of payment.
  9. If paid on a loan granted by a bank/financial institution.
  10. The tax rate for royalties and FTS, under the domestic tax laws, is 20%. This rate is to be increased by a surcharge at 2%/5% on the income tax (based on taxable income) and health and education cess of 4% on the income tax including surcharge. Consequently, the effective tax rate is 20.8%/21.84%. This rate applies for payments made under an agreement entered into on or after 1 June 2005. Accordingly, a tax resident can either use the tax treaty rate or domestic tax rate, whichever is more beneficial.
  11. If interest is received by a financial institution.
  12. Taxable in the country of source as per domestic tax rates.
  13. If royalty payments arise from the use or right to use trademarks.
  14. Tax treaties of certain countries do not have a separate clause specifying the WHT rate for fees for technical services and fees for included services.
  15. 5% if the beneficial owner is a company holding at least 10% of the share capital; 15% in other cases.
  16. 15% of gross amount of dividend in case such dividend is paid out of income derived from immovable property and such income is exempt from tax. 10% in all other cases.
  17. 10% if such interest is paid on a loan granted by a bank carrying on a _bona fide_ banking business or by a similar financial institution (including an insurance company).
  18. 10% if payments of any kind received as consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment and fee for included services that are ancillary and subsidiary to the enjoyment of the property for which payment is received.
  19. Dividend/interest earned by the government and certain institutions, like the Reserve Bank of India, is exempt from taxation in the country of source.
  20. If it is payable in pursuance of any collaboration agreement approved by the government of India.

## Mergers and acquisitions
The expression ‘merger’ has not been defined in the Income-tax Act but has been covered as part of the definition of the term 'amalgamation'. Amalgamation is defined as a merger of one or more companies with another, or the merger of two or more companies to form a new company, in such a way that all the assets and liabilities of the amalgamating company or companies become the assets and liabilities of the amalgamated company, are held by the amalgamated company for a minimum period of five years, and shareholders holding not less than 75% in value of the shares in the amalgamating company or companies become shareholders of the amalgamated company. In case of demerger, the cost of acquisition and period of holding of the assets related to the demerged company will be available to the resulting company.
### Capital gains
No capital gains tax is levied on the transfer of capital assets by an amalgamating company to the amalgamated company, provided the amalgamated company is an Indian company. Similar is the position in case of a demerger by a demerged company to a resulting company.
In cases where shares of an Indian company are transferred by a foreign company or a demerged foreign company to another foreign company or resulting foreign company, there is no tax payable, provided it satisfies certain specified conditions. Furthermore, the shareholder of the amalgamating company or demerged company is not liable to pay capital gains tax on the exchange of shares with that of the amalgamating company or the resulting company under the scheme of amalgamation.
Conversion of a bond or debenture of a company into equity shares is specifically exempt from capital gains tax. Furthermore, conversion of preference shares to equity shares will now be exempt from capital gains tax. The cost of acquisition and period of holding of the preference shares will be considered while determining the cost of acquisition and period of holding of equity shares acquired on such conversion. This is effective from tax year 2018/19 onwards.
## Inter-governmental agreements (IGAs)
The Indian government has signed an IGA with the United States (US) to implement the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) in India. According to the IGA, foreign financial institutions (FFIs) in India are required to report tax information about US account holders to the Indian government, which will, in turn, relay the information about Indian account holders to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Furthermore, the US IRS will provide similar information about Indian citizens having any accounts or assets in the United States. This automatic exchange of information began from 30 September 2015. Subsequent to the signing of the IGA, the Indian government enacted rules relating to FATCA reporting in India.

## Income computation and disclosure standards (ICDS)
The CBDT has notified ten ICDS to be followed by all taxpayers that follow the mercantile system of accounting for the purpose of computation of income chargeable to income tax under the head ‘profits and gains of business or profession’ or ‘income from other sources’ and not for the purpose of maintenance of books of accounts. In case of conflict between the provisions of the Income-tax Act and the ICDS, the provisions of the Income-tax Act will prevail to that extent. These standards have been in effect since tax year 2016/17.
The list of certain important points on implementation of ICDS is given below:
  * Inventory has to be valued at lower of cost or net realisable value. Further, cost of inventory is to include taxes paid, irrespective of recoverable or not.
  * Interest on compensation or enhanced compensation is to be offered to tax in the year of receipt.
  * Any subsidy or grant received from the government that is not adjusted to cost of asset will be offered to tax in year of receipt of such subsidy/grant even if the conditions attached to it are not yet fulfilled.
  * Marked-to-market loss computed in accordance with ICDS will only be allowed.
  * Gain/loss on account of foreign currency fluctuation for monetary and non-monetary items will be computed and allowed as per provisions of ICDS.
  * Profits from construction contracts and/or service contracts will be calculated based on the percentage of completion method. For service contracts with less than a 90-days period, the project completion method can be used. Further, for service contracts with an indeterminate number of acts over a specific period of time, the straight-line method can be used. Retention money will be included while computing contract revenue.
  * It may be noted that ICDS does not recognise the concept of materiality and the concept of prudence.


## Capital gains
Capital gains refer to the gains made on the transfer of a capital asset. Transfer includes sale, exchange, relinquishment, or extinguishment of rights in an asset. Capital assets are either short-term capital assets or long-term capital assets. Long-term capital gains are eligible for a concessional rate of tax and indexation of cost of purchase and cost of improvement (_discussed below_).
Short-term capital assets are capital assets held for a period of not more than 36 months. In case of listed shares, listed securities, or units of specified mutual funds or zero-coupon bonds, the short-term holding period is not more than 12 months, and in case of unlisted shares is not more than 24 months. Capital assets that do not qualify as short-term capital assets are considered as long-term capital assets.
Normally, long-term capital gains are determined after increasing the cost by a prescribed multiplier that varies with the period of holding, to adjust for inflation. In case of non-residents, capital gains on transfer of shares or debentures in Indian companies are computed in the foreign currency in which the shares or debentures were acquired, and the capital gains are then reconverted into Indian currency to compute the tax liability thereon.
Capital gains are taxed as follows:
  * Long-term capital gains on the transfer of equity shares in a company acquired on or after 1 October 2004 will be exempted only if STT was paid at the time of acquisition. This exemption stands withdrawn from 1 April 2018. Post such withdrawal, the long-term capital gains exceeding INR 125,000 will be taxed at the rate of 10% (plus surcharge and health and education cess). The said amendment will be applicable to units of equity-oriented funds as well. The benefit of adjustment of cost of inflation index will not be available. In addition, the benefit of computation of long-term capital gains in foreign currency in the case of a non-resident will not be allowed.
  * Other long-term capital gains are subject to taxation at 20% (plus the surcharge and health and education cess). However, long-term capital gains arising from the transfer of listed securities, units, or zero-coupon bonds on which STT is not paid are taxed at 10% (without adjusting the cost for inflation) or at 20% (after adjusting the cost for inflation), whichever is more beneficial to the taxpayer. These rates exclude surcharge and health and education cess.
  * Long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (not being a company) or a foreign company from transfer of unlisted securities, shares, debentures, etc. are taxable at 10% (plus surcharge and health and education cess) without any indexation benefit.
  * Short-term capital gains on the transfer of listed shares in a company or units of an equity-oriented fund that are subject to STT are taxed at 15% (plus surcharge and health and education cess).
  * Other short-term capital gains are subject to taxation at the normal rates.
  * The indexation benefit is available on cost of acquisition and cost of improvement for assets classified as long-term while computing capital gains. The taxpayer will have the option to consider the fair market value of the asset on 1 April 2001 as the cost of acquisition where date of acquisition is before 1 April 2001. This is effective from the tax year 2018/19.


Finance Act, 2024 has rationalised the capital gains tax regime. These amended provisions are applicable for transfer made on or after 23 July 2024. The provisions amended by Finance Act, 2024 have been provided as follows:
  * Period of holding for determining nature of capital gains: 
    * All capital assets are to be treated as long-term capital assets if they are held for a period of more than 24 months.
    * All listed securities are to be considered as long-term capital assets if they are held for more than 12 months.


  * Applicable tax rate:


  *     * Tax on short-term capital gains on transfer of listed securities that are subject to STT shall be levied at 20%.
    * Tax on long-term capital gains on all assets shall be levied at 12.5%. The benefit of indexation while computing long-term capital gains have been abolished.
    * The exemption limit on long-term capital gains on transfer of listed securities is increased to INR 125,000.


  * Income on transfer, redemption, or maturity of unlisted debentures or unlisted bonds on or after 23 July 2024 is to be deemed as short-term capital gains.


Finance Act, 2024 also provides that for resident individuals and HUFs, if a land or building was acquired before 23 July 2024 and such land/building is transferred on or after 23 July 2024, the tax on long-term capital gains is required to be computed in accordance with the amended provisions, and in case tax computed in accordance with the amended provisions exceeds the tax computed as per the capital gains tax regime applicable prior to Finance Act, 2024, such excess capital gain tax shall be ignored and shall not be required to be paid.
## Taxability of transfer of property for nil or inadequate consideration
Where a person is in receipt of the following property for nil consideration or for an inadequate consideration, then the difference between the fair value of the property and the consideration paid will be considered as deemed income in the hands of recipient of the property:
  * Any sum of money.
  * Any immovable property being land or building, or both.
  * Any property, other than immovable property, being shares and securities, jewellery, archaeological collections, drawings, paintings, sculptures, any work of art, and bullion.


In a case where the difference between the fair value of property and consideration paid does not exceed INR 50,000, the same will be ignored from this taxation. However, the limit of INR 50,000 was libralised in case of immovable property. It is now provided that no adjustments will be made in a case where the variation between stamp duty value and the sale consideration is not more than 10% of the sale consideration.
## Dividend income
Dividend income received by a domestic company with effect from 1 April 2020 will be taxable in hands of resident shareholders at the rates applicable to them.
A provision in the Income-tax Act has been introduced to provide for WHT at 10% on dividends in respect of units of mutual funds (in excess of INR 5,000) on dividend payments to resident shareholders.
Finance Act, 2022 has also withdrawn the concessional rate of 15% on dividend income received by Indian companies from specified foreign companies (shareholding of 26% or more) with effect from FY 2023/24.
In case of non-resident shareholders, dividends received post 1 April 2020 may be taxed at the rate of 20% under the Income-tax Act or tax treaty rate, whichever is beneficial.
WHT obligations will arise in the hands of a company distributing dividends to non-resident shareholders in such case. A corresponding deduction on account of interest would be allowed to the extent of 20% of such dividend income. This change is brought considering that the dividend distribution tax (DDT) has been abolished with effect from 1 April 2020.
Finance Act, 2024 has amended the provisions related to taxability of buyback of shares. As per the amended provisions, the buyback proceeds shall be considered as deemed dividend in the hands of shareholders. The amended provisions shall be applicable with effect from 1 October 2024.
## Interest income
Interest income received by an Indian company is taxable at normal CIT rates. Interest income received by a foreign company is taxed at a concessional rate of withholding at 5%/20%, subject to conditions. For companies engaged in manufacturing business and opting to pay corporate tax at the lower rate, interest income shall be taxable at 25.17% (including applicable surcharge and education cess).
## Foreign income
An Indian company is taxed on its worldwide income. A foreign company is taxed only on income that is received in India, or that accrues or arises, or is deemed to accrue or arise, in India. This income is subject to any favourable tax treaty provisions. According to the current tax law, payments for allowing/transferring the right to use software, customised data, or transmission of any signal by satellite, cable, optic fibre, or similar technology are taxable as royalty income deemed to accrue or arise in India, whether or not the location of such right or property is in India. The Indian Revenue Department notified the rules to grant foreign tax credit to resident taxpayers in respect of taxes paid in overseas countries. The rules lay down broad principles and conditions for computation and claim of foreign tax credit, respectively. In cases where the taxpayer has not been given credit of certain taxes paid outside India since the tax was under dispute, the taxpayer can approach the tax officer within six months from the end of the month in which the dispute was settled with prescribed documents. The tax officer has been empowered to pass an order granting consequential relief. This has been made effective from FY 2018/19 onwards.
Double taxation of foreign income for residents is avoided through tax treaties that generally provide for the deduction of the lower of foreign tax or Indian tax on the doubly taxed income from tax payable in India. Similar relief is allowed unilaterally where no tax treaty exists, in which case a resident would be taxed under the Income-tax Act but would be allowed a deduction from the Indian income tax payable of a sum being the lower of the Indian tax rate on the doubly taxed income or the rate of tax prevailing in the other country in which income is already taxed.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
## Goods and services tax (GST)
GST is an indirect tax, which is a transaction-based taxation regime, that has been in effect in India since 1 July 2017. 
Multiple indirect taxes (except customs duty) have been subsumed within GST, and there is one single tax applicable on supply of goods and services. However, there are a few products that continue to be outside the ambit of GST, such as petrol, diesel, aviation turbine fuel (ATF), natural gas, alcohol for human consumption, and crude oil.
For smooth GST operation, the government has formed a GST Council, which consists of the State Finance Ministers representing their states. The GST Council provides recommendations to the government on various aspects of GST law, such as rate revisions and amendments in GST rules, issuance of notifications, circulars, etc.
### GST regime
GST is a comprehensive ‘consumption tax’ levied on the supply of all goods and services. Indian GST is a dual model:
  * Central GST (CGST), levied by the Central Government.
  * State GST (SGST)/Union Territory GST (UTGST), levied by the State Governments/Union Territories.


In case of intra-state supply of goods and services, CGST+SGST/UTGST would become applicable, and in case of inter-state supply of goods and services, Integrated GST (IGST) would become applicable. IGST is a sum of CGST and SGST/UTGST. The rate of GST varies from 5% to 28% depending upon the category of goods and services being supplied or procured, the general rate of tax being 18% for the majority of supplies. Additionally, some categories of goods/services, such as vehicles, aerated beverages, etc., notified by the government are subject to compensation cess under GST. Apart from the applicable GST rates, the government also imposes cess on certain products, such as sale of cars, soft beverages, etc.
The threshold limit for the purpose of obtaining GST registration is INR 2 million aggregate turnover in a financial year (INR 1 million for some special category states, such as the North-Eastern states). For the purpose of the threshold, aggregate turnover will be computed on a PAN-India basis. For some specific categories of supplies and suppliers, the registration requirement is mandatory.
However, the threshold for obtaining GST registration by a person who is engaged in exclusive intra-state supply of goods is INR 4 million aggregate turnover in a financial year, except in some specified cases.
Also, for some special category states making supply of goods/services (_viz._ Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Sikkim, and Uttarakhand), the threshold limit has increased from INR 1 million to INR 2 million. For other special category states, the threshold continues to be INR 1 million.
Similar to previous VAT laws, there is a concept of composition scheme under GST for small traders. Small traders having turnover of INR 10 million have an option to avail a composition scheme. Under the said scheme, GST at a lower rate (1% of the taxable turnover for manufacturers/traders and 5% in case of restaurants) would apply. The option to avail such a scheme restricts the admissibility to avail input credit.
Further, the option to pay tax under a composition scheme has been extended to services, except for the following:
  * Supply of services not leviable to tax under the CGST Act.
  * Inter-state outward supply of services.
  * Outward supply of services through an e-commerce operator.


### Import of goods and services
The import of goods under the GST regime will be subject to IGST and compensation cess (if applicable), along with basic custom duty (BCD) and social welfare surcharge (up to 10% levied on the BCD). BCD and social welfare surcharge paid at the time of imports are not available as credit under GST; consequently, they will always be a cost to the importer.
Similar to erstwhile service tax laws, on import of service, service recipient would be liable to pay IGST under reverse charge. Also, there are specified categories of goods and services notified by the government on which GST needs to be paid by the recipient under reverse charge such as legal services, Goods Transport Agency services, etc.
Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) _vide_ Notification Nos. 11/2023, 12/2023, and 13/2023, dated 26 September 2023, has exempted the importers from paying IGST on ocean freight in cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) contracts. This is pursuant to the Supreme Court’s pronouncement in the matter of Mohit Minerals.
### Zero-rated supplies/export of goods and services
Export of goods and services are zero rated under GST. Exporters can claim refund of input tax credit (ITC) of inputs/input services used in export of goods/services, subject to fulfilment of prescribed conditions. To claim the zero rate on exports, there is a requirement to file a bond/Letter of Undertaking (LUT) to the jurisdictional tax authorities at the beginning of each financial year. Alternatively, the exporter can pay tax on output and claim refund for the same. 
Also, the supplies to an SEZ for authorised operations have been made zero rated under GST. Unlike the erstwhile indirect tax regime, which involved a lot of paperwork to claim export refund claims, a simplified online process to claim refund of exports has been specified under GST. The taxpayer is required to file a refund application and submit the relevant documents online on the GST portal.
To facilitate trade for smaller exporters, the concept of 'merchant exporter' has been introduced under GST. Accordingly, the merchant exporters will now have to pay nominal GST of 0.1% for procuring goods from domestic suppliers for export, subject to specified conditions.
Some clarifications issued by the government in relation to claiming refunds are as follows:
  * Aadhaar authentication of registration made mandatory for being eligible for filing refund claim.
  * Bank account for credit of refund means such bank account of the applicant that is in the name of the applicant and obtained on one's PAN (i.e. tax identification number).
  * Option for filing refund of accumulated ITC by taxpayers making exempt/nil-rated supplies, by selecting an option of not having an LUT number in the refund application (to enable a taxpayer making exempt and/or nil-rated supplies, without LUT, to file a refund application [as they don’t have a valid LUT number to enter in the refund application], the Form RFD-01 has now been modified).
  * To facilitate exporters, bunching of refund claims across financial years has now been allowed.
  * Previously, to claim a refund of zero-rated supply of services, there was a requirement to receive remittance in foreign exchange within a stipulated time period. Now this requirement has been extended to zero-rated supply of goods as well.
  * Refund of accumulated ITC is restricted to the amount appearing in Form GSTR-2A/2B. However, the department has now clarified that the restriction will not impact the refund of ITC availed on the invoices/documents relating to imports, Input Service Distributor (ISD) invoices, and the inward supplies liable to reverse charge (RCM supplies) merely because the same is not reflecting in Form GSTR-2A.
  * For export of goods, if unutilised ITC is claimed as refund, it is proposed to be mandated to realise the consideration in foreign currency within the timelines prescribed in the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) guidelines. If the consideration is not realised within the prescribed time, the refund needs to be remitted back to the government along with interest.
  * Refund of payment wrongly made through electronic credit ledger is allowed (refund amount would be re-credited to credit ledger).


### Input tax credit (ITC)
As per the ITC provisions stipulated under GST law, a registered taxable person is eligible to claim ITC of such goods and services that are used or intended to be used in the course or furtherance of business. However, there is a specified list of goods and services mentioned below where credit will not be available under GST:
  * Personal use of goods and services procured.
  * Goods and services being used for effecting exempt supplies.
  * Supply of the following goods and services: 
    * Motor vehicles (credit available in certain cases where used for transportation business).
    * Specific credit restriction in respect of general insurance, servicing, repairs and maintenance, hiring, leasing, etc. in respect of motor vehicles, except when used for specified purposes (e.g. used in further supply of vehicles, for transportation of goods/passengers).
    * Food and beverages, outdoor catering, beauty treatment, health services, cosmetic and plastic surgery, except where such inward supply of goods or services of a particular category is used by a registered taxable person for making an outward taxable supply of the same category of goods or services.
    * Membership of a club, health, and fitness centre.
    * Rent-a-cab, life insurance, health insurance, except where the government notifies the services that are obligatory for an employer to provide to its employees under any law for the time being in force.
    * Travel benefits extended to employees on vacation, such as leave or home travel concession.
    * Works contract services when supplied for construction of immovable property, other than plant and machinery, except where it is an input service for further supply of works contract service.
    * Goods or services received by a taxable person for construction of an immovable property on one's own account, other than plant and machinery, even when used in the course or furtherance of business to the extend capitalised.
    * Goods lost, stolen, destroyed, written off, or disposed of by way of gift or free samples.


Having said the above, the ITC of goods and services that are obligatory for an employer to provide to its employees, under any law for the time being in force, is allowed.
Under GST, taxpayers are allowed to take ITC and utilise the same for payment of output tax liability. However, no ITC on account of CGST can be utilised towards payment of SGST/UTGST and _vice versa_. The credit IGST credit needs to be first utilised towards payment of output IGST liability. The IGST credit can be utilised to offset CGST/SGST or UTGST output liability, as the case may be, in any order.
#### Procedure for ITC availment
  * Possession of tax invoice/debit note or any other credit availing document.
  * Goods/services should have been received.
  * ITC can be availed only on invoices/debit notes that have been furnished by the supplier in its Form GSTR-1 and are reflected in auto-populated Form GSTR-2A/2B of the buyer claiming ITC.
  * The date of issuance of a debit note has been de-linked from the date of issuance of the underlying invoice for purposes of availing ITC. Given the same, ITC on debit notes is available irrespective of the date of invoice to which it relates (earlier there was a specified timeline to avail GST credit against a debit note). The functionality has been made effective on GST portal. Further, with effect from 1 January 2021, the date of issuance of debit note (not the date of underlying invoice) will determine the relevant financial year for the purpose of determining time period to avail credit as per the GST law.
  * Where credit has been availed based on invoice, the recipient would be liable to pay credit so availed in case where return has not been furnished by the supplier.
  * Penalty and prosecution provisions have been made more stringent in case of passing on or availing fraudulent ITC.


Also, it is pertinent to note that the credit pool is state-specific (i.e. IGST, CGST, and SGST of one state cannot be used to offset output of IGST, CGST, and SGST liability of another state).
### Compliance
#### Monthly returns
There are three monthly returns for a normal taxpayer under GST:
  * Form GSTR-1 for output (to be filed by the 11th day of the succeeding month). There is an option to file quarterly Form GSTR-1 returns (to be filed by the last day of the succeeding quarter) for suppliers whose turnover in the previous or current financial year was less than INR 15 million. Form GSTR-1 with no outward data can also be filed with a single click functionality on the GST portal.
  * Form GSTR-2 for ITC (by the 15th day of the succeeding month).
  * Form GSTR-3, a monthly tax return (by the 20th day of the succeeding month).


The government has notified a requirement to file monthly Form GSTR-3B (to be filed by the 20th day of the succeeding month).
Further, filing of Forms GSTR-2 and GSTR-3 continues to be suspended by the government.
The government had proposed to implement a new GST return system. The existing returns Form GSTR 1/GSTR 3B would be revamped in lines with the new format. However, this has currently been kept in abeyance (i.e. the existing system of Forms GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B is to continue).
#### Annual return
There is a requirement to file a GST annual return by 31 December of the succeeding financial year. Also, along with a GST annual return, suppliers whose turnover exceeds INR 50 million in a financial year are required to file a GST Audit Report by 31 December of the succeeding financial year.
### Key updates
#### Compliance related
  * Facility to view and download Electronic Credit Ledger, Electronic Cash Ledger, and Electronic Liability Register from the GST portal is available for 12 months (earlier this facility was available for six months).
  * A download facility is available on the CBIC/GST portal for the entire Harmonised System of Nomenclature (HSN) directory in Excel format has also been provided to taxpayers under the link 'Download HSN in Excel Format'. This facility is available as a part of the ‘Search HSN’ functionality, available both in Pre and Post Login.
  * The taxpayers having annual aggregate turnover up to INR 20 million are exempted from the requirement of furnishing annual return from FY 2020/21 onwards.
  * Effective from 1 September 2021, the GSTN portal will check whether, before the filing of Form GSTR-1 of a tax-period, the following has been filed or not: 
    * Form GSTR-3B for the previous month (for monthly filers), or
    * Form GSTR-3B for the previous quarterly tax period (for quarterly filers), as the case may be.
  * Form GSTR-1 filing has been made mandatory before filing of Form GSTR-3B for the concerned month.
  * Taxpayers whose annual aggregate turnover in the preceding financial year is above INR 50 million shall furnish ITC-04 (job work return) once in six months commencing on 1 April and 1 October.
  * Taxpayers whose annual aggregate turnover in the preceding financial year is up to INR 50 million shall furnish ITC-04 once in a financial year.
  * A self-service functionality has been made available on the GST Portal that can be used to search Bill of Entry (BOE) details, which did not auto-populate in GSTR-2A, in GST System, and fetch the missing records from ICEGATE.
  * It usually takes two days (after reference date, either out of charge date, duty payment date, or amendment date, whichever is later) for BOE details to get updated on the GST Portal from ICEGATE.
  * Enabled furnishing of nil return in Form GSTR 3B or in Form GSTR-1 for a tax period through a SMS using the registered mobile number, which shall be verified based on one-time password facility.
  * An auto-populated ITC statement Form GSTR-2B facility has been enabled from 12 September 2020 (available on 14th of subsequent month) capturing details of credit available on import of goods, domestic procurement, etc. Basis statement taxpayers can reconcile credit to be availed/revered in monthly Form GSTR-3B. With effect from January 2022, only the credit that reconciles with GSTR-2B can be availed. No excessive credit permitted to be availed. Unreconciled credit can be carried forward to the next month’s compliance period for reconciliation with Form GSTR-2B. Such carryforward of credit can be made till the 30th day of November of the succeeding year, post which the credit would lapse.
  * The government for the returns to be filed for October 2024 has introduced a new input mapping mechanism in the form of the Invoice Management System (IMS), which is in the form of a dashboard that captures the details of ITC transactions based on output returns filed by the vendors of the recipient. The recipient, upon perusal of such details, has to take an action in the form of acceptance, rejection, or deferral of the inward transaction. Based on the action undertaken by the recipient, form 2B would be generated, which will form the basis for ITC availment in the GSTR-3B return in each month. The IMS functionality is optional till January 2025, post which it has been proposed to be made mandatory.
  * The government has made an amendment within the Finance Act, 2022 to specify that all year-end adjustments (i.e. availment of credit, reporting of credit/debit notes) can be made till 30 November of the succeeding financial year. Previously, such a timeline was specified as last date for filing of return for the month of September of succeeding financial year.
  * The government has further relaxed the ITC matching provisions for the period of FY 2017/18, 2018/19, and 2019/20, where, previously, ITC appearing in Forms GSTR-2A/2B till return filing of September of the succeeding financial year was considered, the same has now been extended till 30 November of the succeeding financial year.
  * The government has notified an amendment in the GST provisions wherein, it has been specified that interest on delayed payment of tax would be levied only in cases where the taxpayer has wrongly availed and utilised credit.
  * New HSN disclosure norms applicable from 1 April 2021. This is in respect of HSN reporting of supply of goods or services at the time of filing GST returns. The requirement of quoting HSN as per table below has been mandated on e-way bills and e-invoices, respectively.  Aggregate turnover in the preceding financial year | Number of digits of HSN code  
---|---  
Below INR 50 million | 4 (not required for B2C invoices)  
Above INR 50 million | 6  
  * A GST Officer can proceed for cancellation of GSTIN where a taxpayer avails ITC exceeding that permissible in Section 16 of CGST Act, 2017 (i.e. not reconciling with Form GSTR 2B), and, where the liability declared in Form GSTR-3B is less than that declared in Form GSTR-1 in a particular month, the department may now proceed with cancellation of GSTIN.
  * Now, no opportunity of being heard shall be given to a taxpayer for suspension of GSTIN, where the proper officer has reasons to believe that the registration of person is liable to be cancelled.
  * Where a GSTIN is suspended, no refund under Section 54 of Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 can be availed by the taxpayer.
  * Where a taxpayer fails to file Form GSTR-3B for two subsequent months, Form GSTR-1 shall now be blocked. 
  * The government has introduced certain changes in Form GSTR-3B, such as reporting of ineligible credit, reporting of credit reversals, etc. Further, a new table in Form GSTR-3B has also been introduced, whereby, electronic commerce operators can disclose supplies on which tax is to be paid by them.
  * The CBIC has issued an advisory to clarify that the impact of credit notes and their amendments will now be auto-populated in relevant tables of Form GSTR-3B. Further, taxpayers can now enter negative values for credit notes while filing Form GSTR-3B.
  * The GSTN portal, with a perspective to streamline the credit reversal and reclaim of ITC, has introduced the electronic credit reversal and reclaimed statement to validate the taxpayer’s reclaimed ITC. 
  * In order to introduce uniformity in the reporting disclosure of reversal of input credit within Form GSTR-3B, certain amendments were introduced whereby the total input credit as reflected in the Form GSTR-2B (including ineligible credit) is auto-populated in the relevant table of Form GSTR-3B. Correspondingly, the total credit as available in Form GSTR-2B is bifurcated into the following two streams: 
    * Permanent reversal of ineligible input credit that is blocked as per GST regulations.


Such ineligible credit is to be permanently reversed and reported within Table-4B (1) of Form GSTR-3B.
  *     * Temporary reversal of credit to be reported under Table-4(B) (2) of Form GSTR-3B. Such temporary reversal can be re-availed through subsequent returns post fulfilment of requisite ITC availment criteria as prescribed under Section 16 of the CGST Act.


Till the time of the availment of such input credit within Form GSTR-3B return, such input credit is carried forward with the pool of the total credit.
  * The government had extended the timelines for issuance of order by the adjudication authorities for litigation matters such as tax short paid or ITC wrongly availed, etc., as follows: 
    * For the FY 2018/19: Up to 30 April 2024.
    * For the FY 2019/20: Up to 31 August 2024.


#### Clarifications
  * It is clarified that there is no need to carry a physical copy of tax invoice in cases where invoice has been generated by the supplier in the prescribed manner and production of the Quick Response (QR) code having an embedded Invoice Reference Number (IRN) electronically, for verification by the proper officer, would suffice.
  * It is clarified that a company incorporated in India and a body corporate incorporated by or under the laws of a country outside India, which is also referred to as foreign company under Companies Act, are separate persons under the GST law, and thus are separate legal entities. Accordingly, these two separate persons would not be considered as 'merely establishments' of a distinct person in accordance with provisions of the GST law. This was one of the major issues why the tax authorities were rejecting the GST refund claims for various taxpayers.
  * Time period to claim refund of tax paid on an intra-state/inter-state supply subsequently held to be inter-state/intra-state supply is two years from the date of payment of tax under the correct head. Earlier, there was ambiguity around the time period to claim such refund claim.
  * It is clarified that service provided by way of cooking and supply of food, by cloud kitchens/central kitchens, are covered under the category of 'restaurant services' and attract 5% GST [without ITC].
  * It is clarified that where ice cream parlours sell pre-manufactured ice cream and do not cook/prepare ice cream for consumption, such as a restaurant, it is supply of ice cream as goods and not as a service, even if the supply has certain ingredients of service. Accordingly, it is clarified that ice cream sold by a parlour or any similar outlet would attract GST at the rate of 18%.
  * A circular dated 3 August 2022 clarified the GST implications on liquidated damages, compensation, and penalty arising out of breach of contract wherein it has been specified that amounts paid only to compensate for injury, loss, or damage suffered by the aggrieved party is not liable to GST. Similarly, forfeiture amounts, fines, penalties, etc. in which there is no underlying supply are not liable to GST.
  * Guidelines for disallowing debit of electronic credit ledger have been issued.
  * Clarification issued around classification of intermediary services.
  * The CBIC clarified that director's remuneration declared as 'salaries' in the books of company (subject to tax deducted at source) is the consideration for the services provided by an employee to the employer in the course of or in relation to employment.

  * Further, it has been clarified that part of employee director remuneration that is not declared as salary in the company's books and is subject to tax deducted at source (fee for professional or technical services) would be liable to GST under reverse charge (i.e. company would be liable to discharge GST liability on it under reverse charge).

#### SEZ-related updates
  * A new declaration has been introduced in the SEZ online portal while filing the DTA Procurement Form (Goods) and DSPF (services) confirming that the supplies are availed by an SEZ entity from DTA for authorized operations only.
  * Ad hoc extension till 30 June 2020 had been provided for undertaking compliances filing of SOFTEX, Annual Performance Reports, Extension of Letter of Approval (LoA), etc. For ease of doing business on account of the COVID-19 outbreak, revised guidelines for work from home have been issued. Further, the last date of filing ARPs/QPRs by SEZ units/Developers/EOUs has been extended to 31 December 2020.

  * Development Commissioners have been requested to advise State Government/Private SEZs to consider similar relief measures.
  * In the Union Budget for FY 2022/23, the government proposed to replace the existing law governing SEZs with a new legislation, proposals of which include incentives, such as retention of zero-rating of IGST on domestic procurement by a unit in an SEZ, continuation of indirect tax benefits to developers of these zones, and allowing depreciation on sale of used capital goods cleared to domestic tariff areas. The new legislation is envisaged to enable states to become partners in 'Development of Enterprise and Service Hubs' (DESHs).
  * A new facility has been implemented in the SEZ Online System regarding Service Exports Filing (SERF) to declare the foreign currency value of the transaction, and the system will automatically calculate and present the rupee value based on the exchange rates present in the system for the invoice date. This facility is already available in 'Softex Forms' and now it has been extended to 'SERF' as well. Also, in case of non-standard currencies (if any), the exchange rate declared by the user will be considered for calculating the rupee value.
  * Facility for Online Payment of Customs Duty (SEZ to DTA transactions) is being significantly enhanced to enable net-banking facility and API-based processing. This will be an additional facility (i.e. in addition to existing facility of NEFT/RTGS-based payments). SEZ online has initiated testing with ICEGATE for the same. ICEGATE is expected to enable this from 1 April 2023 tentatively.


#### Concept of e-invoicing under GST
The government introduced an e-invoicing system under GST laws with effect from 1 October 2021. A summary of the key aspects of the proposed e-invoicing system is briefly explained below.
  * The e-invoicing (for B2B invoices/GST registered recipients) was made mandatory from 1 October 2021 for the taxpayers whose aggregate turnover in a financial year (in any of the last three financial years) exceeded INR 500 million. 
  * The applicability of the e-invoicing threshold was INR 5 billion till 31 December 2020 and INR 1 billion till 31 March 2021, which was further revised to INR 500 million with effect from 1 April 2021, INR 200 million with effect from 1 April 2022, and INR 100 million with effect from 1 October 2022.
  * The turnover limit for e-invoicing purposes has been revised to INR 50 million with effect from 1 August 2023.


  * E-invoicing is a system in which invoices would be authenticated electronically by a portal of the government.
  * The companies would need to submit details related to the invoice on the government approved/authorised portal known as the Invoice Registration Portal (IRP), which would issue a unique identification number (i.e. Invoice Registration Number [IRN]) and QR code against every invoice.
  * Without an IRN/QR code, the invoice issued by the company would be invalid and the recipient company would not be eligible to avail credit.
  * All invoice information will be transferred from the IRP to the GST portal (of both supplier and recipient).
  * Certain classes of registered persons (insurance company, banking company, financial institution, non-banking financial institution, GTA, passenger transportation service, SEZ units, government departments and local authorities, persons supplying services by way of admission to the exhibition of cinematographic films in multiplex services, etc.) are exempted from issuing e-invoices or capturing dynamic QR codes.
  * Further, effective from 1 October 2021, for invoices issued to unregistered customers (B2C), such taxpayers are required to issue/capture dynamic QR code on the invoice. The purpose of dynamic QR code is to encourage digital payments where buyers can scan the dynamic QR code and make payment from mobile wallet directly.
  * According to an update on the e-invoice portal, with effect from 1 November 2023, it has been decided to impose a time limit of 30 days on reporting of old invoices (including debit notes and credit notes) on the e-invoice portal for taxpayers with turnover greater than or equal to INR 1 billion.


#### Other GST returns
With effect from 1 October 2018, the government has made tax deducted at source/tax collected at source provisions stipulated under GST laws effective.
Tax deducted at source provisions are applicable on cases specified under section 52 of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. The notified taxpayers, like the government, Public Sector Undertakings, etc., are required to deduct 2% tax (1% CGST, 1% SGST, or 2% IGST) on payments made for goods/services to suppliers where payment exceeds INR 0.25 million. The tax so collected would be available as credit to the supplier in its electronic cash register, which can be used for set-off against future tax liabilities.
Tax collected at source provisions are applicable for e-commerce operators. Every e-commerce operator is required to deduct 1% tax (0.5% CGST, 0.5% SGST, or 1% IGST) on net value of supplies provided by suppliers through the e-commerce operator's portal. As per the Notification, for the supplies made through the platform of an e-commerce operator, tax is to be paid by the said e-commerce operator. Further, such transactions are to be reported by the e-commerce operator within their Form GSTR-3B.
The requirement of issuance of the tax deducted at source certificate under GST laws has been relaxed (post acceptance of tax deducted at source by deductee on GST portal, it shall be electronically available on GST portal).
The due date of filing the tax collected at source return (Form GSTR-8) is the 10th day of the next month. 
### E-way bills
The e-way bill is an electronic bill that will be required for the movement of goods in case the value of the consignment is above INR 50,000. The movement of goods may be (i) in relation to supply, (ii) for reasons other than supply, or (iii) due to inward supply from unregistered persons.
The e-way bill can be generated from the GSTN portal, and every GST-registered taxpayer is required to comply with the requirement to issue an e-way bill.
With effect from 16 November 2018, new enhancements have been made in the e-way bill system, which involves checking of duplicate e-way bills, complete knock down/semi knock down movement of goods imported/exported, shipping address to be mentioned on e-way bill for goods exported outside India, etc.
A rule was inserted such that a person, including consignor, consignee, transporter, courier agency, or an e-commerce operator, who has not filed their GST returns for two consecutive tax periods will not be allowed to generate an e-way bill. 
In cases where the principal supply is purely a supply of service and involving no movement of goods, the e-way bill is not required to be generated.
However, in cases where, along with the principal supply of service, movement of some goods is also involved, the e-way bill may be generated. Such situations may arise in cases of supply of services like printing services, works contract services, catering services, pandal or shamiana services, etc. In such cases, the e-way bill may be generated by entering the details of HSN code of the goods, along with SAC (Service Accounting Code) of services involved.
### Advance rulings for Customs and GST
To enable foreign investors to ascertain their indirect tax liabilities arising from proposed business ventures in India, the Central Government has constituted the Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) as a high-level, quasi-judicial body. The functions of the AAR consist of giving advance rulings on a specific set of facts relating to specified matters under Customs and GST.
Advance rulings may be sought by any resident/non-resident investor entering into a joint venture in India in collaboration with another non-resident or resident of India, or by a resident setting up a joint venture in India in collaboration with a non-resident. This facility has also been made available to existing joint ventures in India. The Central Government is also empowered to include any other class or category of persons as eligible for the benefit of an advance ruling. Under the customs law, the Central Government has allowed a ‘resident public limited company’ to be eligible for an advance ruling. Under the erstwhile excise and service tax regime, advance rulings could be given only on a proposed transaction, whereas under GST, advance rulings can be obtained on a proposed transaction as well as a transaction being undertaken by the appellant.
In terms of GST provisions, the following matters/questions specified can be sought before the AAR:
  * Classification of any goods or services, or both.
  * Applicability of a notification issued under the provisions of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017.
  * Determination of time and value of supply of goods or services, or both.
  * Admissibility of ITC of tax paid or deemed to have been paid.
  * Determination of the liability to pay tax on any goods or services, or both.
  * Whether applicant is required to be registered.
  * Whether any particular thing done by the applicant with respect to any goods or services, or both, amounts to or results in a supply of goods or services, or both, within the meaning of that term.


The comprehensive provision for advance rulings is provided under GST to ensure that disputes are minimal. Timelines are also given within which the ruling is to be given by the concerned authority. The aim is to provide certainty to the taxpayer with respect to one's obligations under the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 and an expeditious ruling, so that the relationship between the taxpayer and administration is smooth and transparent and avoids unnecessary litigation.
### Amnesty scheme under indirect tax
Various states (_viz_. Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Haryana, etc.) have introduced amnesty schemes for settlement of past VAT dues with waiver (certain percentage) of tax dues, interest, and penalty dues, subject to fulfilment of prescribed conditions.
Late fees for composition dealers have been reduced to INR 500 through Notification No. 2/2023-Central Tax, dated 31 March 2023, in case of delayed filing of GSTR-4 from 1 July 2017 to 31 March 2022, provided that the taxpayer’s file it on or before 30 June 2023. Further, if the tax payable is nil, then no late fees is required to be paid.
As per Notification No. 2/2023-Central Tax, dated 31 March 2023, the taxable person whose registration got cancelled on account of non-filing of returns and who had failed to file revocation within the time limit (i.e. 30 days) can now apply for revocation of cancellation up to 30 June 2023 only after furnishing the returns due till effective date of cancellation along with due tax, interest, penalty, and late fee.
Best judgement assessment order shall be deemed to be withdrawn, provided returns along with interest and late fees have been filed up to 30 June 2023.
The late fees for delayed furnishing of the annual return for FY 2017/18 to FY 2021/22 has been reduced through Notification No. 7/2023-Central Tax, dated 31 March 2023, to INR 20,000 (CGST 10,000 + SGST 10,000), provided such return has been furnished up to 30 June 2023.
The time limit for passing order under section 73(10) (i.e. non-fraud cases) has been extended by further three months in each of the FYs 2017/18, 2018/19, and 2019/20, as follows:
  * FY 2017/18: 31 December 2023.
  * FY 2018/19: 31 March 2024.
  * FY 2019/20: 30 June 2024.


The CBIC extended the time limit for availing the benefit of amnesty schemes as stated above, which were notified dated 31 March 2023, till 31 August 2023.
The time limit for filing appeal against demand orders under sections 73 and 74 issued till 31 March 2023 has been extended to 31 January 2024. The extension is subject to making a pre-deposit of 12.5% (as against 10%) of the tax under dispute (with at least an incremental 2.5% to be discharged from the electronic cash ledger).
The government has recently introduced an amnesty scheme through the CGST Act for matters pending under litigation other than fraud, misrepresentation, etc. under section 74 of the CGST Act. Through such amnesty, taxpayers can avail the benefit of resolution of such ongoing or pending matters through making payment of tax liability and availing the benefit of waiver of interest and penalty for the periods of FYs 2017/18, 2018/19, and 2019/20.
## Customs duty
All goods imported into India are subject to customs entry requirements and are subject to customs duty generally on an _ad valorem_ basis, except for few items (e.g. edible oils, gold, silver) that are subject to specific tariff rate as notified from time to time.
The customs duty is levied based on the classification as laid down in the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 which follows the Harmonized System of Nomenclature of the World Customs Organisation (WCO), with certain localisation. The customs duty on entry of goods is levied on transaction value (i.e. price paid or payable in additions as provided under Customs Valuation Rules, which are based on GATT Valuation Code). The value basis for assessment is CIF apart from other additions that may be required as directed by Customs in terms of Customs Valuation Rules. However, related-party transactions are scrutinised closely by Indian Customs for arm’s-length nature of transaction and complete disclosure of value for the purpose of assessment of customs duty.
The customs duty comprises basic customs duty (generally levied at 7.5% or 10%) apart from other duties comprising of:
  * Social Welfare Surcharge: An additional surcharge up to 10% of the BCD is levied to fund social welfare programs.
  * IGST and Compensation Cess: Imports are subject to IGST and, if applicable, Compensation Cess under the GST regime as levied on identical goods manufactured and sold in India.
  * Health Cess: Effective from 2 February 2020, a 5% health cess is imposed on the import of medical devices to support health infrastructure.
  * Agriculture Infrastructure and Development Cess (AIDC) is an additional levy imposed on certain imported goods. It is levied at a specified rate on the assessable value of the imported goods. It is designed to fund infrastructure development in the agriculture sector.


In addition to these duties, which are dependent on classification, certain goods are subject to anti-dumping, countervailing, and safeguard duty as well. Also, depending upon the economic and trade requirement, the government can change the rate of duties on specified goods/sectors.
Exemption from these duties is extended on certain classifications and/or end use/sectoral promotion, including bilateral/multilateral trade agreements. Some of these exemptions can be conditional and require additional compliances as well. Moreover, exemptions now have a validity of two years from the date of notification.
Exemption from customs duties is also extended to promote exports, including businesses located in Free Trade Zones. However, these are linked to export commitments and other conditions/requirements.
Apart from customs duty, imports into India are subject to compliance with trade policy requirements as notified under Foreign Trade Policy. Largely, goods are freely importable; however, some goods may require pre-approval/licences and compliance with domestic regulations in terms of certifications, approvals, etc.
On the export side, while largely no customs duty is levied except on a few specified items, India, being part of the export control regime, monitors export of potential dual use goods and technology.
The cross-border transaction is done through the online portal of Indian Customs, which also has single window facilitation for other approvals. The customs duty needs to be paid electronically within 24 hours of importation and filing of import entry; otherwise, interest and penalty is payable as well. However, specific Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) status holders are eligible for duty deferment benefit, subject to conditions. Apart from this benefit, the AEO status holders are extended certain additional benefits in terms of compliances and procedural relaxations.
Moreover, while the clearances are handled by the Customs Broker, the consequences of any error or mis-declaration lie with the importer. Hence, the Customs Broker arrangement needs to be examined and reviewed periodically _vis-à-vis_ compliance status.
While Indian Customs now follows a self-declaration regime with faceless customs assessment system in operation, trade needs to ensure that declarations made at the time of import/export entry are correct and compliant with the applicable laws. Indian Customs has adopted post clearance audits where the trade is audited on these compliances as per internal guidelines or periodic checks.
As a trade facilitation measure, an Advance Ruling mechanism is available under Indian Customs for the trade to seek ruling on specific aspects prior to import, like classification, exemption/duty rates, valuation methodology, and origin compliance.
Non-compliance or evasion of duty through suppression of facts or mis-declaration can trigger investigation by the investigative arm of Indian Customs, which, depending upon the facts, can cover a five-year period and may result in notices for demand and penalties, including personal penalties. Hence, having a robust compliance and record management system is a must, as well as being updated on relevant developments.
## Property taxes
Property tax is levied by the governing authority of the jurisdiction in which the property is located. The rate of tax levied varies from city to city in India and is generally related to the prevailing market prices for property in each locality.
## Stamp duties
Stamp duty is a government tax that is levied on all legal property transactions. Stamp duty is a tax that is paid as evidence for any purchase or sale of a property between two or more parties. Stamp papers, which are bought either in the name of the buyer or seller, are valid for six months, provided the stamp duty is paid without any delay. No document that has not been duly stamped can be introduced as evidence in any court proceedings. Stamp duty is charged at both central and state levels. State level stamp duties vary from state to state, and on the document type. Stamp duty should be paid in full without any delay, failing which, a penalty is levied. Stamp duty has to be paid prior to execution (signature by an individual’s party) of a given document, the next day, or on the day of document execution. Stamp duty is paid by a buyer in most cases. However, both the seller and the buyer have to bear the burden of stamp duty for property exchange cases. Stamp duty rates differ in various states across the country, as stamp duty in India is a state subject. However, the Central Government fixes the stamp duty rates of specific instruments.
## Virtual digital assets (VDAs): Crypto taxation
Finance Act, 2022 has introduced provisions to bring VDAs (including crypto currencies, NFTs, etc) into tax ambit. The gains arising on transfer of VDAs would be taxable at 30% without providing any deduction of expenses other than cost of acquisition. Further, any loss arising on transfer of VDAs is not permitted to be set-off against any other income in the current year or subsequent years.
Tax is to be deducted at 1% payment to a resident on transfer of VDAs with effect from 1 July 2022.
## Buyback of shares
An additional tax is payable on transactions involving buyback of shares by Indian companies from its shareholders. A tax at 20% (plus surcharge at 12% and health and education cess at 4%) is payable by the company on the difference of consideration paid on buyback and the issue price of shares. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has prescribed the methodology for determination of amount received for issue of shares under 12 different situations, being a subject matter of tax on buyback. The buyback consideration received will be tax exempt in the hands of the receiver. No tax credit will be allowed in case of such taxes paid either to the company or to the shareholder.
Finance Act, 2024 has amended the provisions related to taxability of buyback of shares. As per the amended provisions, the buyback proceeds shall be considered as deemed dividend in the hands of shareholders. The cost of acquisition shall be considered as capital loss in the hands of shareholders, which can be adjusted against the capital gains, if any. The amended provisions shall be applicable with effect from 1 October 2024. 
## Securities transaction tax (STT)
STT is applicable to transactions involving the purchase/sale of equity shares, derivatives, units of equity-oriented funds through a recognised stock exchange, or the purchase/sale of a unit of an equity-oriented fund to any mutual fund. The STT leviable in respect of such transactions varies for each kind of instrument, whether delivery based or non-delivery based. Rate of STT varies from 0.001% to 0.125%, depending upon the nature of securities. However, securities transacted by any person on a recognised stock exchange located in an International Financial Services Centre where the consideration for such transaction is paid or payable in foreign currency are not subject to STT.
## Taxability of Partnership/ LLP
A partnership firm and an LLP are taxed as separate legal entities. The share of income of partners from a partnership firm or an LLP is exempt from tax. Partnerships and LLPs are taxed at 31.2% (inclusive of surcharge and health and education cess) if the income is less than INR 10 million and 34.944% (inclusive of surcharge and health and education cess) if the income exceeds INR 10 million. Alternate minimum tax at the rate of 18.5% applies to a partnership/LLP.
The interest payment to partners on capital or current account is allowed as tax-deductible expenditure. However, the maximum interest rate allowable for tax purposes is 12% _per annum_. A working partner can be paid salary, bonus, commission, or remuneration. The maximum permissible deduction in respect of remuneration payable collectively to all working partners is based on the book profit of the firm, at slab rates for different levels of book profit.
Finance Act, 2024 has introduced WHT provisions whereby if a partnership firm is making a payment (salary, remuneration, commission, bonus, or interest) to its partner over and above the prescribed threshold, that partnership firm is required to withhold taxes at the rate of 10%.
