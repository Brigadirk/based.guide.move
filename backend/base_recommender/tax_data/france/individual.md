## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 06 September 2023
## Foreign tax relief
Unless specifically excluded by a treaty, foreign-source income is taxable in France. Residents are entitled to tax credits for WHT paid on certain types of income from other tax treaty countries. Foreign-source income exempt from French tax by virtue of a tax treaty is, nevertheless, added to income taxable in France either to determine the French tax rate applicable to income taxable in France (exemption with progression) or to calculate gross French tax liability, from which tax paid abroad is deducted (tax credit system), depending on the applicable tax treaty.

France has signed two new DTTs in 2022, one with Denmark and the other one with Moldova.
However, these agreements have been signed but are not yet ratified by the parliaments of the states concerned (nor France). Therefore, these agreements have not entered into force, and their provisions are not yet applicable.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 06 September 2023
Recent significant developments impacting the taxation of individuals include the following:
## Cross-borders workers
### Luxembourg
On 7 November 2022, France and Luxembourg signed an amendment to the double taxation treaty (DTT) that increases the number of days cross-border workers are allowed to work in the home country from 29 to 34 days per year. This amendment must be submitted for ratification in both countries. In a joint press release dated 7 November 2022, the French and Luxembourg Finance Ministers stated that these new arrangements should apply from income received in 2023.
### Switzerland
From 1 January 2023, home office should be possible up to 40% of the working time per year without calling into question the state of taxation of income from salaried activity, particularly for cross-border workers.
The provisions of the amendment to the agreement are intended to apply from 1 January 2023. However, its entry into force will be conditional on its signature and ratification by both states. The text will be made public when it is signed, which is expected towards the end of the first half of 2023.
In the meantime, France and Switzerland have agreed to implement the terms and conditions of the agreement, as far as home office is concerned, by mutual agreement. This can be applied until 31 December 2024 at the latest if the amendment is signed by 30 June 2023 and taking into account the progress of the ratification process.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 06 September 2023
Individuals, whether French or foreign nationals, who have their tax domicile in France are generally subject to personal income tax (PIT) on worldwide income unless excluded by a tax treaty. Individuals who are not domiciled in France (non-residents) are subject to tax only on their income arising in France or, in certain cases, on imputed income.
## Personal income tax rates
Each category of income is combined and, after deduction of allowances, is taxed at progressive rates. Total income is split according to family status (i.e. 'the more children you have, the less tax you pay’). Under income-splitting rules, total taxable income is divided by the number of shares awarded to the taxpayer: one share for a single person, two shares for a married taxpayer without children, half a share for each of the first two dependent children, and one full share for the third and each subsequent child. Thus, the income of a married taxpayer with three children is split into four.
However, the tax saved from income splitting is limited depending on the net taxable income of the tax household. Figures vary for married taxpayers and for single and divorced taxpayers with dependent children.
Rates are progressive from 0% to 45%, plus a surtax of 3% on the portion of income that exceeds 250,000 euros (EUR) for a single person and EUR 500,000 for a married couple and of 4% for income that exceeds EUR 500,000 for a single person and EUR 1 million for a married couple.
Progressive tax rates - 2021 * | PIT  
---|---  
Total compensation | Employee social contributions | Net taxable compensation | Single | Married | Married + 1 child (c) | Married + 2c

* Note that social contribution rates are the average rates applicable to 2022 remuneration. PIT rates are those applicable to 2021 annual income.
## Social surcharges
Social surcharges are applicable to various kinds of income. The total social surcharges on employment income, rental income, interest, dividends, and capital gains for 2022 are shown below.
Type of income | Social surcharge (%)  
---|---  
_Contribution Sociale Généralisée_ (CSG) | _Contribution au Remboursement de la Dette Sociale_ (CRDS) | Other levies  
Employment income | 9.2 | 0.5 | -  
Rental income | 9.2 | 0.5 | 7.5  
Dividends | 9.2 | 0.5 | 7.5  
Interest | 9.2 | 0.5 | 7.5  
Capital gains | 9.2 | 0.5 | 7.5  
The persons affiliated to a compulsory social security scheme, other than French, within a country of the European Economic Area (EEA) (European Union, Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein) or Switzerland are exempt from CSG and CRDS on their investment income. However, these revenues remain subject to a solidarity levy at a rate of 7.5%.
## Inbound assignee regime (Article 155 B of the French tax code)
The inbound assignee regime applies to employees assigned to France by their foreign employer or to employees directly recruited abroad by a French company as of 1 January 2008. In both cases, the individuals must not have been French tax resident during five calendar years preceding the year of beginning of their functions in France. In addition, the individuals need to fulfil specific residence/domicile conditions.
Under this regime, individuals assigned to France by their foreign employer can benefit from a French income tax exemption in relation to salary supplements connected with their transfer.
For employees directly recruited abroad, and for employees transferred to France by their foreign employer who have taken up their position as of 16 November 2018, the regime offers the following options:
  * exemption of the actual amount of salary supplements received, or
  * a flat rate exemption of 30% of the total remuneration.


The regime still provides for a 'floor' of reportable compensation (i.e. the taxable compensation cannot be lower than the taxable remuneration paid for a similar job in the same or a similar company established in France).
It also provides for an exemption for the part of the remuneration related to foreign workdays. However, the total exemption (i.e. on salary supplements, actual or not, and foreign workdays) is limited to 50% of the total remuneration. Alternatively, the individual can elect for an exemption of French tax on the actual salary supplements and the remuneration related to foreign workdays, limited to 20% of the taxable remuneration.
The availability of this inbound regime is limited to eight years from the year of arrival (five years for taxpayers who have taken up a position in France before 6 July 2016). The employee will be able to keep the benefit of the inbound regime even in case of mobility with the company or intra group (but still within the eight or five maximum years).
This legislation cannot be combined with the regime available to French outbounds.Since this tax regime is complex, we would recommend that you seek professional advice before claiming the benefits of this provision on your French income tax return.
## 'Headquarters' tax regime
Certain expatriates who cannot benefit from the above 'inbound regimes' (or for whom a claim under these provisions may not be beneficial) may be able to claim a full exemption in respect to certain 'expatriate' allowances, providing they do not stay in France more than six years as salaried employees and providing they were not regarded as French tax residents in the year preceding their transfer to France. In particular, the reimbursement by the employer of tuition fees for dependent children enrolled in either primary or secondary school may be tax exempt.
## Local income taxes
There are no local taxes on personal income in France. However, there are local taxes on housing for individuals occupying or renting housing in France on 1 January of the tax year (_see Property taxes in the section for more information_).

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 06 September 2023
## Taxable period
The French tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December.
## Tax returns
Husbands and wives or partners of a PACS must file joint returns (except the year of marriage/the year the PACS is signed, where spouses/partners can opt to file separate tax returns for the whole year). Otherwise, separate filing status is not permitted, except under strictly limited circumstances.
French resident tax returns are based on calendar-year income and must be filed, in principle, by mid-May of the following year (the exact filing deadline is confirmed each year by the French tax authorities). 
## E-filing
The taxpayers whose main home is equipped with access to the Internet should file their tax return online on the government website.
A fixed EUR 15 fine by tax return will be applied after two breaches, except in particular cases (e.g. the elderly who have no access to the Internet).
## Payment of tax
As of 1 January 2019, for French resident taxpayers, a WHT system has been implemented. The scope of income subject to the WHT system is very wide and covers most categories of income: employment income, pensions, replacement income, annuities, self-employment income (industrial and commercial, non-commercial, agricultural), and rental income.
Incomes derived from an activity carried out in France on behalf of a foreign employer in principle constitute French-source incomes that are taxable in France, even if the activity is carried out on an occasional basis or in teleworking. The foreign employer is therefore in principle liable for the WHT. 
As of 1 January 2023, if the employee is not covered by a compulsory French social security scheme, pursuant to Article 13 of Regulation (EC) 883/2004 of 29 April 2004, it is possible under certain conditions for the employer to be exempted from collecting the WHT, although the employer will still be required to declare the employee's taxable income in France annually.
For taxpayers who have already filed a French tax return, the French tax authorities calculate the applicable WHT rate to be applied on employment income or the amount of monthly instalments to be paid by taxpayers based on the last tax return submitted by the taxpayers. The WHT rate or the instalment amount is revised each year in September after the filing of the annual tax return. The tax rate applied is an average tax rate calculated for the household. It is possible to request the application of an individualised tax rate for each spouse. It is also possible to request a modulation of the applicable WHT rate in case of change of personal situation or income.
When a tax rate is not available (e.g. for taxpayers who have never filed a French tax return), employers apply a neutral tax rate on compensation, depending on the level of income. It is possible to request a personalised WHT rate by filing a form (2043 Form).
Considering the risk of potential penalty, specific advice from a tax advisor is required to request or adjust the applicable WHT rate.
The filing of an annual tax return is still required. However, since 2020, the declaration is simplified for certain taxpayers. The automatic declaration is a new declarative mode allowing certain tax households to benefit from automatic validation of their tax returns, without any action on their part, as long as the information pre-filled and known to the tax authorities is accurate and exhaustive for the calculation of income tax. For the tax households concerned, the absence of filing will now be considered as a declaration. To be eligible, households must meet the following two conditions:
  * They should have been taxed the previous year only on income pre-filled by the tax authorities.
  * They should not have reported any changes in status (address, marital status, or creation of a withholding tax account) the previous year.


If the final tax liability per the annual tax return is higher than the withholding, the taxpayer is required to pay the balance to the authorities, in principle spread from September to December. If the tax withheld is more than the computed tax on the tax return, the French authorities will refund the difference. 
For non-resident taxpayers deriving income from employment and professional activities exercised in France, a WHT mechanism is applied; tax at flat rates of 0%, 12%, and 20% is withheld at source for employment compensation. An annual income tax return is required if the income subject to WHT falls into the 20% WHT bracket and additional tax may be due.
In addition, there is a tax withholding obligation on French-source stock options (granted from 20 June 2007) and free share award gains realised as of 1 April 2011 by non-resident taxpayers of France.
Other French-source income may also be subject to WHTs and annual reporting.
## Tax audit process
The French Tax Administration can verify the accuracy and correctness of the tax return and can provide a control on the document provided. The French Tax Administration analyses the consistency between declared income, the financial situation, and the household's lifestyle.
When disbursements exceed receipts, the difference is considered hidden income unless the taxpayer responds satisfactorily to a request for clarification or justification.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations in France is, in general, for three years (period called _délai de reprise_). It has been extended for one year for the year 2018 ('tax holiday year').

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 06 September 2023
## Employment expenses
Salaries and other related benefits are taxed after deducting an employee's mandatory social security contributions, except CRDS and part of CSG, and after a standard allowance for professional expenses equal to 10% of taxable employment income (limited to EUR 13,522 on 2022 remuneration). An employee may elect to deduct actual professional expenses incurred instead of the 10% standard deduction; however, in this case, all expenses reimbursed by the employer must be added back to the taxable salary.
Qualifying professional expenses include certain commuting expenses, meals taken while away from home, and professional documentation. Professional advice should be sought before any option is elected to deduct actual expenses since various conditions must be met to ensure deductibility.
Contributions made to foreign social security systems are also deductible for French PIT purposes for taxpayers qualifying under the provisions applicable to inbounds in France as well as for individuals who are seconded under EU regulation no. 8832004 or a social security agreement signed by France.
In addition, deduction of contributions made to foreign complementary health/disability/death and pension funds are allowed for taxpayers qualifying as inbounds under the law applicable to inbounds.
Nevertheless, these funds must comply with specific conditions in order to be tax deductible. We recommend contacting our specialists to determine whether the foreign plan contribution qualifies for tax deductibility.
Also, in accordance with the regime for inbounds (Article 155B of the French Tax Code), the compulsory registration with the French social security system for those who work in France does not apply to the old-age state pension schemes, provided that certain conditions are fulfilled. The exemption is granted once per assignee and is for a limited period of three years, with a possible extension of three years.
## Personal deductions
Taxpayers may be entitled to one or more of the tax credits or general deductions shown below:
  * Limited tax credits are available for certain expenses with respect to principal residences, expenses for sustainable development, charitable contributions, domestic employees, students, and child care (s _ee the section_).
  * General deductions are available for child support and alimony payments.


### Alimony and child support
Payments of alimony to an ex-spouse, and of child support to children under 18, made according to the provisions of a court settlement, qualify as fully deductible expenses.
Support payments made to parents, grandparents, children over 18, or married children may qualify as a deductible expense (with a cap for children), provided that the beneficiaries are in need and that the need can be demonstrated.
## Personal allowances
Total taxable income is divided into the number of shares (‘parts’) that reflects the taxpayer's marital status and the number of dependants. Children under 18 years of age and disabled children of all ages can be claimed as dependants.
Children from the ages of 18 to 21, as well as children from the ages of 21 to 25 who are full-time students, can, upon request, be claimed as dependants.
The tax benefit per additional half-share for dependent children is limited to EUR 1,678 (limit) for each of the first two children and EUR 3,356 for each additional child.

## Work permits/work visas
If an assignee is a non-EEA national, one cannot perform a salaried activity or professional mission in France without an authorisation.
The appropriate authorisation will depend on the job position, level of salary, seniority within the group, reporting line, management functions, etc.
The immigration reforms of 7 March 2016 and 2 November 2016 instituted a short-term authorisation exemption, valid for stays of up to 90 days, consecutive or not, over a period of 180 days, from work authorisations for persons performing audit work or providing expertise in one of a number of areas, including architecture, computer sciences, engineering, insurance, management, and finance. This exemption is valid for both intra-group secondments and service-provider activity, and thus does not apply to work that would be considered as salaried activity for the host entity.
In 2007, the French legislature created a new category of work authorisation designed to facilitate temporary intra-group transfers of assignees, a category of authorisation named _salarié en mission_ valid for stay of more than 90 days, consecutive or not. Since the reform of 7 March 2016 and 2 November 2016, the _salarié en mission détaché_ (home employment contract only) category is now called _salarié détaché_(intra-corporate transfer or ICT), and the _salarié en mission salarié_ (simultaneous home and host contract) category is now called _passeport talent salarié en mission_.
To qualify for this type of work authorisation, the assignee must:
  * receive an amount of the salary indicated in the collective bargaining agreement for the ICT intra-group posted workers and EUR 2,886 for intra-group salaried workers
  * have at least three months of seniority within the group for salaried workers and six months for ICT intra-group posted workers
  * be performing a function for one's home employer within a French entity of the same group for a period of no less than three months and no longer than three years for ICT intra-group posted workers, and 
  * have either a certificate of coverage for social security purposes or an attestation that French social security affiliation will be requested in the visa application file.


The advantage is that these categories of admission above do not require establishing proof that no qualified candidate is available locally and also grant the candidate’s spouse the right to work in France when the stay in France is for more than six months.
It is also possible for a French employer to hire an individual who has no pre-existing employment relationship with another company of the same group in a salaried employee capacity. This latter category of work authorisation results in the assignee having salaried employment status under an employment contract with the French host entity. It should be noted that a request of this type of authorisation may be refused by the French labour authorities as the future employer should check the employment market to ascertain whether a local person could occupy the job that one proposes to one's candidate except if the position is shortlisted (the list is set by the Arrêté of 1 April 2021).
There are several other types of authorisations, notably those for corporate officers and highly skilled individuals (now called the Talent Passport – European Blue Card), and several smaller categories for specific professions.
‘Work’ in France will trigger French social security liability, unless a treaty exemption applies, and the application of French labour law to a degree that will depend on the structure of the work.
If the assignee is an EEA or a Swiss national, they are exempt from a French work permit as well as from a residence permit (_see below_).
## Residence permits
A residence permit or a procedure of registration of stay is also required for non-EEA nationals who plan to stay in France for more than three months. This residence permit is issued by the police authorities depending on the home address of the applicant for one or several years depending on the immigration status of the assignee. An online platform is now available for most categories of residence permits.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 06 September 2023
## Employment income
Unless expressly excluded by a tax treaty as subject to tax in another country or by domestic law, employment income earned in France and abroad by a resident is subject to French income tax, regardless of where payment is made and whether it is remitted.
Employment income is widely defined and includes all employment benefits provided by the employer whether in cash or in kind. Social security and pension contributions made to French and qualified foreign plans are tax deductible. Business expense reimbursements are not taxable.
Benefits-in-kind are, as a general rule, included in income at market value. The following are exceptions:
  * Reimbursements of travel costs incurred by an employee exclusively for business purposes and furniture removal expenses are generally both fully non-taxable.
  * A cash lump sum provided by an employer to compensate the employee for housing costs is assessed in full for income tax purposes, although housing (rented or owned by the employer) provided to the employee is subject to special rules. In this case, the taxable benefit is assessed, not at the actual cost of the rent, but at the fixed rates provided by the French social administration (depending on the level of remuneration as well as the number of rooms) or, upon election by the employer, at the rental value used by the tax authorities to levy local taxes. In order to qualify, the expatriate must not be a managing director/corporate officer of the company owning or renting the dwelling.
  * Impatriate allowance may be fully exempt from PIT according to the special inbound tax regime (_see the section_).


Non-residents liable to PIT on employment income are subject to withholding tax (WHT). After deducting mandatory employee social security contributions and the standard 10% salary deduction, employment income is subject to WHT at source by the employer at the rates of 0%, 12%, and 20%. The 12% WHT is a final non-refundable tax. Non-residents are, nevertheless, liable to PIT (resident rates) on the portion of remuneration subject to the 20% band. For non-residents, the minimum rate of tax applicable to net annual income up to a limit of EUR 27,478 (for 2022) is 20% and 30% for the fraction above this limit (limit for income from France mainland). Therefore, the annual tax may be higher than the 20% WHT; in such a case, the 20% WHT levied by the employer is offset, but an additional income tax is due by the employee. If the annual tax is lower, the total WHT tax is the final tax liability of the employee. Under certain conditions and in limited cases, refunds of WHT can be claimed.
## Equity compensation
There is a specific tax regime in France applicable to stock options and free shares gains that depends notably on the date of grant of the stock options or of the free shares and on whether or not the plan is ’qualified’ (under provision of the French Commercial Code).
For 'non-qualified' plans, the acquisition gain is taxed the year the options are exercised (for stock options) or the shares are vested (or put at the employee's disposal if different from the vesting date) for free shares. The acquisition gain is taxable according to progressive tax rates.
For 'qualfied' plans, the taxation of the acquisition gain occurs the year of the sale of the shares. Depending on the date of the grant of the stock options or free shares, the relative acquisition gain may be taxed according to progressive tax rates or flat tax rates. In addition, the acquisition gain is subject to social surtaxes, and may be subject to social tax.
The capital gain, if any, is taxed at the flat tax rate of 30%. _See Capital gains tax in the section for more information._
Both the acquisition gain and capital gain may be subject to the exceptional surtax on high income (CEHR), if applicable.
Considering the complexity of taxation of the stock options and free shares gain in France, specific advice from a tax advisor is required.
## Business income
Profits or gains derived from trades, professions, or vocations carried out in France are subject to tax regardless of whether the individual is resident of France. If the individual is resident in France, a liability may also arise on profits or gains on activities carried out abroad unless tax treaties provided otherwise.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are generally subject to the flat tax rate. _See Capital gains tax in the section for more information_.
## Dividend income
Generally, a French resident is liable to French income tax on investment income, whether from French or foreign sources. Dividend income is subject to a flat rate tax (PFU, sometimes referred to as the 'flat tax') set at 30%, including income tax at 12.8% and social surtaxes at 17.2%.
Upon receipt of the dividends, French tax residents are subject to a compulsory WHT as a type of instalment payment against the final tax (self-assessment/return to be prepared in certain situation).
Taxpayers may opt to tax all of the income subject to the PFU at the progressive income tax rates if more beneficial. In this case, the 40% reduction previously applicable to dividends remains applicable. It should be noted that this option is applicable to all of the income subject to the PFU without a possibility of a partial option.
The CEHR applicable to a fraction of fiscal reference income at the 3% and 4% rates remains applicable in addition to the 30% PFU.
## Interest income
Generally, a French resident is liable to French income tax on interest income, whether from French or foreign sources. Taxable interests are subject to a flat rate tax (PFU, sometimes referred to as the 'flat tax') set at 30%, including income tax at 12.8% and social surtaxes at 17.2%.
Upon receipt of the interests, French tax residents are subject to a compulsory WHT as a type of instalment payment against the final tax (self-assessment/return to be prepared in certain situation).
Taxpayers may opt to tax all of the income subject to the PFU at the progressive income tax rates if more beneficial. It should be noted that this option is applicable to all of the income subject to the PFU without a possibility of a partial option.
The CEHR applicable to a fraction of fiscal reference income at the 3% and 4% rates remains applicable in addition to the 30% PFU.
## Rental income
Rental income (for unfurnished properties) is taxed as ordinary income after deducting actual expenses borne by the landlord, such as mortgage loan interest, management expenses, repairs, property taxes, and insurance expenses. However, no actual depreciation cost will be taken into account (except for specific investments).
Nevertheless, when the tax household receives annual rental income (not relating to specific type of investments) lower than EUR 15,000, the gross income may be directly reported on the tax return and is taxed after deduction of a fixed allowance of 30% corresponding to expenses.
Alternatively, the tax household may opt for the determination of net rental income taking into account the actual expenses paid (instead of the 30% flat rate deduction). This election is made through the filing of the annual PIT return and cannot be revoked for a three-year period.
Rental losses (generally due to repairs), with the exception of interest on loans, are creditable against other income up to a limit of EUR 10,700 per year. Depending on the nature of the property, rental losses exceeding this limit are creditable against rental income only and can be carried forward for ten years following the year in which the loss is incurred.
## Inbound assignee regime (Article 155 B)
Inbound assignees who actually benefit from the inbound regime can exempt 50% of the amount of the following income, under certain conditions, that mainly relates to the geographic situation of the paying entity:
  * Foreign-source interest and dividends.
  * Foreign-source royalties.
  * Foreign-source capital gains.
  * Foreign-source industrial and intellectual property (IP) gains.

## Personal tax credits
### Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions (including amounts expressly renounced) made to qualified philanthropic, educational, scientific, social, religious, political, or cultural organisations, non-profit making organisations recognised as being of public benefit (_d'utilité publique_), associations authorised to assist with the creation of companies, companies in difficulty, or companies with fewer than 50 employees, as well as to trade unions, can be claimed as a tax reduction of up to 66% of actual contributions.
Limitations on the tax reduction are applicable, based on the net taxable income of the tax household.
In addition, contributions to associations providing free food to people in need also qualify for a tax credit of 75% for contributions up to EUR 1,000 (for 2021 and 2022 income).
Note that specific and temporary limitations may be applicable to charitable contributions made to organisations (applicable regime to be checked depending on the charitable contributions made). 
### Child care expenses
Taxpayers (whether single, married, divorced, or widowed) who carry out an employed or self-employed activity are entitled to a tax credit of up to 50% of childcare expenses incurred for each dependent child under six (age to be considered on the 1st of January of the year of taxation) up to a ceiling of expenses of EUR 3,500 per year per child.
### Schooling expenses
A tax reduction for schooling expenses is granted to taxpayers whose dependent children study in secondary schools, 'C _ollège_ ' (EUR 61), '_Lycée_ ' (EUR 153), and university (EUR 183).
### Domestic help expenses
A taxpayer who employs housekeeping help can benefit from a tax credit of 50% of the expenses incurred, up to the limit of EUR 12,000 per year (i.e. a maximum tax credit of EUR 6,000) or of EUR 15,000 for the first year of employment, increased by EUR 1,500 per dependent child and dependants over 65 years old, but limited to EUR 15,000 (or EUR 18,000 for the first year of employment). There are specific provisions for invalid taxpayers.
### Tax credit on expenses for energy transition
Taxpayers who incur certain major equipment expenses (notably boiler equipment, power generation using renewable energy, heating equipment, storm water treatment, insulating roller shutters) on their principal residence in France may benefit from a tax credit under certain conditions and depending on the type of expenses.
Attention should be paid to the type of expenses incurred as certain conditions must be fulfilled to qualify for a tax credit.
## Global limit of tax credits
The reduction of PIT due to tax deductions/credits is globally limited (except in specific cases). The global tax reduction is limited to EUR 10,000 per year (plus EUR 8,000 for investments in SOFICA and DOM-TOM).

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 06 September 2023
Under domestic law, an individual is considered to be domiciled in France if at least one of the following criteria below is met:
  * The habitual abode of the person or family is in France or France is the principal place of sojourn.
  * Professional activities are carried out in France. Note that managing executives of a company having its registered office in France and whose turnover exceeds EUR 250 million are considered as exercising their professional activity mainly in France unless they prove otherwise.
  * France is the centre of economic interests.


Under most bilateral tax treaties concluded with France, tax domicile is first determined under the law of the country that asserts the power to tax. If the individual is considered to be resident under the laws of two countries, the treaty provides 'tie-breaker' provisions to determine the country of residence. These tie-breaker tests generally include as criteria, in descending order, permanent home, personal and economic relations (centre of vital interests), habitual abode, nationality, and, if none of the foregoing tests is determinative, the decision of the competent authorities.

## French social security contributions
The French social security system is composed of various schemes providing a wide range of benefits. This system includes social security basic coverage (sickness, maternity, disability, death, work-related accident benefits, and old age state pension), unemployment benefits, compulsory complementary retirement plans, complementary death/disability coverage, and complementary health coverage.
The contributions are shared between employer and employee; on average the employer's share of contributions represents 45% of the gross salary. For 2022, the employee’s share of French social contributions represents approximately 20% to 23% of the remuneration. However, since the contributions are assessed using various ceilings, the average rate will decrease as the gross salary increases.
Employers' contributions made to additional medical coverage schemes (which are mandatory and collective) are taxable.
Generally, for any employee who carries out a salaried activity in France, the employer withholds the employer's share and pays the employer's share of French social security charges. However, France has entered into agreements with more than 40 countries whereby expatriates temporarily transferred to France may remain under the home country social security schemes and are exempt from French charges (scope of the exemption according to the applicable provision of the bilateral agreement), provided they hold a valid certificate of coverage.
## Capital gains tax
### Capital gains tax on securities
Capital gains derived from the sale of securities are subject to PIT at a flat tax rate (PFU) of 30% (12.8% for income tax, plus social levies at a rate of 17.2%), and, if applicable, to the exceptional income tax for high earners at a maximum marginal tax rate of 4%.
Taxpayers with low income may have interest to opt to tax the capital gains at the progressive income tax rates.
If they opt for a taxation at the progressive income tax rates, they can benefit from a rebate for length of holding, but only for shares acquired or subscribed before 1 January 2018.
This rebate for length of holding is as follows:
  * 50% for holding between two and eight years.
  * 65% after eight years of holding.


A specific regime applies to capital gains derived from sales of shares in small and medium companies (PMEs) created less than ten years ago and to capital gains currently taxed under a preferential regime (notably regimes applicable to young innovative companies' securities), assuming that the shares were acquired before 1 January 2018 and that the taxpayer chose to opt for the taxation at the progressive income tax rates. It consists of a rebate for length of holdingon the net gain, as follows:
  * 50% for holding between one and four years.
  * 65% for holding between four and eight years.
  * 85% after eight years of holding.


On top of this increased rebate, a preliminary fixed tax allowance of EUR 500,000 applies for PME executives upon retirement. This is applicable for the sales until 31 December 2024.
The above rebates only apply to income tax and not to social surtaxes, which remain due at the rate of 17.2%.
The PFU also applies to capital gains due upon transfer of tax residency outside of France (i.e. exit tax).
Capital gains on the sale of securities of certain real estate companies or real estate funds may be subject to the rules on capital gains on real estate. For these securities, it is necessary to check beforehand which regime is applicable to them.
### Capital gains tax on real estate properties
Various regimes apply to the capital gain tax on real estates. It is therefore highly recommended to refer to a real estate tax specialist to confirm the applicable tax treatment.
Capital gain derived from the sale of a principal residence is tax-free.
A similar tax exemption is possible for individuals who have transferred their tax residency outside of France in a member country of the European Union (EU) or in a country or territory that has concluded with France a treaty on administrative assistance to combat tax evasion and tax fraud as well as a treaty on mutual recovery assistance for income tax (similar in scope to that laid down by Directive 2010/24/ EU of Council dated 16 March 2010). The country should not be considered as a 'non-cooperative' country. Taxpayers can benefit from the tax exemption of the capital gain derived from the sale of their former principal residence if:
  * their former principal residence is sold before 31 December of the year following the year of the transfer, and
  * the former principal residence has not been rented to or occupied by a third person between the date of the transfer out of France and the date of the sale.


This tax exemption is applicable for sales that have occurred since 1 January 2019.
Capital gain derived from the sale of another property (for instance, secondary residence) is tax-free if the sales price is less than EUR 15,000.
Capital gains derived from the first sale of a secondary residence are tax-free if the vendor did not own one's principal residence during the four years preceding the sale and if the sale price is reinvested for the purchase of one's principal residence.
In addition, the capital gain relating to the sale of a property in France by a non-French tax resident may be tax exempt, providing that:
  * the sale occurs before 31 December of the tenth year following the departure from France, or
  * without condition of time if the residence has not been rented to or occupied by a third person since 1 January of the year preceding the sale of the residence.


The individual must have been considered as a French tax resident for at least two years at any time preceding the year of sale.
The exemption is limited to one property per tax household and to EUR 150,000 of net capital gain.
The exemption would also be extended to nationals of non-EU countries that have included a non-discrimination clause in their tax treaty signed with France.
For taxable real estate capital gains, a tax rebate for the holding period is applicable. Regarding real estate held for more than five years, a rebate is applied on the taxable basis as follows:
  * 6% for each year of holding after the fifth year.
  * 4% for the 22nd year of holding.


This leads to a full income tax exemption of capital gains after a holding period of 22 years.
Regarding social surtaxes (if applicable), the full exemption is obtained only after a holding period of 30 years, the rebate being as follows:
  * 1.65% for each year of holding after the fifth year.
  * 1.60% for the 22nd year.
  * 9% for the years after the 22nd year.


This leads to a full income tax and social surtaxes exemption of capital gains after a holding period of 30 years.
The net gain is taxed at a flat rate of 19% (i.e. a total of 36.2%, including special social surtaxes of 17.2%).
An additional tax is applicable on real estate capital gains exceeding EUR 50,000 and realised on real estate other than building lots. This tax is progressive from 2% to 6% and is applied in addition to income tax and social levies.
The declaration of this capital gain, as well as the payment of the related PIT, is made directly through the notary. However, it must be reported on the annual tax return to determine the ’reference income’ and therefore the potential application of the special surtax on high income of 3% and 4%.
Note that an additional specific tax rebate is applicable to the sale of construction lands (_terrain à bâtir_) for income and additional surtaxes purposes, under certain conditions.
## Exit tax
Individuals who transfer their tax domicile outside of France (and who had their tax domicile in France for six years during the ten years before they break their tax domicile in France) are taxed on the unrealised capital gains on shares and rights held directly by tax household members when these rights either:
  * exceed 50% of the shareholding or
  * represent a total value exceeding EUR 800,000.


These capital gains or value of receivables will be subject to the PIT at a flat tax rate of 12.8% and social surtaxes of 17.2%. Taxpayers may opt to tax the capital gains at the progressive income tax rates (_please refer to the description of Capital gain tax above_).
Individuals who have transferred their tax residency outside of France in a member country of the European Union or in a country or territory that has concluded with France a tax treaty covering administrative assistance to combat tax evasion and tax fraud as well as a tax treaty on mutual recovery assistance for income tax (excluding 'non-cooperative' countries) are benefiting from an automatic payment deferral. In such a case, the payment of tax will be deferred up to the date of disposal of the securities or rights.
If the individual finally comes back to France, or after the expiry of the specified time period, the gain or rights will benefit from an automatic cancellation/reimbursement of tax, provided that certain filing conditions are fulfilled.
Four tax relief periods may apply depending on the date of transfer of the domicile outside France:
  * 8 years for a transfer from 11 March 2011 to 2013.
  * 15 years for a transfer from 2014 to 2018.
  * 2 years from 2019 if the total value of the shares is less than EUR 2.57 million.
  * 5 years from 2019 if the total value of the shares is more than EUR 2.57 million.


## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is assessed on goods sold and services rendered in France. The normal VAT rate is 20%. Catering and transports of persons are taxable at a 10% reduced rate. Sales of certain kinds of medicines and sales of books are taxable at a 5.5% reduced rate. Food products, subscription to gas and electricity (under certain circumstances), and products and services provided to disabled persons are taxable at a 5.5% rate. Medicines reimbursed by French social security are taxable at a particular rate of 2.1%. Exports and certain specific services invoiced to non-French residents are zero-rated.
## Tax on real estate properties (IFI)
Individuals who qualify as tax residents of France on 1 January of a given year are liable to tax on their worldwide real estate properties, unless otherwise provided by a tax treaty.
Non-residents of France are only liable to the tax on their real estate properties located in France.
Only non-professional real estate properties are taxable.
IFI is only due if net taxable wealth exceeds EUR 1.3 million (2023 tax year) on 1 January of that year.
Rates are progressive from 0.50%, after an allowance of EUR 800,000 to 1.5% for net wealth in excess of EUR 10 million.
The IFI return has to be submitted by the same deadline as the income tax return (normally by mid-May of the relevant year). The corresponding tax has to be paid upon receipt of the IFI bill (in most of the cases on 15 September of the relevant year).
Citizens of certain countries, such as Sweden, Germany, and the United States, are fully exempt from wealth tax on non-French assets for the first five years of residence in France.
If an individual arrived in France after 6 August 2008 and was regarded as a non-French tax resident for the five years preceding arrival in France, the individual’s real estate properties situated outside of France are exempt from French wealth tax until 31 December of the fifth year following the year of arrival in France.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
French inheritance or gift tax may be due by beneficiaries of gifts or inheritance. If the deceased or the donor is a tax resident of France, tax will be due in France on worldwide assets transmitted. If the deceased or donor is not a tax resident of France, tax will be due on worldwide assets transmitted to the donee if the donee has been a tax resident of France for at least six out of the last ten years.
Regardless of whether the donor or donee is a tax resident of France, tax will be due on all personal and real property located in France. However, it is to be noted that tax treaties addressing the inheritance and/or gift tax may modify the above tax results.
Inheritance tax is levied on assets at their fair market value, with allowances taking into account the relationship between the deceased and the beneficiary. Debts existing at the time of death are deductible in full. Inheritance tax is levied according to tax schedules that vary depending on the family relationship between the beneficiaries and the donor or deceased.
No inheritance tax is due for inheritancebetween spouses (or partner of a _Pacte civil de solidarité_[PACS]) and for inheritance between brothers and sisters living together under specific conditions.
Progressive tax rates are applicable after a rebate of EUR 100,000 when beneficiaries are direct dependants.
Between non-related parties, the rate is 60% after an allowance of EUR 1,594 granted to each beneficiary. This allowance is not applicable in case of gifts.
Gift tax is subject to the same standard rules. However, there are some differences. Debts in relation to the property transferred are not deductible, and this is not considered to be a taxable benefit if the donor pays the gift tax personally.
## Property taxes
### Property tax on developed property
As owner, usufructuary, or trustee of a building, it is necessary to pay the property tax on developed property each year. This tax is established for the year according to the situation on 1 January of the tax year. If the taxpayer is an owner on 1 January, that individual has to pay the property tax even if the property is sold later.
### Housing tax
Housing tax is established annually according to the taxpayer’s situation on 1 January of the tax year. This tax is collected by the municipality where the taxpayer’s home is located and is calculated on the net rental value.
The Finance Act Bill for the year 2018 has provided a gradual decrease in the housing tax applicable to a principal residence, to be applied over a three-year period starting with the 2018 tax year. 80% of all households have been exempted from the payment of this tax in 2020. For the remaining 20% of households, the decrease was 30% in 2021 and 65% in 2022.
The housing tax on primary residences is abolished on 1 January 2023; however, the housing tax is still due for secondary residences.
