## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 18 March 2024
## Tax consolidation regime
The Finance Act for 2024 extends the benefits of the tax consolidation regime (i.e. the exemption up to 99% of French corporate income tax [CIT]) to dividends received by French companies that have, deliberately, not elected for the tax consolidation regime. Such exemption applies to dividends distributed by foreign companies established within the European Union (EU) (or the European Economic Area [EEA] under certain conditions) to French companies, provided that shareholding conditions are met.
However, for financial years ending on or after 31 December 2023, the Finance Act for 2024 reintroduces a minimum period after which such dividend distributions are eligible for this exemption.
## Reinforcement of transfer pricing controls
In order to strengthen the administration's ability to detect and punish the abusive use of transfer pricing rules, the Finance Act for 2024: 
  * reduces the threshold for triggering the transfer pricing documentation requirement from 400 million to 150 million euros (EUR) for financial years starting from 1 January 2024, and
  * increases to EUR 50,000 the minimum fine for failure to provide transfer pricing documentation for offences committed from 1 January 2024.


## Hard-to-value intangibles
To enable tax authorities to fully apply Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) principles to control the price of intangible asset disposals, the Finance Act for 2024 introduces the possibility for the French tax authorities, for financial years starting from 1 January 2024, to adjust the value of a transferred hard-to-value intangible asset or right on the basis of results subsequent to the financial year in which the transaction took place. 
## Public Country-by-Country (CbC) Reporting
On 21 June 2023, France transposed the EU Public CbC Reporting Directive. The measure requires both EU-based multinational enterprises (MNEs) and non-EU based MNEs doing business in the European Union through a branch or subsidiary with total consolidated revenue of more than EUR 750 million in each of the last two consecutive financial years to report publicly the income taxes paid and other tax-related information, such as a breakdown of profits, revenues, and employees.
## Reduction of French production taxes 
In order to improve competitiveness, the territorial economic contribution (CET) started to decrease over previous years.
The 2021 Finance Bill also provided for a reduction of the rental value of industrial facilities (notably used to calculate the land contribution [CFE]) by half, pursuant to a defined accounting method. The reduction is applicable to the tax due as of 2021.
The Finance Bill for 2023 provided for the repeal of the business value-added contribution (so-called ’CVAE‘, one of the components of the CET) over a two-year period and its abolition in 2024. The Finance Act for 2024 postpones the abolition of the CVAE to 2027. 
In parallel with the abolition of the CVAE, the rate of the cap on CET according to value added, currently set at 2%, will be decreased as depicted in the table below: 
2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 | 2026  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
CET cap  | 2% | 2% | 1.625% | 1.531% | 1.438% | 1.344%  
## New 'green industry tax credit' ('_crédit d'impôt pour l'industrie verte_ ' or C3IV)
The 2024 Finance Bill introduced a tax credit for green industry equal to 20% (or 25% to 40% depending on the geographic area of investment) of the amount of eligible expenses incurred. The tax credit could amount to a maximum of EUR 150 million per company (or EUR 200 million to EUR 350 million in the case of investments in specific areas). 
Eligible investment expenditures are incurred in connection with activities contributing to the production of batteries, solar panels, wind turbines, and heat pumps. 
This tax credit would apply to applications filed as of 27 September 2023 and would apply to accredited investments until 31 December 2025. 
## Tax regime for reinsurance captive companies
The Finance Bill for 2023 creates a specific tax regime for certain captive reinsurance, defined as an undertaking owned either by a financial undertaking (with certain exceptions) or by a non-financial undertaking, the object of which is the provision of reinsurance cover relating exclusively to the risks of the undertaking or undertakings to which it belongs, or to the risks of one or more other undertakings in the group of which it forms part. The purpose of this provision is to facilitate the creation of captive reinsurance companies in France by offering them a favourable tax regime in order to promote a better insurance offer, by allowing them to negotiate with third-party insurers (‘fronters‘) insurance coverage more adapted to their needs.
This new tax regime provides that captive reinsurance undertakings held by an undertaking other than a financial undertaking and whose object is the provision of reinsurance cover relating exclusively to the risks of undertakings other than financial undertakings may constitute, tax-free, a provision to cover expenses relating to accepted reinsurance operations whose insurance risks fall within the categories of damage to professional and agricultural property, natural disasters, general civil liability, pecuniary losses, and pecuniary damage and losses resulting from damage to information and communication systems and transport. 
These provisions entered into force on 1 January 2023.
## Possibility to offset convention tax credits on French taxation (upon capital gains and dividends): Key decisions
The French administrative jurisdictions have ruled that the French 5% taxation of dividends at the level of the beneficiary under the participation exemption regime (i.e. EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive) and the French 12% taxation of long-term capital gains (i.e. shares representing securities that qualify as ’titres de participations‘) constitute an effective taxation against which foreign tax credits may be offset (Administrative Supreme Court, 15 November 2021, n°454105, L’Air Liquide, Administrative Court of Appeal of Lyon, 27 January 2022, n°20LY00698, Sté A. Raymond & Cie and Administrative Supreme Court, 5 July 2022 n°463021, Sté Axa). 
Claims can be addressed to the French tax authorities in order to benefit from the foreign tax credits over the years that are not statute barred (i.e. 2020, 2021, and 2022 for financial years closed on 31 December and if the claim is sent in 2023).
There is still uncertainty about the exact amount that can be claimed (Administrative Supreme Court 7 April 2023 n° 462709, min. c/ Sté A. Raymond et Cie).
## Application of the double tax treaty (DTT) between France and the state of the beneficial owner (as not being the direct beneficiary): Key decision
A recent decision from the French Administrative Supreme Court (Conseil d'État, 9e et 10e ch., 20 mai 2022, n°444451, Sté Planet) has recognised, for the first time, the applicability of a reduced withholding tax (WHT) rate provided by the DTT between France and the state of the beneficial owner (i.e. as being the indirect beneficiary of the income paid), as opposed to the withholding rate provided by the tax treaty between France and the state of the direct beneficiary of the income (in the case at hand, royalties).
Such possibility is subject to several and specific conditions (notably the collection of a precise and complete documentation), which are to be validated on a case-by-case basis.
## Value-added tax (VAT) group
As of 1 January 2023, Article 11 of the Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006, whereby each member state may regard as a single taxable person any persons established in the territory of this member state who are legally independent but are closely connected with each other for financial, economic, or organisational purposes, will be implemented in France under new Article 256C of the French Tax Code (FTC). This new regime would be optional and would reinforce the neutrality of VAT for groups, particularly in sectors carrying out tax-exempt transactions. Taxable persons who have elected to form a single taxable person would have to appoint one of them as the head of the group in order to comply with all the obligations related to the tax and make the tax payments, in respect of which all members would remain jointly and severally liable. The group would be set up for a minimum period of three years.
## Electronic e-invoicing reform postponed 
Officially announced in a press release on 28 July 2023, the postponement of the entry into force of the e-invoicing reform, originally scheduled for 1 July 2024, has now been ratified, following the adoption of amendments introduced by the French government as part of the adoption of the Finance Act for 2024. 
The timetable for implementation of the e-invoicing reform is now as follows: 
  * In 2025 (month to be confirmed): Opening of the pilot phase (instead of 1 January 2024); registration opens in 2024. 
  * 1 September 2026: Obligation to issue e-invoices for large and mid-sized companies (instead of 1 July 2024 and 1 January 2025, respectively.
  * 1 September 2027: Obligation to issue e-invoices for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (instead of the 1 January 2026). 
  * As of 1 September 2026, the reception of electronic invoices will apply to all companies, whatever their size. 


## Customs
The Union Customs Code (UCC), which came into force on 1 May 2016, originally provided for the implementation of interoperable national information systems. 
However, the UCC and its delegated regulation granted a transitional period to Member States to develop and adapt their IT systems by 31 December 2025, with the aim of dematerialising and facilitating the exchange of information between them. 
France will soon be offering a new customs clearance service, DELTA I/E (import/export). This service will gradually become the norm and will eventually replace all existing customs clearance applications (DELTA G, ECS BC, DELTA X import, and DELTA X export). 
Within the framework of DELTA I/E, the current customs declaration (Single Administrative Document or SAD) will be replaced by an electronic message including approximately 120 data elements. Postponed several times, DELTA I/E is due to come into force progressively from November 2024 in France.
## Excise duties 
Amended Council Directive (EU) 2020/262 of 19 December 2019 establishing the general arrangements for excise duty came into force on 13 February 2023 and replaces Council Directive 2008/118/EC of 16 December 2008, providing, in particular, for the dematerialisation of the Simplified Accompanying Document (SAD) via the entry into force of the Simplified Electronic Administrative Document (SEAD). 
This reform applies to movement permits covering movement between professionals (B2B) located in two Member States for which excise duties have been paid in the country of departure. 
For this type of flow, the use of a dematerialised accompanying document is compulsory. As in the case of movements under suspension, the new SEAD implies the need for discharge, as well as the deferral of compulsory information for the purposes of electronic monitoring. 
On the other hand, this reform has no impact on the distance-selling system (i.e. duty-paid movements from a professional to a private individual [B2C]) or on duty-paid movements of excise goods within the national territory.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 18 March 2024
## Taxable period
The ordinary taxable period is equal to 12 months. Conformity with the calendar year is not requested. In particular cases, the duration of the taxable period can be different from 12 months (e.g. newly established companies are allowed to have taxable periods longer than 12 months; companies that are involved in extraordinary transactions [merger, de-mergers, etc.], as well as companies that are liquidated, may have taxable periods shorter than 12 months).
## Tax returns
Regarding financial years that end on 31 December, CIT returns are, in theory, due by the end of May of the following year.
### Accounting records to be provided in 'computerised format' in case of tax audit
Companies are required to keep their accounting records in computerised form and to provide them to the tax authorities in the same format. Such electronic files must be provided for FY 2015 and following years.
## Payment of tax
Payment of tax is made during the financial year by way of four instalments equal to 1/4 of the standard taxable income of the preceding year (i.e. by 15 March, 15 June, 15 September, and 15 December for financial years that end on 31 December). Regarding financial years that end on 31 December, final CIT payment is due on 15 May of the following year.
Currently, for companies that have gross income in excess of EUR 250 million, the last down-payment is assessed on the basis of the estimated taxable income of the present year. This instalment plus the three previous ones should represent 95% or 98% of the CIT due on profits of the current year (95% for taxpayers with a revenue between EUR 250 million and EUR 1 billion and 98% for those with revenue in excess of EUR 1 billion). This leads to an anticipated payment of CIT.
### Interest and penalties
Regarding CIT, VAT, registration duties, and business tax:
  * late payment is subject to late interest computed at a rate of 0.4% per month late (4.80% per year) (the 2017 Act reduces this rate to 0.20% per month late [2.40% per year] for interest due from 1 January 2018) and to a 5% penalty, and
  * late filing is subject to late interest computed at a rate of 0.4% per month late (4.80% per year) (the 2017 Act reduces this rate to 0.20% per month late [2.40% per year] for interest due from 1 January 2018) and to a 10% penalty.


Moreover, a penalty of 40% applies in case of bad faith and is increased to 80% in case of fraud.
## Tax audit process
The French tax authorities are responsible for verifying that taxpayers’ obligations are correctly complied with and, if necessary, for making adjustments by issuing tax assessments.
Once an assessment is notified by the tax inspector and if the taxpayer disagrees with such an assessment, the taxpayer has 30 days to answer (with a possible 30 days extension upon request) and to provide comments to the French tax authorities.
Following an exchange of written correspondences between the tax inspector and the taxpayer (including hierarchical recourse), either party may submit any disagreement on a factual issue to the departmental or national tax commission. The decision of this commission is neither binding on the taxpayer nor on the French tax authorities.
In cases where the disagreement between the French tax authorities and the taxpayer still remains, the taxpayer can file a claim with the French civil courts or with the French administrative courts, depending on the type of tax that has been subject to assessment by the tax inspector.
France has reinforced its criminal rules applicable to tax matters. The French tax authorities are now required to transfer to the prosecutor any tax reassessment exceeding the amount of EUR 100,000, provided that said reassessment notably gives rise to the application of a 100% tax penalty, 80% tax penalty, or 40% bad faith penalty in cases where a 40% or 80% tax penalty or a tax fraud proceeding already occurred in the past six years.
Regularisation processes, in some circumstances, are facilitated with application of lower penalties.
Subject to some conditions, there is the possibility for companies to enter into enhanced relationships with the French Tax Administration in order to facilitate communication and ruling requests.
## General anti-abuse rule (GAAR)
### Exclusive tax purpose
To restore their true character, the French tax authorities are entitled to disregard, as not being enforceable against it, acts that constitute an abuse of law (i) either because these acts are fictitious or (ii) because, by seeking to benefit from a literal application of the laws or decisions against the objectives sought by their authors, these acts could not have been inspired by any other purpose than avoiding or mitigating the tax burden that the party concerned would normally have borne, given its actual situation or activities, had these acts not been executed or committed.
On top of the avoided taxes and the standard late payment interest, an 80% penalty for abuse of law is applicable. Specific procedural rules apply in case the French tax authorities apply the abuse of tax law procedure. 
### Principal tax purpose
A wider GAAR provision was also enacted. The French tax authorities may disregard an arrangement, or series of arrangements, put into place for the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of French tax law and is not genuine (which means that it does not rely on economic rationale).
The French tax authorities may apply penalties depending on the circumstances.
## Statute of limitation
Regarding CIT, the general statute of limitation expires at the end of the third year following the one that has triggered the tax liability.
Under certain circumstances, the statute of limitation can be extended up to ten years (e.g. fraud, undisclosed/hidden activity); the statute of limitation can also be interrupted (e.g. notification of a notice of reassessment or international tax assistance).
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Transfer pricing, business reorganisation, financing arrangements, PEs due to home-based working model, and VAT are standard elements reviewed during tax audit.
## The ruling system
To secure the tax status of a situation, foreign companies and individuals can request a private ruling from the French tax authorities as to whether their activities constitute a PE or fixed base.
The French tax authorities have to provide an answer within three months after the receipt of the request. In the absence of response from the French tax authorities within this period of time, the foreign company or individual will be deemed not to have a PE in France.
France provides for other specific rulings (e.g. for R&D activities eligible to R&D tax credit).
APAs are also provided by the French tax authorities for transfer pricing purposes (_see the section for more information_) as well as for eligibility of R&D expenses to the R&D tax credit.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 18 March 2024
France is defined as metropolitan France (excluding the overseas territories [COM], but including the continental shelf), Corsica, and the overseas departments (DOM, i.e. French Guyana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Reunion, and Mayotte).
As a general rule, a resident company is a company that is incorporated under French commercial laws.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The notion of PE is not defined by the FTC and has been specified by a court case of the French Administrative Supreme Court. The notion of PE refers to an enterprise exploited in France that can be materialised in one of the three following situations:
  * Business activity conducted through an establishment (i.e. a fixed business installation operating with some degree of autonomy [e.g. a branch, sales office]).
  * Business conducted in France by a dependent agent.
  * Existence of a complete commercial cycle in France.


A ruling application can be submitted to the French tax authorities to get confirmation as to whether the presence in France of a foreign corporation is a PE.
## Key decision 
In a decision dated 11 December 2020, the French Administrative Supreme Court overturned a Paris Court of Appeal decision dated 1 March 2018 (which had previously concluded in the absence of a PE under the France-Ireland Tax Treaty) and ruled against the Irish subsidiary (Irish Co.) of a US group.
Irish Co., a subsidiary of a US group and sister company of French Co., carried out digital marketing activities in Europe mainly consisting in selling marketing affiliation, media, and technology services in these markets. 
In France, French Co. was remunerated by Irish Co. on a cost plus 8% basis for various services, including administrative and marketing activities and representation (e.g. identification, prospecting, targeting of clients on the French market). The contracts with French clients were signed by Irish Co.
The French Administrative Supreme Court ruled that French Co. should be regarded as a dependent agent in France of Irish Co., even if it did not formally conclude contracts in the name of Irish Co., since it decided on transactions that Irish Co. merely and routinely approved and, as such, became legally binding to Irish Co. 
Consequently, the Court considered that the Irish Co. constituted a PE for CIT and VAT purposes.


# France
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 18 March 2024
## Depreciation
The depreciation of fixed assets has to be carried out component by component. The components of a fixed asset have to be depreciated separately according to their own lifetime.
Declining-balance depreciation is allowed for certain new and renovated assets whose useful life is in excess of three years.
For assets bought or manufactured after 31 December 2009, the rate is computed by multiplying the rate of straight-line depreciation by:
  * 1.25, if the useful life of the asset is three or four years
  * 1.75, if the useful life of the asset is five or six years, or
  * 2.25, if the useful life of the asset is more than six years.


A temporary investment incentive measure was introduced by the Finance Bill for 2016, enabling companies to claim an additional deduction equal to 40% of the asset investment, provided the investment meets the following three conditions:
  * Conditions of the fiscal special depreciation regime (i.e. a new asset having a minimum useful life of three years).
  * Belonging to some limited categories defined by the government (industrial assets, such as plant machinery and equipment, manufacturing equipment, and research operations fittings).
  * Investments made between 15 April 2015 and 14 April 2016.


The Finance Bill for 2017 extended this incentive measure to companies that invest under the following three conditions:
  * The investment has been firmly decided before 15 April 2017.
  * The investing company has paid, before 15 April 2017, an instalment that amounts to at least 10% of the total investment cost.
  * The final acquisition of the investment occurs within a two-year period following the date of beginning of the purchase order.


Specific depreciation rules have been enacted for 'green' road transportation equipment and for robots, 3D printers, and other digital based equipment in order to facilitate the digitalisation of the French economy.
## Goodwill
According to French accounting standards, goodwill is deemed to have an unlimited period of use. It is therefore, in principle, not amortised from an accounting standpoint. However,:
  * this rule is only a presumption, which can be rebutted if a limited period of use can be established; in such a case, goodwill can be amortised over its period of use or, if this period cannot be reliably determined, over ten years, and
  * small businesses can amortise their acquired goodwill over ten years without having to justify a limited period of use.


While confirming the general principle according to which amortisation of goodwill is, in principle, not deductible for French tax purposes, the French tax law allows, on a temporary basis, the tax deduction of goodwill amortisation booked in respect of businesses acquired between 1 January 2022 and 31 December 2025.
## Start-up expenses
No specific rules apply regarding deduction of start-up expenses, except the qualified expenses incurred in establishing the company (so called ‘ _frais d’établissement’_), which can be either deducted or depreciated over five years.
## Research and development (R&D) and software expenses
Concerning R&D and software expenses, a business may elect to immediately deduct costs incurred in R&D of software or to amortise their cost on a straight-line basis over a maximum period of five years.
The cost of acquiring software may be written off on a straight-line basis over 12 months.
The cost of patents acquired can be amortised over a five-year period.
## Financial expenses
The 2019 Finance Act implemented ATAD I and significantly amended the rules limiting the tax deduction of financial expenses borne by French entities as of 1 January 2019.
### Limitation of financial expenses deduction
The net financial expenses incurred in a given year are deductible only if they do not exceed the higher of the two following thresholds:
  * EUR 3 million.
  * 30% of the adjusted taxable income of the taxpayer (i.e. EBITDA).


Financial expenses and income used to determine the net amount referred to above include, _inter alia_ , amounts that are accrued in remuneration for monies put at the disposal of or by the taxpayer. They include, but are not limited to:
  * Payments under participating loans.
  * Imputed interest on financial instruments (e.g. convertible bonds).
  * Notional interest amounts under derivative instruments or hedging arrangements.
  * Certain foreign-exchange gains and losses.
  * Guarantee fees for financing arrangements, arrangement fees, and similar costs related to the borrowing of funds.


The adjusted taxable income corresponds to the taxable income before the offset of tax losses and without taking into consideration net financial expenses and, to some extent, depreciation, provisions, and capital gains and losses. 75% of the net financial expenses exceeding the threshold is tax deductible, provided that the equity-to-asset ratio of the company is at least equal to, or is not lower by more than two percentage points, the equity-to-asset ratio of the consolidated group to which it belongs.
Non-deductible financial expenses of a given year are carried forward indefinitely within the above-mentioned limits. Unused interest deduction capacity of a given financial year can be carried forward for up to five years.
### Thin capitalisation
_Please see comments regarding thin capitalisation in the section_.
## Hybrid mismatches
The EU Directive 2017/952, transposed by the Article 13 of the 2021 Finance Bill, has extended the measures combating hybrid mismatch to situations upon which a same payment has various qualifications for tax purposes in two or more jurisdictions leading to its double deduction or its deduction in one jurisdiction combined with its absence in the tax basis or taxation in the other ones. In these cases, the deduction can be denied in France.
These new rules apply regardless of whether the hybrid mismatches occur between EU or non-EU countries, as long as one of the parties involved is subject to CIT in France.
The new measures against hybrid mismatches entered into force for the financial years opened as of 1 January 2020. The reverse-hybrid mismatch rule entered into force for financial years opened as of 1 January 2022.
## Bad debt
Bad debts that are definitively non-recoverable are treated, from a tax point of view, as deductible charges.
Under certain conditions, a tax-deductible reserve can be established for debts whose collection is uncertain.
## Charitable donations
As a general principle, charitable donations are not tax deductible for CIT purposes. However, they may entitle one to an incentive (_see the section for more information regarding the charitable donations tax reduction_).
## Fines and penalties
As a general principle, fines and penalties are not tax deductible for CIT purposes.
## Taxes
Most taxes, including unrecoverable turnover taxes, registration duties, and CET, are deductible. The major exceptions are CIT and tax penalties, which are never deductible.
## CIT losses
### Carryforward of tax losses
Tax losses carried forward are available to offset the first EUR 1 million of taxable profits and 50% of taxable profits in excess of this.
The carryforward is conditional to certain limitations, namely that the entity continues the same business activities. The FTC provides criteria for measuring such a change of activity that jeopardises the right to carry forward net operating losses.
Under certain circumstances, a ruling can be obtained from the French tax authorities to keep all or part of the net operating losses despite a business reorganisation.
### Carryback of tax losses
Tax losses are available for carryback to the financial year immediately preceding that in which the losses arise and up to a maximum of EUR 1 million. Any unused surplus will be carried forward and used as set out above. In addition, the election to carry back tax losses must be filed prior to the deadline for submission of the tax return for the loss-making period.
### Tax groups
The overall tax losses of a French tax group, as well as pre-election tax losses of the individual members of the group, will be attributed, whether carried forward or carried back, in the same manner and within the same limits as those set out above.
## Payments to foreign-related parties
Unless otherwise provided by the FTC, payments to foreign affiliates are deductible from the CIT basis as long as they meet the arm’s-length test. If they do not, Article 57 of the FTC provides that income directly or indirectly transferred to the foreign-related parties, through either the increase or the reduction of the purchase or sales price of goods and services, or through any other means, must be added back to taxable income. For the purpose of this provision, foreign-related parties are defined as a parent, subsidiaries, or sister companies.
Where the payments are made to companies located in a country with a privileged tax regime, the French taxpayer must prove, in addition, that the transaction is _bona fide_ and that the amount due is not exaggerated (_see the section for more information on countries with a privileged tax regime_).
### Royalties
The FTC restricts the conditions for deducting licensing royalties where the licensor and the licensee are related parties. The deduction will not be possible if the related-party beneficiary is not liable to an effective tax rate of at least 25% on this income.


# France
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 18 March 2024
## Tax consolidation regime
French corporations and their 95% owned domestic subsidiaries may elect to file one single tax return, thus allowing the offset of losses of one group corporation against the profits of a related corporation. CIT is then levied on the aggregate income after certain adjustments (e.g. neutralisation/deneutralisation of capital gain or loss on the sale of assets, provisions) have been made.
When shares in a company that will be tax consolidated into the group are acquired by a group company from individuals or legal entities that control this group, either directly or indirectly, a portion of the group's overall financial expense incurred by the members of the group is progressively added back to the group's taxable income on a straight-line basis over a nine-year period.
A French subsidiary can be included in a tax consolidated group even if its parent company is not located in France. However, at least 95% of the share capital of the foreign company must be held, directly or indirectly, by the French company that is head of the tax consolidated group. In addition, the foreign company must be subject to CIT, be located in the European Union or in a member state of the European Economic Area whose tax treaty with France includes a mutual administrative assistance clause to fight tax fraud and tax evasion, and hold 95% of the lower-tier subsidiary’s shares.
Amending Finance Bill for 2014 adds the opportunity for the companies subject to CIT to adopt horizontal tax consolidation. The creation of a horizontal tax consolidation between French companies’ subsidiaries of the same parent located in an EU member state, or Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein, and subject to a tax equivalent to CIT (‘non-resident parent entity’) is now permitted, allowing one of its subsidiaries (called ‘parent company’) to be solely liable for CIT. This regime applies, optionally, for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2015.
A PE of a foreign company subject to French CIT can be a member of a French tax consolidated group if the shares of the foreign company are held by other French companies, which are members of the consolidated group.
Dividends distributed within a tax consolidated group under the parent-subsidiary regime are exempt up to 99%, and the remaining 1% may not be neutralised.
The Finance Act for 2024 extends the benefits of the tax consolidation regime (i.e. the exemption up to 99% of French CIT) to dividends received by French companies that have, deliberately, not elected for the tax consolidation regime. Such exemption applies to dividends distributed by foreign companies established within the European Union (or the European Economic Area under certain conditions) to French companies, provided that shareholding conditions are met for at least one fiscal year.
### Allocation of the tax charge within a tax consolidated group
In an important decision dated 12 March 2010 ('Wolseley Centers France'), the French Supreme Court disagreed with the French tax authorities by ruling that the tax charge of the group can be freely allocated between members of the consolidated tax group.
Following this decision, group companies are free to enter into a tax consolidation agreement stating the conditions for the allocation of the group tax charge or, where applicable, the tax savings arising from the group arrangement.
The Supreme Court concludes that since the terms of an agreement to allow a re-allocation take into account the specific results of each of the group companies, the terms of this re-allocation cannot be regarded as an indirect subsidy. However, this allocation should neither undermine the corporate benefit of each group member nor the minority shareholders rights; otherwise, this will result in an abnormal act of management.
### Cancellation of the neutralisation of intra-group debt waivers and subsidies
When determining the consolidated taxable basis debt wavers, direct and indirect subsidies granted between tax consolidated entities are no longer neutralised. In other words, they are taken into account in the tax basis.
### Cancellation of the neutralisation of the 12% portion taxed upon long-term capital gain
Gains on the sale of shares in subsidiaries held for at least two years benefit from significant relief (88% of such capital gains are excluded from CIT, with the remaining 12% portion being taxed at the standard rate). As of 1 January 2019, this 12% portion can no longer be neutralised in the tax group in case of sale of shares between members of the tax group.
### Transactions at cost among consolidated entities
The 2019 Finance Act provides that goods and services sold at a lower price than the arm's-length one but higher than their cost of goods or cost of service do not qualify as indirect subsidies and thus never create a tax event within tax consolidation.
## Participation-exemption regime
French parent companies (i.e. companies incorporated in France and holding qualifying shares that represent at least 5% of the issued capital of subsidiaries, French or foreign) have the option of excluding 95% of the subsidiaries' net dividends from CIT (5%, reduced to 1% in certain circumstances, of charges and expenses must be added back to the parent company’s taxable results). The French parent-subsidiary regime extends to certain shares without voting rights. There is no formal commitment to have held the shares for at least two years, and companies can benefit from this regime from the acquisition date of the shares. However, the obligation remains to hold the shares over this two-year period. Certain shares of listed real estate companies are not eligible to the French parent-subsidiary regime.
The taxation of dividends received by a parent company from its subsidiary cannot be capped at the amount of the expenses actually incurred by the parent company. Thus, the tax liability is equal to 5% (or 1%) of the dividends received, tax credits included. However, a French Administrative Court recently ruled that the flat add-back amount to the taxable result in application of the parent-exemption regime, amounting to 5% (or 1% in certain cases), represented a real taxation (as opposed to a flat amount of costs and expenses) under French CIT, against which may potentially be offset tax credits due, for instance, to application of the DTTs (CAA Lyon, 27-1-2022 n°20LY00698, Sté A. Raymond et Cie). 
The French parent-subsidiary regime is not applicable to dividends paid from entities located in an NCST unless the entity can demonstrate that its activities are real and it does not seek to locate profits in the NCST.
In principle, the subsidiary’s shares must be kept by the parent company for at least two years in order to benefit from the participation-exemption regime. However, some operations lead to a break of the two-year holding period. In that case, the exchanged shares are deemed withheld until the sale of the securities received in exchange.
The exchanged shares will be deemed kept for the application of the participation-exemption regime only if the gain or loss is not taken into account in the result of that exchange. If the gain or loss is included in the result, the dividends received may not benefit from the participation-exemption regime and will be taxed.
In addition to the above, the 2016 Act repealed the exclusion from the benefit of the parent-subsidiary regime for the dividends received on shares with no voting rights retroactive to 3 February 2016.
### In case of tax consolidated group
There is a 99% exemption on dividends received by a member of a tax group from:
  * another member of the same group or
  * a company: 
    * subject to a tax equivalent to French CIT in another member state, or in an EEA member state that has concluded an administrative assistance agreement with France to fight against tax fraud and tax evasion, and
    * that would fulfil the conditions to participate in a French tax consolidated group if it were established in France (other than being subject to CIT in France).


## Distribution followed by absorption or sale of subsidiary
The FTC prevents the possibility for a company to accumulate the exemption of dividends received from its subsidiaries (under the participation-exemption regime or the tax consolidation regime) and the deduction of a loss in value resulting from the dividends' distribution due to previous distributions at the time of the securities exchange or sale of shares.
## Transfer pricing
Upon tax audit, companies whose gross assets exceed EUR 400 million, have a turnover that exceeds a specific threshold (EUR 152.4 million or EUR 76.2 million, depending on the activity of the company), or that are part of a group that meet those criteria, and assuming they have management accounts or consolidated accounts, have to provide the French tax administration with analytical and consolidated accounts.
Identically, rulings granted by foreign tax authorities have to be part of the transfer pricing documentation.
It is not possible to defer the collection of CIT reassessed when a mutual agreement procedure is launched.
### Transfer pricing documentation
Large corporations located in France (i.e. with annual turnover or amount of gross assets in excess of EUR 400 million) are required to provide documentation containing general information regarding the relevant group of companies, including main activities, operational and legal structures of the related companies, functions performed and risks borne, main intangible assets, and group transfer pricing policy, amongst others.
In order to strengthen the administration's ability to detect and punish the abusive use of transfer pricing rules, the Finance Act for 2024: 
  * reduces the threshold for triggering the transfer pricing documentation requirement from EUR 400 million to EUR 150 million for financial years starting from 1 January 2024, and
  * increases to EUR 50,000 the minimum fine for failure to provide this documentation for offences committed from 1 January 2024.


### Advanced pricing agreements (APAs)
APAs are available for taxpayers only on the basis of international agreements entered into in accordance with Article 25 of the OECD Model Tax Convention. Currently, taxpayers are also allowed to enter into APAs with the French tax authorities on a unilateral basis. In practice, taxpayers are entitled to submit their transfer pricing policy to the French tax authorities. Agreement of the tax authorities to the APA precludes a later challenge as long as facts and circumstances described in the APA and actual ones are identical.
### Light French transfer pricing annual reporting obligation
All French entities with turnover or gross assets on the balance sheet exceeding EUR 50 million, or with more than 50% direct or indirect shareholder or subsidiary interest meeting this threshold, are also subject to the light but annual French transfer pricing documentation requirements.
French companies subject to these transfer pricing obligations must file Form 2257 no later than six months after the deadline to file the annual CIT return with the tax authorities.
Form 2257 discloses general information related to the consolidated group (i.e. activities performed, group transfer pricing policy, country of location of intangibles, etc.). The form also includes specific information on the French entity (i.e. aggregated amounts of inter-company transactions exceeding EUR 100,000, main transfer pricing method used for each kind of transaction, etc.).
The 2016 Finance Act introduced two main changes:
  * Electronic filing of Form 2257.
  * If the relevant French entities are members of a French fiscal unity (consolidated group), Form 2257 must be filed by the head company of the French fiscal unity on behalf of the entire consolidated tax group.


## Hard-to-value intangibles
To enable tax authorities to fully apply OECD principles to control the price of intangible asset disposals, the Finance Act for 2024 introduces the possibility for the French tax authorities, for financial years starting from 1 January 2024, to adjust the value of a transferred hard-to-value intangible asset or right on the basis of results subsequent to the financial year in which the transaction took place.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
To align with recommendations of the OECD and the G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Initiative (Action 13), France has introduced CbC reporting for multinational corporations, applicable to tax years beginning on or after 1 January 2016. The annual obligation requires multinational corporations to file with the French tax authorities anytime within the 12 months following their financial year-end a CbC report disclosing information regarding the name, activities, and profits of foreign entities in the same group.
French entities are subject to the CbC reporting requirement if they:
  * establish consolidated accounts
  * directly or indirectly hold or control one or several legal entities established abroad, or have foreign branches
  * generate annual consolidated group revenue of at least EUR 750 million, and
  * are not held by one or several legal entities established in France already subject to the French CbC reporting requirement, or by legal entities established abroad that are subject to similar CbC reporting requirements pursuant to foreign legislation.


The French government publishes a list of states or territories that have implemented a similar CbC reporting requirement, have concluded an automatic exchange of information agreement with France, and comply with this agreement.
An entity established in France is also subject to the French CbC reporting requirement when that French entity is held, directly or indirectly, by a legal entity established in a foreign state or territory that would have been subject to the CbC reporting requirement if established in France when:
  * the French entity is designated by the consolidated group to perform the CbC reporting obligation for that group, and the French tax authorities have been informed of that designation, or
  * the French entity is not able to demonstrate that any other entity of the group, either established in France or in a listed state or territory, has been designated to perform the CbC reporting for the group.


Failure to provide the French tax authorities with complete CbC reporting will result in a penalty of up to EUR 100,000.
On 21 June 2023, France transposed the EU Public CbC Reporting Directive. The measure requires both EU-based MNEs and non-EU based MNEs doing business in the European Union through a branch or subsidiary with total consolidated revenue of more than EUR 750 million in each of the last two consecutive financial years to report publicly the income taxes paid and other tax-related information, such as a breakdown of profits, revenues, and employees.
## Thin capitalisation
Interest accrued by a French corporation in relation with borrowings from its direct shareholders may be deducted if the following two conditions are met:
  * The share capital of the borrower is fully paid-up.
  * The interest rate does not exceed the average interest rate on loans with an initial duration of more than two years granted by banks to French companies or a higher rate if it can be demonstrated that this rate would be at arm's length.


For financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2019, in line with the implementation of the ATAD 1 rules in France, deduction is further limited.
Related-party interest charges are tax-deductible only if they are at arm’s-length and if the lender meets a minimal taxation test as referred to below.
Under the arm’s-length test, the deductible interest rate is limited to the higher of:
  * The average annual interest rate on loans granted by financial institutions that carry a floating rate and have a minimum term of two years.
  * The interest rate at which the company could have borrowed from any unrelated financial institution, such as a bank, in similar circumstances (i.e. the market rate).


The portion of interest that exceeds the higher of the above two thresholds is not tax-deductible and must be added back to taxable income for the relevant financial year (this portion is furthermore deemed distributed).
For taxpayers considered to be thinly capitalised (i.e. where the related-party debt-to-equity ratio exceeds 1:5), the portion of deductible financial expenses is determined based on the following limitations:
  * External debt: The 30% EBITDA test applies to the interest charges derived from external debt, determined as being the total interest multiplied by the amounts put at the disposal of the taxpayer by third parties increased by 5 x equity/total amounts put at the disposal of the corporation.
  * Related-party debt: Interest on related\\-party debt will be subject to stricter rules, with a 10% of tax EBITDA limitation applying to interest charges derived from related-party debt, calculated as being the total interest multiplied by the amounts put at the disposal of the corporation by related parties/total amounts put at the disposal of the corporation.


For taxpayers not considered to be thinly capitalised, the net financial expenses incurred in a given year are deductible only if they do not exceed the higher of the two following thresholds:
  * EUR 3 million.
  * 30% of the adjusted taxable income of the taxpayer (i.e. EBITDA).


For a tax-consolidated group, the limitation rule based on a portion of the adjusted taxable income applies at the level of the group.
### Special thin capitalisation rules for tax consolidated groups
A member of the tax consolidation may benefit under restrictive conditions of an extra interest charge deduction when the ratio of the consolidated group is higher than its own one.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
The CFC rules provide that:
  * French corporations are required to include in their taxable income profits made by their more than 50% owned foreign subsidiaries and branches. The 50% holding is determined by direct and indirect control of shares and voting rights.
  * The minimum holding threshold has to be reduced to 5% if over 50% of the share capital of the foreign entity is indirectly held through French or foreign companies controlled by the French parent company. However, if the shares in the foreign entity are listed on a regulated market, the French tax authorities will have to demonstrate that the French parent company, together with other entities holding shares in such foreign entity, is acting in concert.
  * The CFC rules are only applicable if the foreign legal entity or PE in which the French company owns the requisite percentage of shares is in a country with a privileged tax regime. A privileged tax regime is defined by the FTC as a tax regime in which a foreign jurisdiction subjects taxable income of a foreign entity to at least 50% or lower of the income tax liability that would have been incurred in France, had the activity of the foreign entity been performed in France.
  * Profits of the foreign entity that fall under the CFC rules are no longer taxed separately. They are now aggregated with the other taxable profits of the French parent company. Consequently, any tax losses incurred by the French parent company may be offset against the foreign entity’s profits.
  * The French parent company can avoid the application of the CFC rules if it demonstrates that the foreign entity carries an effective trading or manufacturing activity, conducted from its country of establishment or registered office. Furthermore, the CFC rules, in principle, are not applicable with respect of foreign branches or subsidiaries located in another EU country. However, this exception is not applicable if the French tax authorities can demonstrate that the foreign entity located in another EU country constitutes an artificial arrangement, set up to circumvent French tax legislation. This concept is similar to the ‘abuse of law’ concept, although it does not have all the same characteristics.




# France
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 18 March 2024
Tax rates on branch profits are the same as on corporate profits. As a principle, branch profits are deemed to be distributed to the head office. WHT is levied on French branches of non-resident, non-EU corporations at the rate of 25%, or a reduced tax treaty rate (e.g. 5% for the United States), on net profits. Refund (limited or full) of tax may be claimed to the extent that the taxable amount exceeds the dividend(s) actually distributed by the foreign corporation during the 12 months following the close of the financial year concerned, or to the extent the dividends are distributed to residents of France.
Profits realised in France by non-resident corporations whose head offices are located in an EU country or in the European Economic Area are not subject to branch WHT, provided that certain conditions are met (e.g. effective head office in an EU country or non-resident corporation subject to corporate taxation).

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 18 March 2024
## Foreign tax credit
Under DTTs signed by France, several methods have been established to avoid double taxation. The main one is the traditional deduction of a tax credit from tax effectively paid. However, some treaties establish a tax exemption or the exclusive right to tax. Also, a tax-sparing clause is included in some treaties, which allows for the deduction of not only the tax actually paid but a higher amount of tax.
## Decrease of payroll charges paid by employers (former tax credit to boost competitiveness and employment [CICE])
For wages paid on or after 1 January 2019, the CICE tax credit is repealed and replaced by a permanent decrease in payroll charges paid by employers to finance the French social security system.
## R&D tax credit
The R&D tax credit is determined on the basis of the eligible R&D expenses incurred during the calendar year.
The R&D tax credit is determined on the basis of R&D projects qualified as eligible due to compliance with criteria set by the French Ministry of Research (so-called '_Ministère de l’Enseignement Supérieur, de la Recherche et de l’Innovation_ ' or MESRI) and is equal to 30% of the sum of qualifying R&D expenses, up to EUR 100 million, and 5% above. The R&D tax credit includes technical and scientific research operations in three areas: fundamental research, applied research, and experimental development.
The qualifying expenses are the following:
  * Depreciation of assets entirely or partially dedicated to R&D, including patents acquired.
  * Researchers' salaries, with a doubling of the expenses for ‘young graduate doctors’ during the 24 months following their hiring in an open-ended contract by the company.
  * Purchases of qualified subcontracted research towards public or private subcontractors in the European Economic Area, approved by the French Ministry of Research.
  * Operating costs equal to 75% of R&D tax credit eligible depreciation and 43% of R&D tax credit eligible researchers' salaries (50% before FY20) and 100% of ‘young graduate doctors’.
  * Miscellaneous amounts, such as costs related to patents (filing, maintenance, and defense), standardisation, and technological monitoring.
  * The amounts of subsidies for R&D tax credit eligible R&D projects.


Regarding the subcontracting expenses, they are subjected to multiple ceilings:
  * The total amount of expenditure sub-contracted is capped at EUR 10 million in cases where sub-contractors are unrelated and to EUR 2 million in the contrary case.
  * In addition, they are to be included within the limit of three times the total amount of other research expenses.


The 2021 Finance Bill provides that:
  * the R&D expenditures sub-contracted by a company to public research bodies shall no longer be doubled
  * the public research bodies are to be accredited by the French Ministry of Research
  * the increase of EUR 2 million applicable on expenditure sub-contracted to public research bodies shall be removed, and
  * the expenses related to public research bodies are subjected to the ceiling of three times the total of other research expenses alongside the expenses to private research bodies.


These measures may apply to R&D expenditures incurred as of 1 January 2022.
The tax credit can be offset against the CIT liability payable by the taxpayer with respect to the calendar year during which the wages are paid. Any excess credit can be carried forward and offset against the tax liability of the taxpayer during the next three years.
Credits unused after three years will be refunded to the taxpayer. The 'receivable' (unused credits) can be transferred or sold only to credit institutions. Finally, special provisions apply in the case of mergers and assimilated restructuring operations.
### Research collaboration tax credit
The 2022 Finance Bill introduced a tax credit for collaborative research for eligible expenses incurred between 1 January 2022 and 31 December 2025 within the European Union or European Economic Area as part of collaborative contracts with Research and Knowledge Dissemination Organisations (i.e. mainly universities) (ORDCs).
An ORDC is considered to be an entity, regardless of its legal status or method of financing, whose primary objective is to carry out, in complete independence, fundamental research, industrial research, or experimental development activities or to widely disseminate the results of these activities by means of teaching, publications, or knowledge transfer. ORDCs must be approved by the French Ministry of Research.
The tax credit includes technical and scientific research operations in three areas: fundamental research, applied research, and experimental development.
This tax credit is equal to 40% (50% for EU SMEs) of the expenses invoiced by these organisations, up to a cap of EUR 6 million per year. Expenses invoiced by ORDCs in excess of the EUR 6 million limit may be included in the basis for calculating R&D tax credit.
The tax credit can be offset against the CIT liability payable by the taxpayer with respect to the calendar year during which the wages are paid. Any excess credit can be carried forward and offset against the tax liability of the taxpayer during the next three years.
Credits unused after three years will be refunded to the taxpayer.
## New 'green industry tax credit' ('crédit d'impôt pour l'industrie verte' or C3IV)
The 2024 Finance Bill introduced a tax credit for green industry, equal to 20% (or 25% to 40% depending on the geographic area of investment) of the amount of eligible expenses incurred. The tax credit could amount to a maximum of EUR 150 million per company (or EUR 200 million to EUR 350 million in the case of investments in specific areas). 
Eligible investment expenditures are incurred in connection with activities contributing to the production of batteries, solar panels, wind turbines, and heat pumps. 
This tax credit would apply to applications filed as of 27 September 2023 and would apply to accredited investments until 31 December 2025.
## Patent Box regime
The Patent Box regime resulting from the Finance Law for 2019 provides for a CIT rate reduced to 10% (instead of the current standard rate of 25%) on the net income derived from the disposal (to unrelated parties) / licensing of patents and related IP rights.
This legislation implements the 'nexus' approach, according to which a company may only be granted the reduced tax rate when it has carried out the R&D activities from which the patent/related IP right derives.
Eligible assets must qualify as fixed assets for French GAAP purposes:
  * Patents.
  * Industrial manufacturing processes.
  * Proprietary Variety Protection Certificates.
  * Copyrighted software.


A formal election must be made in the yearly tax return.
## Tax reduction on charitable donations 
For charitable donations made over a financial year ending as of 31 December 2020, the tax reduction amounts to 60% of the amount of the payments. The fraction of the payments exceeding EUR 2 million is entitled to a tax reduction at a rate of 40%. For the calculation of the reduction, the amount of the payments is taken into account within the limit of EUR 20,000 or 5 per thousand of turnover, whichever is higher.
The tax reduction on charitable donation can be offset against the CIT liability payable by the taxpayer with respect to the financial year during which the donations were granted. Any excess reduction can be offset against the tax liability of the taxpayer during the next five financial years.
## Inbound investment incentives
No particular incentives are available to foreign investors in France. However, the government offers a comprehensive programme of tax incentives and development subsidies to encourage investment in underdeveloped areas.
Capital investment is encouraged through the declining-balance method of depreciation as well as through exceptional depreciation for certain capital expenditures.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 18 March 2024
Payments to resident corporations and individuals are not subject to WHT.
Payments to non-resident corporations and individuals are subject to WHT, _as shown below_. When relevant, the rates of dividend WHT mentioned below might be subject to additional requirements with respect to the application of the MLI (i.e. the rates and notes do not include the amending position set out by the MLI application; _see below for more information on the MLI_). 
In a decision given on 9 November 2015, the French Administrative Supreme Court ruled that a person who is exempt from tax in a contracting state by reason of one’s status or activity cannot be considered liable to taxation and, consequently, is not a resident of the contracting state under the DTT if the treaty defines a ‘resident’ as a person who is liable to tax in a contracting state.

Explanation of columns
**Column 2:** Individuals and companies not qualifying as parents are subject to the WHT rates for dividends as indicated in this column.
**Columns 3 and 4:** Column 3 indicates the WHT rate for dividends paid to a foreign ‘parent’ company. To be considered as a parent company, the foreign company must hold a specified percentage of the French company’s share capital or voting rights. These minimum percentages range from 0% to 80%, as indicated in Column 4, and certain other conditions must be met (_see each treaty_). If no percentage is indicated, either no minimum shareholding is required or the tax treaty does not reduce the WHT rate of 25%.
No WHT is levied on dividends paid by a French company to an EU parent or to a parent company of Iceland, Liechtenstein, or Norway that is subject to CIT, provided all the following conditions are met:
  * The parent company has held a minimum percentage of the share capital of the distributing company, directly and continuously, for at least two years. As of 1 January 2009, the participation required is 10%.
  * The parent company is the beneficial owner of the dividends.
  * The parent company has its place of effective management in an EU state and is not deemed to be domiciled outside the European Union under an applicable tax treaty.
  * The parent company is one of the legal forms enumerated by the relevant Directive.
  * The parent company is subject to CIT in the member state where it has its effective seat of management.
  * The dividend distribution does not fall under the anti-abuse provisions.


**Column 5:** The tax mechanism has been changed so as to exempt the interest from WHT in France except where the interest is paid to an entity established in a non-cooperative state or territory (WHT at a rate of 75% applicable). The payer can, however, be exempt if one proves that the main purpose and effect of such a payment is not to take advantage of locating the income in such a jurisdiction.
These provisions apply to income paid as of 1 March 2010. A special provision applies to loans entered into outside of France by French companies and some investments funds prior to this date. Interest paid on these loans and on related loans after 1 March 2010 will continue to be exempt.
**Column 6:** There is no requirement to withhold income tax on royalties paid to EU companies if all the following conditions are met:
  * The taxpayer is a French-resident company or a French PE of a company resident in another EU member state.
  * The beneficial owner of the income is an EU-resident company.
  * The beneficial owner must have its place of effective management in an EU member state.
  * The beneficial owner is one of the legal forms enumerated by the EU Directive. 
  * The beneficial owner is subject to CIT in the member state where it has its effective place of management without being exempted from it.
  * The taxpayer and the recipient are at least 25% associates, which means that either one directly holds 25% or more of the share capital or voting rights in the other, or a third party directly holds 25% or more of the capital or voting rights in both of them. In any case, the 25% shares must be held for an uninterrupted period of at least two years (or a commitment to respect such requirement might be undertaken by the beneficial owner).


**Column 7:** WHT is automatically imposed on after-tax profits of a PE unless certain conditions are met. The rate is 25% or the reduced tax treaty rate.
Notes
  1. _See explanation of Columns 3 and 4_.
  2. The nil rate of WHT is subject to the payment of dividend issued from profits taxed at the standard rate of CIT.
  3. The passive income (dividend, interest, royalties) clause shall be modified with respect to the most favoured nation clause.
  4. The exemption of WHT applies if the beneficial owner of the dividend is a company that holds, directly or indirectly, at least 50% of the share capital of the distributing company and has invested at least EUR 3 million (or equivalent amount in Georgian currency) in the share capital of the latter at the date of effective payment of the dividend; the 5% WHT rate applies if the beneficial owner of the dividend is a company that holds, directly or indirectly, at least 10% of the share capital of the distributing company and has invested more than EUR 100,000 (or equivalent amount in Georgian currency); the WHT rate is 10% in the other cases.
  5. A rate of 15% is applicable for dividend distributed by certain companies.
  6. A new DTT has entered into force as of 19 August 2019 between France and Luxembourg. The nil rate of WHT provided by the DTT is subject to the direct ownership of 5% of the share capital of the paying company over a minimum shareholding period of 365 days.
  7. The WHT exemption applies unless dividends are paid to a Mexican company whose share capital is held more than 50%, directly or indirectly, by one or more third country residents.
  8. The 5% rate applies if the Japanese company has held at least 10% of the share capital of the French company over the period of six months ending on the date on which entitlement to the dividend is determined. No WHT applies if the Japanese company has held at least 15% over the same period. 
  9. No WHT applies if dividends are taxable in Morocco. 
  10. The 5% rate applies to dividends when three conditions are fulfilled, as follows: the beneficial owner of the dividends (i) must have invested at least EUR 76,224.51 in the company that pays these dividends; (ii) must be a company liable for CIT; and (iii) must be exempt from CIT. The rate is 10% when only condition (i) or both conditions (ii) and (iii) are fulfilled. In all other cases, the rate is 15%.
  11. The exemption of WHT shall not apply where dividends distributed benefit a body corporate controlled, directly or indirectly, by persons who are not residents of one of the contracting states, except if such body corporate proves that the principal objective of the participation is not to benefit from the nil WHT rate. Where the exemption from withholding at source is requested on the basis of Article 15, paragraph 1, of the Agreement of 26 October 2004 between the Swiss Confederation and the European Community providing measures equivalent to those provided in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of income from savings in the form of interest payments, the nil WHT rate shall apply if the body corporate is controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of states that are members of the European Community.
  12. The 5% rate applies to gross dividends if the beneficial owner is a Ukrainian company that holds, directly or indirectly, at least 10% of the French company’s share capital. The rate is 0% if the shareholding is at least 50% and EUR 762,245 or if the shareholding is guaranteed by the Ukrainian State, its central bank, or any other person acting on its behalf. It is 15% in all other cases.
  13. Non-treaty recipients of royalties and management fees are subject to a 5% WHT rate. Where a treaty exists, management fees are exempt from WHT unless they are included in the definition of royalties subject to WHT.
  14. In France, the WHT is levied on a provisional basis at 5% of the net profit. This amount is reduced to the extent it exceeds the dividends effectively paid by the company during the previous 12 months, and the amount of dividends paid to residents of France. Consequently, if the foreign head office undertakes not to distribute dividends in a given year, the after-tax profits of its French branch are not subject to WHT, even when they are transferred abroad.
  15. WHT on interest on loans with a contract is 0%, while withholding on other interest is in a range from 15% to 75%. For treaty rates, consult the individual entry in the table.
  16. The WHT rate can be 60% for certain securities if the investor’s identity is not disclosed.
  17. The WHT is levied on the following amount: French net profit divided by the total foreign company net profit, multiplied by the amount of the distribution.
  18. The rate of 10% is applicable on royalties for the use of literary, artistic, or scientific works, including films; 25% on royalties for the use of trademarks; and 15% otherwise.
  19. No WHT is applicable on a royalty arising from the use of, or the right to use, literary, artistic, or scientific works (excluding film). For Trinidad and Tobago, scientific works are excluded from the scope of the WHT exemption.
  20. WHT is reduced to 6% for royalties paid for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment.
  21. A rate of 5% is applicable on royalties paid for the use of, or the right to use, films.
  22. Profits realised in France by foreign corporations whose head offices are located in a European country are not subject to WHT if certain conditions concerning the foreign corporation are met (head office in a European country; foreign corporation subject to corporate taxation).
  23. No WHT is applicable on a royalty arising from the use of, or the right to use, literary, artistic, or scientific works.
  24. No WHT is levied on certain royalties paid in the field of audio-visual techniques.
  25. The rate of 10% is applicable on royalties paid for the use of literary, artistic, or scientific works, including films. The rate of 15% is applicable on royalties paid for industrial property or for information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific experience.
  26. A rate of 5% is applicable on royalties paid for the use of, or the right to use, films.
  27. The rate of 5% is applicable on royalties paid for the use of, or the right to use, literary, artistic, or scientific works, including films. For Azerbaijan, scientific works are excluded from the scope of the reduced rate.
  28. The rate of 5% is applicable on royalties paid for the use of literary and artistic works, including films, and for information concerning commercial experience.
  29. No WHT is levied on royalties paid for the use of, or the right to use, literary or artistic works, excluding films and recordings.
  30. No WHT is levied on royalties paid for the use of, or the right to use, copyrights or cinematographic films.
  31. No WHT is levied on royalties paid for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment.

  33. The rate of 5% is applicable on royalties for the use of literary, artistic, or scientific works, not including films.
  34. The rate of 5% is applicable on royalties for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment.
  35. The reduced rate is applicable if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership).
  36. Voting shares solely.
  37. The rate of 10% is applicable on royalties for the use of literary, artistic, or scientific works, including films.
  38. _See explanation of Column 6_.

  42. The rate of 5% is applicable on royalties paid for the use of, or the right to use, copyright of literary, artistic, or scientific works (excluding films), and the rate of 10% is applicable on royalties paid for the grant of licenses for use of patents, designs, models, plans, secret formulas, and processes from sources.

### WHT on French-source dividends
The EU WHT exemption extends to dividends paid by foreign companies whose effective place of management is in an EEA member state that has concluded an administrative assistance agreement with France (including Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway).
Shares held in bare ownership are taken into account for the computation of the 10% percentage in the distributing entity’s capital in order to benefit from the WHT exemption. The ownership percentage required to benefit from the WHT exemption may be reduced from 10% to 5% if the beneficial owner of the dividends (EU or EEA) cannot offset the French domestic WHT in its home country.
The WHT exemption also applies if dividends are paid to a parent company based in the European Union or in a third country that has concluded an administrative assistance agreement with France that is in a tax loss position and is declared bankrupt or is in a similar situation.
### Dividends received by a French parent from qualifying holdings
Shares held in bare ownership are taken into account for the computation of the 5% percentage in the subsidiary’s capital in order to benefit from the participation-exemption regime.
Participation exemption is available for distributions received from entities established in NCSTs, provided the parent company demonstrates that these operations are not designed for, or do not result in, locating profits in such NCST for tax fraud purposes.
There is an exclusion of certain dividend distributions (e.g. distributions made by _société d’investissement immobilière côtée_ [SIIC], _société immobilière pour le commerce et l’industrie_[SICOMI], _société de placement à prépondérance immobilière à capital variable_ [SPPICAV], etc.) from the participation-exemption regime.
## OECD Multilateral Instrument to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (MLI)
France has adopted the MLI, and it entered into force as of 1 January 2019.
The MLI's purpose is to enable jurisdictions to modify their bilateral tax treaties to implement measures aiming to update international rules and lessen the opportunity for tax avoidance.
France opted for the Principal Purposes Test (PPT) clause included in Article 7 (1) rather than a Limitation on Benefits (LoB) provision.
This PPT may lead to denial of treaty benefits for an item of income or capital where, taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case, it is reasonable to conclude that the principal purpose of the transaction or arrangement is to obtain treaty benefits.
## Anti-avoidance rules applicable to Non-Cooperative States or Territories (NCSTs)
The French parent-subsidiary regime is not applicable to dividends paid from entities located in an NCST unless the entity can demonstrate that its activities are real and it does not seek to locate profits in the NCST.
WHT on passive income is 75% for transactions with an NCST person or entity.
Payments (e.g. interests, royalties, payments for services) made to an NCST person or entity are, as a general rule, not tax deductible. In addition, it is not possible to offset WHT in France with any foreign WHT borne by the entity located in an NCST.
Moreover, concerning shareholders (individuals and companies) located in an NCST, a tax amounting to 75% is levied on capital gains derived from the disposal of shares in French companies, whatever the level of shareholding, unless the entity can demonstrate that its activities are real and it does not seek to locate profits in the NCST.
In 2024, the list of NCSTs includes Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Belize, Fiji, Guam, Palaos, Panama, Russia, American Samoa, Samoa, Seychelles, Trinidad and Tobago, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Vanuatu, and the American Virgin Islands.
## Specific Anti-Abuse Rule (SAAR)
An SAAR provides that the French WHT exemption does not apply to an arrangement or series of arrangements when the following two conditions are met:
  * The arrangement, or the series of arrangements, was put into place for the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the Directive.
  * The arrangement, or the series of arrangements, is not considered as genuine, which means that it does not rely on economic rationale.




# France
## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 18 March 2024
## France and the United States sign bilateral agreement on the implementation of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
France and the United States signed a bilateral intergovernmental agreement (IGA) intended to implement FATCA. FATCA was enacted by the United States in 2010 to combat offshore tax evasion by US persons. France, with the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, and Italy, was an original member of the ‘G5’ countries that agreed with the United States to advance the principles of FATCA under the concept of bilateral IGAs in order to address many of the legal barriers faced by financial institutions in complying with FATCA.
The French government has committed to drafting local laws and regulations to implement FATCA among all financial institutions resident in France (including French branches of foreign companies). Broadly speaking, the banking, life insurance, and asset management industries will be most affected, but certain estate (patrimonial) vehicles, holding companies, as well as hedging, finance, and treasury centres of non-financial groups could also be impacted, depending on the nature of their activities.
As expected, the US-France IGA is based on the Model 1A version with an Annex II negotiated to include provisions specific to the local French market and that contains categories of French financial institutions qualifying for exempt beneficial owner or deemed-complaint status.
Compliance with FATCA’s due diligence, reporting, and, in some cases, withholding requirements is necessary for foreign financial institutions (FFIs) to avoid suffering 30% withholding on certain US-source income and payments. The French IGA is intended to simplify the FATCA requirements for French financial institutions, but, in most cases, still requires significant efforts to maintain compliance.
The following are key points specific to the US-France IGA to consider:
  * Inclusion of the ‘most favoured nation’ clause allowing adoption of certain provisions from other IGAs that may be more favourable to French financial institutions.
  * Consistent with Notice 2013-43, the timetable for implementation of FATCA has been synchronised with the intended amendments to the US Treasury Regulations, starting with the entry into force of key provisions effective 1 July 2014.
  * Annex II of the French IGA describes various classes of exempt beneficial owners and deemed-compliant financial institutions. 
    * The deemed-compliant financial institutions described in Annex II are treated as Non-Reporting French Financial Institutions under the French IGA. In turn, these Non-Reporting French Financial Institutions are considered certified deemed-compliant FFIs under the US regulations and do not have to register to obtain a global intermediary identification number (GIIN).
    * Collective investment vehicles, including investment entities established in France that are regulated as collective investment vehicles, _sociétés de crédit foncier_ and _sociétés de financement de l’habitat_ , are Non-Reporting French Financial Institutions treated as deemed-compliant FFIs.
  * The asset management industry should benefit from an exemption related to employee savings plans and a special status that is intended to reduce the FATCA obligations of investment vehicles and management companies that can ensure the absence of US investors and non-participating financial institution customers.
  * The agreement also provides specific provisions for certain French institutions and financial products, including: 
    * Exemption for certain local banks with an almost exclusively local client base. This could be beneficial to French institutions following the mutual banking model.
    * Most regulated savings products (savings books and savings plans), which are excluded from the definition of a financial account and will not be treated as US Reportable Accounts, whereas the share savings plan (PEA) remains within the scope of FATCA.
    * Products dedicated to retirement planning (Article 39, Article 82 , Article 83, Madelin, Madelin agricole, Perp, Pere, and Prefon), which are excluded from the definition of financial accounts and will not be treated as US Reportable Accounts.
    * Pension funds will also benefit from a specific exemption.


French financial institutions, as well as non-financial organisations with financial institutions within their groups, should be taking steps based on the IGA (and in some cases US Treasury Regulations) to ensure they are prepared to comply. Unofficial draft guidelines have been prepared regarding the US-France IGA. This draft is not binding on French tax authorities. Official guidelines were published on 5 August 2015.
## DAC6 - Reporting obligations
Pursuant to the EU Council Directive 2018/822/EU regarding mandatory exchange of information in the field of taxation with respect to reportable cross-border arrangements, intermediaries and taxpayers are subject to new reporting obligations involving certain cross-border tax planning arrangements.
The DAC6 reporting obligations to local tax authorities focus on cross-border tax planning arrangements that meet characteristics or hallmarks intended to highlight risk of tax avoidance and enable more effective audits.
France transposed DAC6 on 21 October 2019, and its provisions took effect on 1 July 2020 as arrangements that occurred as of this date must be reported within 30 days as of 1 January 2021.
For arrangements that occurred between 25 June 2018 and 30 June 2020, the reporting obligation deadline is on 28 February 2021.
## ATAD 3
The European Commission unveiled on 22 December 2021 a draft directive for preventing the misuse of shell entities for tax purposes (‘ATAD 3‘ or the ’Directive‘) also known as the ’Unshell Directive‘, by making the benefit of certain tax arrangements (including DTTs) conditional on the existence of a minimum substance for companies established in the European Union. 
Concerning the scope, the draft of ATAD 3 aims at companies:
  * with a passive activity (more than 75% of their revenues during the two previous fiscal years were passive revenues)
  * with an international activity (more than 60% of their revenues from cross-border transactions during the two previous fiscal years, or a balance sheet composed of more than 60% of real estate or private use assets worth more than EUR 1 million located abroad), and
  * using subcontracting for the day-to-day management of the company or decision-making for the most important functions during the previous two fiscal years.


Companies meeting these criteria will be required to include certain information in their annual tax returns to enable the member state where they are established to verify their level of substance. It is called the annual reporting on minimal substance. In practice, the companies will have to disclose:
  * if they own or have exclusive use of premises in the member state
  * if they have at least one active bank account in the European Union, and
  * if they have at least, alternatively: 
    * one self-employed director or manager who is resident for tax purposes in the same member state as the company or in a nearby state, has decision-making powers relating to the company's business, has the autonomy to use them on a regular basis, is not employed by a third company, and is not performing a similar function for other unrelated companies, or
    * if a majority of FTE employees resides for tax purposes in the same member state as the one in which the company is established or resides in a nearby state and has the necessary skills to perform their functions.


Depending on the information provided in the tax return, the tax authorities of the member state concerned will be able to establish either (i) the presumption of a minimum substance (criteria fully met), or (ii) the company will be presumed to lack minimum substance and qualify as a shell company. If a shell company is qualified in France, the tax authorities would be entitled not to issue a tax residence certificate, or to issue a certificate stating that the entity cannot benefit from the provisions of the tax treaties or the EU Directives. However, such entity would remain subject to the French tax law.
It must be noted that the above could be amended with respect to the definitive version of the Directive to be further adopted.
On 17 January 2023, the European Parliament approved the European Commission’s draft directive as amended by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON). The amendments impact the scope (notably by adjusting the thresholds), the reporting requirements, and the penalties that may apply. The draft ATAD 3 (as amended) will now go before the Council of the EU for consideration. It may be further amended. 
This directive is expected to be definitive on 1 January 2024, having a retroactive effect from 1 January 2022.

In October 2021, 136 of the 140 members of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion Profit Shifting (BEPS), as well as the G20, signed on to a Declaration on a two-pillar solution to the tax challenges raised by the digitalisation of the economy.
Regarding Pillar 1, the Inclusive Framework is expected to prepare a Multilateral Convention by mid-2023, which could enter into force in 2024 (the timetable has been shifted by one year from the initial announcements), aiming to introduce a reform that allocates to ’market jurisdictions‘ a fraction of the global profits of ’MNEs, whether or not they locally have a physical presence. It would apply to MNEs with profitability above 10% and global turnover initially above EUR 20 billion. 
Regarding Pillar 2, a draft EU Directive (‘GloBE Directive‘) has been published in December 2022 by the EU Council, aiming to introduce an effective minimum corporate tax rate of 15% on the benefits of MNEs that fall within the scope.
The Finance Act for 2024 transposed this directive into French law. This transposition is compliant with the Pillar 2 EU Directive and instigates the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) and the Undertaxed Profit Rule (UTPR). It also allows for the creation of a qualified domestic minimum top-up tax (QDMTT). 
Currently, France also levies a tax on digital services.

## Corporate - Income determination

## Inventory valuation
Inventories must be valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost must be determined in accordance with the first in first out (FIFO) or the average-cost method. The last in first out (LIFO) method is prohibited.
## Capital gains
Capital gains generally are taxable as ordinary income and subject to CIT at the standard rate, regardless of the duration of ownership of the assets sold.
However, under restrictive conditions, a reduced rate of 10% is applied to capital gains on the disposal of patents, industrial processes connected to patents, and software. _See the section for more information._
Gains on the sale of shares in subsidiaries held for at least two years benefit from significant relief (88% of such capital gains are excluded from CIT, with the remaining 12% portion being taxed at the standard rate). In case of sale of shares of foreign subsidiaries, the French Administrative Supreme Court recently ruled that the flat add-back amount to the taxable result in application of the long-term tax regime, amounting to 12%, represented a real taxation against which tax credits can be offset due to application of the DTTs. Long-term capital losses cannot be offset against future long-term capital gains.
The long-term capital gain regime applies notably to capital gains from the disposition of shares benefiting from the parent-subsidiary regime only if the seller holds at least 5% of the voting rights in the entity whose shares are being disposed. 
The long-term capital gain regime also applies to capital gains from the disposition of shares in an entity located in a ‘non-cooperative state or territory’ (NCST), as long as the entity can demonstrate that its activities are real and it does not seek to locate profits in the NCST.
### Capital gains and losses on shares sold to a related company
Capital gains derived from the disposal of shares held in subsidiaries for less than two years are immediately taxable at the common rate of CIT.
Capital losses derived from such disposal are not immediately deductible. In such a case, the loss will be deducted if, before a period of two years (as from the date of acquisition by the purchaser):
  * the vendor stops being subject to CIT
  * the shares are, after a restructuring of the transferee company, held by a company that is not related to the vendor, or
  * the shares stop being held by the related company (notably further to a new sale).


If no event mentioned above arises within a period of two years starting from the acquisition by the vendor, the capital loss that has not been immediately deducted is treated in accordance with the long-term regime (i.e. the capital loss is therefore not deductible).
Otherwise, the vendor has to join to its corporate tax return a specific form mentioning capital losses that are not immediately deducted.
### Capital gains of non-residents
As a general rule, non-resident companies are not taxable in France regarding capital gains derived from the disposal of French assets unless these are part of a PE.
There are two main exceptions to this principle:
  * Capital gains derived from the disposal of real estate assets located in France or derived from the disposal of French real estate, and of non-listed corporations.
  * Capital gains derived from the disposal of shares held in a French company subject to CIT are subject in France to WHT in the specific case where the seller has owned, at any point in time during the five years preceding the sale, at least 25% of the rights in the profits of the French company, unless provided otherwise by the DTT applicable, if any. According to ongoing cases before the French administrative courts, the capital gains derived from the disposal of shares held for more than two years may benefit from the special exemption regime. 


Note that in the specific case where the non-resident company is located in an NCST, all capital gains derived from the disposal of French assets are subject to WHT in France at a specific rate of 75% as long as the entity can demonstrate that its activities are real and it does not seek to locate profits in the NCST.
## Dividend income
Dividends generally are taxable as ordinary income and subject to CIT at the standard rate.
_For information on the taxation of inter-company dividends, see Participation-exemption regime in the section_.
## Interest income
Interest income generally is taxable as ordinary income and subject to CIT at the standard rate.
## Royalty income
Royalties are, in principle, subject to CIT at the standard rate (plus additional social contribution if relevant).
However, a reduced CIT rate of 10% applies under restrictive conditions to royalties derived from licensing or sub-licensing of patents or copyrighted software. _See the section for more information._
## Foreign income
Resident corporations are not taxed on foreign-source income derived from activities carried out abroad through foreign branches and foreign PEs. Other foreign income is not taxable until actually repatriated to French-resident corporations. As a result, undistributed income of foreign subsidiaries is not taxable. The only exception to the territoriality principle is provided by Article 209 B of the FTC, known as the Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) rules (_see the section for more information_).

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 18 March 2024
A resident company is subject to corporate income tax (CIT) in France on its French-source income. In that respect, income attributable to foreign business activity (if there is no treaty in force between France and the relevant foreign country) or to a foreign permanent establishment (PE) (if a tax treaty applies) is excluded from the French tax basis.
A non-resident company is subject to CIT in France on income attributable to French business activity or to a French PE, as well as on income from real estate located in France.
France levies CIT as follows:
**Turnover (EUR)** | Profits (EUR) | CIT rate (%)  
---|---|---  
FY opened as of 1 January 2020 | FY opened as of 1 January 2021 | FY opened as of 1 January 2022  
< 250 million | 28 | 26.5 | 25  
> 250 million | 0 to 500,000* | 28 | 27.5  
In excess of 500,000 | 31  
* Situation of small corporations not addressed.
For financial years opened as of 1 January 2021, the reduced CIT rate of 15% that applies for small corporations on their first EUR 38,120 of taxable profits (according to the French Tax Law definition) is extended to the corporations realising a turnover up to EUR 10 million (compared to EUR 7.63 million for financial years opened before 1 January 2021).
## Social contribution tax
The social contribution tax is due by any corporation at the rate of 0.16% assessed on the revenue excluding VAT and after deduction of a EUR 19 million relief.
## Patent box regime
Under certain conditions, income derived from the sale or license of patents or patentable inventions, as well as software under restrictive conditions, is taxed at a reduced CIT.  _See the section for more information._
## Capital gains
A reduced tax rate applies to certain capital gains. _See Capital gains in the section for more information_.
## Local income taxes
No income tax is levied on income at the regional or local level.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 18 March 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is due on goods sold and services rendered in France. The standard VAT rate is 20%. Sales of certain kinds of medicines and transports of persons are subject to the 10% VAT rate. Food products, subscriptions to gas and electricity (under certain circumstances), sales of books, and products and services provided to disabled persons are subject to the 5.5% reduced VAT rate. Other specific sales and services are subject to the 2.1% VAT rate ​(such as drugs that are reimbursable by social security, press). Supplies of goods outside France and certain specific services invoiced to foreign clients are, in principle, exempt from VAT.
Business-to-business (B2B) suppliers of services are generally taxable at the location of the customer and not at the location of the supplier. For business-to-consumer (B2C) supplies of services, the place of taxation is generally where the supplier is established.
VAT applies only to taxable persons, partly taxable persons, and non-taxable legal persons that are registered for turnover taxes.
Specific VAT rules apply to leases of transportation equipment; cultural, arts, and sports services; TV, radio, electronic, and telecommunication services; and transportation of goods.
## Customs duties
Customs duties are payable when goods are imported into the European Union from a third country. They are determined on the basis of origin (preferential or non-preferential), tariff classification, and customs value. There are _ad valorem_ duties (taxes calculated by applying a percentage based on the value of the goods) or specific duties (duties based on the quantity of goods: weight, volume, number, and not the value).
Reduced or zero customs duties can be levied on the imported goods thanks to free trade agreements between the European Union and third countries.
## Excise taxes
Alcohol, tobacco, and oil products are subject to a specific regime involving complex obligations, both financial and administrative. For example, these arrangements require specific authorisations to be obtained beforehand, depending on the type of flow, notably in order to allow receiving, storing, and moving these types of products. Obligations have been introduced to ensure the traceability of products subject to excise duty. The challenge for operators is therefore to fully comply with the regulations in force in view of the civil and criminal penalties incurred in the event of mismanagement. 
## Eco-contributions (Extended Producer Responsibility or EPR)
In accordance with the polluter-pays principle, the concept of 'Extended Producer Responsibility' (EPR) provides that product manufacturers and distributors can be held responsible for managing waste throughout the life cycle of a product. The implementation of an EPR system involves the transfer of responsibility, costs, and waste management to the 'producers'. 
In France, EPR takes the form of various eco-contributions for different products categories, including electrical and electronic equipment, packaging, paper, textiles, furniture, tires, tobacco products, toys, mineral oils, etc. These eco-contributions represent a significant compliance challenge for businesses, both in terms of potential penalties and reputational impact. 
## Environmental taxes
Environmental taxation has emerged as a prominent challenge in recent years, driven by rapidly evolving societal expectations. Political initiatives aimed at promoting environmental sustainability have proliferated, placing greater emphasis on the role of economic actors in mitigating environmental impacts.
This primarily concerns energy excise duties levied on the sale or use of certain products (formerly known as Domestic Consumption Tax on Energy Products [TICPE], Domestic Consumption Tax on Electricity Supply [TICFE], Domestic Consumption Tax on Natural Gas [TICGN], and Domestic Consumption tax on coal [TICC]). It is important, however, to note that environmental taxation also encompasses various mechanisms related to natural resource protection, pollution control, and carbon emissions.
## Real estate tax
All properties located in France are subject to a 3% real estate tax. The tax is assessed annually on the fair market value of the real estate, in proportion to the direct or indirect interest held. All entities in the chain of ownership are jointly liable for the payment of the tax.
Automatic exemptions apply in three situations. First, to entities whose French real estate assets represent less than 50% of their total French assets. Second, to entities listed on a regulated market whose shares, units, or rights are significantly traded on a regular basis. Third, to entities having their registered office in France, in an EU member state, or in a country that has concluded a DTT with France providing for an administrative assistance or a non-discrimination clause, where:
  * their direct or indirect interest in the French real estate is less than either EUR 100,000 or 5% of the fair market value of the French real estate
  * they are pension funds or public charities recognised as fulfilling a national interest whose activities justify the need to own French real estate, or
  * they are non-listed French real estate funds (_société de placement à prépondérance immobilière à capital variable_ [SPPICAV] or _fonds de placement immobilier_ [FPI]) or foreign funds subject to equivalent regulations.


Where an automatic exemption does not apply, a claim may be submitted for conditional exemption upon communication or the undertaking to communicate to the French tax authorities information concerning the real estate and the shareholders. From 2021, entities subject to the French 3% real estate tax will have to submit their tax returns in a dematerialised way. This implies that foreign entities be duly registered in France.
## Territorial economic contribution
The territorial economic contribution (_Contribution Economique Territoriale_ or CET) is comprised of two different taxes: the companies’ land contribution (_Cotisation Foncière des Entreprises_ or CFE) and the companies’ added value contribution (_Cotisation sur la valeur ajoutée des entreprises_ or CVAE). Although they have a similar scope, the taxes are subject to very different rules.
The CFE tax is based on the rental value of assets that are subject to the real estate tax, excluding movable goods and equipment. For industrial plants, the taxable base is reduced by 30%. There is a specific rental value for each town and an upgrading ratio is set forth at the national level each year.
The CVAE is based on a company’s added value. Only taxpayers that are not exempt from the CFE and whose turnover is greater than EUR 152,500 are subject to CVAE. However, tax relief equal to the amount of the tax is provided for companies whose turnover is below EUR 500,000. The tax rate for companies whose turnover ranges from EUR 500,000 to EUR 50 million is assessed according to a progressive scale. The Finance Bill for 2023 provides for the repeal of the CVAE over a two-year period. Whereas the Finance Act for 2023 provided for the abolition of the CVAE in 2024, the Finance Act for 2024 postpones the abolition of the CVAE to 2027.
In parallel with the abolition of the CVAE, the rate of the cap on CET according to value added, currently set at 2%, will be lowered as follows: 
2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 | 2026  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
CET cap  | 2% | 2% | 1.625% | 1.531% | 1.438% | 1.344%  
There is an upper ceiling on the added value that applies to the CET. As a consequence, tax relief applies and is equal to the excess of the sum of CFE and CVAE over 2% of the added value of the company as of 2021 (instead of 3% previously).
## Registration duties
Registrations duties mentioned hereafter are imposed on the purchaser. However, the seller may be liable for these duties in case of non-settlement by the purchaser.
### Transfer of goodwill
The transfer of goodwill is subject to a registration duty at a rate of 3% on the part of the transfer price amounting from EUR 23,000 to EUR 200,000 and at a rate of 5% on the part exceeding EUR 200,000.
### Transfers of shares
The transfer of shares is subject to registration duty at a rate of 0.1% with no cap. The transfer of listed shares recorded by a deed is subject to registration duty at a rate of 0.1%.
#### Transfer of interest or quotas in legal entities whose capital is not divided into shares
The transfer of interests or quotas in legal entities whose capital is not divided into shares (e.g. _Société à responsabilité limitée_ [SARLs] or _Société en nom collectif_ [SNCs], which are a form of private limited liability corporate entity) is subject to a registration duty of 3% with no cap.
#### Transfer of shares in non-quoted real estate companies
The transfer of shares in non-quoted companies whose assets consist principally of immovable property (or rights related to such immovable property) is subject to a registration duty of 5% with no cap.
### Transfer of real estate
The sale of land and buildings is subject to registration duty at a rate of 5.80% on the transfer price, including expenses.
### Exemptions
Several exemptions are added to the list of the transactions that are not subject to transfer duties:
  * Transactions subject to the FTT.
  * Repurchase by companies of their own shares intended to be sold to the subscribers of a company employee saving plan, with some exceptions.
  * Transactions between companies in the same group within the meaning of Article L233-3 of the French Commercial Code.
  * Transfer of ownership resulting from a merger, a contribution, or a spin-off made under the provisions of Article 210 A and 210 B of the FTC and acquisition shares of a company by its employees.


## Exit tax rules in case of transfer of French head office or establishment
In the case of a transfer of assets outside France as part of a transfer of a head office or an establishment, unrealised gains are immediately taxable. However, in the case of a transfer to an EU member state or, under certain conditions, to an EEA member state, taxpayers are able to either pay the full amount of tax immediately or pay it over five years in five equal instalments.
## Payroll tax
Companies that are not liable for VAT on at least 90% of their annual turnover are subject to payroll tax (_taxe sur les salaries_) regarding salaries paid during the following calendar year. Companies below the 90% threshold trigger are liable for the payroll tax on the complement of their VAT recovery ratio, called the counter VAT recovery ratio.
The standard rate of the payroll tax is 4.25%, but increased rates apply to gross individual wages that exceed certain thresholds. Those increased rates are:
  * 8.5% for wages ranging from EUR 8,020 to EUR 16,013.
  * 13.6% for wages in excess of EUR 16,013.


## French social security contributions
The French social security system is composed of various schemes providing a wide range of benefits. This system includes social security basic coverage, unemployment benefits, compulsory complementary retirement plans, complementary death/disability coverage, and complementary health coverage.
The contributions are shared between employer and employee; on average the employer's share of contributions represents 45% of the gross salary. For 2022, the employee’s share of French social contributions represents approximately 20% to 23% of the remuneration. However, since the contributions are assessed using various ceilings, the average rate will decrease as the gross salary increases.
Employers' contributions made to additional medical coverage schemes (which are mandatory and collective) are taxable.
Generally, for any employee who carries out a salaried activity in France, the employer withholds the employer's and employee's share of French social security charges.
## Financial transaction tax (FTT)
FTT applies to acquisitions for consideration of equity securities or similar securities in the meaning of the French Monetary and Financial Code issued by certain French-listed companies (i.e. financial instruments giving access to capital or to voting rights in the company and securities issued under foreign law representing French-eligible securities). FTT applies regardless of whether the transaction is executed inside or outside of France.
The tax is due by the investment service provider (ISP) that has executed the purchase order or, when there is no ISP, by the custodian, irrespective of its place of establishment.
In most cases, the central securities depositary will be in charge of centralising the collection of the tax, the reporting to the French tax authorities, and the payment of the tax to the French Treasury.
The tax is computed based on the acquisition price of the shares.
The FTT rate is equal to 0.3% for acquisitions made on or after 1 January 2017.
## Digital services tax 
As of 1 January 2019, a 3% digital tax applies to companies providing certain digital services in France with global annual revenue in excess of EUR 750 million and annual revenue in France in excess of EUR 25 million. The tax applies, in particular, to the provision of a digital interface by means of electronic communications allowing a user to contact and interact with other users, as well as services to advertisers or their agents aimed at placing targeted advertising messages on the digital interface based on the interface user's data collected or generated through the case of such interface.
