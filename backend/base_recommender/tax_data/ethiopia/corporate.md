## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
## **Economic liberalisation**
In September 2020, the government gazetted Investment Regulation (IR) 2020, which, among other amendments, allowed foreigners to invest in areas or sectors that were previously restricted to the government or domestic investors. One of the key sectors that was open for foreigners through IR 2020 was the telecommunications sector.
IR 2020 also opened other sectors where foreign investors are now allowed to invest jointly with the government or domestic investors, some of which are as follows:
  * Jointly with the government: international air transport services, bus rapid transit, import and export of electrical energy, etc.
  * Jointly with domestic investors: freight forwarding and shipping agency, accounting and auditing, advertisement and promotion services, etc.


For the investments allowed jointly with domestic investors, the foreigner investor is not allowed to hold more than 49% of the share capital.
Further, the Council of Ministers approved a policy that aims at opening up the banking and telecommunication sectors to foreign investors.
In April 2024, the Ethiopian Investment Board issued a new directive to further regulate foreign investors’ participation in restricted export, import, wholesale, and retail trade. This new directive introduced significant changes to the previous regulations. 
Under the new directive, the retail and import sectors are now open to foreign investors, with the exception of fertilizer and petroleum. The export trade of raw coffee, khat, oilseeds, pulses, hides and skins, forest products, poultry, and livestock purchased from the market, as well as the wholesale of products, are now included in the sectors open to a broader scope of foreign investors.
The introduction of this new directive demonstrates Ethiopia’s renewed emphasis on enhancing the nation’s productivity and competitive stance in the global market.
## **Introduction of social welfare levy**
The Council of Ministers approved a regulation to introduce social welfare levy on imported goods. The levy is earmarked for the rehabilitation and construction of education, training, and medical facilities and expansion of other social services. The levy will be at the rate of 3%.

## Taxable period
The tax period of a person (body) is the accounting year and is the 12-months period ending on the date of the annual financial statements. A person can change the tax period upon seeking approval from the MoR in writing.
The normal taxable period runs from 8 July to 7 July of the following year. However, a different tax period can be allowed, and the base will be computed differently.
## Tax returns
Resident companies and PEs of non-resident companies must file a self-assessment tax return annually. The return is accompanied by a tax computation and financial statements, amongst other schedules. The return is due on the last day of the fourth month after the end of the tax year period. Before accepting the tax return, the MoR undertakes a desk review, after which they may request additional information/clarifications.
## Payment of tax
Payment for CIT should be made on or before the last day of the fourth month after the year-end.
## Tax audit process
Large taxpayers are selected for audit on a regular basis. The MoR tends to audit two tax periods, but this can be extended. Most audits are carried out onsite. In some instances, the MoR may conduct a desk audit of the taxpayer's tax affairs where they note discrepancies on tax returns filed by the taxpayer, anomalies with turnover, or any other situations that justify an audit.
## Statute of limitations
Under the Tax Administration Proclamation, a taxpayer is required to retain documents for the longer of the record keeping period specified in the Commercial Code of Ethiopia (CCE) or five years from the date the tax declaration for the tax period was filed with the MoR. According to the CCE, company documents and books must be maintained for ten years. An entity can request the MoR to audit and issue clearance letters at any time.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
Under the local tax legislation, a resident for tax purposes is a body incorporated in Ethiopia. A resident also includes a body incorporated overseas that has a place of effective management in Ethiopia at any time during the tax period.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
A business carried out wholly or partly through a fixed place of business or an exploration/extraction of mineral resources (a mine, oil or gas well, etc.) will give rise to a PE in Ethiopia. The definition of PE in the local tax legislation also includes a service PE and dependent agent PE concepts.
A service PE arises through furnishing of services by a person through employees or any other personnel engaged by the person where the activities on the same project or connected projects continue for more than 183 days in a one-year period. On the other hand, a dependent agent that habitually concludes contracts on behalf of a person triggers a PE.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
Subject to certain conditions, business expenses are generally deductible to the extent they are incurred for the purpose of earning, securing, and maintaining business income.
## Depreciation and amortisation
The depreciation rates range between 5% to 30% depending on the type of the asset. A taxpayer can use either a straight-line or diminishing value basis on most of the business assets, and the taxpayer is required to apply the same method of depreciation used in its financial accounts. However, some assets, such as business intangibles and buildings/structure improvements, are required to be depreciated on a straight-line method only.
The tax depreciation rates are as follows:
Capital assets | Depreciation rate (%)  
---|---  
Straight-line | Diminishing value  
Buildings and structural improvements | 5 | N/A  
Computers, software, and data storage equipment | 20 | 25   
Greenhouses | 10 | N/A  
Depreciable assets used in mining and petroleum operations | 25 | 30  
Any other depreciable asset | 15 | 20  
## Start-up expenses
Pre-operational expenses that provide benefit or advantage for more than one year fall under the meaning of business intangibles and qualify for tax depreciation at the rate of 25% on a straight-line basis.
## Interest expenses
The domestic tax law prohibits deduction of interest expense where the rate of interest exceeds the rate used between the National Bank of Ethiopia (the Central Bank) and the commercial banks by two percentage points. This restriction does not apply if the funds are borrowed from financial institutions recognised by the National Bank of Ethiopia or foreign banks permitted to lend to enterprises in Ethiopia.
Ethiopia also has thin capitalisation rules (_see the_ _section_). 
## Bad debt
Identifiable bad debts are allowed if the company has taken all reasonably necessary steps (including legal action) to recover the debts without success.
## Charitable contributions
Donations are deductible where the donations are made to Ethiopian charities and Ethiopia societies or where the donations are made in response to a call for development or an emergency issue by the government to defend the sovereignty and integrity of the country or provide relief in case of manmade or natural disasters.
## Fines and penalties
A fine or penalty imposed, or punitive damages awarded, for violation of any law or regulation or contract is not deductible.
## Net operating losses
Generally, tax loss incurred in a given year of income can be carried forward to the following tax year. If the loss is not fully utilised in the second year, the amount is carried forward to the subsequent years, up to a maximum of five years from the year the loss was incurred.
However, if there has been any two years that a person has incurred a loss and each of those losses have been carried forward, the person is not permitted to carry forward any further losses.
The tax law allows tax losses accumulated during tax holiday periods to be carried forward for half of the tax holiday period post expiry of the tax holiday.


# Ethiopia
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
There are no group taxation consolidation rules in Ethiopia.
## Transfer pricing
Ethiopia has transfer pricing provisions and rules that regulate dealings between related parties. The rules require taxpayers to have transfer pricing documentation in place at the time of filing the annual CIT return.
The rules largely follow Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines and apply to both resident and non-resident related parties. The Ethiopian transfer pricing rules require transactions between related parties to be at arm’s length.
## Thin capitalisation
Ethiopia has thin capitalisation rules that apply where a foreign-controlled resident entity (entity where 50% or more of the membership interest is held by a non-resident person alone or together with other related person(s)) has an average debt-to-average-equity ratio in excess of 2:1 for a tax year.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Ethiopia has no specialised rules regarding CFCs.


# Ethiopia
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
Generally, taxation of a branch is similar to that of a resident company (i.e. CIT rate of 30% and withholding tax [WHT] on profits repatriation of 10%).

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
## Tax holiday regime
Ethiopia has a tax holiday regime in relation to CIT that applies to most of the sectors. Under the regime, an investor who establishes a new business is entitled to income tax exemption for a period of one to six years depending on the sector and the location where the investment is situated.
Further, if the investment is made in areas classified as areas with very low infrastructure development through a Directive issued by the Minister of Finance, the investor is entitled to a 30% income tax deduction for three consecutive years after the tax holiday period.
## Foreign tax credit
Ethiopia allows a foreign tax credit on income generated from business activities abroad by a resident taxpayer. The income tax payable is offset against the foreign tax paid on that income. However, the foreign tax credit is limited to the amount of tax that would be applicable on that income in Ethiopia.
The credit is allowed where it is supported by appropriate evidence, such as a tax declaration, a WHT certificate, or any other similar acceptable document.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
Generally, payments for supply of goods (worth ETB 10,000 or more) and provision of services (worth ETB 3,000 or more) to a resident person are subject to WHT at the rate of 2%.
The 2% WHT applies if the supplier provides a valid tax identification number (TIN) and a business licence. If the TIN and the licence are not provided at the time of making the payment, the payer is required to subject the payment to a 30% WHT rate.
On other qualifying payments, WHT is levied at varying rates on a range of payments to residents and non-residents. Resident WHT is a final tax or creditable against CIT.
**Payments** | **Resident WHT rate (%)** | Non-re**sident WHT rate (%)**  
---|---|---  
Dividend | 10 | 10  
Repatriation of profits by PE | 10  
Undistributed profits | 10 | 10  
Royalties | 5 | 5  
Management fees | 2 | 15  
Technical fees | 2 | 15  
Interest: | 10  
Savings deposit with financial institution | 5 | 5  
Other | 10 | 10

  1. The 5% rate applies to interest paid on a loan granted by a bank of a contracting state, and the 10% rate applies in other cases.
  2. The 0% rate applies if the beneficial owner is the government of the other contracting state or a company 49% of the capital of which is owned by the government. The 5% rate applies in other cases.
  3. The 0% rate applies if the interest is derived by the government of the other contracting state or a company 49% of the capital of which is owned by the government or if the interest is paid on loans guaranteed by the government. The 5% rate applies in other cases.
  4. The 5% rate applies if the beneficial owner is (i) a company (other than a partnership) that is a resident of the other state and directly holds at least 10% of the capital of the payer company or (ii) a pension fund.

## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
## Exchange controls
Ethiopia used to have stringent foreign currency controls, which were regulated through Directives issued by the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) and applied to both resident and foreign companies. The Directives were used to govern the flow of foreign exchange, and, generally, all outgoing and incoming foreign currency denominated funds were regulated.
However, on 30 July 2024, the NBE announced the liberalisation of Ethiopia’s foreign currency exchange system. The NBE issued a new directive to govern all foreign currency exchange control-related issues, repealing all previously issued guidelines and directives.
With this new development, foreign currencies will now be transacted based on market rates. The NBE has lifted restrictions on foreign exchange trading, allowing banks and authorised foreign exchange dealers to buy and sell forex at freely negotiated rates as the currency floats.
## Adoption of IFRS
Ethiopia has adopted international standards for financial reporting, including International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as well as International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) for public sector entities, including not-for-profit organisations.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
Taxable income is the amount of income subject to tax after the deduction of all expenses and other deductible items allowed under the tax law. _See the general principle on deductibility of expenses in the_ _section_ _._
## Capital gains
_See Capital gains tax (CGT) in the_ _section_.
## Dividend income
Payment of dividend to a resident or non-resident person is subject to WHT at the rate of 10% of the gross amount.
## Interest income
Similar to dividend, payment of interest to a resident or non-resident is subject to 10% WHT. However, interest payment from a savings deposit with a financial institution to a resident or non-resident person is subject to 5% WHT.
## Royalty income
Royalty payments to a resident or non-resident are subject to 5% WHT.
## Foreign currency exchange gains/losses
All net gains or losses arising from transactions in foreign exchange are considered to be taxable income or deductible losses in the year in which they arise. Effective 2021, a person is allowed to either capitalise and claim tax depreciation on foreign exchange loss incurred in acquiring a capital asset or deduct realised foreign exchange loss incurred in relation to operating expenses.
Prior to 2021, taxpayers were only required to offset realised foreign exchange losses against realised foreign exchange gains as opposed to deducting the losses against the business income.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
Business income for a resident person is considered Ethiopian-source income except to the extent that it is attributable to a business conducted by the resident through a permanent establishment (PE) outside Ethiopia. For a non-resident person, business income is considered Ethiopian-source income to the extent that it is attributable to:
  * business conducted by the non-resident through a PE in Ethiopia
  * disposals in Ethiopia by the non-resident of goods of same or similar kind as those disposed by the non-resident through a PE in Ethiopia, or
  * any other business activity conducted by the non-resident through a PE in Ethiopia.


Corporate income tax (CIT) is applicable at the rate of 30% on adjusted business income (taxable income) of a person. The taxable income of a business for tax purposes is the gross income reduced by allowable expenses.
Foreign investors have the option of setting up a branch or a project office in Ethiopia. Note that project offices are normally set up to perform specific projects that are usually awarded through international bids and are limited to the life or time period of the registered contract. The CIT rate for a branch and project office is also 30%.
## Advance payment of CIT on imports
A person importing goods for commercial/business purposes is required to make advance payment of business income tax equal to 3% of the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) value of the goods.
The income tax advance is paid before the customs clearance, and the person is allowed to offset the amount paid against their CIT liability for the year. A taxpayer in a tax holiday is not required to pay the advance tax.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is a consumption tax that is charged on the supply of taxable goods or services made in Ethiopia, on the importation of taxable goods or services into Ethiopia. 
The standard VAT rate is 15% and applies to goods and services that are neither exempt from VAT nor zero-rated. The Ethiopian Proclamation 1341/2024 (“the Proclamation”) outlines Zero rated supplies under Schedule 1 of the Proclamation and Exempt supplies specified in Schedule 2. Additionally, the Proclamation also highlights exempt imports under Schedule 3. 
The major difference between taxable supplies and exempt supplies is that where the supplies are taxable, the registered person is required to charge VAT but is also eligible to recover VAT incurred on such supplies as input tax, whereas VAT incurred on making exempt supplies is not recoverable as input tax.
VAT is chargeable on:
  * a taxable supply of goods or services made by a registered person in Ethiopia;
  * the importation of taxable goods and taxable services; and
  * reverse charged supply made to a registered person, Government entity or large unregistered person.


The VAT proclamation provides that a resident entity importing a service is required to account for ‘reverse VAT’ on the services. In this case, the resident entity is required to withhold and pay reverse VAT from the payments made to the non-resident service provider.
A person who, in the course of business, has supplied or expects to supply taxable goods or services whose value is 2 million Ethiopian birr (ETB) or more in a period of 12 months should register for VAT.
A supplier of taxable goods and services is allowed to claim/deduct VAT paid (input tax) on importation or local purchase of goods and services. The claim is made through the monthly VAT returns by reducing the output VAT payable. Input tax is not allowed to be deducted unless a registered person is in possession of a valid tax invoice and uses the purchases to make taxable supplies.
Where a person supplies partly taxable and partly exempt supplies, input tax attributable to the taxable supplies is deductible in full while input tax relating to exempt supplies is not deductible.
The Proclamation introduced the requirement to account for VAT on general insurance, telecommunication services,remote services offered through an Electronic Distribution Platform and goods electronically ordered and physically delivered in Ethiopia
## Customs duty
Ethiopia follows the Harmonised Commodity and Description Coding System (HS Codes) for customs purposes.
Customs duty rates in Ethiopia range between 10% and 35% depending on the tariff classification of the goods. Customs duty is applicable on the dutiable value (CIF) at the point of importation into Ethiopia and is required to be paid by the importer of record/declarant.
Customs duty exemption on the importation of capital goods and construction materials necessary for the establishment of a new enterprise or for the expansion or upgrading of an existing enterprise may be granted subject to meeting certain conditions.
## Excise tax
Excise tax is charged on excisable goods manufactured in Ethiopia by a licensed manufacturer, excisable goods imported into Ethiopia, and excisable services supplied in Ethiopia by a licensed person. Generally, the rates of excise duty range between 5% to 500%. The 500% applies to goods such as old motor vehicles.
In Ethiopia, excise tax is chargeable on: 
  * excisable goods manufactured in Ethiopia by a licensed manufacturer; 
  * excisable goods imported into Ethiopia; and
  * excisable services supplied in Ethiopia by a licensed person. 


The time of importation for excisable goods in Ethiopia is as follows: 
  * At the time of customs clearance for goods cleared for home use directly at the port of importation or at an inland station; 
  * At the time of final clearance from a licensed warehouse for goods stored post-importation; 
  * At the time of removal for home use from an export processing zone or special economic zone; or, 
  * In any other case, at the time the goods are brought into Ethiopia. 


For excisable services, the time of supply is the earliest of the date the services are performed, the date the invoice is issued, or the date payment is received, either in whole or in part.
Ethiopia issued an excise duty directive in June 2024. The directive mandates excise stamps on goods such as alcoholic beverages, non-alcoholic drinks, and tobacco products, while exempting exports and goods in transit. It also introduces the implementation of Unique Identifiers (UIs) to track and verify the authenticity of excisable goods, ensuring each product can be traced throughout the supply chain.
## Sur-tax
All goods imported into Ethiopia (with a few exceptions) are subject to sur-tax at a rate of 10%. The tax base is the aggregate of the CIF value, customs duty, VAT, and excise duty.
## Property taxes
Property taxes were introduced in 2023, and the right to tax was given to regional states. 
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is payable on instruments such as Memorandum and Article of Association of any business, cooperative, or any other organisation, bonds, warehouse bonds, employment contracts, registration of title to property, lease (including sub-lease), and transfer of similar rights (lease), etc.
The stamp duty rates of bonds, registration of title to a property, and lease are 1%, 2%, and 0.5%, respectively, of the value. Stamp duty on the other instruments is nominal.
## Capital gains tax (CGT)
Taxable assets/properties are classified into two groups (namely ‘class A’ and ‘class B’) for CGT purposes.
Class A taxable assets relate to immovable assets, and the CGT rate is 15%. Class B taxable assets relate to shares and bonds, which attract CGT at the rate of 30%.
In relation to shares, CGT applies on gains derived from the direct transfer of shares issued by a resident company. It also applies on indirect share transfer where the gain relates to disposal of a membership interest in a body if more than 50% of the value of the interest is derived directly or indirectly through one or more interposed bodies from immovable assets located in Ethiopia.
## Payroll taxes
Employment income derived by an employee is Ethiopian-source income to the extent that it is derived in respect of employment exercised in Ethiopia wherever paid or it is paid to the employee by or on behalf of the government wherever employment is exercised.
Employers are required to withhold tax on payments to employees in respect of employment services that they have rendered. The tax is withheld through the Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) system. The tax deducted should be remitted to the Ministry of Revenue (MoR) on or before the 30th day of the month following the payroll month.
## Social security contributions
All entities are required to register with the Private Organisation Employees Social Security Agency (‘pension fund’). The employer is required to contribute 11% of the employee’s basic salary to the scheme, while the employee’s contribution is 7%.
It is mandatory for all Ethiopian citizens to contribute and optional for foreign citizens with Ethiopian origin. Foreign citizens with no Ethiopian origin are not allowed to contribute to the fund.
