## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 22 July 2024
During 2024 and in the beginning of 2025 there were little to no changes in regard to new corporate taxation. The changes mostly covered the amending of existing or implementation of already proposed regulations (such as Minimum Income Tax, Pillar 2 regulations, CIT SAF-T file). 
Also, the regulator has postponed the deadline for mandatory issuing of invoices using the National e-Invoice System (so-called KSeF) until 1 February 2026.
More changes are expected to be presented during 2025 after the assessment of impact of regulations currently in force and as a part of proposed so-called deregulation initiative.
## Changes in corporate income tax (CIT)
### Changes to CIT introduced in 2025
During 2023, the following significant amendments were introduced that impact CIT:
  * Polish minimum income tax - tax year 2024 is the first year in which the provisions on local minimum income tax apply. It is payable by taxpayers who incurred a loss from operating activities or achieved low profitability (income not exceeding 2% of the value of revenues) in FY24.
  * From 1 January 2024, the provisions on the Pillar II Directive introducing a global minimum tax came into force in many European Union countries. In Poland, the act implementing Pillar II entered into force on 1 January 2025. However, transitional provisions provide for the optional possibility of applying the provisions of this act retroactively, from 1 January 2024, based on the choice made.
  * On 1 January 2025, the regulations regarding the so-called SAF_CIT structures (JPK_CIT in Polish) came into force. These regulations impose on taxpayers the obligation to keep accounting books using computer programs and to send them to the relevant head of the tax office after the end of the tax year. The taxpayers will be obliged to send two new logical SAF structures, which reflect the CIT calculation and the fixed assets register prepared for CIT purposes. Taxpayers subject to the reporting obligation will be required to submit SAF_CIT structures for the first time for the tax/financial year starting after December 31, 2024, by the deadline for filing a CIT return. Therefore, in the case of entities whose tax year coincides with the calendar year, these files will have to be submitted to the relevant tax authority by the end of March 2026.
  * The amendment to the Commercial Companies Code entered into force on 15 September 2023 and introduced the following changes in restructuring activities, which also have effects in terms of CIT and tax ordinance:
    * A new method of division as an alternative to contribution-in-kind of a going concern while maintaining tax succession (i.e. division by separation). Such a division is tax neutral provided that the assets taken over and the assets remaining in the company constitute going concerns.
    * Simplified procedure for a zero-emission merger (i.e. without increasing the share capital [if the same partner/partners hold, directly or indirectly, all shares in the merging companies]).
    * Regulation on cross-border reorganisations (division, merger, transformation), including clarification of the provisions on tax succession and obligation to obtain the opinion of the Head of the National Tax Administration on the existence of a justified suspicion of tax avoidance or abuse of law, and confirmation that the company's financial obligations towards the authorities are satisfied or secured.


## Changes in value-added tax (VAT)
The main areas of changes in the Polish VAT system for 2025 and subsequent years will be related to digitalisation of reporting obligations (i.e. preparation of mandatory e-invoicing system). Other changes will concern VAT exemption for small enterprises or rules for determining the place of supply of virtual services. 
There are also some planned changes at the EU level (the so-called ViDA package). 
In recent years, the majority of amendments (apart from digitalisation such as introduction of Central Electronic System of Payment Information) has focused on simplifications for taxpayers (in particular, implementation of three SLIM VAT legislative packages and introduction of VAT groups).
### National e-Invoicing System 
As of 2022, the National e-Invoice System (the so-called KSeF) was launched, which enables issuance of and access to structured invoices. In the initial period, structured invoices have been introduced as one of the acceptable forms of documenting transactions, alongside paper and electronic invoices. Structured invoices as a mandatory solution arewere planned to come into force from 1 February 2026 (for taxpayers whose turnover exceeds 200 M PLN in a preceding year) or 1 April 2026 (for other taxpayers). At the same time, it is planned to introduce a 6-month transitional period (until 30 September 2026) for micro-entrepreneurs who issue single invoices up to PLN 450 and whose total sales value does not exceed PLN 10,000 per month.
Mandatory e-invoicing will apply (in principle) to all transactions that have been so far documented with invoices (including domestic supplies of goods and services made between entrepreneurs [B2B] and public authorities [B2G]).
The B2C transactions will be documented on a voluntary basis.
At the same time, it is planned to completely exclude the obligation to issue structured invoices in relation to the transactions, such as highway tickets, transportation of passengers and certain services exempt from VAT (i.e. insurance and financial services). However, the provisions that regulate this issue are still in the process of consultation.
On the other hand, the National e-Invoice System will remain optional for other foreign taxpayers who do not have a seat or a fixed establishment for VAT purposes in the territory of Poland.
_The structured invoices and National e-Invoice System are discussed in more detail in the section._
### ViDA Package (EU level)
On November 5, 2024,The Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) approved the VAT in the Digital Age (ViDA) package, in the version published on October 30, 2024. The ViDA package was the subject of intensive discussions throughout 2024, and its adoption was temporarily blocked by Estonia, which particularly expressed concerns regarding the second pillar mentioned below, i.e., the Platform Economy.
The latest ViDA package includes several compromises and new implementation dates for the various pillars compared to earlier proposals (originally published on December 8, 2022). The implementation of changes will be spread out over the coming years. The main pillars of ViDA concern:
  * Digital Reporting Requirements (DRR) and mandatory e-invoicing for B2B transactions within the EU - the implementation date is generally July 1, 2030, with the EU e-invoicing standard applying to both intra-community and domestic transactions from 2035.
  * Platform Economy - new rules may optionally be applied from July 1, 2028, with the obligation to implement them by January 1, 2030.
  * Introduction of a Single VAT registration - from July 1, 2028.


### Central Electronic System of Payment information
As of 1 January 2024, the payment service providers are required to keep electronic records of payment data for cross-border payments and to exchange these records with a newly established central EU-database, i.e. Central Electronic System of Payment information (the so-called CESOP). The purpose of the new reporting obligation is to combat VAT fraud.
Under the new reporting requirements, domestic banks, foreign bank branches, credit institutions, payment institutions, and credit unions must maintain, store, and report on cross-border payments to the Head of National Revenue Administration, when the payment service provider makes more than 25 such payments to the same payee per quarter.
Payment service providers must keep electronic records of cross-border payments for a period of three calendar years from the tax year the payment was made.
## Other changes to the tax system
**Customs duties**
  * A significant legislative update in Polish law will take effect in 2025, targeting customs transactions. This amendment aims to align with EU law, enhance the enforcement of sanctions due to the conflict in Ukraine, and address loopholes that allow sanction circumvention. Notable changes include a requirement for evidence confirming goods are not for use in Russia or Belarus, and proof of customs clearance within 45 days post-EU departure. The customs and tax authorities will have expanded powers to enforce these regulations, including the seizure of non-compliant goods.
  * Additionally, businesses should note the AIS/IMPORT PLUS system rollout has moved to May 1, 2025. This system will replace AIS/IMPORT, although no data migration is planned, requiring the completion of current operations in the existing system.
  * The European Union has intensified efforts to protect its internal market, evident from increased anti-dumping duties on imports from countries like China. Recent measures include definitive anti-dumping duties on various goods from China, Egypt, and the United States.


**Property tax**
As of January 1, 2025, businesses in Poland are affected by significant changes in property tax regulations. Key amendments redefine terms such as building, structure, construction facility, construction work, and permanent land attachment, now included in the Local Taxes and Fees Act, eliminating reliance on the Construction Law for these definitions. This may cause some properties to be categorized differently, potentially impacting tax liabilities. Additionally, the deadline for submitting the 2025 RET (Real Estate Tax) return is extended to March 31, provided certain conditions are met. However, payment deadlines for RET remain unchanged, with installments due at the end of January and on the 15th of each subsequent month.
**Implementation of DAC7 to Polish law**
As of 1 July 2024, digital platform operators in Poland must adhere to new obligations under the implementation of DAC7 Directive to domestic law, aimed at preventing tax fraud. These operators, who facilitate transactions for sellers, must report seller data and adhere to due diligence procedures concerning sellers' status and information reliability. They are required to report activities such as real estate provision, personal services, goods sales, and transport rentals to the Head of the National Revenue Administration. 
The first reporting obligation is due by 31 January 2025, covering 2023 and 2024. Subsequent reports should be submitted annually.


# Poland
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 22 July 2024
## Taxable period
The taxable period is the calendar year (between 1 January and 31 December). Companies are entitled to choose another (than calendar) fiscal year for the purpose of CIT (e.g. between 1 April and 31 March).
## Tax returns
Companies are, in general, required to file their tax returns electronically, via an online creator published by the Ministry of Finance. The annual CIT return should be submitted to the tax office within three months following the end of the tax year.
## Standard Audit File for Corporate Income Tax (SAF_CIT; known as JPK_CIT)
As of January 2025, the legislative changes in Poland regarding SAF for CIT aim to streamline the operations of tax authorities and standardize the electronic data submitted to the tax office. This means that taxpayers will be required to keep ledgers only in electronic form and to submit to the tax authorities data based on two new, separate logical structures of SAF, i.e. the accounting books (JPK_KR_PD), and the fixed assets and intangibles register (JPK_ST_KR) - jointly "JPK_CIT". The first reporting for a tax year ending December 31, 2025, will be March 31, 2026.
The logical structure JPK_KR_PD is for the most part based on the existing JPK_KR structure, which is one of the structures taxpayers must provide upon the request of the tax authority. However, the new reporting elements, mandatory for selected taxpayers already in the first year of new regulations’ validity, will include among others: tax tags identifying ledger accounts. This means that income statement accounts must be marked for tax purposes as e.g. tax deductible expenses or non-deductible expenses, taxable or non-taxable income.
The JPK_ST_KR is a new logical structure designed to disclose data confirming the acquisition, production, or deletion from the records of a fixed asset or intangible asset, effectively containing the same content as the regular tax register of fixed assets and intangibles.
The obligation to submit the Standard Audit File for CIT (JPK_CIT) will apply: 
  * starting from the tax year beginning after January 1, 2025 - to CIT taxpayers whose revenue in the previous tax year exceeded 50 million euros or entities that are part of tax capital groups;
  * starting from the tax year beginning after January 1, 2026 - to all CIT taxpayers required to submit SAF_VAT (JPK_V7) files; 
  * starting from the tax year beginning after January 1, 2027 - to all remaining CIT taxpayers in Poland.


However, based on the Regulation of the Ministry of Finance of December 13, 2024, the obligation to submit JPK_ST_KR for the first group (i.e. the large taxpayers and tax capital groups) is postponed by one year i.e. the regulation will be in force from January 1, 2026
## Payment of tax
The same deadline as the CIT return applies to the settlement of the annual CIT liability. In financial terms, the final settlement is not significant since most of the annual liability is paid by CIT advances throughout the tax year.
The CIT advances should be paid for each month by the 20th day of the following month. Entities that started business activities (except for companies organised as a result of certain transformations) and entities whose gross sales revenue (including VAT) in the prior tax year did not exceed EUR 2 million are entitled to opt to make advance settlements on a quarterly basis (instead of a monthly basis).
From 5 October 2023, the interest rate for late payment is 14.5% _per annum_ (previously, 15%).
### Individual tax account numbers
Each PIT, CIT, and VAT payer or remitter should transfer all of their Polish tax liabilities to a given tax office’s bank account using an individual tax account (‘tax micro-account’) identifying a given taxpayer or tax remitter. The tax micro-account may be checked using the generator or at any tax office.
Generating an individual tax account is not possible without the appropriate tax identification number. Taxpayers waiting for a decision on granting the tax identification number (NIP) pay the amount due to the tax micro-account of a competent tax office.
## Tax audit process
The tax authorities generally shall notify its intention to initiate a tax audit. The inspection shall be initiated not earlier than after seven days and not later than 30 days from the receipt of the notice.
The duration of all audits in one calendar year may not exceed the following:
  * For micro entrepreneurs: 12 working days.
  * For small entrepreneurs: 18 working days.
  * For medium entrepreneurs: 24 working days.
  * For large entrepreneurs: 48 working days.


The rules mentioned above do not apply to the inspection commenced by the customs and revenue office. This kind of tax inspection is initiated without issuing a notification and in practice there is a possibility to prolong the inspection without any specific time limits.
## Statute of limitations
Tax liability expires five years after the end of the calendar year in which the tax payment deadline passed. There are also situations when the statute of limitations can be suspended or interrupted (e.g. litigation).
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
In recent years we observe that the most inspections concern VAT, regarding frauds and validity of the VAT refund. The focus of the tax audit authorities is also directed on transactions between related parties (transfer pricing issues), WHTs, as well as new discounts and preferences in CIT. Also, the focus remains on tax schemes (MDR) and PIT (concerning selfemployment scheme).
According to data provided by the Ministry of Finance for 2023, there were 9,051 customs-tax audits initiated, which represents a 117.4% increase compared to the previous year, when there were 4,163 such audits. The Ministry's data also indicates that 7,186 customs-tax audits were completed, marking a 78.2% increase from the previous year. Of the audits concluded in 2023, 6,660 included findings, accounting for 92.7% of all completed audits, compared to 91.5% in the previous year
## Binding rulings and APAs
General binding rulings are issued by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) in order to ensure the uniform application of tax law by tax authorities.
Individual binding rulings are issued at a taxpayer’s request in individual cases. A ruling should be provided in three months and is subject to the payment of a fee (immaterial amount). If no decision is taken within the deadline established, there is a tacit approval of the taxpayer's understanding of the tax matter.
The individual tax ruling provides protection only to the entity that requested the ruling. However, if the same factual state or future event applies to two or more taxpayers (e.g. parties to the same transaction), they may submit a joint application for an individual tax ruling. 
The ruling is not binding for the tax authorities (e.g. tax offices and fiscal control offices) from the formal point of view. Nevertheless, according to the law, compliance with the interpretation should not lead to any harm to the taxpayer (i.e. if the taxpayer follows the ruling, they should not be required to pay any penalty interest or be subject to fiscal-penal responsibility even if the tax authorities do not agree with the ruling in their proceedings). 
In case of rulings covering future events (e.g. rulings obtained prior to closing of a given transaction), the taxpayer should also be protected not just against interest and penal fiscal liability, but also against the base tax liability.
Entities performing related-party transactions may also apply to the Head of NFA for APAs available under certain conditions (_for more details, see Transfer pricing in the section_).
## Cooperation agreement
The entrepreneur being a party to the cooperation agreement will have the opportunity to discuss with the Head of the National Fiscal Administration important issues related to the tax settlements. Such arrangements may concern, among others:
  * Interpretation of tax laws and the content of tax rulings.
  * Transfer pricing rules.
  * The amount of advance income tax.
  * Non-applicability of the general anti-avoidance rule.


The cooperation agreement may provide the taxpayer with benefits such as reduction (by half) of the fees for an APA and for a security opinion, as well as reduction (or, in some cases, even the lack) of interest on tax arrears. The cooperation agreement may also protect an entrepreneur against additional tax liability and the tax audit. Moreover, the custom and fiscal control of a taxpayer who is a party to the cooperation agreement will be carried out only by the Head of the National Fiscal Administration.
PwC actively participated in the expert support of the first taxpayer to conclude the cooperation agreement with the Head of the NFA in March 2022. By the end of 2023, the list of taxpayers who joined the program amounted to 11 entities.
## Investment Agreement
The 'Investment Agreement', an agreement concluded between an investor and the tax authority regarding the tax consequences of a planned investment in Poland.
This is a new solution aimed at protecting the investor from the negative tax consequences in a wider scope than individual tax rulings do. It also encourages the investor to enter the 'cooperation agreement' after the investment is made.
This agreement is concluded between the Ministry of Finance and the investor, i.e. an entity that plans or has started an investment on the territory of Poland with a value of at least PLN 50 million (PLN 100 million before 2025). Although Investment Agreement is addressed primarily to foreign entities planning to start a new business Polish residents are not excluded from benefiting from these regulations.
The regulations indicate two types of fees that investors will have to pay in order to enter into an agreement: an initial fee and a main fee. The initial fee, which is the payment for the application, is to amount to PLN 50,000 (from each investor filing in the application). The conclusion of an Investment Agreement is to be subject to a main fee in a range of PLN 100,000 to PLN 500,000. The amount of the fee will depend on, among other things, the declared value of the investment and its complexity.
An Investment Agreement is to be equivalent to the following administrative acts:
  * advance pricing agreement (unilateral only).
  * GAAR ruling
  * Binding Excise Information
  * Binding Rate Information
  * individual tax ruling
  * and top-up taxation ruling based on Global Minimum Tax rules.


The agreement may cover all or some of the above acts. It is valid for five years from the date of issue. It is possible to renegotiate its contents, resulting in changes to the agreement, including extending its duration.
Based on data published by the Ministry of Finance, no investment agreement has been concluded by the end of 2023.
## Obligation to prepare and publish information on the execution of tax strategy
The obligation to prepare and publish information on the execution of tax strategy applies to taxpayers whose revenues exceeded EUR 50 million in a tax year and tax capital groups.
Taxpayers shall prepare and disclose information on, _inter alia_ ,:
  * the approach to processes and procedures on managing obligations arising from tax regulations and ensuring their proper execution
  * the number of submitted reports on tax schemes (under mandatory disclosure rules [MDR]), separately for each tax, and
  * transactions with related entities, the value of which exceeds 5% of the total assets on the balance sheet (based on the Statutory Financial Statements).


The taxpayer publishes information about the implemented tax strategy in Polish on its website and electronically informs the head of the competent tax office about the address of the website on which it is published by the end of the 12th month following the end of the tax year to which the report relates.
## Reporting obligations of real estate companies
If a given entity is classified as a ’real estate company‘ in line with the specific definition provided by Polish CIT Law, this may translate into the following obligations:
  * New mechanism of capital gains tax collection upon the sale of shares in such company by non-residents.
  * Annual obligation to disclose the group structure to the tax authorities. 
  * Automatic publication of certain basic tax data by the authorities (on an annual basis).


However, please note that the specific definition of a real estate company under the Polish CIT Law should not be confused with the concept of so-called ’land-rich company‘ (often used interchangeably with ’property-rich company‘ or ’real estate-rich company‘), which, under the domestic legislation, would be any company (and other entities) whose assets comprise, directly or indirectly, of real estate located in Poland of at least 50% (also DTTs provide for a similar concept, but the definitions may differ to some extent).
A real estate company should be understood as an entity in which:
  * at least 50% of the balance sheet total value of assets consisted, directly or indirectly, of the carrying amount of real estate located in Poland or rights to such real estate (or, in case of entities commencing their activity, at least 50% of the market value of assets consisted, directly or indirectly, of the market value of real estate located in Poland or rights to such real estate)
  * the respective fair market/book value of the real estate exceed PLN 10 million, and
  * in the previous tax year, the company obtained at least 60% of taxable revenues from (sub)rental, (sub)lease, agreements of a similar nature, or from ownership rights relating to real estate/other real estate companies (unless it is an entity commencing its activity).


## Specialisation of tax offices
1st Mazowiecki Tax Office in Warsaw is responsible for the largest taxpayers, including:
  * Legal entities or organisational entities without legal personality whose net income from the sale of goods, products, and services in the tax year exceed EUR 50 million (excluding civil law partnerships).
  * Capital tax group and companies forming part of the group.
  * Public companies with headquarters in Poland.


There are also 19 specialised tax offices, which are responsible for the following taxpayers:
  * Legal entities or organisational entities without legal personality whose net income from the sale of goods, products, and services in the tax year amounts to EUR 3 million to EUR 50 million (excluding civil law partnerships).
  * Foreign entrepreneurs whose net income from the sale of goods, products and services in the tax year amounts to at least EUR 3 million.
  * Branch or representation of foreign entrepreneurs.


Additionally, 2nd Mazowiecki Tax Office in Warsaw is the dedicated tax office for investment and pension funds and for foreign entrepreneurs (net income exceeding EUR 3 million) who have a fixed establishment in more than one territorial jurisdiction of the specialised tax offices. 
Tax Office in Lublin is responsible for WHT proceedings.
## General anti-abuse rule (GAAR)
In line with the GAAR, legal transactions with the main purpose of obtaining a tax advantage contrary to the tax regulations shall not result in tax benefit. Tax consequences of such transactions will be assessed as if an alternative 'appropriate' transaction had taken place. Furthermore, if transactions carried out by a taxpayer do not have any real economic or business rationale other than tax avoidance, tax authorities may completely disregard them.
The GAAR is applicable to the tax benefits received after the amendments were introduced (i.e. 15 July 2016). This means that the sole fact that the transaction was carried out before the amendments entered into force may not exclude application of the regulations in case the taxpayer obtains a tax benefit after the GAAR is introduced.
As of 1 January 2019, there is a penalty payment in the form of an additional liability of 40% (or 10%) of the tax liability resulting from the application of the clause. Penalty payment also covers application of other anti-abuse clauses, transfer pricing settlements, and cases where the WHT payer issued an incorrect statement and did not make the required verification with reference to the WHT rate. The 10% rate may apply to income taxes where income constitutes the tax base.
The above penalty payment rate may be doubled in the case of tax benefits exceeding PLN 15 million, where the taxpayer has previously received a final decision on the basis of anti-abuse provisions, or in the absence of transfer pricing documentation. In certain circumstances, the above rates may also be reduced by half.
The applicability of the GAAR clause has been also extended to remitters. A number of detailed changes in the application of the GAAR clause have been introduced, including proceedings for issuing of a protective opinion by the Head of National Fiscal Administration (NFA). The protective opinion is issued if the circumstances presented in the application indicate that the tax benefit described in the motion is not subject to the GAAR. In case of the motions for issuance of the protective opinions, the Head of NFA analyses the case more deeply than in case of individual tax rulings (e.g. tax ruling fully relies on the descriptions of the backgrounds presented by the taxpayers).
The Polish Tax Law also contains: (i) other specific anti-abuse/anti-avoidance provisions dedicated to certain transactions/events (e.g. anti-abuse provisions in the CIT Law covering certain types of transactions/distributions, such as mergers, dividend payments, interest payments, or share-for-share exchanges); (ii) ’exit tax‘; (iii) anti-abuse provisions included in the VAT Law; and (iv) MDR.
## Central Electronic System of Payment information
As of 1 January 2024, payment service providers are required to keep electronic records of payment data for cross-border payments and to exchange these records with a newly established central EU-database, i.e. Central Electronic System of Payment information (the so-called CESOP). The purpose of the new reporting obligation is to combat VAT fraud.
Under the new reporting requirements, domestic banks, foreign bank branches, credit institutions, payment institutions, and credit unions must maintain, store, and report on cross-border payments to the Head of National Revenue Administration when the payment service provider makes more than 25 such payments to the same payee per quarter.
Payment service providers must keep electronic records of cross-border payments for a period of three calendar years from the tax year the payment was made.
Data collected at national level are transmitted quarterly to the CESOP. The first reports were sent by the service providers to the competent authorities by 30 April 2024. Each submission of reports by the Polish administration to the central register takes place for a quarterly period by the 10th day of the second month following the end of the quarter to which the information relates.
## Opinions on the cross-border reorganisations
An amendment to the Commercial Companies Code was introduced in 2023, bringing significant changes to regulations regarding domestic and cross-border reorganisations and their implications under tax law.
A new obligation mandates obtaining a prior opinion from the Head of the National Fiscal Administration for any cross-border transformation, merger, and division on whether: 
  * the reorganisation carried out does not constitute tax avoidance within the meaning of the GAAR clause or abuse of law, and 
  * the company's public financial liabilities are satisfied or secured.


An application for an opinion should be submitted as part of an application to the registry court. As a rule, the Head of the NFA should issue an opinion within one month from the date of submitting the application, with the possibility of extending the deadline by a maximum of three months. Issuance of the opinion may be refused, among others, in the event of a justified assumption that the transaction is of an abusive nature or the public receivables will not be settled/secured. A negative decision may be appealed to an administrative court.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 22 July 2024
A company is considered to be a resident in Poland if its registered office or management is located in Poland.
As of 1 January 2022, it is understood that the taxpayer has a management board in the territory of Poland, _inter alia_ , when in the territory of Poland current activities of that taxpayer are conducted in an organised and continuous manner, in particular on the basis of: an agreement, decision, court judgment or other document regulating the establishment or functioning of this taxpayer, or granted powers of attorney, or connections between related entities.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
### PE under Polish CIT law
According to the Polish CIT Act, definition of 'permanent establishment' covers:
  * a fixed place of business through which the entity, whose seat or management office is on the territory of one state, pursues its activities, in whole or in part, within the territory of another state, in particular a branch, agency, office, factory, workshop, or place of extraction of natural resources (fixed place of business concept)
  * a construction site, construction, assembly, or installation work carried on within the territory of one state by the subject, whose seat or management office is on the territory of another state (construction site concept), and
  * a person who, on behalf and for the benefit of a subject, whose seat or management office is on the territory of one state, operates on the territory of another state, provided such person holds and exercises a power of attorney to enter into contracts on its behalf (dependent agent concept),


unless a relevant DTT to which Poland is a party provides otherwise.
Note that Polish CIT law:
  * does not encompass any provisions concerning the period required for construction works to create a PE
  * does not include provisions indicating that an independent agent does not create a PE, and
  * does not include provisions indicating that actions of an auxiliary or preparatory character do not lead to creation of a PE in Poland.


The above-mentioned standard PE existence triggers should be interpreted taking into account wording of a specific DTT, the provisions of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Commentary, and international practice.
### PE from a DTT perspective
In general, the provisions of DTTs concluded by Poland are based on the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital (OECD Model), except for provisions related to taxation of royalties, which are based on the United Nations (UN) Model Double Taxation Convention.
Under standard DTTs based on the OECD Model, PE in Poland may be triggered by a foreign entity having:
  * a fixed place of business through which the business of the enterprise is wholly or partially carried on
  * a dependent agent, or
  * a building site, construction, assembly, or installation, or a supervisory or consultancy activity connected therewith.


Note that some DTTs concluded by Poland also encompass other PE concepts (e.g. service PE concept or offshore PE concept).


# Poland
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 22 July 2024
Generally, a tax-deductible cost is defined as a cost incurred for the purposes of deriving revenues, as well as for the purpose of securing or preserving a source of revenue. Based on common practice, in order to determine tax deductibility of the expense, it must be incurred by the taxpayer, be definitive, be related to the taxpayer’s business activity, be properly documented, and not specifically excluded from deduction (by means of limitation, likewise interest, or being listed as non-deductible). 
In addition, the expense must be paid by a bank transfer, in particular included on a white list of taxpayers in case of a payment to a VAT payer and/or paid without the split payment mechanism if indicated on the invoice (_for more details, see comments on the 'White list of VAT payers’ and ‘Split payment system in VAT settlements’ in the section_). Obligation to settle expenses with use of bank accounts is applicable to B2B transactions exceeding a value of PLN 15,000 (gross). Expenses paid in violation of these rules cannot be treated as tax deductible costs.
As a rule, the CIT Act divides tax-deductible costs into:
  * costs directly related to taxable revenues (‘direct’ costs), which generally should be recognised in the tax year in which their corresponding revenues are achieved, and
  * other (‘indirect’) costs (e.g. management costs, media, advertising), recognised at the moment when incurred, or spread over time in case of costs relating to a period exceeding the tax year.


There are few groups of expenses defined as non-deductible, i.e.:
  * Expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of fixed and intangible assets that are subject to tax depreciation; a one-off write-down for fixed assets of small value is possible for assets worth up to PLN 10,000.
  * Expenses deducted only at the moment of payment (e.g. interest).
  * Expenses deducted only at the time of disposal of the rights to which they relate (e.g. shares or land).
  * Expenses included on a list of items that are not deductible for tax purposes, even if the items meet the general conditions described above. This list contains over 60 items, including, among others, the following: 
    * Written-off, lapsed accounts receivable.
    * Entertainment costs.
    * Accrued but unpaid interest.
    * Accounting and comparable provisions.
    * Tax penalties and penalty interest.
    * Donations.
    * A portion of the insurance premium paid on a passenger car (i.e. the portion calculated on the excess of the car value over EUR 35,000).
    * A portion of the depreciation write-offs made on a passenger car (i.e. the portion calculated on the excess of the car value over EUR 35,000, or EUR 54,000 in case of a passenger car that is an electric vehicle).


## Depreciation
Expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of fixed assets and intangible assets (e.g. licences, trademarks, know-how) are not directly deductible. Instead, the acquired assets are subject to depreciation. If such assets are sold, a business is entitled to deduct the net value (cost of acquisition reduced by the overall value of the tax depreciation allowances made). 
Depreciation write-offs are treated as tax-deductible costs. Generally, depreciation allowances are calculated based on the straight-line method and the maximum annual rates provided in the CIT law. If this is the case, a taxpayer deducts equal annual write-offs, calculated by multiplying the maximum rate of depreciation by the asset’s initial value until the total value of write-offs equals the initial value (typically, the initial value equals the purchase price/manufacturing cost).
Standard depreciation rates can be decreased (and increased back up to the standard rate) at the beginning of each tax year. Taxpayers can rather freely decrease depreciation rates according to their needs. 
For certain categories of machinery and vehicles (but not passenger cars), the reducing-balance depreciation method may be applied. Under this method, the tax depreciation may be accelerated during the initial period of the asset’s use by multiplying the statutory maximum rate by two. The rate is then applied to the net value of fixed assets (i.e. initial value reduced by earlier annual write-offs). The reducing-balance method is applied until the annual depreciation write-off equals the hypothetical write-off that would be made under the straight-line method. From this point, the depreciation allowance is taken based on the straight-line method for its remaining useful life.
The main categories of assets and the related statutory annual tax depreciation rate are as follows:
Assets | Depreciation rate (%)  
---|---  
Various buildings and constructions | 2.5 to 10  
Machinery and equipment (general) | 7 to 20  
Machinery for road building and construction | 18 to 20  
Machinery for paper industry | 14  
Office equipment | 20  
Computers | 30  
Apart from the above, the Polish CIT law includes provisions for accelerated depreciation (within specified limits) for assets used in deteriorated conditions and for second-hand assets.
In addition, from 1 January 2024, a new tax preference was introduced, which shortens the depreciation period of fixed assets in the form of non-residential buildings and structures from 40 years to 10 or 5 years, depending on the level of unemployment. This possibility applies to micro, small, and medium-sized entrepreneurs operating in communes with high unemployment (over 120% or 170% of the average rate) and low tax income per capita (below 100% of the average rate). These rules only apply to new investments carried out after the new regulations enter into force.
As of 2022, the tax deductibility of tax depreciation write-offs in real estate companies is limited up to the value of the accounting depreciation. In practice, this regulation may have an adverse impact on the entities whose tax depreciation write-offs are higher than the accounting ones if the entity applies the cost model. Moreover, according to the tax authorities, if a given entity measures its investment properties under the fair value model from the accounting perspective, then no tax depreciation deduction is allowed.
Moreover, tax depreciation should be specifically excluded in relation to residential buildings and apartments (irrespective of their accounting treatment).
## Goodwill
Under the provisions of CIT law, goodwill is subject to tax amortisation if it is created as a result of acquisition of an enterprise, or its organised part, made in one of the following ways: (i) purchase; (ii) payable use, provided that the user of such enterprise/organised part of an enterprise makes the depreciation write-offs; or (iii) contribution to a company based on commercialisation and privatisation regulations. The goodwill is amortised for tax purposes for a minimum period of five years.
## Start-up expenses
There are no specific provisions in the Polish CIT law relating to start-up expenses; the general rules of tax deductibility described above apply.
## Interest expenses
Generally, interest on loans is deductible on a cash basis, provided that: (i) the loan is used to earn or secure sources of taxable revenues, (ii) the loan has been provided at arm’s-length terms, (iii) deductibility is not excluded based on thin capitalisation (interest deductibility) limitations, (iv) and this interest is not specifically listed in the CIT Law as non-tax deductible (e.g. interest listed as non-deductible based on the anti-debt push down provisions or the provisions implementing the ATAD2 Directive).
### Interest limitation
As of 1 January 2018, new interest limitation rules entered into force. Previously, the amount of tax-deductible interest on intra-group loans was correlated with the level of equity. New rules introduced deductibility restrictions:
  * applicable both to internal and external financing, and
  * correlated with tax EBITDA.


Tax deductibility of ’debt financing costs‘ is disallowed to the extent in which they exceed (i) the amount of PLN 3 million or (ii) 30% of so-called ‘tax-EBITDA’ (whichever is higher). 
The amount of non-deductible interest in a given tax year may be carried forward and deducted in five subsequent years (still subject to general limitations of 30% EBITDA).
Restrictions are not applicable to financial entities (e.g. banks, credit institutions, as well as open-end and closed-end investment funds).
Starting from 1 January 2022, the costs of debt financing obtained from a related entity in the part in which they were intended, directly or indirectly, for capital transactions (in particular for acquisition or taking up of shares and acquisition of all the rights and duties in a partnership with regard to other related entities, making additional payments, increasing share capital, or repurchase of own shares for purposes of their redemption) cannot be treated as tax deductible. Restrictions are not applicable to costs of debt financing granted by a bank or a cooperative savings and credit fund having its seat in an EU member state or in another state belonging to the European Economic Area.
### Notional Interest Deduction (NID)
As of 1 January 2019, a new NID mechanism has been introduced. NID allows one to deduct from the taxable base the hypothetical costs of obtaining external capital in the case the company receives funding in the form of additional payments to capital or retained profits. The maximum limit of NID is PLN 250,000 in a tax year. This mechanism is applied from 2020.
## Bad debt
As of 1 January 2020, creditors may reduce their tax base by the value of receivables if monetary payment has not been paid or sold. After 90 days from the invoice due date as specified in the invoice or contract, the taxpayer may reduce/increase the tax base.
The reduction or increase should be shown in the tax return submitted for the tax year as well as monthly advances. Taxpayers may reduce the tax base if the liability has not been settled by the date of tax return submission. If the liability is settled in the following tax period, the taxpayers are required to increase or reduce the tax base in the subsequent period.
## Charitable contributions
Companies are entitled to deduct donations for the purposes of public benefit and to volunteer activity organisations up to a total amount not exceeding 10% of income; however, deductions may not be made for donations to:
  * natural persons or
  * legal persons or organisational units having no legal personality who carry on economic activity consisting in the production of electronic goods; fuel; tobacco; spirits, wines, beers, and other alcohol beverages containing over 1.5% alcohol; products made of noble metals or containing such metals; or incomes received from trading in such goods.


Donations for religious practice purposes can be deducted up to a total amount not exceeding 10% of income.
Additionally, the donations of food products made for the purposes of so-called public benefit constitute tax deductible costs in the amount of production costs or purchase price.
### Donations to counteract the effect of war in the Ukraine
Irrespective from deductions from the tax base, CIT and PIT payers may additionally settle donations made with respect to war in Ukraine as tax deductible costs in the amount of the production costs or purchase price of items or rights that are the subject of donations or costs incurred as a result of gratuitous services aimed at counteracting the effects of hostilities on the territory of Ukraine, transferred in the period from 24 February 2022 to 31 December 2024, unless these expenses were included in tax deductible costs, including through depreciation write-offs.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties can be recognised as tax deductible items if they meet the general conditions. However, the Polish CIT law provides some exceptions, which include contractual penalties and indemnities for defects in supplied goods, works, and services performed; delayed supply of non-defective goods; and delay in the elimination of defects in goods, works, and services performed, unless it is caused by an epidemic emergency or an epidemic declared due to COVID-19.
## Taxes
Income tax, certain industry-specific taxes (e.g. banking tax), and, in most cases, VAT incurred on purchases are not deductible. However, as a rule, VAT is deductible for CIT purposes if it cannot be offset against the company’s output VAT. Other taxes, if paid in the course of business activities, are generally deductible in full.
## Net operating losses
Tax losses may be carried forward for five consecutive tax years, subject to the restriction that not more than 50% of the amount of the tax loss from a given past year can be utilised in any single subsequent tax year. 
Alternatively, a tax loss generated in a tax year commencing after 31 December 2018 may be also set-off during one of the immediately following consecutive five tax years by an amount not exceeding PLN 5 million. The amount not utilised may be deducted within the remaining years of this five-year period (however, the amount of such reduction in any of these years may not be higher than 50% of the amount of the tax loss; this is controversial if the latter limit is 50% of the full amount of loss [in our view] or the unsettled amount of loss). 
Tax losses carried forward in one ’basket‘ may be utilised solely to set-off taxable income from the same ’basket‘. Under grandfathering rules, tax losses carried forward from years preceding the tax year 2018 may be set-off against any taxable income, irrespective of the baskets.
As of 1 January 2022, this regulation also applies to the situation when a tax capital group loses its taxpayer status, or its agreement is terminated. In this case, the aforementioned regulation applies to the loss of the company forming the tax capital group incurred before the formation of this group, provided: 
  * the loss was incurred not earlier than in the fifth tax year of the company preceding the year for which the deduction is made, provided that this period also includes tax years of the tax capital group created by this company, and 
  * the income of the tax capital group has not been deducted by the amount of this loss.


Currently, there is no possibility to carry back tax losses in Poland, except for the specific measure introduced in recent years with regard to countering the impact of COVID-19. The taxpayers were allowed to carry back and set-off against taxable income of FY19 the tax loss incurred in FY20 (considering also shifted tax years) if certain conditions were met.
Tax losses of the entity expiring upon the restructuring (i.e. transformations, mergers, and demergers) are unavailable for utilisation, except for transformation of a company being a taxpayer into another company also being a taxpayer. However, with regard to restructurings taking place as of 2021, the taxpayer is disallowed to deduct tax losses carried forward in case of certain types of restructurings, i.e. a take-over of another entity or an acquisition of an enterprise or organised part thereof, if any of the following conditions is met:
  * The scope of taxpayer’s core business activity afterwards is different (in full / in part) than it was before the takeover/acquisition.
  * At least 25% of shares of the taxpayer is held by entity/entities that did not hold such rights on the last day of the tax year in which the tax loss was incurred.


## Payments to foreign affiliates
On 1 January 2022, the provisions on the so-called ’diverted profits tax‘ came into force. The aim of those provisions is to eliminate the possibility of obtaining tax benefits through the transfer of profits to a tax jurisdiction with a marginal effective tax rate. The new regulations on diverted profits replaced the repealed provisions on the limitation of costs of certain intangible services and royalties incurred towards related entities (_see Diverted profits tax in the_ _section for more information_). 
Furthermore, note that transactions with related companies should be made according to the market conditions. Where a company shifts income to another entity (especially a foreign entity), the tax authorities may adjust the taxable base upward (_see Transfer pricing in the_ _section for more information_).


# Poland
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 22 July 2024
Each individual corporate group member is required to submit their own tax return on a stand-alone basis, with the exception of the special rules for grouping available with respect to CIT and VAT (_discussed below_).
Moreover, extensive rules on transfer pricing in respect of transactions with related parties are in force. In particular, the tax authorities may increase the tax base and re-characterise or even disregard related-party transactions that do not meet the arm’s-length principle. The taxpayers making transactions with related entities or residents of tax havens are also required to comply with local requirements (such as preparation of Local File, benchmarking studies, and Master File and reporting), as well as requirements imposed upon OECD recommendations (i.e. country-by-country [CbC] reporting for multinational corporations).
The Polish CIT Act also provides for specific tax regimes regarding Polish tax residents having a holding position, i.e.: 
  * optional, preferential tax exemption on dividends and capital gains on share disposal for the Polish holding companies, and 
  * additional tax obligation on the income of the CFCs.


## CIT capital group
The CIT law includes provisions on group taxation. If a group of companies meets certain conditions, it can be treated as a single taxpayer. The required conditions are extremely demanding, and not many taxpayers of this type exist (according to data published by the Ministry of Finance, as of August 2024, the number of CIT capital groups in Poland was 92). However, effectively from 2022, conditions for starting and running a tax capital group have been significantly simplified. In particular, the minimum revenue-to-income ratio of the tax capital group at 2% has been eliminated.
A tax capital group can be created if following requirements are jointly met:
  * Average share capital of each company is not lower than PLN 250,000.
  * A direct share of a parent entity in subsidiaries forming the tax capital group is at least 75%. 
  * No tax arrears exist with respect to the ’state‘ taxes.
  * The tax capital group agreement is concluded for at least three tax years and is registered by the Head of the Tax Office.
  * Conditions of transactions concluded between the group’s members and their related parties not being part of the group are at arm’s-length.


There is a possibility to lose the status of taxpayer retroactively in case of breach of above conditions. Should this be the case, companies forming the tax group are required to reconcile, for CIT purposes, as independent taxpayers retroactively for the past three tax years, considering that the day preceding the date of the loss of taxpayer status constitutes the last day of the tax year. 
All entities forming the tax capital group are required to apply the arm’s-length rule to transactions within the tax group. There is no obligation to prepare transfer pricing documentation for such transactions; however, the tax authorities are entitled to examine and, potentially, estimate prices used in transactions between members of the tax group.
Additional benefit of a CIT capital group is that it is considered a “new taxpayer” in regard to the Minimum Income Tax regulations (discussed in a section ), hence it is exempt from said tax in the first year of operation and two consecutive tax years.
## VAT group
From 1 January 2023, taxpayers are able to form a VAT group. The main reason for this solution is that the entities creating it become one taxpayer for VAT purposes. Thus, the supply of goods or services performed between entities being members of the same VAT group shall not be subject to VAT. Members of a VAT group should not issue invoices for transactions conducted within this group. However, they must maintain and report on a monthly basis separate records documenting these transactions.
A VAT group may be formed by a group of entities related financially, economically, and organisationally(within the meaning of Polish VAT Act), which conclude an agreement on forming a VAT group for at least three years and register it to the Head of the Tax Office. A VAT group may be formed by taxpayers:
  * having their registered seat in Poland or
  * not having the seat in Poland but conducting business activity in Poland through a branch.


One entity can be a member of only one VAT group. A VAT group cannot be a member of another VAT group. The composition of a VAT group cannot change during its duration. This means that no new members can join an existing VAT group and no existing members can leave it.
As a consequence of creating the VAT group, the supply of goods or services by an entity being a member of this group to an entity that is not a member of a group is considered to be made by that group to the entity outside of the group. This rule may also be applied in reverse, which means that the supply of goods and services to an entity being a member of a VAT group by an entity that is not a member of this group is considered to be made for this group.
The introduction of the provisions concerning a VAT group may be, therefore, particularly important for the entities conducting VAT-exempt/non-taxable activities and having a limited right to deduct tax. For these entities, intra-group purchases of services that have been taxed so far (in the absence of the right to deduct) will become neutral from the VAT perspective.
The VAT group status may be lost when the agreement period expires or the conditions for establishing the group no longer exist. Importantly, losing the VAT group status does not require retroactively adjusting individual members' tax returns for the period they were in the group. Upon the VAT group's deregistration, the tax office automatically restores each member's VAT status to what it was before the group was formed.
## Transfer pricing
Transactions between related parties should be conducted in accordance with the arm’s-length principle. The tax authorities may increase the taxable income or decrease tax loss if the pricing method applied between related parties differs from what would have been applied between unrelated parties in a similar business transaction and the difference results in income being understated by a Polish taxpayer. In such a case, the tax authorities are also entitled to impose additional tax liability, amounting to 10% to 30% (depending on the circumstances) of the tax base of the payment for which the tax was not collected.
The regulations apply to domestic transactions as well as cross-border ones. Similar rules also apply to transactions between Polish residents and the residents of tax havens. These transactions may be subject to the transfer pricing principles even if the parties thereto are not related. 
For the purpose of transfer pricing regulations, there is a 25% (direct or indirect) participation threshold for determining whether parties are related or not (including shareholding, voting rights, or participation in profits, losses, or property). Note that legal, not economic, ownership should be taken into consideration. Additionally, certain personal/management links may also create relationships between two entities under the transfer pricing regulations.
### Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
As required from members of the OECD Inclusive Framework within Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) minimum standards, Poland has implemented the CbC reporting requirements (i.e. information on the capital groups’ taxable income, tax paid, and their place of business). Pursuant to the domestic rules, the largest capital groups (with consolidated revenues exceeding PLN 3.250 billion if the consolidated financial statement is prepared in PLN, EUR 750 million, or the equivalent amount converted in accordance with statutory rules) are required to submit, in Poland, the CbC report, provided the ultimate parent is a Polish entity. In case the Polish consolidating entity is a subsidiary of a foreign capital group, the obligation is shifted abroad, but the Polish entity is required to submit information on where the report is filled.
However, a Polish entity that is not an ultimate parent company may be required to submit a CbC report if:
  * the ultimate parent company is not under such obligation in the state in which its registered office or seat of management is located
  * the authorities of the state in which the ultimate parent company’s registered office or seat of management is located did not conclude an agreement on the exchange of information with Poland within 12 months from the end of the reporting year or suspended the automatic exchange of information, or


  * no other group entity has been designated to prepare such information.


The CbC report should be submitted within 12 months after the end of the financial year of the group, while the information on the entity required to submit the CbC report (whether it is the entity itself or the obligation is shifted) should be submitted within three months after the end of the financial year.
### Local File
Taxpayers are also required to prepare transfer pricing documentation for each uniform transaction (separately for income and cost transactions) exceeding the threshold in an extended format covering not only the description of a transaction but also ‘other events included in the accounting books’ if they were agreed to by related parties and influence the taxpayer’s taxable income or loss. In particular, taxpayers must present the actual result achieved on a specific related-party transaction.
Transactional materiality thresholds applicable for transfer pricing documentation (Local File) are set at:
  * PLN 10 million for transactions concerning tangible assets and financing.
  * PLN 2 million for other transactions.


### Master File
Obligation to prepare group transfer pricing documentation (i.e. Master File) applies to the groups of related entities that prepare consolidated financial statements or excess materiality threshold set at PLN 200 million of consolidated revenue. The Master File may be prepared in English; however, the tax authorities may request for the translated version to be provided within 30 days from the receipt of such a request.
### Benchmarking study
A benchmarking study is a compulsory element of the documentation for each transaction described in a Local File, except for those to which safe harbours apply. If conducting such analysis is impossible, a taxpayer is required to prepare an analysis justifying compliance of the related-party transaction with the conditions that would have been set by unrelated entities. 
Taxpayers are also required to explain any discrepancy between the actual results achieved on related-party transactions and results of relevant benchmarking studies.
The benchmarking studies are required to be updated at least every three years, unless a change in the economic environment that significantly affects the analysis prepared justifies an update in the year in which such a change occurred. 
### Non-recognition and re-characterisation
The law, which entered into force as of 1 January 2019, granted the tax authorities additional tools. They are able to re-characterise or even disregard related-party transactions if they conclude that unrelated entities would not enter into transaction declared by the taxpayer or would conclude different transactions. Consequently, when assessing the arm’s-length level of remuneration in a given transaction, they could refer to other transactions or terms that, in their opinion, could have been applied by unrelated parties.
### Safe harbours and other exceptions 
As of 1 January 2019, safe harbours have been introduced for two transaction types, i.e. loans meeting specific requirements and low-value-adding services. In the case of the former, an official announcement on the arm’s-length level interest rates is published once a year for the following financial year. For the latter, a mark-up limit of 5% is provided by the law. 
The table below presents some of exceptions from obligations to prepare transfer pricing documentation and benchmarking studies (including safe harbours):
**Transaction type** | **Obligation to prepare**  
---|---  
**Local File** | Benchma**rking study**  
Transactions concluded between Polish entities that have achieved a tax profit and have not utilised SEZ tax breaks | NO | NO  
Transactions concluded between related PEs of EU/EEA entities that are based in Poland or between the PE of an EU/EEA entity that is based in Poland and its Polish related entity | NO | NO  
Transactions covered by an agreement with authorities (an APA, a tax agreement, or an investment agreement) | NO | NO  
Transactions concluded within a tax capital group | NO | NO  
Transactions in which the price was determined in an open tender pursuant to the Public Procurement Law | NO | NO  
Certain transactions concluded by groups of agricultural producers / groups of fruits and vegetables producers with members of such groups  | NO | NO  
Attribution of earnings to a PE in Poland if such earnings may be taxed only in another country according to a relevant DTT | NO | NO  
Transactions regarding settlements for re-invoicing meeting specific conditions, primarily under the provision that no added value is created and the settlement is performed without taking into account the profit margin or mark-up | NO | NO  
Loans meeting safe harbor requirements | NO | NO  
Low-value-adding services meeting safe harbor requirements | NO; however, in order to apply safe harbour rules, a similar file needs to be prepared. | NO  
Transactions concluded by related entities that are micro or small entrepreneurs within the meaning of the Entrepreneurs' Law (fewer than 50 personnel, with a turnover of less than EUR 10 million or whose total assets did not exceed EUR 10 million at the end of the year) | YES | NO  
Transactions with unrelated entities that are based in territories/countries applying harmful tax competition (tax havens) | YES | NO  
### Reporting responsibilities
Taxpayers are required to submit an electronic form (TPR form). For the financial years starting in 2023, the TPR form must be submitted within 11 months after the end of the financial year and should contain information on the transactions carried out with related entities. The form includes a statement confirming that the transfer pricing documentation had been prepared and related-party transactions described therein had been conducted according to the arm’s-length principle. 
Taxpayers are required to submit the TPR form to the competent Head of the Tax Office and not to the Head of the National Tax Administration, as was the case before. The TPR form should be completed or uploaded on the government web portal for electronic forms (eFormularz) and signed using the qualified electronic signature by the designated board member that possesses the power of attorney to sign electronic tax returns (UPL-1). Submission of false information on a TPR form may lead to personal fines.
### Tax haven transactions
Taxpayers are required to prepare transfer pricing documentation for transactions with both unrelated and related entities that are based in territories/countries applying harmful tax competition (tax havens) if the value of such transactions exceed:
  * PLN 2,500,000 for transactions concerning financing,
  * PLN 500,000 million for other transactions.


In addition, the Polish legislators pursued the law in force as of January 2021 requiring taxpayers to prepare a Local File for so-called ’indirect‘ tax haven transactions (i.e. made with a counterparty whose beneficial owner is registered in a tax haven) exceeding the threshold PLN 500,000; however, these rules were ultimately withdrawn.
### Advance pricing agreement (APA) provisions
Taxpayers can mitigate the transfer pricing risk by applying for an APA. The tax authorities may not challenge the methodology agreed therein but may verify whether the methodology is followed in practice.
Provisions adopted in 2019 clarified the current procedure of issuing an APA decision. The regulations also provided new possibilities to apply for an APA by the foreign investor that is planning to start its operations in Poland.
The provisions also introduced changes to the rules regarding ensuring compliance with the issued APA decision. According to the regulations, possible audits will be carried out by the authorities as verifying activities.
### Mutual agreement procedure (MAP)
In 2019, a MAP was implemented, which is the result of implementing the Council Directive (EU) 2017/1852 on the tax dispute resolution mechanisms in the European Union. In Poland, the regulations on the matter are provided in the Act of 16 October 2019 on the settlement of disputes regarding double taxation and the conclusion of APAs.
This procedure is intended to protect a taxpayer operating in two or more membership countries from the potential effects of double taxation.
## Thin capitalisation
Currently, there are no thin capitalisation rules on intra-group loans as such; instead, there is interest deductibility limitation to, basically, 30% of EBITDA or PLN 3 million (whichever is higher). 
At the beginning of 2022, a restriction was added to the CIT Act that limits the deductibility of costs of debt financing granted by a related entity to finance restructuring activities or acquisitions of other related entities..
## CIT exemption for the Polish holding company
Starting from 1 January 2022 a preferential holding company tax regime was introduced withr amendments in force from 2023,  that clarified the law and extended its benefits to more companies. This tax scheme offers the following tax benefits:
  * exemption from taxation of capital gain from the sale of shares in subsidiaries (not real estate-rich companies) to an unrelated entity provided that it is reported to the tax office in advance, and 
  * exemption from taxation of dividends paid to this holding company by subsidiaries; in that case the domestic subsidiary is not required to withhold tax on such dividends


The scheme may be applied by a Polish capital company being a Polish tax resident, which directly owns at least 10% of the shares in a subsidiary company, for a continuous period of at least two years (up to the day before receiving income) and carries out a genuine business activity (as defined by CFC rules). A holding company may simultaneously benefit from the WHT exemption for dividends implemented upon the Parent Subsidiary Directive for other dividend inflows, but may not form a tax capital group nor benefit from exemptions in the SEZ/PIZ.
In addition, shares in this company may not be held, directly or indirectly, by an entity seated in a country applying harmful tax competition (included in the Polish or EU’s lists) or with which Poland/EU have not ratified any treaty (e.g. DTTs) allowing for exchange of tax information. In practice, this condition seems extremely challenging to be fulfilled in case of many mid-level companies owned by multinational groups or listed companies due to not fully traceable ownership.This issue is highly controversial because tax authorities deny exemptions to Polish companies that are either publicly listed or owned, at any level, by a publicly listed entity. Although court rulings in this area have been limited, they tend to be more favorable to taxpayers.
The holding company scheme can also be applied to subsidiaries having multi-level structures beneath them. This scheme remains applicable even if a domestic subsidiary benefits from exemptions offered in the SEZ/PIZ.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
An additional income tax may be imposed in Poland on direct and indirect shareholders (Polish tax residents) of a company/PE that meets the definition of a CFC, i.e. passes at least one out of five so-called ’CFC tests‘ (two of which were introduced on 1 January 2022).
The introduction of two new CFC tests (i.e. the passive assets test and the operational test) requires Polish taxpayers to constantly monitor not only revenues but also foreign balance sheets and revenue streams of their foreign subsidiaries.
The CFC tax regime affects taxpayers that are shareholders of foreign entities (defined in the CIT Act; since 1 January 2019, the definition has been extended to foundations, trusts, and other fiduciary entities) located (i.e. seated or having a place of management or being registered or situated) in: 
  * countries recognised as applying harmful tax competition (tax haven test) or
  * countries with which Poland/EU have not ratified any treaty (e.g. DTTs) allowing for exchange of tax information (tax treaty test).


No other conditions have to be met in these cases for the foreign entity to be considered as a CFC.
If the foreign entity is not located in one of the countries mentioned above, the CFC analysis should still be conducted. A foreign entity is considered to be a CFC if it meets jointly all of the conditions provided for in at least one of the below CFC tests:
  * Passive revenues test.
  * Passive assets test.
  * Operational test.


All of these CFC tests consist of three or four conditions, among which the following two conditions are the same for all of the CFC tests, i.e.:
  * Polish tax residents have directly/indirectly, solely or jointly with related entities or with non-related entities being Polish tax residents, over 50% participation in the foreign company’s income, voting rights, or capital, or exercise actual control over the foreign entity.
  * Income tax actually paid by the foreign entity (not subject to refund or credit in any form, including the refund or credit for the benefit of another entity) is lower by at least 25% than the income tax that would be paid by this foreign company in Poland at the application of the 19% tax rate (if it was a Polish tax resident).


The remaining conditions are as follows:
  * For the passive revenues test: 
    * At least 33% of foreign company revenues is derived from passive sources (since 1 January 2022 it has been clarified that passive revenues achieved through entities not having legal personality should also be taken into account).
  * For the passive assets test: 
    * The sum of the passive revenues of this foreign entity is lower than 30% of the sum of the value of passive assets (i.e. shares in other companies, real estate, movable property, intangible assets, receivables from passive sources towards related entities).
    * The passive assets mentioned above constitute at least 50% of all assets of the foreign entity (however, for the application of this particular condition, when assessing the value of passive assets, the shares held in companies that are not Polish tax residents or not holding [directly or indirectly] shares in a company that has its seat or management in Poland should not be taken into account).
  * For the operational test: 
    * The income of the entity exceeds the income calculated using the following formula: (b + c + d) × 20%, where: 
      * b is the balance-sheet value of the foreign entity’s assets
      * c is the annual employment costs of the foreign entity, and
      * d is the accumulated value of depreciation write-offs within the meaning of the accounting regulations.
    * Less than 75% of the foreign entity’s revenues come from transactions with unrelated entities having their place of residence, seat, place of management, registration, or location in the same country as this foreign entity.


Under the CFC regime, income earned by the CFCs is subject to the 19% CIT rate to be paid by the Polish taxpayer. The tax base covers the whole amount of income earned by the CFCs (including the passive income and the income earned on the actual business) that can be allocated to the Polish shareholders (however, If the CFCs are located in tax havens, the reduction by the actual share in the CFC’s income is not considered), calculated proportionally to the period in which shareholding connection existed. The tax base may be reduced by the amount of dividend received from a CFC and/or the income from disposal of a share in a CFC by the Polish taxpayers, in part included in their tax base.
As a general rule, taxpayers are allowed to decrease the tax due in Poland by the amount of income tax already paid by the CFCs. 
Tax on income from the CFCs is not levied if the CFC is liable to taxation on their total income in an EU/EEA member state and performs significant genuine business activity. The later condition shall be assessed by considering, inter alia, the following circumstances:
  * Incorporation must correspond with an actual establishment intended to carry on genuine economic activities. In particular, the CFC should physically exist in terms of premises, staff, and equipment.
  * The CFC does not create an artificial arrangement without a link with economic reality.
  * There is proportionality between the actual economic activities carried out by the CFC and the extent to which the CFC exists in terms of premises, staff, and equipment.
  * Agreements concluded by the CFC have business justification and are in line with its economic interest.


Furthermore, holding shares in foreign entities and/or CFCs is correlated with certain administrative and reporting obligations (e.g. obligation of the Polish taxpayer to maintain a register of the CFCs and/or separate accounting books, filing separate tax returns presenting the amount of income generated through the CFC on the CIT-CFC or PIT-CFC form).

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 22 July 2024
Foreign businesses are allowed, under certain conditions, to establish their branch offices (exclusively within the scope of their ‘foreign’ business activity) and representative offices (exclusively with regard to promotion and advertising) in Poland.
A branch office almost always has PE status in Poland. Once a branch is established, the foreign company pays CIT at the standard rate of 19%, based on the income attributable to the operations of the Polish branch. For this purpose, as well as for accounting purposes, a branch is obligated to keep accounting books that include all the data necessary to establish the taxable base. In this respect, general income determination rules relevant to Polish companies apply to branches as well. In the few cases in which a branch can demonstrate, based on a DTT, that its business presence in Poland does not constitute a PE, its profits are not subject to Polish CIT.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 22 July 2024
## Foreign tax credit
Resident corporations are taxed on their worldwide income unless there is an applicable DTT in place between Poland and the relevant country that provides that the foreign income shall be exempt from taxation in Poland. In all other cases (in particular, when the income is not covered by any treaty), Poland uses the ordinary credit method to avoid double taxation. Therefore, a Polish resident is liable for income tax imposed on its worldwide income, but the tax is proportionately reduced by the income tax paid abroad.
## Polish Investment Zone (PIZ)
At the end of June 2018, new regulations on applying for the income tax exemption due to the new investment implementation entered into force (so-called PIZ), which replaced the previous Special Economic Zones system. The biggest change is that the possibility to obtain a tax incentive does not depend on the location of the new investment, which does not necessarily have to be on the territory of a Special Economic Zone (SEZ). 
The amount of the incentive (which is income tax exemption) is calculated exactly the same as within the SEZ system and depends on the:
  * value of incurred eligible costs of the investment (investment capital expenditures or two-year labour costs of the new employees)
  * state aid intensity in a selected region, and
  * size of the enterprise.


The right to use the exemption is granted for 12, 14, or 15 years, depending on the investment’s location.
Applying for the income tax exemption within the PIZ requires declaration to meet numerous quality criteria. Some of them remain common for all types of investment projects. The minimum number of required quality points vary from 4 to 6 points out of 13 possible and depends on the investment location.
The core obligations regarding income tax exemption within the PIZ are:
  * Project implementation may begin no sooner than the day after the date of submission of complete documentation to the PIZ.
  * Five-years investment maintenance after completing the project.
  * Keeping ownership on acquired fixed assets for five years from the day of registering them.
  * Maintenance of workplaces created for the project purpose for up to five years.
  * Necessity to incur declared value of CAPEX.


Until the new regulation entered into force, Polish legislation provided investment incentives related to business activities carried out in 14 zones defined as SEZs. A business entity could benefit from tax incentives, provided that the entity obtained a permit from the Ministry of Economic Development to conduct business activities there and met other legal requirements. Note that a CIT credit applied only to income earned on activity conducted within the territory of SEZs and covered by permit. According to current regulations, the deadline for utilising the available tax credit from the previous SEZ system is the end of 2026 (previously 2020).
## Tax relief for research and development (R&D)
Entrepreneurs have the possibility of a tax deduction of costs incurred for R&D. The value of the deduction varies depending on the size of the company and type of eligible costs.
Eligible costs include the following six categories of R&D expenditures:
  * Employees’ wages and social contributions.
  * Purchase of commodities and raw materials.
  * Expertise, research, and opinions bought from scientific units.
  * Payments for use of research equipment.
  * Amortisation of intangible assets and fixed assets, excluding passenger cars, buildings, and constructions.
  * Costs of obtaining IP protection.


To benefit from the tax relief, each entity needs to perform R&D works and prepare a record of the eligible costs incurred in relation to R&D works in a given year. It is not important whether the R&D works end with success or the level of innovativeness of future effects of those works. Tax relief is also allowed for qualifying projects in progress (e.g. projects launched in previous years).
From 2018, there is an increase of the existing deductions in income taxes from 50% and 30% (depending on the category of eligible costs and the size of the taxpayer) to 100% of qualified costs, irrespective of their category and size of the taxpayer (which has hitherto differentiated the allowed deduction limits). This means that all taxpayers benefiting from R&D tax relief will be able to save in income tax PLN 19 on every PLN 100 of qualified costs starting from 2018.
Also, taxpayers may deduct expenditure incurred on employees that covers the costs of staff hired by taxpayers for R&D purposes under selected civil law contracts (previously only on an employment contract basis).
The R&D tax relief is available to taxpayers who, during the tax year, have operated in a PIZ on the basis of a decision on support, regarding eligible costs that were not recognised as costs of running the activity covered by the PIZ decision.
From 2022, there is an increase of the existing deductions in income taxes from 100% to 200% of qualified costs incurred on employees that covers the costs of staff hired by taxpayers for R&D purposes.
## Innovation Box
As of 1 January 2019, a new mechanism reducing tax rate to be applied to income derived from intellectual property (IP) rights (Innovation Box) has been introduced.
The Innovation Box scheme reduces, to 5%, the tax rate applicable to an income derived from IP rights.
The adjustment relates to the ratio of costs incurred on self-developed of IP rights in R&D activity and costs of subcontracting of R&D activity.
Taxpayers applying the Innovation Box scheme shall be entitled to benefit from the tax preference until a given right expires (20 years in case of a patented invention).
The tax preference applies provided that a taxpayer conducts R&D activity related to development, creation, or improvement of a given IP component. In order to benefit from the scheme, taxpayers will be required to separate the discussed income in their accounting books.
The new provisions complement the Polish innovative activities tax preferences system by supplementing the existing R&D tax relief. Previously, an entrepreneur introducing an invention to the market was required to tax income with a standard tax rate. Upon R&D relief, the entrepreneur is now entitled to a tax relief calculated on the basis of qualified costs incurred (e.g. on development of an invention).
## Simultaneous IP BOX and R&D relief
A taxpayer commercialising the results of R&D and obtaining qualified income from it within the meaning of the IP Box provisions has the possibility of deducting R&D relief from the IP Box income of eligible costs incurred to develop the right covered by IP Box.
## Innovative employees tax relief
The innovative employees tax relief mechanism is an extension of the existing R&D relief. Taxpayers benefitting from R&D tax relief that had not been settled in the previous year are able to deduct it from advances for PIT paid by the employer due to:
  * service relationship, employment relationship, contract work, cooperative employment relationship
  * services provided under a contract of mandate or contract for specific work, and
  * copyrights.


The condition for the deduction will be that a given employee devotes at least 50% of the total working time directly to R&D activities in a given month. The deduction will be valid from the month in which the taxpayer submitted a tax return for a given year until the end of that tax year.
## Relief for Robotisation
The relief for robotisation was introduced for a period of five years and covers expenses from the beginning of the 2022 fiscal year until the end of the 2026 fiscal year. It is available to both PIT and CIT payers investing in robotisation, regardless of the size of their operations. Entrepreneurs are additionally able to deduct 50% of the costs incurred for investments in robotisation.
The deduction is to apply in particular to: 
  * purchase or financial leasing of new robots and cobots
  * purchase of software necessary for the proper start-up of new fixed assets in the field of robotisation
  * purchase of accessories (e.g. tracks, turntables, controllers, motion sensors, end effects)
  * purchase of occupational health and safety (OHS) devices, and
  * training costs for employees who will operate the new equipment.


The value of the deduction may not exceed the amount of income in a given tax year.
## Relief for prototype
The prototype relief allows a deduction from the tax base of 30% of the sum of the costs of the trial production of a new product and the launch of a new product, but the amount of the deduction cannot exceed 10% of the income earned from sources other than capital gains in a tax year. It is an extension of the already existing R&D relief, and its scope covers the stage after completion of R&D works but before mass production of the developed product.
The deduction is limited to selected costs covering:
  * the purchase price or production cost of new fixed assets necessary to start trial production of a new product
  * purchase costs of materials and raw materials purchased solely for the purpose of trial production of a new product
  * costs of improvement incurred to adapt the fixed asset to launch trial production of a new product
  * research, expertise, and certification costs
  * product life cycle studies, and
  * environmental technology verification system.


The costs incurred have to be shown in the annual tax declaration with the possibility of their deduction in the next six years following immediately after the year in which they were incurred. 
## Relief for expansion
The main purpose of the tax relief for expansion is the possibility of an additional deduction of the value of expenses related to the increase in revenues from the sale of products. The product may be an item already produced by the taxpayer or an item not yet offered by the taxpayer and not yet offered in a given country.
The relief may be settled on an ongoing basis, and the increase in revenues should be shown for two years, which requires monitoring of revenues obtained from products to which eligible costs were allocated.
Expenses for the expansion is eligible for a two-fold deduction up to the amount of PLN 1 million in a given tax year.
The costs associated with increasing revenues from the sale of products are:
  * participation in fairs (e.g. organisation, accommodation)
  * promotional activities
  * adaptation of packaging to the contractor's requirements
  * preparation of documentation for the sale of products (e.g. certification of goods and registration of trademarks), and
  * cost of tender documentation.


## Relief for corporate social responsibility (CSR)
The CSR relief enables the deduction of an additional 50% of selected costs from the tax base incurred on activities such as sports, culture, higher education, and science. The new preference, similar to the R&D relief in force for several years, is deductible in the tax return for the tax year in which the costs were incurred.
Eligible costs include: 
  * purchase of sports equipment, covering the costs of organising or participating in sports competitions, covering the costs of using sports facilities for the purposes of sports training, and financing sport’s scholarships
  * costs incurred for sport’s events not being mass sport’s events
  * costs incurred for the benefit of cultural institutions entered in the register of cultural institutions, as well as for financing cultural activities carried out by art academies and public art schools, and
  * costs incurred for student scholarships for academic performance or sports and for research scholarships for doctoral students, costs of fees related to the education of an employed employee in studies, post-graduate studies and other forms of education, and costs of remuneration of students during internships work placements.


## Relief for initial public offerings (IPOs)
The relief for IPOs allows for the deduction of costs incurred in the scope of the IPO. 
The catalogue of eligible expenses is closed and is divided into the following two categories:
  * Expenses eligible for 150% deduction: 
    * Preparation of the prospectus.
    * Notary, court, fiscal, and stock exchange fees.
    * Preparation and publication of advertisements required by law.
  * Expenses eligible for 50% deduction (limit of PLN 50,000): 
    * Advisory, legal, and financial services costs.


The expenses must be incurred directly for making the IPO, i.e. related directly and exclusively to the IPO, and incurred in the IPO year or in the preceding year, but not later than on the IPO date when the taxpayer introduced the shares to trading for the first time.
## Relief for consolidation
The taxpayer who bears the eligible expenses for the acquisition of shares in a capital company has the right to reduce its tax base by these expenses in the year in which they are actually incurred, while meeting the following conditions:
  * The company whose shares are acquired has its registered office or management board in the territory of the Republic of Poland or in a country with which the Republic of Poland has concluded a double taxation agreement.
  * The main activity of the company whose shares are acquired is the same as the subject of the taxpayer's activity, or the company's operations may be considered to support the taxpayer's activities, excluding financial activities.
  * The main activity of the company whose shares are acquired is conducted at least 24 months prior to the acquisition of the shares.
  * Within 24 months prior to the acquisition of the shares, the company and the taxpayer were not related parties.
  * The taxpayer is required to acquire shares in one transaction representing an absolute majority of voting rights (51%).


The maximum amount of the deduction in a tax year is PLN 250,000.
Eligible expenses subject to deduction include the following: 
  * Legal services for the purchase of shares or stocks.
  * Taxes charged directly on the transaction.
  * Notary, court, and fiscal fees.


The deduction of expenses related to the acquisition of another company is possible in the tax year in which the taxpayer acquires shares in that company and applies to the amount of expenses incurred by the taxpayer in that tax year.


# Poland
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 22 July 2024
## Domestic provisions: General rules
The general domestic WHT rate for dividends is 19%. For the purpose of applying Polish WHT rules, the term ’dividends‘ should be understood as encompassing certain other revenues (incomes) from participation in profits of legal persons having their seat or management office within the territory of the Republic of Poland, including, among others, the income from liquidation of a company and the income from the redemption of shares (with the exception of gain from voluntary redemption, which is treated as a capital gain subject to the 19% CIT rate in Poland if the gain is realised by a taxpayer from a non-treaty country or the treaty includes a so-called 'real estate clause'). The WHT rate on the dividend might be reduced based on the applicable DTT provision or specific participation exemption rules.
The general domestic WHT rate on interest and royalties paid to non-residents is 20% (10% regarding services of sea or air transportation). These WHT rates may also be reduced by DTTs.
There is also a 20% WHT on payments made to non-residents for intangible services listed in the CIT Act (such as consulting or management services). However, if a payment is made to a country that has a DTT with Poland, then, as a rule, this payment may be exempt from WHT (under a business profits clause) provided certain administrative formalities and WHT due diligence are completed (see below). However, a few DTTs treat payments for technical services as royalties (e.g. India or Malta).
The 'beneficial owner' clause determines that in order to apply the exemption from WHT based on the Polish provisions implementing the Interest-Royalties Directive, the entities receiving royalties and interest must constitute their beneficial owners (i.e. they should be in possession of the right to use and enjoy the payment received, and this right cannot be constrained by a contractual or a legal obligation to pass the payment; in addition to the above, they should conduct actual business activity in the country of their registered office if the receivables are obtained in connection with the conducted business activity). The beneficial ownership requirement has also become one of the conditions to apply reduced tax rates or exemptions on interest and royalties by Polish remitters under applicable DTTs, despite the fact that not all Polish DTTs directly include such a clause. A similar approach has been presented by the tax authorities in Poland towards dividend payments. The verdicts issued by administrative courts mostly reject the view that a Polish company, as a payer of CIT on the dividend, is required to check whether the recipient of the dividend is its beneficial owner. Nevertheless, the opposite approach is presented as well.
As of 1 January 2019, a mechanism of settlement of WHT in relation to payments exceeding PLN 2 million _per annum_ for each taxpayer has been introduced (the so-called 'pay and refund' mechanism). The application of this mechanism was suspended until the end of 2021. The package of changes introduced to the Polish tax law regulations starting from January 2022 (the so-called 'Polish Deal') has limited the original scope of the application of this mechanism. Under the rules applicable from January 2022, the conditional exemption from WHT or application of the reduced tax rate stipulated in the applicable DTT or local specific rules is restricted in terms of the passive payments (i.e. dividends, interest, license fees) in the amount exceeding PLN 2 million _per annum_ made to each related entity. In such cases, the tax remitter is required to automatically collect the tax at the statutory domestic rate (19% or 20%), regardless of the fulfilment of the conditions allowing for the application of the exemption or the reduced rate on the basis of the local law or DTT.
Moreover, the tax remitter is required to collect the tax with regard to other payments if the total amount of payments in one tax year to one taxpayer exceeds 2 million PLN when transactions are not classified as passive payments without justified economic reasons (e.g. a payment is artificially classified as a service).
In compliance with the pay and refund mechanism, the taxpayer/remitter has the right to claim for a WHT refund.
The following payments subject to WHT do not fall within the scope of the pay and refund mechanism:
  * Intangible services (unless classified as passive payments without justified economic reasons).
  * Interest or royalties paid to unrelated parties.
  * Passive payments to the benefit of related entities not exceeding PLN 2 million per annum for each taxpayer (though the tax remitter should demonstrate due diligence). 


  * Dividends paid between Polish residents (regardless of their amount).


Regardless of the payment amount, the payer is required to undertake due diligence during the verification of the payment recipient in order to apply the preferential WHT rules (the level of verification shall be stronger for related entities).
The pay and refund mechanism allows the remitters not to withhold tax in relation to payments exceeding PLN 2 million _per annum_ if the remitter submits a statement to the tax authorities confirming that:
  * it possesses all documents necessary for applying reduced WHT rate or exemption from WHT, and
  * it is not aware of any circumstances that speak against granting tax exemption.


The further amendment to the rules on submitting the remitter's declaration made it more flexible by extending the time scope. The submission of a declaration allows this mechanism not to apply until the end of the remitter's tax year, including the declarations submitted in 2022. Changes also included the exemption from the application of certain obligations of payers with respect to withholding taxation of interest and discount on certain securities.
In case of tax authorities challenging the amount of withheld tax in the course of the tax audit, the remitter may be held accountable for uncollected tax as to the completeness of the documents and correctness of the facts considered. In addition to the uncollected WHT, a penalty of 10% to 30% of the tax base may be imposed if the tax authorities question the due diligence or the certification process. Fines under the Fiscal-Penal Code may be imposed on the persons responsible for tax matters in a remitter’s organisation in case of misstatement.
Alternatively, the taxpayer or the remitter can apply to the tax authorities for a ruling (binding opinion) on the application of WHT reduced rates / exemptions. The opinion is valid for three years.
## Special treatment: EU Directives
The CIT law provisions implementing EU Directives provide a special treatment for dividends, interest, and royalties paid to residents of EU or EEA member countries.
In general, the WHT exemption rules on interest and royalty payments paid by Polish corporate residents only apply to associated EU or EEA companies (parent-subsidiary relationships or sister-sister relationships) in which capital involvements are significant, i.e. the paying company owns (or is owned in a share of) at least 25% by the receiving company or the paying company and the receiving company are owned at least in the share of 25% by the same parent company. Shareholding should be kept for a minimum of two consecutive years.
Dividends paid to corporate residents of EU and EEA countries (or Switzerland) are exempt from WHT, subject to certain conditions specified in the CIT law. The basic requirement is that the foreign recipient directly holds at least 10% (or 25% in case of Switzerland) of the shares in the Polish company for a minimum of two consecutive years.
The condition regarding holding shares is also fulfilled if two years passes after the day of the dividend/interest/royalty payment. If the period is interrupted afterwards, the company is obligated to pay the tax at the standard rate with interest.
Note that several additional conditions have to be met in order to apply the exemption implemented upon the Directives (e.g. the company receiving the dividend/interest/royalty cannot be exempt from tax on all its income, regardless of its source; the recipient has to have ownership title to the shares in the Polish company; the recipient has to obtain a written statement confirming fulfilment of exemption conditions).
Additionally, the CIT law states that to enjoy the exemption from WHT based on the Directives’ provisions, the relevant DTT or other agreement concluded by Poland should allow for the exchange of tax information between the tax authorities of Poland and the country of the payment recipient. Given the fact that Poland did not conclude a DTT with Liechtenstein, payments made to tax residents of Liechtenstein should not benefit from the exemption.
It should be noted that the Polish WHT due diligence and pay and refund rules also apply to payments exempt under provisions implementing the EU Directive.
## Treaty rates
If EU special rules do not apply, the domestic WHT rates can be decreased by a DTT concluded between Poland and the payment recipient’s country of residence if certain administrative conditions are met (i.e. the payer obtains a valid certificate of a fiscal residence of the payment recipient/beneficial owner).
The following table lists the WHT rates as provided in the treaties concluded by Poland. Notably, the following table shows only rates that result from general treaty provisions; the treaties themselves occasionally include special provisions (applicable in special circumstances or to special entities) that provide lower WHT rates than the ones listed.
Furthermore, if a treaty rate is higher than a domestic one, the latter should apply.

## Mandatory Disclosure Rules (MDR)
The MDR law in Poland, which transposes the Council Directive 2018/822 of 25 May 2018 (DAC6 Directive), entered into force as of 1 January 2019.
The Polish MDR legislation has a broader than the DAC6 Directive, stipulating an extended definition of reportable tax arrangements (covering not only cross-border but also domestic tax arrangements), as well as an extended list of hallmarks and a wider definition of covered taxes, including domestic VAT.
Polish MDR provisions are applicable to both Polish tax residents, as well as non-Polish residents. As a result - in practice - more types of arrangements might be reportable under Polish MDR provisions than under DAC6.
Polish MDR legislation listsed 24 hallmarks divided into three categories: generic, specific and other specific hallmarks. Only 11 of them, constituting the generic hallmarks, require the so-called main benefit test to be met, with the remaining ones giving rise to reporting obligations regardless of whether the main benefit test is satisfied. Polish MDR regulation requires the reporting of:
  * cross-border tax schemes, in relation to which the first activity related to their implementation was made after 25 June 2018, and
  * domestic tax schemes, in relation to which the first activity related to their implementation was made after 1 November 2018.


Reporting obligation with regard to tax schemes generally arises within 30 days from the date the scheme is shared or implemented. 
Failure to report or other non-compliance may be connected with fines:
  * up to PLN 10 million for an entity being a promoter, and
  * for individuals responsible for non-compliance - up to the maximum threshold of 720 daily rates, which translates into the maximum possible penalty of up to PLN 44.792.640 in 2025,


Taxpayers whose revenue or costs exceed PLN 8 million in the previous tax year may be required to implement an internal procedure on fulfilling the obligation to provide information on tax schemes to comply with Polish MDR regulations. Failure to do so can result in penalties up to PLN 2 million.
Please also note that pursuant to Polish MDR rules, a tax scheme should be identified, , in case of payments, recognised as tax deductible costs, are made to a related entity located in a country applying harmful tax competition (including those indicated in the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes), while the occurrence of a tax advantage or the value of the transaction remains irrelevant in such a case. On 14 February 2023, the EU added the Russian Federation to its blacklist of tax havens. Thus, any transactions with related entities based i.a. in Russia should be identified as cross-border tax schemes.
## New obligatnions on digital platform operators (DAC7)
As of 1 July 2024, legislation implementing the DAC7 Directive came into force, aiming to combat tax fraud by establishing uniform reporting standards for digital platform operators across the EU. 
The new regulations impose a number of new obligations on digital platform operators, i.e. entities that contract sellers to make available all or part of a platform to such sellers. Platform operators are obliged in particular to: 
  * provide the Head of the National Revenue Administration with data of the reportable sellers and 
  * comply with specific due diligence procedures (these procedures relate to, i.a., determining the status of sellers, their residence and reliability of the information obtained), also with regard to sellers who were registered on the platform as of July 1, 2024.


Information on the following activities ("relevant activities") will be reported to the Head of the National Revenue Administration:
  * provision of real estate, share in real estate or parts thereof, including adjoining premises, 
  * provision of personal services, including time- or task-based work performed by a natural person acting for or on behalf of an entity via the platform at a user's request online or physically offline after its execution has been enabled via the platform, 
  * sale of goods, 
  * rental of modes of transport.


The first reporting obligation should have been submitted to the Polish tax authorities by January 31, 2025 for two years - 2023 and 2024. Subsequent reports should be submitted annually.
Non-compliance with DAC 7 requirements may result in penalties for platforms, which may amount to up to PLN 1,000,000. The maximum fine for the responsible individual may even exceed PLN 10 million.
Theis legislation implementing the DAC7 Directive in Poland legislation also introduced additional data protection requirements with regard to MDR provisions. Under the new laws, promoters and supporters must inform individuals in writing about collecting and the processing of their data in relation to reported tax schemes concerning them. As a result, the internal MDR procedures require verification and amendment to comply with the above mentioned changes to MDR provisions as well as data protection laws, as non-compliance could lead to penalties under both regulatory frameworks.
## Limitation for cash payments 
A company cannot settle payments to another entrepreneur in cash if the one-off transaction value exceeds the equivalent of gross PLN 15,000. The limit applies to the value of the transaction, regardless of the number of payments made as part of the transaction. The one-off transaction value is the entire value of the receivables or liabilities expressed in money, resulting from the paid delivery of goods or the paid provision of services specified in a contract concluded between entrepreneurs.
If the price is specified in a foreign currency, the transaction value is calculated on the basis of the central bank exchange rate on the business day preceding the transaction date.
In addition, payments above PLN 15,000 to another entrepreneur who is an active VAT payer should be made to their bank account verified on the White List of VAT payers (_see the_ _section_).
Violation of the limit for cash payments results in exclusion of such a payment (the entire amount is paid without the bank account) from tax deductible costs of a buyer.
Entrepreneurs registered outside Poland, but providing services in the territory of Poland, do not have to apply a cash payment limit. However, this only applies to those situations in which the activity of a foreign entrepreneur may be considered as cross-border provision of services. If a foreign entrepreneur was required to register a branch in Poland and did not do so, the transaction exceeding the statutory limit should be paid in a non-cash form.
In payment transactions in which the parties are the entrepreneur and the consumer, it is the consumer who decides in what form the consumer wants to pay: in cash or non-cash. 
Entrepreneurs who are required to record sales with a cash register must allow consumers to pay without using cash, using a payment instrument. Entrepreneurs must provide such a possibility in every place where they carry out their activity.
## Multilateral Instrument to Modify Bilateral Tax Treaties (MLI)
The MLI globally implements mechanisms created to prevent international profit shifting to locations where they are subject to reduced taxation or non-taxation. 
Poland was the third country (after Austria and Isle of Man) to ratify the MLI. The Act on ratification of the MLI was published in the official Journal of Laws on 14 November 2017. Poland declared 78 DTTs for the MLI’s purposes. As of 1 January 2025, Poland applies the MLI Convention in relation to double taxation treaties with 58 countries. 
Poland's approach with regard to the scope of the adopted MLI provisions includes (in addition to the regulations that constitute the minimum standard) _inter alia_ : rules for limiting the use of hybrid mismatches, determining the tax residence of dual resident entities, changing the method of avoiding double taxation (tax exemption method with progression to the credit method), the real estate clause, and cooperation between states regarding the adjustment of profits of related entities.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 22 July 2024
Taxable income is generally determined on the basis of a tax calculation, which in turn is based on the statutory books according to accepted accounting principles. In practice, taxable income is calculated by adjusting the accounting profit. The relevant adjustments are necessary due to differences between tax and accounting treatment of numerous revenue and cost items. As a result, the taxable base is usually higher than the accounting profit. 
The tax base for CIT purposes includes all sources of income, established individually for each source of income as the difference between taxable revenues and tax-deductible costs within a given source.
There is a separation of income/loss sourced from capital transactions (‘capital gains’) and from other income/loss sources (also referred to as income/loss from ‘operational activities’). Revenues and costs related to each ‘basket’ are disclosed separately. All revenues not included in the closed catalog of capital gains are classified as revenues from 'other sources' (i.e. revenues from operational activities).
Costs should be allocated to the basket to which the corresponding revenues are allocated (direct and indirect costs of a source). Costs that cannot be allocated to a specific revenue basket, should be allocated based on the proportion of revenues of each basket.
There is no possibility to set-off income derived from one ‘basket’ with loss borne in the other ’basket’. Thus, losses incurred in one 'basket' may be set-off only against taxable income from the same 'basket' (within certain limits in case of tax losses carried forward).
The rules for determination of taxable income do not apply to the so-called 'Estonian CIT' scheme, due to taxation of net (accounting) profit at the moment of its distribution (_discussed in the_ _section_).
## Inventory valuation
Generally, the value of inventory shortages may be included as a tax-deductible cost only if they are not a result of taxpayers' negligence and they are properly documented (e.g. in a form of a protocol, including the reason and the extent of such damage). Other write-offs in the value of inventory are not recognised for tax purposes until the inventory in question is sold.
When inventory is lost or sold, a tax deduction is allowed for the costs incurred when the inventory was purchased. The methods acceptable for inventory valuation for tax (and accounting) purposes are standard cost, average (weighted) cost, first in first out (FIFO), and last in first out (LIFO).
## Capital gains
There is no separate capital gains tax. 
Revenues and related costs are qualified to one of two baskets: 'capital gains' and 'operational activity'. Income (loss) from each of these baskets is disclosed separately. Apart from share/capital transactions, the capital basket will include royalties, license fees, and similar rights. 
## Dividend income
Dividends distributed by Polish residents (domestic dividends), although they fall under the capital gains basket, are subject to a 19% WHT, which is withheld and remitted to the tax office by the payer of dividends. 
For the purpose of applying Polish WHT rules, the term ’dividends‘ should be understood as encompassing certain other revenues (incomes) from participation in profits of legal persons having their seat or management office within the territory of the Republic of Poland, including, among others, the income from liquidation of a company and the income from the redemption of shares (with the exception of gain from voluntary redemption). The revenue arising from voluntary redemption of shares is treated as a capital gain subject to the 19% CIT rate in Poland (if the gain is realised by a taxpayer from a non-treaty country or the treaty includes a so-called 'real estate clause'), but it does not enjoy the benefits of the participation exemption (i.e. the method of redemption, whether voluntary or automatic, will matter). 
The WHT rate on the dividend might be reduced based on the applicable DTT provisions (with regard to non-residents) or participation exemption rules (both to residents and non-residents).
### Domestic dividend income
Based on a participation exemption, domestic dividends are not subject to the 19% WHT if the Polish beneficiary holds at least a 10% share in the paying company for at least two years (upon EU Directive-driven participation exemption, _described below_ , or new Polish holding company tax scheme, _described in the_ _section_).
### Dividend income from abroad
Generally, dividends received by a Polish corporate tax resident from a non-resident are treated as regular income and taxed at the standard CIT rate. CIT on such dividends withheld in other countries may be credited proportionally against Polish CIT.
Additionally, dividends received from entities seated in EU/EEA member states, or Switzerland, can benefit from CIT exemption if the Polish company owns, respectively, at least 10% (in respect to companies seated in the EU/EEA member states) or 25% (in respect to companies seated in Switzerland) in the share capital of the payer for two consecutive years (and certain other conditions are met).
Dividends received from non-EU/non-EEA member states may benefit from underlying tax credit. The deduction is only possible if the Polish company/company from EU/EEA, which PE is located in Poland, holds (for two consecutive years) at least 75% of shares of the dividend payer. The tax may be deducted in an appropriate proportion. Furthermore, the deduction is only possible if there is a DTT or other agreement concluded by Poland, upon which the Polish tax authority may exchange tax information with its counterparty.
### Anti-avoidance regulations
The participation exemption on dividends and other profit-sharing payments does not apply to the legal transaction or series of legal transactions that, having been put into place for the main purpose or one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax advantage, are not genuine, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances.
Based on the introduced provisions, a ‘not genuine’ legal transaction is such transaction that is undertaken in order to benefit from the tax exemption but does not reflect economic reality (i.e. it is not conducted for valid commercial reasons and its result is, in particular, transfer of shares’ ownership of the company paying the dividend or achieving, by this company, income [revenue] paid in the form of a dividend).
## Interest income
As a general rule, interest income is aggregated with income from operational activities; however, in certain cases, interest should be allocated to the capital gains basket (e.g. interest resulting from the loan, used to finance acquisition of shares).
Payments of interest (or capitalisation thereof to loan principal/set-off) made to non-residents are subject to WHT in Poland. The WHT rate applicable to interest is 20%. WHT exemption or a reduced WHT rate may apply, either based on the Polish tax law implementing Interest-Royalties Directive or on the DTTs (_see the section for details_).
## Royalty income
Revenues related to copyrights and related rights, licences, patents, and know-how (including rental or disposal thereof) should be allocated to the capital gains basket, except for (i) revenues arising from licences directly related to revenues not included in ‘capital gains’ basket and (ii) rights created by the taxpayer. Any other royalty income also falls to the income/loss from ‘operational activities’. 
The Innovation Box scheme reduces, to 5%, the tax rate applicable to income derived from IP rights (_see Innovation Box in the_ _section_).
Royalties paid to non-residents are subject to WHT in Poland. The domestic WHT rate applicable to royalties is 20%. WHT exemption or a reduced WHT rate may apply, either based on the Polish tax law implementing Interest-Royalties Directive or on the DTTs (_see the section for details_).
## Foreign income
Resident corporations are taxed on their worldwide income unless there is an applicable DTT in place between Poland and the relevant country that provides that the foreign income shall be exempt from taxation in Poland ( ).
Controlled foreign company (CFC) rules entered into force as of 1 January 2015 ().

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 22 July 2024
Polish CIT is, in general, due on income of legal persons, limited partnerships, and limited joint-stock partnerships, as well as general partnerships if it has any partner not being a natural person and does not submit information on shareholders (in other cases general partnerships are tax transparent).
Polish tax residents are subject to tax on their worldwide income, unless there is an applicable double tax treaty (DTT) in place exempting the foreign-sourced income from taxation in Poland. Non-residents are taxed only on their Polish-sourced income. DTTs may result in specific income being not taxable in Poland, irrespective of its source.
The standard CIT rate is 19%.
The reduced CIT rate of 9% can be applied to income, other than capital gains, if the taxpayer:
  * is a small taxpayer (i.e. taxpayer whose value of sales revenue, including the amount of VAT due, did not exceed the amount corresponding to the PLN equivalent of 2 million euros (EUR) in the previous fiscal year) or
  * started its business activity, provided the establishment of the company was not a result of transformation or merger (in the first tax year).


The lower rate does not apply to tax capital groups nor companies created as a result of certain restructuring operations (mergers, contribution of a going concern, etc.).
In addition to the general CIT obligation, Polish taxpayers may be subject to additional income tax under special tax regimes, including:
  * Minimum Income Tax: imposed on taxpayers declaring tax losses or negligible income (below 2% of revenue),
  * 'Diverted Profits' Tax,
  * Minimum Tax on ’deemed‘ taxpayer’s income from Buildings: calculated based on the initial value of the taxpayer’s buildings over PLN 10 million,
  * Global Minimum Tax rules (known as Pillar 2): top-up taxation introduced as of 1 January 2025,


(these regulations are elaborated below)
  * and Income of CFCs (further discussed in the section on Group Taxation).


Polish taxpayers can choose an independent income taxation system known as 'Estonian CIT'. Under this system, CIT is generally paid only when income is distributed, such as through dividends. However, specific, stricter rules apply to the other taxable events, such as ‘hidden profits’.
Revenues resulting from the receipt of dividends, interest, and royalties are subject to special CIT withholding rates of 20% on interest and royalties (paid to non-residents) and 19% on dividends or other payments from participation in the profits of legal persons (paid to both residents and non-residents) (_see the section for more information_).
Income or loss is qualified to one of two baskets: sourced from capital transactions (‘capital gains’) and from other income/loss sources (also referred to as income/loss from ‘operational activities’) (_see the section for more information_). 
There is no limitation on the percentage of foreign participation in Polish resident companies. Such entities are subject to the general CIT rules. The same rules apply to branches of foreign companies (_see the section for more information_).
Certain entities are explicitly excluded from the group of taxpayers under the CIT law (e.g. Treasury, National Bank of Poland). Polish and EU/European Economic Area (EEA)-based investment funds are also exempted on the grounds of such provisions. 
Family foundations (introduced to the Polish legal system as of 22 May 2023) are exempt from CIT on the ongoing, permitted (statutory) activities. CIT liability arises only at the time of transfer of the benefit to the beneficiary (at 15% CIT rate). This solution is similar to the one used in the Estonian CIT mechanism.
## Minimum income tax
Minimum income tax is a new tax obligation that is applicable to taxpayers declaring tax losses or negligible income (≤ 2% of revenue).
The regulations were initially introduced as of 1 January 2022. However, upon a postponement, the minimum tax is applicable from 1 January 2024, and the first payment will occur in 2025.
The minimum income tax rate is 10%. 
The tax base is calculated as a sum of the following:
  * 1.5% of operational revenues (other than from capital gains), plus
  * ’excessive‘ debt financing costs paid to related entities (generally debt financing costs exceeding 30% of the so-called ‘tax EBITDA’), plus
  * costs of intangible services or royalties paid to related entities exceeding PLN 3 million plus 5% of the so-called ‘tax EBITDA’.


It is possible to choose an alternative method of determining the tax base amounting to 3% of the value of revenues other than from capital gains in the tax year.
The provisions provide for a list of reductions from the tax base (e.g. the amounts of donations or R&D relief, for prototypes and robotisation, Special Economic Zone (SEZ) / Poland Investment Zone (PIZ) revenue, the value of expenses included in the tax year as deductible costs resulting from the acquisition, production, or improvement of fixed assets, including through depreciation).
The minimum income tax does not apply, _inter alia_ , to financial enterprises, start-ups, entities whose profitability in any of three prior years was no less than 2%, and taxpayers who recorded over 30% decrease in revenues.
The amount of the minimum tax paid for a given tax year may be deducted from the due CIT calculated using the traditional method for the consecutive three tax years immediately following the year for which the taxpayer has paid the minimum income tax.
## Exit tax
The concept of exit tax exists in Poland and assumes a taxation of unrealised capital gains in the case of transfer of assets, change of tax residence (including cross-border transformation, which may be interpreted as cross-border mergers), or change of taxpayer's PE outside the territory of Poland. The exit tax rate is established at 19%. The tax base is the surplus of the market value of assets, with respect to which Poland would lose taxing rights, over their tax value. Under certain conditions, taxpayers may be able to apply for payment in instalments for a period not exceeding five years.
## Optional tax rules (so-called ‘Estonian CIT’)
From 2021, a new, optional, and autonomous system of taxation of companies was introduced into the Polish legal system, commonly referred to as 'Estonian CIT'. In this model, the tax is paid only when the income is distributed (e.g. in the form of a dividend). In 2022 and 2023, important amendments with regard to the scope and application of the lump-sum scheme of Estonian CIT were introduced. 
The main advantages of switching to Estonian CIT taxation are:
  * lack of separate accounting for tax purposes (tax settlement is based on the net profit calculated for P&L purposes)
  * tax due only when profits are distributed and is calculated on the amounts of distributions (not on reinvested profits), and
  * as a rule, tax payment deadline is deferred until the year following the year when distribution takes place and there are no tax advances (however, specific short deadlines apply to the other taxable events indicated below, such as ‘hidden profits’).


The scheme is addressed to entities operating as joint-stock companies, limited liability companies, simple joint stock companies, limited partnerships, or limited joint-stock partnerships that meet the following criteria:
  * The shareholders are exclusively natural persons.
  * The company has no shares in other entities.
  * The company employs, apart from the shareholders, at least three employees on the basis of an employment contract (or at least three persons engaged on the basis of other contracts, provided that it incurs monthly salary expenditures in the amount of at least three times the average monthly salary).
  * Passive revenue (such as interest, copyrights etc.) does not exceed 50% of all company revenues obtained from its activities in the previous tax year, calculated including the amount of output VAT.


The lump-sum tax on income is accrued at the moment of the distribution of profit and in a different amount than the standard CIT. In order to avoid abuses, the tax base is extended to other events similar to distributions to shareholders, such as ‘hidden profits’ (i.e. all kinds of benefits towards [directly or indirectly] a shareholder or a related entity), expenses not related to business activities (e.g. 50% of exploitation costs of passenger cars in case of the use not exclusively for business activity), or revenues and costs of undisclosed business operations.
The deadline for paying the lump-sum tax falls by the end of the third month of the tax year following the year in which the profit was distributed. Specific deadlines apply to the other taxable events.
For small taxpayers and for taxpayers starting business activity on these principles, it is 10% of the tax base. In the case of other taxpayers, it is 20% of the tax base. 
Considering PIT due from shareholders on profit distribution (at 19%) and special mechanism of reduction of PIT liability for shareholders of companies using “Estonian CIT”, the effective tax rate (i.e. combined CIT and PIT taxation) for Estonian CIT with regard to amounts calculated to the tax base (assuming it is applied by the taxpayer for the period of four tax years) is:
  * approximately 21% for non-small taxpayers (instead of 34.4% on regular CIT rules), and
  * approximately 18% for small taxpayers (instead of 26.3% on regular CIT rules).


## Family foundations
With the introduction of the legal form of a family foundation into the Polish legal system with effect from 22 May 2023, tax laws have been amended with regard to taxation of economic events related to the operation of family foundations, in particular in the field of CIT.
A family foundation is generally exempt from CIT. This exemption is not complete and does not apply to all tax-significant events from the perspective of the family foundation. In particular, the exemption does not apply to the following transferred or made available by a family foundation (directly or indirectly):
  * Benefits provided to beneficiaries in accordance with the principles of operation of the foundation (regardless of which group the beneficiary belongs to).
  * Property transferred due to the dissolution of a family foundation (so-called ’post-liquidation property’).
  * Benefits in the form of hidden profits.


Income tax is 15% of the tax base. The tax base is the revenue corresponding to the value of the benefit or property transferred. In the event of dissolution of a family foundation, the revenue is reduced by the tax value of the property contributed by the founder or founders. A structure was used here in which CIT liability arises only at the time of payment/transfer of the benefit to the beneficiary. This solution is similar to the one used in the Estonian CIT mechanism.
Revenues from business activities other than permitted activities (i.e. ’non-statutory‘ activities) are subject to ongoing taxation at a sanctioned CIT rate of 25%.
The CIT exemption for a family foundation also does not apply to the minimum tax on revenues from buildings.
## Diverted profits tax
In 2022, the new provisions regarding ’diverted profits tax‘ were implemented (as part of the Polish Deal reform programme). The Act of 7 October 2022 amending, among others, the CIT Act (Polish Deal 3.0) introduced further amendments to the provision on diverted profits that apply as of 1 January 2023. Some of the introduced changes were defined as clarifying ones, having impact not only on the income achieved in 2023 but also on settlements for the tax year 2022.
This tax can be imposed at 19% on ’diverted profits‘, understood as certain qualified costs (e.g. intangible services, royalties, debt financing cost, or payments for transfer of functions, assets, or risks) incurred for the benefit of non-resident-related entities and treated as tax-deductible by the Polish taxpayer, provided that:
  * the income tax paid by the recipient, with regard to a specific type of income of this entity from one of the individual titles listed in qualified costs list (e.g. income from interest, consulting services, or royalties), for the year in which it received the due amount from the Polish company is lower than 14.25% (¾ of the standard Polish CIT rate of 19%), tax exempt, or excluded from the CIT
  * on the side of the payment recipient, such qualified costs borne by the Polish taxpayer or by other Polish companies related to the Polish taxpayer constitute at least 50% of the revenue obtained by that foreign related entity, and
  * the payment recipient transfers at least 10% of the profits received from the Polish taxpayer and this taxpayer’s related Polish entities to another entity (in the form of expenses deductible for tax purposes or distribution of profits).


Diverted profits tax is payable if the sum of qualified costs incurred in a tax year towards related entities constitutes not less than 3% of the sum of tax-deductible costs incurred by the Polish taxpayer in that year in any form. 
Since 2023, the burden of proving that a given expense does not meet the definition of diverted profit rests on all Polish taxpayers making payments to foreign related entities.
As a ’safe harbour‘ mechanism, the ’diverted profits tax‘ should not apply if the above costs are incurred for the benefit of a related entity subject to taxation on its worldwide income in the EU/EEA (assuming that this entity conducts a genuine and material business activity). The assessment of whether actual economic activity is material takes into account, in particular, the ratio of revenues obtained by the related entity from its actual economic activity to its total revenues.
The 'diverted income' is not combined with other income (revenue) of the taxpayer.
## Minimum tax on buildings
Minimum tax on buildings is a special type of tax on ’deemed‘ taxpayer’s income from buildings, i.e. initial value of the taxpayer’s buildings, decreased by PLN 10 million.
The basic principles regarding minimum tax on buildings are as follows:
  * It is calculated separately from the ’regular‘ CIT.
  * Currently, all types of commercial buildings subject to lease/tenancy (including hotels) fall within its scope.
  * It is payable on a monthly basis at the rate of 0.035% (which roughly translates to the rate of 0.42% per annum).
  * It may be set-off against ’regular‘ CIT liability. Therefore, in practice, minimum tax on buildings results in additional tax burden only if: (i) no regular CIT is paid by the taxpayer or (ii) the taxpayer’s regular CIT is lower than the minimum tax on buildings.
  * If this minimum tax is higher than the ’regular‘ CIT, the excess may be refunded by the tax office provided that no irregularities in regular CIT are identified in the course of a special proceeding initiated by the taxpayer.


## Local income taxes
There are no provincial or local income taxes in Poland.
## Global Minimum Tax - Pillar 2
**General information**
As of 1 January 2025, a top-up taxation based on Global Minimum Tax (“GMT”) rules was introduced to Polish tax laws. 
The GMT based on EU Directive/ OECD Model Rules applies to international and domestic capital groups with a total annual revenue of at least EUR 750 million in at least two of the four tax years immediately preceding the tax year in question.
This reform seeks to align Poland’s tax system with global standards, imposing additional tax on under-taxed profits and ensuring a consistent minimum tax rate across jurisdictions.
The newly adopted rules will affect both parent companies of the above-mentioned capital groups and subsidiaries of foreign capital groups operating in Poland (due to the introduction of Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-Up tax (“QDMTT”). 
The transitional provisions provide for the optional possibility of applying the Act retroactively, starting on 1 January 2024, based on the irrevocable choice made. This option is applicable to IIR and QDMTT, while UTPR is not applicable retroactively.
The Polish Act is aimed at introducing three types of top-up tax:
  * global top-up tax levied under Income Inclusion Rule (“IIR”),
  * QDMTT, and
  * top-up tax levied under Undertaxed Profits Rule (“UTPR”).

**Tax** | **Essence of tax** | **Which companies will be affected?**  
---|---|---  
IIR | The group's parent company, in the jurisdiction where seated, should pay top-up tax on itself and its low-tax subsidiaries | Companies with a parent company in Poland  
QDMTT | The top-up tax is levied in the country where the low-taxed constituent entities of the group are located. | Companies located in Poland.  
UTPR |  A top-up tax is levied in a given jurisdiction in situations where the parent company operates in a jurisdiction where there is no IIR or QDMTT does not apply. | Companies of capital groups whose parent company is located in a jurisdiction that has not implemented Pillar 2.  
The key aspect of the QDMTT is the collection of the top-up tax, aimed at bringing the effective tax rate (“ETR”) of the particular group in Poland to 15% at the domestic level. 
In practice, if the ETR on business activity in Poland is less than 15% and the substance based income exclusion is not sufficient, an obligation to pay QDMTT will arise in Poland. 
The assumption remains that the Polish QDMTT is to meet the conditions to be treated as QDMTT by other jurisdictions (the so-called QDMTT safe harbor) which mean that the mechanism of collecting top-up tax on the profits of Polish companies will not be applicable in the jurisdiction of the parent company.
Apart from the potential additional burden of having to pay the top-up tax, the new rules will also require companies to collect a large volume of data points and might result in a significant compliance burden. This means that groups subject to the QDMTT will have to monitor changes in the values affected at the calculation of the tax.
**Potential registration and compliance obligations under the Polish Act**
The Polish Act does not provide information on the necessity of additional registration for the Pillar 2 purposes in Poland. 
**GloBE Information Return**
The Polish Act provides for the obligation to submit a GloBE Information Return (“GIR”). At the moment, GIR can only be filed locally. However, we expect a change in EU regulations, which will allow only UPE or another designated CE to file GIR on behalf of the entire MNE group.
In general GIR will be submitted by the end of the 15th month following the end of that tax year. There are also transitional provisions for the first tax year for which relevant a group will be obliged to apply the Polish Act, stating GIR will should be submitted by the end of the 18th month following the end of that tax year. However, this provision seems to be applied only if the election to apply new laws as of 1 January 2024 has been made or only in 2025 in the case if the group starting business activities in counties (jurisdictions) which have implemented Pillar 2 rules in 2024. An exemption from the obligation to submit GIR by Polish companies may be utilised if
IIR, QDMTT and UTPR taxpayers will be obliged to submit Polish tax returns of a given tax year to the competent tax office by the end of the 18th month following the end of this tax year and pay the tax resulting from this return within this deadline. Similarly to GIR, transitional provisions provide for deadline extension - until the end of the 21th month following the end of this tax year - under the same conditions.
As part of the Pillar 2 rules, Polish Act introduced the so-called Transitional Safe Harbour Rule (“TSHR”) in order to lower the administrative burden of complying with said new rules during the first three financial years (i.e. FY24-26).
TSHR provides temporary relief by exempting from full Pillar 2 calculations and potential payment of top-up taxes for jurisdictions which meet at least one of the provided three tests. (de minimis, simplified ETR, and routine profits tests). Also, an additional election must be made by the entity submitting the GIR to be able to use TSHR.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 22 July 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
Polish VAT applies to the following activities:
  * Supplies of goods and services within the territory of Poland.
  * Exports of goods outside the territory of the European Union.
  * Imports of goods into the territory of Poland from countries that do not belong to the European Union.
  * Intra-Community acquisitions of goods (imports to Poland from countries belonging to the European Union).
  * Intra-Community supplies of goods (exports to the countries belonging to the European Union).


### VAT rates
The VAT rates are 23% (standard rate), 8%, 5%, 0%, and exemption.
The standard 23% VAT rate generally applies to the supply of all goods and services, except for those that are covered by special VAT provisions that provide other rates or treatments.
Supplies covered by a reduced rate of 8% include, among others, supplies of pharmaceutical products and passenger transport services and also supply of goods for the Social Housing Programme (no greater than 150 square metres in the case of residential units and 300 square metres in the case of single-family buildings).
Supplies covered by a reduced rate of 5% include books and journals, unprocessed food, and basic food.
Zero-rated activities include, among others, exports of goods to countries outside the European Union.
VAT-exempt supplies include, among others, certain financial, insurance, and educational services.
### Basic calculation rules
In general, the VAT due equals the VAT on outputs decreased by the VAT on inputs (in other words, input VAT is deducted from output VAT). Input VAT may be deducted from output VAT when a business (with a VAT payer status) receives an invoice with VAT amoun for goods or services purchased. Input VAT may not be deducted unless a purchased supply is linked to the VATable activities. Furthermore, the deductibility of input VAT is restricted by the VAT law with respect to the purchase of certain goods and services. In addition, subject to numerous conditions, output VAT may be reduced when receivables, resulting from VATable sales, become uncollectible.
### 'White list' of VAT payers
The ‘white list’ of VAT payers is the electronic database of taxpayers registered for VAT purposes in Poland. 
The list contains data on the VAT status of the entities that were, in particular:
  * not registered for VAT purposes (or were de-registered), and
  * registered as VAT payers (i.e. data on active and exempt VAT taxpayers), including entities whose registration as VAT payers has been restored.


The list is extended by the additional data (e.g. bank accounts numbers indicated in the tax forms filed to the tax office).
Obligation to settle expenses with use of bank accounts mentioned in the white list is applicable to B2B transactions exceeding a value of PLN 15,000 (or its equivalent in a foreign currency). Expenses paid via transfer to a bank account not included in the list cannot be treated as a tax-deductible cost. Additionally, payments made to accounts not included in the list result in joint and several liability for VAT obligations of the supplier, in the amount equal to the VAT proportionally attributable to the transaction. 
The above sanctions do not apply,in particular, if the taxpayer notifies the head of the tax office about the payment made to an account other than the one included in the list within seven days from the date of the payment being ordered.
### Split payment system in VAT settlements
The split payment mechanism is a method designed to improve VAT compliance and reduce fraud in B2B transactions. It assumes that the bank transfer is divided into net amount and VAT; the VAT amount is credited to a dedicated bank account of the seller. Cash deposited in a VAT account can be used only to pay VAT liability or other tax liabilities (among others CIT, PIT, excise duty, customs duty) and social security (ZUS) contributions or to pay the VAT shown on acquisition invoices to the supplier’s VAT account. Cash in a VAT account may only be sourced from VAT payments made by acquirers or refunds of VAT from tax authorities.
Obligatory split payment applies only to transactions between taxpayers, which are subject to VAT in Poland, documented by invoices in which the total amount of receivables exceeds PLN 15,000 (gross) or its equivalent in a foreign currency. Foreign entities settling transactions by bank transfers, subject to VAT in Poland, are required to open a bank account in Poland.
The obligatory split payment mechanism applies to 150 product and service groups determined in accordance with the Polish Classification of Products and Services (PKWiU) of 2015.
In general, the following groups of goods and services can be distinguished:
  * Steel products, precious metals, non-ferrous metals.
  * Waste, scrap, recyclable materials.
  * Electronics, specifically processors, smartphones, phones, tablets, netbooks, laptops, game consoles, inks, toners, hard drives.
  * Fuels for cars, fuel and lubricating oils.
  * Greenhouse gas emission rights.
  * Building and constructions services.
  * Coal.
  * Sale of car and motorcycle parts.


### International services
The treatment of international services largely depends on the place of supply since it is determinative of whether particular services are subject to the Polish VAT. The Polish VAT applies only to those services that are considered as supplied within Poland.
### Reporting rules
The taxpayers in Poland are obliged to report VAT in the form of SAF-T (Standard Audit File) for VAT (the so-called JPK_VAT or JPK_V7 files). SAF-T files for VAT generally contain both VAT return part and VAT records part (including specific information about sales and purchase transactions).
Generally, the VAT reporting period is one month; quarterly reconciliation of VAT may apply to small taxpayers. There is no annual VAT reporting in Poland. VAT should be reported and reconciled by the 25th day of the month (or first working day after that date) following the VAT reporting period.
Alongside SAF-T for VAT the EC Sales and Purchase list (the so-called VAT-UE declaration) is a crucial document for businesses engaged in intra-community transactions within the European Union. VAT-UE is a reporting document in which the taxpayer reports the transactions carried out in a given period: intra-Community acquisition of goods, intra-Community supply of goods, intra-Community supply of services and movement of goods in a call-off stock warehouse procedure to the territory of a Member State other than the territory of the country. The statutory deadline for submitting the VAT-UE declaration is the 25th day (or first working day after that date) of the month following each subsequent month.
### VAT refunds
The Polish VAT law allows direct refunds when input VAT (available for deduction) exceeds output VAT. The standard time for processing VAT refunds is 60 days. In some cases, the refund can be expedited to 25 days with specific criteria and additional documentation. The 180 days deadline is applicable if no supplies are reported for the same period. The deadline for VAT refund may also be extended if additional verification is needed by tax authorities.
A Polish business may also be entitled to the VAT refund owed by another country under certain circumstances. Likewise, a foreign business having a seat or fixed place of business for VAT purposes outside of Poland may be, in most cases, entitled to the refund of Polish VAT. If the respective countries belong to the European Union, the procedure is substantially simplified due to the EU Directive, which provides favourable rules for businesses based in EU countries that are seeking VAT refunds in other EU countries (i.e. electronic VAT refunds are possible).
### Invoices and e-Invoices
Under Polish VAT regulations, the timing and requirements for issuing VAT invoices are critical for compliance. As a rule, VAT invoices must be issued no later than the 15th day of the month following the month in which the delivery of goods or the provision of services took place. At the same time, the Polish VAT provisions allow for the issuance of VAT invoices prior to the delivery of goods or the provision of services. However, as a rule, they can be issued not earlier than 60 days before planned supplies.
Currently, invoices can be issued in any format - electronic or paper one. However, the electronic invoicing (e.g. pdf) required the prior buyer’s consent (in practice, it is confirmed as part of a contract with the buyer). 
Regardless of the above, the National System of e-Invoice (the so-called KSeF) is currently implemented in Poland. Once KSeF comes into force, generally invoices have to be issued in the structured XML format via governmental platform. 
At this moment KSeF based e-invoicing might be used on a voluntary basis. The obligatory KSeF will be effective from 1 February 2026 (for taxpayers whose turnover exceeds 200 M PLN in a preceding year) or 1 April 2026 (for other taxpayers).
### VAT group
_The option to form a VAT group introduced to the Polish tax system (available to taxpayers as of 2023) is discussed in the section._
## Customs duties
As a member of the European Union, Poland belongs to a customs union, thus only goods imported from non-EU countries or exported from Poland to non-EU countries are subject to customs duties and formalities. Moreover, all the Union customs regulations are directly applicable in Poland. The most important act is the Union Customs Code and its implementing provisions, as well as the EU Customs Tariff.
These regulations are supplemented with certain Polish national rules, especially in respect to procedures and specific areas that are not defined in the EU customs law (e.g. strict regulations concerning the export of works of art and animals, limits on the amount of cash that may be brought from Poland to non-EU countries).
One of the major changes in customs operations (export) is the introduction of a new version of the EU export control system (AES/ECS2 PLUS), which is planned to be fully operational by 2024. This system is supposed to simplify and harmonise the customs procedures and formalities for the export of goods from the European Union to third countries, as well as to enhance the security and safety of the trade flows.
The AES/ECS2 PLUS was initially supposed to be implemented by all the EU member states by December 2023, but Poland (along with some other member states) decided to postpone the implementation until May 2024, due to the technical and organisational challenges involved.
The main implication of the new system version for the Polish exporters is the elimination of the possibility of using the simplified procedure of an entry in the declarant's records (EIDR) in the approved place. This procedure allows the exporters to declare the goods for export by making an entry in their own records, without the necessity to present the goods to the customs authorities each time, and to provide supplementary information later.
Under the AES/ECS2 PLUS, the exporters will have to use the standard procedure (or the simplified declaration) for the export of goods, which means that they will have to submit an electronic declaration to the customs authorities before the goods leave the European Union, and to present the goods and the declaration to the customs authorities at the customs office of exit.
Another of the most important novelties already introduced in January 2024 in the field of EU’s customs regulations is the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). The regulation is aimed at equating the situation of producers manufacturing goods in the European Union (where restrictions on reducing greenhouse gas emissions are already in force) with producers transferring production to third countries in order to reduce their costs.
The mechanism will initially apply only to certain goods (but be careful, that is in broad understanding) from the following list: cement, iron and steel, aluminium, fertilisers, and electricity.
In fact, the year 2024 is only the beginning of the transitional period that will last until the end of 2025. During this period, importers of the abovementioned goods are required to report gas emissions embedded in their imports, thus it only applies to direct emissions and no payment is required.
Once the full system is operational as of 1 January 2026, the importers will be compelled to purchase certificates at a cost equal to the carbon price that would be requested for the goods manufactured under the EU's carbon pricing rules. This will effectively correspond to additional duties collected at the EU border upon import.
## Excise duties
Excise duties are levied on the production, sale, import, and intra-Community acquisition of ‘excise goods’, which are listed in the excise duty law and include (among others) alcohol, cigarettes, energy products (e.g. petrol, oils, gas), passenger cars, and electricity.
Depending on the excise goods in question, one of four methods of calculating excise tax may be applicable:
  * A percentage of the taxable base.
  * An amount per unit.
  * A percentage of the maximum retail price.
  * An amount per unit and a percentage of the maximum retail price.


The excise rate for car petrol is PLN 1,529 per 1,000 litres.
Passenger cars are subject to the following excise rates:
  * 3.1% for cars with engine cubic capacity that does not exceed 2,000 cc.
  * 18.6% for cars with engine cubic capacity that exceeds 2,000 cc.


Notwithstanding the above, Polish excise duty law provides for a wide system of excise duty exemptions as well as 0% taxation. Under specified circumstances, such preferential treatment may apply to specified goods that are otherwise taxed based on general rules. This concerns, mostly, specific energy products used for other purposes than as a fuel or for heating.
There is also an excise duty placed on coal. Depending on the product, the excise duty rates for energy products are for coal and coke intended for heating purposes. The rates are PLN 32.84 per 1,000 kg of coal, PLN 11.87 per 1,000 kg of lignite, and PLN 37.95 per 1,000 kg of coke. In practice, there are a wide range of excise duty exemptions (practically, Poland has used all the exemption options provided in the EU Directive); nevertheless, many new administrative obligations have been set for entities producing, distributing, and using coal. The fulfilment of those obligations is necessary in order to apply an excise duty exemption.
On 1 February 2021, the Central Register of Excise Entities was launched. Information on the use of excise goods by entities from all over the country is collected in the Register.
## Property taxes
Property tax is imposed on the following real properties: 
  * Buildings or parts of buildings: Taxed on usable area.
  * Structures or parts of structures, only if used for an economic activity: Taxed on initial value adopted for tax purposes, not reduced by depreciation write-offs of 2% per annum. 
  * Land (if not subject to the farming tax): Taxed on area.


Property tax rates with regard to buildings and land are established on a yearly basis by municipalities within limits set in the Law on Local Taxes and Fees. In general, rate limits vary depending on the purpose of the property. The highest rates apply to business premises, and the lowest to residential buildings. In 2024, land used for business purposes is subject to a rate limit of PLN 1.34 per square metre, buildings used for business purposes are subject to a rate limit of PLN 33.10 per square metre, and residential buildings are subject to a rate limit of PLN 1.15 per square metre (year-on-year increase in rates by approximately 15%).
Taxpayers liable to property tax are individuals and other entities that are:
  * the owners or independent possessors of properties
  * possessors of properties that are state-owned, or
  * permanent landholders.


Legal persons submit tax returns for a given tax year by 31 January to the local authority competent for the location of the objects of taxation. The tax should be paid in monthly instalments by the 15th day of each month (with exception for the first instalment in a given year by 31 January).
## Transfer taxes
A transfer tax (civil law activities tax) may apply to certain civil law transactions (i.e. sale, loan, donation), determined as a percentage of the transaction value. Sale and exchange are taxed at 1% (property rights) or at 2% (tangibles and real estate), with the market value being the tax basis. Loans are taxed at 0.5%. 
The law provides a number of exemptions, including an exemption for transactions that are subject to VAT or where at least one of the parties of the transaction is exempt from VAT. This exemption is not applicable to VAT-exempt transactions on shares or real estate.
In 2023, the exemption from civil law activities tax for the purchase of the first apartment or single-family residential house on the secondary market was introduced (as a rule, transactions on the secondary market are exempt from VAT and taxed at 2% transfer tax). The exemption is available if the buyer is a natural person or natural persons, and none of them is entitled to any of such rights or shares in these rights on the date of purchase and was not entitled to them before that date. The exception applies to persons who, before the transaction date, acquired a share that does not exceed 50% and was acquired by inheritance.
In turn, from 1 January 2024, an additional tax on civil law activities applies. Buyers of more than five residential premises constituting separate properties in one or more buildings built on one plot of land should pay 6% from purchasing the sixth and subsequent premise - also the transactions concluded the primary market subject to VAT will be subject to this tax.
## Stamp duty
In Poland, some activities are charged a stamp duty. Payment is required, for example, in connection with the submission of a power of attorney, after completion of an official act, or the issue of a certificate or permit.
## Capital tax
A share capital increase (in case of corporations, i.e. limited liability companies and joint-stock companies) and contribution increase (in case of partnerships) is subject to a 0.5% capital tax (civil law activities tax), payable by a company or partnership that receives a capital contribution.
A merger, division, or transformation of a corporation into another corporation is not subject to capital tax, even if the transaction results in a share capital increase. A similar exemption applies to a capital increase resulting from (i) an in-kind contribution of an enterprise or its organised part or (ii) a qualified share-for-share exchange concerning corporations.
## Payroll taxes
There are no payroll taxes other than social security contributions (_see below_) as a financial burden for employers. Employers are required to pay employee’s remuneration under deduction of the income tax due, acting as tax remitters.
## Social security contributions
Both the employer and the employee are obligated to contribute to the Polish social security system (including retirement, disability, sickness, accident and health insurance, labour fund, and guaranteed employee benefits fund). Apart from paying its own share, the employer is obligated to withhold the employee‘s share of the social security contributions and remit them to the Social Security Authorities (ZUS). In both cases, the relevant payments shall be made monthly.
The employer pays total contributions in a range of 19.48% to 22.14% of the employee’s gross salary (the employer’s contribution rate includes an accident insurance element that varies according to the number of employees insured and the business sector). The contribution rate for the employee is 13.71% of gross salary on social security and 9% of the base (income minus the sum of the employee's social security contributions) on statutory health insurance. The social security shares payable by the employer and the employee are tax-deductible items in their respective income tax settlements. The statutory health contribution is non-deductible for employees either from the tax base or the income tax.
The rates of retirement and disability contributions apply to yearly salaries below the cap of PLN 260,190 in 2025. The cap changes every year. After exceeding this cap, the salary is subject to a contribution rate in a range of 3.22% to 5.88% payable by the employer and 2.45% (sickness insurance) payable by the employee.
## Tax on certain financial institutions
A tax on certain financial institutions (so-called ‘banking tax’) is levied on:
  * Banks, branches of foreign banks, branches of credit institutions, and credit unions.
  * Insurance companies, reinsurance companies, branches of international insurance companies and international reinsurance companies, and main branches of international insurance companies and international reinsurance companies.
  * The lending institutions within the meaning of the Consumer Credit Act.


Tax at the rate 0.44% per year (0.0366% per month) is levied on the assets of the taxpayers less (i) PLN 4 billion in case of banks, (ii) PLN 2 billion in case of (re-)insurance companies, and (iii) PLN 200 million in case of lending institutions. In case of (re-)insurance companies and lending companies, tax is levied on the consolidated assets of the capital group companies.
## Retail tax
On 1 September 2016, the Retail Tax Act of 6 July 2016 entered into force, but was quickly suspended due to an EC investigation into the Polish tax on the retail sector. After several postponements, this law came into force on 1 January 2021.
Based on the Retail Tax Act, retailers are to be taxed on the revenues achieved on retail sales, which should be understood as sales of goods to consumers for remuneration, in case an agreement is concluded on the business premises or away from business premises of the given taxpayer. Thus, e-commerce sales should not be subject to this tax. In this context, the services associated with retail sales should also be subject to taxation, unless they are recorded separately than the sale of goods.
### Retail tax rates
The retail tax should be imposed on the excess of revenues over the amount of PLN 17 million, calculated, in principle, based on the turnover registered by the cash registers. The Act introduces two tax rates: 0.8% of the tax base for the given month, in the part not exceeding the amount of PLN 170 million, and 1.4% of the excess of the tax base, in the part exceeding the amount of PLN 170 million.
The retailers shall be obligated to submit tax returns and calculate and pay retail tax in the monthly settlement periods. However, no tax return must be submitted in case the revenues in the given month do not exceed the value of PLN 17 million.
### Retail tax exemptions
The Retail Tax Act includes certain exemptions from taxation, among others, in respect of:
  * energy, water, natural gas, and heat supply to consumers made by network utilities
  * supply of some fuels designated for heating fuel purposes, and
  * supply of medicines, special purpose nutrition, and reimbursed or partially refunded medical products.


In the period from 1 January 2022 to 30 June 2023, retail sales of motor gasoline, diesel oil, and gases intended to power engines were not subject to tax.
## Capacity fee
The capacity fee is a new item (introduced as of 2021) on the bills for electricity consumed by each consumer. The capacity fee is collected, _inter alia_ , from end users connected directly to the transmission network and electricity distribution system operators. 
The power charge in 2024, depending on annual energy consumption, will be:
  * Below 500 kWh: PLN 2.66.
  * From 500 kWh to 1,200 kWh: PLN 6.39.
  * Between 1,200 kWh and 2,800 kWh: PLN 10.64.
  * Above 2,800 kWh: PLN 14.90.


For other groups of customers, the charge depends on the amount of electricity taken from the grid during selected hours of the day (on working days from 7:00 a.m. to 9:59 p.m.) and will amount in 2024 to PLN 0.1267 /kWh (compared to PLN 0.1024/kWh in 2023).
## Sugar tax and fee on alcoholic beverages
The fee on foodstuffs, the so-called 'sugar tax', was imposed on beverages with added sugars, sweeteners, and caffeine or taurine. The amount of the sugar tax is:
  * PLN 0.50 for the content of sugars in an amount equal to or less than 5 g in 100 ml of drink, or for the content of at least one sweetener in any amount.
  * PLN 0.05 for each gram of sugar above 5 g in 100 ml of drink. 


Drinks containing the addition of caffeine or taurine will be charged a fee of PLN 0.10 per litre of drink. This fee will be paid, among others, by entities supplying retail stores.
The fee for the permit for domestic wholesale trade in alcoholic beverages with alcohol content above and below 18% will be imposed on alcoholic beverages in unit packages with a nominal quantity of the drink not exceeding 300 ml.
## Product fee - quasi taxation in Poland
According to the Polish Waste Act, every entity is required to enter the waste register if they introduce to Poland (meaning production, import, or intra-Community acquisition to Poland to be used or sold) the following categories of product:
  * Products in packaging.
  * Packaging.
  * Electric and electronic equipment.
  * Lubricating oils/preparations.
  * Batteries.


Apart from registration, entities introducing products to the market are required to calculate and cover product fee (on an annual basis) or ensure recycling of certain amount of products similar to those that were introduced by the entrepreneur (e.g. if you introduce plastic packaging, you need to ensure recycling of plastic packaging; it does not have to be the same packaging). The obligation applies also to companies who only have VAT registration in Poland (i.e. they do not have to be established in Poland).
The legal changes related to implementation to Polish law of subsequent regulations implementing Directive (EU) 2019/904 of 5 June 2019 on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment have imposed new obligations towards entrepreneurs running a retail trade, wholesale trade, or catering, _inter alia_ ,:
  * From 24 May 2023:
    * Obligation to keep records of the number of purchased and issued single-use plastic products that are packaging.
  * From 1 January 2024:
    * Obligation to collect fees from end users purchasing single-use plastic products, or food or beverages packaged in single-use plastic products.
    * Obligation to submit an annual report on products, packaging, and waste management in the dedicated register (for the first time, the report will be submitted for 2023 by 15 March 2024. 
    * Obligation to pay the collected fees by 15 March of the year following the calendar year in which the fee was collected (for 2024 by 15 March 2025).
  * From 1 July 2024:
    * Obligation to ensure the availability of alternative packaging for single-use products, such as beverage cups and food containers.
