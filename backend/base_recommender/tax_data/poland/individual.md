## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 22 July 2024
## Foreign tax relief
When a Polish resident earns income in a foreign country that has not concluded a DTT with Poland, double taxation is avoided based on the credit method. The Polish resident is liable for income tax imposed on its worldwide income, but this tax is proportionately reduced by the income tax paid abroad. Numerous DTTs provide for the same credit method. However, some of them provide for the exemption method (i.e. foreign income covered by such a treaty is exempted from taxation in Poland).
## Tax abolition relief
The tax abolition relief was introduced to the Polish tax law in 2008 as a method of equalising the tax situation of people working in different countries and applying various methods of avoiding double taxation.
It uses a complex deduction system, which effectively allows Polish tax residents to use the exemption method for all their foreign incomes even if the applicable DTT states that the credit method should be used. However, this relief is not applicable to income earned in tax havens.
As of 2021, the application of the relief is limited to an amount not exceeding PLN 1,360.00 which means that only the non-Polish income up to PLN 8,000 will be exempted from the Polish taxation. This limitation does not apply to people who work offshore (i.e. seafarers).
### Limitation of the tax abolition relief vs the Multilateral Instrument to Modify Bilateral Tax Treaties (MLI)
Poland has ratified the MLI, under which the method of avoiding double taxation is changed to the tax credit method in many DTTs that Poland has concluded with other countries. Hence, the tax abolition relief could have a broader use than before the ratification of the MLI.
It is advisable to check which countries have ratified the MLI Convention changing the method of avoiding double taxation.

# Poland
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 22 July 2024
## Taxable period
The Polish tax year is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
The employer is obligated to file with the tax office the tax return, including information on the employee's income and tax advances withheld with respect to that income. The above tax return is filed only once for the whole year.
The final PIT settlement, in general, is made by individuals themselves. Individuals are obligated to submit the annual return for the tax year by 30 April of the following year. As a result of changes enacted on 1 July 2022, this deadline applies also to taxpayers who will reconcile income subject to lump-sum tax for the 2022 and the following tax years (previously they only had time until the end of February of the year following the year for which the tax return should be filed).
As of 1 January 2019, there is a possibility of completing the tax return forms by the tax authorities. The taxpayer has a possibility to revise the input data. Such prepared tax return form is considered as filed within the statutory deadline. This also reduces the risk of exceeding the deadline for filing.
Married taxpayers who are tax residents in Poland may, under some conditions, choose between filing their Polish tax return jointly or separately. Generally, it is more advantageous to file jointly if one of the spouses does not derive any income subject to taxation or if that person’s income is subject to a lower tax rate than the tax rate applicable to the income derived by the spouse.
Individuals may benefit from a joint reconciliation if the following conditions are fulfilled:
  * They are married for the entire tax year or from the date of marriage to the last day of the tax year.
  * Both have joint property co-ownership.
  * Neither of them conducts business activity that is taxed differently than at progressive tax rates up to 32%.


Moreover, taxpayers who are not resident of Poland also have the right to benefit from joint spousal taxation; however, in addition to the above, they need to meet the following conditions: (i) they have a place of residence in an EU/EEA country or in Switzerland and they have a tax residency certificate of this country, and (ii) at least 75% of their joint worldwide revenue is derived in Poland in a given year.
## Payment of tax
The employer is obligated to withhold the employee’s monthly advance payments. The advance payment for a particular month should be remitted by the 20th day of the following month.
The taxpayer has to pay the difference between the annual tax due and total amount of advance payments made during the year by 30 April of the following year.
## Individual bank accounts for taxes
As of 1 January 2020, each PIT, CIT, and VAT payer and remitter should transfer all of their Polish tax liabilities concerning the above taxes to their individual tax account (so called micro account) regardless of whether such payments will concern one’s liabilities for 2020 or for prior years. 
The micro account number is to remain the same even if one changes their residency address, firm’s seat, surname, or tax office that is relevant for a given taxpayer or tax remitter.
Each micro account will include one’s relevant tax identification number. For the majority of individual taxpayers, this number will be the PESEL number. For all corporate taxpayers, entrepreneurs, tax, or social security remitters, as well as certain groups of individuals (e.g. those conducting business activity or those not being subject to a PESEL register), the NIP number will be appropriate.
## Tax audit process
The control of Polish taxation is divided between two departments: fiscal offices, which administer and collect tax, and fiscal chambers, which deal with appeals against tax liabilities. The tax authorities must review the matter within two months after the appeal is submitted. An appeal does not stop collection of tax. However, collection may be suspended if it is reasonable, due to the interests of the taxpayer, or if the appeal is not considered within two months. 
If the above procedure is exhausted, a petition against an appeal decision can be made to the Administrative Court. The petition can be made by a taxpayer within 30 days of the final decision and by a prosecutor within six months, even if the proceedings have not been exhausted.
Tax audits on business activities of individuals are limited by the rules applicable to all entrepreneurs (_see the section in the Corporate tax summary_).
## Statute of limitations
Tax liability expires five years after the end of the calendar year in which the tax payment deadline passed. There are also situations when the statute of limitations can be suspended or interrupted (e.g. litigation).
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
In case of a tax refund resulting from the taxpayer’s self-assessment, the tax authorities may initiate a tax audit.
According to recent statements from the Ministry of Finance (MoF), the tax authorities, as regards tax audits, are concentrated on corporations (i.e. transfer pricing issues, VAT frauds, and tax restructuring); however, they may also embrace areas of business activities of individuals.


# Poland
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 22 July 2024
## Employee expenses
Non-business expenses reimbursed by the employer are generally taxable for an employee.
Business travel costs, up to a certain limit, can be reimbursed without giving rise to a tax liability.
If school fees/home visits are paid for by the employer, then a taxable benefit arises for the employee.
## Personal deductions
### Charitable contributions
Donations may be deducted from gross income, subject to numerous conditions and up to the limit of 6% of taxable income.
### Internet connection expenses
The Internet connection relief of PLN 760 can only be used by those individuals who would like to take it for the first time in the tax return or already deducted Internet expenses in the previous year only (and not in prior years). It means that it may be used only for two consecutive years.
### Free of charge blood donation
A money equivalent (depending on the amount of blood you donate) may be deducted from the tax base, based on the special confirmation stamp in a blood donation book received, at up to 6% of the total income subject to progressive taxation.
### Payments made to the individual insurance security account (IKZE)
An income deduction concerns payments made to the non-obligatory IKZE by a taxpayer in a given tax year and cannot exceed the amount equal to 4% of the pension insurance assessment basis for the individual in a previous year, but not more than 4% of annual cap for pension and disability insurance.
### Rehabilitation expenses
The taxpayer has a right to deduct from the taxable base expenses for rehabilitation and expenses related to facilitating performance of life activities incurred in the tax year by a disabled taxpayer or a taxpayer supporting a disabled person (e.g. expenditures incurred for adaptation and equipment of apartments and residential buildings to meet the needs arising from disability; adaptation of motor vehicles to meet the needs arising from disability; purchasing and repairing of personal equipment, appliances, and technical instruments necessary for rehabilitation and facilitating performance of life activities, in accordance with the needs arising from disability, with the exception of household equipment). The aforementioned expenses should be properly documented.
As of 1 July 2023, the rehabilitation relief is used by taxpayers who support disabled individuals classified as tax group I in relation to the taxpayer or the taxpayer's spouse. This change applies to income (revenue) earned as of 1 January 2023 in the PIT return filed for 2023.
Currently, the relief is available to disabled dependants: spouse, own and adopted children, strangers' children adopted for upbringing, stepchildren, parents, spouse's parents, siblings, stepfather, stepmother, sons-in-law, and daughters-in-law.
### Thermo-modernisation relief 
Introduced from 1 January 2019, the thermo-modernisation relief gives the owners/co-owners of a single-family residential building the opportunity to deduct from the tax base expenses incurred in the tax year for building materials, equipment, and services related to the implementation of the thermo-modernisation project.
The total amount of the deduction cannot exceed PLN 53,000 in relation to all implemented thermo-modernisation projects in individual buildings of which the taxpayer is the owner or co-owner.
### Deduction of social security contributions
Employee’s social security contributions can be deducted up to specified limits.
Under some conditions, it is possible to deduct obligatory social security contributions paid in another EU or European Economic Area (EEA) member state or in Switzerland from an individual’s taxable income.
### Relief for renovation of monuments
In 2022, the owners or co-owners of properties listed in the Register of Cultural Property were allowed to deduct from their income a portion of the expenses incurred for the renovation and purchase of the historic property.
Starting from 2023, the formula of relief for renovation of monuments changed (as a result of the Polish Deal amendment of July 2022) and currently it will be possible only to deduct expenses incurred for renovation works (under certain conditions) without the possibility of expenses deduction for the purchase of the historic property. Moreover, these expenses will be deductible after the renovation is approved by the provincial conservator of monuments.
The taxpayer may deduct 50% of the renovation costs incurred for the historic property (with no limit).
## Standard deductions
There is a standard deduction for employees. In most typical circumstances, it amounts to PLN 250 per month. The annual limit of tax costs from one's employment currently cannot exceed PLN 3,000. In the case of obtaining income from more than one employment relationship, the upper limit of costs amounts to PLN 4,500.
Deductible costs  
---  
Period | Costs in 2024/25 (PLN)  
Monthly (one contract, local) | 250  
Monthly (one contract, commuters) | 300  
Yearly (one contract, local) | 3,000  
Yearly (one contract, commuters) | 3,600  
Yearly (multiple contracts, local) | 4,500  
Yearly (multiple contracts, commuters) | 5,400  
An individual doing independent work may claim various allowances, depending on the type of activities performed. In most typical situations, the standard deduction amounts to 20% of the revenue. The most favourable treatment relates to revenue from copyrights. As of 2018, the limit applicable to the 50% lump-sum, tax-deductible costs corresponding to remuneration related to creative activities has been increased. Currently, the limit amounts to PLN 120,000 _per annum_. The advantage applies only to those authors who derive income from certain specific types of activities, including, among others, creative and artistic activities in chosen areas, research and development, academic and scientific activity, audio-visual activity, or journalism.
## Personal allowances
Personal allowances are provided as credits against PIT. _See the section for more information_.
## Business deductions
Individuals running business activities as sole traders or partners in partnerships can deduct all expenses incurred in order to derive revenue or to ‘protect a source of income’. It should be noted, however, that there is also a list of items that are not deductible even if they meet the above general conditions. This list contains over 60 items, including, among others, the following:
  * Written-off lapsed receivables.
  * Entertainment cost.
  * Accrued but unpaid interest.
  * Accounting and comparable provisions.
  * Tax penalties and penalty interest.


In addition, entrepreneurs conducting innovative activities can take advantage of special deductions from income, i.e.:
  * 200% of costs incurred for R&D activities.
  * Tax relief for innovative staff allowing cashless refund of unused R&D tax relief.
  * Tax relief for prototypes, allowing for additional deduction of pilot series production up to 30% of incurred costs.
  * Robotisation tax relief granting additional deduction of 50% of costs incurred on purchase of industrial robots.
  * Tax relief for expansion with additional deduction of up to PLN 1 million incurred on increasing revenues of sale of goods.
  * Tax reliefs on CSR activities.


## Losses
The annual loss generated within a source of income cannot be set off against income generated from other sources. Instead, a taxpayer is entitled to carry such loss forward over the next five years from income derived from the same source.
The amount of the tax loss deduction:
  * in the next consecutive years may not exceed 50% of the amount of the loss incurred, or
  * in one of the consecutive five tax years, the tax loss may not exceed PLN 5 million (the unrelieved loss is deductible in the remaining years of the five-year period but may not exceed 50% of the incurred loss).

# Poland
## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 22 July 2024
PIT is levied on an individual’s overall income. The taxable base is calculated as the sum of income generated from all taxable sources, subject to a number of exceptions (i.e. some sources are taxed separately and left outside the overall income calculation).
Income from a particular source is defined as the surplus of revenue from such source over the tax-deductible costs related to the same source. If within one source of income tax-deductible costs exceed revenue, the result is a tax loss (_see Losses in the section for more information_).
## Employment income
Employee revenue includes basic pay, overtime pay, supplemental pay, awards and bonuses, compensation for unused holiday or vacation time, and all other monetary amounts and benefits in kind, as well as all other services obtained for free, from the employer.
## Capital gains
### Transfer of real property
Transfer of real property, if made within the scope of regular business activity, is taxed on general rules. Consequently, it is added to other business income and taxed based on the progressive scale or the 19% flat rate.
However, special rules apply if the transfer of property is made outside the scope of business activity. These rules vary according to the date on which real property had been acquired.
Generally, sale of real property shall not be taxed if the sale is made after the lapse of five years after the end of the tax year when the property in question was purchased (i.e. property acquired in 2018 or earlier can be sold free of tax in 2024).
If the above exemption is not applicable, real property disposal is taxed at a 19% rate calculated on income. The income equals the difference between the revenue on sale and the cost of earning that revenue, increased by the overall amount of depreciation allowances (if any) made on the property in question before the disposal. Revenues earned from the disposal of residential real estate can be exempt from taxation in some cases.
### Transfer of shares
Transfer of shares is taxed at a separate 19% rate calculated on income (revenue less expenses on acquisition). The income is not added to income from other sources.
## Dividend and interest income
Income from dividends paid by joint-stock companies and limited liability companies is not added to an individual's overall income. Instead, it is subject to 19% tax calculated on revenue (deductions are not available). The same rules apply to interest on loans and savings.
An exception concerns loans granted within the scope of regular business activities. If this is the case, the PIT rules concerning business income apply.
## Exempt income
More than 130 types of income are tax exempt. The most important are the following:
  * Damages received on the basis of administrative law, civil law, and other legal acts (subject to numerous exceptions).
  * Receipts from property insurance and personal insurance claims (subject to some exceptions).
  * Cash equivalents provided to employees when they need to use their own tools, goods, and equipment to perform work.
  * Limited daily allowances and other amounts due to employees for the duration of business trips.
  * Revenue from specific sources earned by taxpayers up to age 26 (so-called 'relief for young').


Regulations of the Polish Deal introduced the following new reliefs from 2022 (tax exemptions):
  * Interest on late payment of a tax-exempt receivable (beginning in 2022).
  * Revenue from specific sources earned by taxpayers who:
    * have transferred their tax residence to Poland (so-called 'relief for return')
    * raise four children (so-called 'relief for families 4+'), or
    * are seniors and remain active on the labour market (so-called 'relief for working seniors').


## Special rules for non-residents
Specified types of income, if gained by non-residents, are subject to special treatment. _See the section for more information_.

## Personal allowances
As of 1 January 2022, taxpayers earning income taxed according to the tax scale are entitled to a tax-free amount (personal allowance) of PLN 30,000. 
As a result of the increase of the tax-free amount, the amount decreasing tax has increased. As of 1 July 2022, it amounts to PLN 300 per month
### Child relief
In the tax return for 2025, the taxpayer may deduct:
  * PLN 92.67 per month (i.e. up to PLN 1,112.04 per year) for a pro-family allowance for raising one child who meets the conditions of the allowance, assuming that the taxpayer's income, after deducting social security contributions, does not exceed PLN 112,000 in total, and for a non-married person, including for part of the tax year, does not exceed the amount of PLN 56,000 in the tax year.
  * PLN 92.67 per month (i.e. up to PLN 1,112.04 per year) for the second child.
  * PLN 166.67 per month (i.e. up to PLN 2,000.04 per year) for the third child.
  * PLN 225.00 a month (i.e. up to PLN 2,700.00 per year) for raising the fourth and subsequent child.


If a child was in the taxpayers’ custody only for a period of time during the taxable period, the allowance is proportionally lowered.
The annual income limit for an adult, studying child, beyond which the parent loses the possibility of deducting the child allowance amounts for 2024 to PLN 21,371.52, i.e. 12 times the social pension value for December 2024 (this amount is variable every year, depending on the amount of social pension set for December of a given year).


# Poland

## Social security contributions
In Poland, social security consists of:
  * pension insurance
  * disability insurance
  * accident insurance
  * labour fund, and
  * sickness insurance.


The Polish social security system covers people economically active, like employees or self-employed people. Social insurance may be mandatory or voluntary.
### Employees and employers: General rules
Both the employer and the employee are obligated to contribute to the Polish social security system. Apart from paying its own share, the employer is obligated to withhold the employee‘s share of the social security contributions and remit them to the Social Security Authorities (ZUS). In both cases, the relevant payments shall be made monthly.
As of 1 April 2015, the employer pays total contributions in a range of 19.21% to 22.41% of the employee’s gross salary (the employer’s contribution rate includes an accident insurance element that varies according to the number of employees insured and the business sector). The contribution rate for the employee is 13.71% of gross salary. The social security shares payable by the employer and the employee are tax-deductible items in their respective PIT settlements.
Part of the above rates apply to salaries below the cap of 234,720 in 2024 (and below 260,190 in 2025). The cap is changing every year. After exceeding this cap, the salary is subject to a contribution rate of 3.22% to 6.41% payable by the employer and 2.45% payable by the employee.
Details of the social security contribution calculation are shown in the following table:
Contribution | Contribution amount | Paid by  
---|---|---  
Pensions and disability insurance  | 16.26% of total gross salary (up to the cap of PLN 234,720 in 2024 and up to the cap of PLN 260,190 in 2025) | Employer  
11.26% of total gross salary (up to the cap of PLN 234,720 in 2024 and up to the cap to PLN 260,190 in 2025) | Employee  
Sickness insurance | 2.45% of total gross salary | Employee  
Accident insurance | 1.67% of total gross salary for employers that employ up to nine employees. 0.67% to 3.33% of total gross salary for employers that employ more than nine employees (the precise rate depends on the business sector). In practice, a flat rate of 1.67% is applied in respect of foreign employers. | Employer  
Labour Fund | 2.45% of total gross salary | Employer  
Employee Guaranteed Benefits Fund | 0.10% of total gross salary | Employer  
### Social security for mobile employees
The social security position in Poland of mobile employees depends on whether:
  * European Union (EU) coordination regulations can be applied
  * bilateral totalisation agreement regulations should be applied, and finally
  * whether the international transfer is made to or from a third country with whom Poland does not have any international agreements, in which case only Polish domestic regulations will be applicable.


### Social security contributions of self-employed
As a rule, self-employed persons pay social security contributions in a lump sum, regardless of their actual income. The base for social security contributions, thus the amount of contributions, depends on the forecast average monthly wage for a given year (i.e. calculation basis amounts to 60% of the forecast average monthly wage).
Self-employed persons whose income in the previous year did not exceed PLN 120,000 may pay contributions from the income obtained in the previous year (provided that they meet additional criteria).
There is also a relief for starting a business. Individuals under self-employment do not have to pay social security for the first six months of their activity. For the next 24 months, they can pay so-called 'preferential contributions' that are significantly lower than normal ones.
## Health insurance
### Employees, board members, and proxies
The monthly contribution rate for health insurance is 9% of the assessment base. In the case of obligatory participation, the assessment base is equal to the individual's gross income decreased by the amount of the employee’s part of social security contributions. The health insurance assessment base is not tax deductible for taxpayers reconciling their income with the tax scale, thus the 9% of contribution rate for health insurance is financed from the employee’s net income.
Please note that there is no cap on the health insurance contributions’ assessment base.
### Entrepreneurs
Also, from 2022, the method of calculating the health insurance contributions for entrepreneurs has changed. Currently, the rules for paying the health insurance contributions depend on the method of taxation of business activity and are as follows:
  * 4.9% of income for sole proprietorships taxed at flat rate (19%).
  * 9% of income for sole proprietorships taxed according to the tax scale (12% and 32%). However, the health insurance contribution cannot be lower than PLN 381.78 per month (value for January 2025), PLN 314.96 (value for the period February 2025 -January 2026). Please note that there is no amount of the maximum contribution indicated.
  * A specific contribution depending on the amount of annual revenues for sole proprietorships taxed with a lump sum on recorded revenues - values for 2023, i.e.:
    * for revenue up to PLN 60,000: PLN 461.66 per month.
    * for revenue between PLN 60,000 and PLN 300,000: PLN 769.43 per month.
    * for revenue exceeding PLN 300,000: PLN 1,384.97 per month.


Additionally, as a result of the changes introduced on 1 July 2022, entrepreneurs can deduct health insurance contributions under modified rules.
According to the changes, such possibility will be provided for entrepreneurs who tax their income (revenues) differently than according to the tax scale, i.e:
  * a flat rate tax,
  * a lump sum on registered revenue, or
  * a tax card.


However, the amount of the deduction is to be limited, depending on the chosen form of taxation:
  * Up to PLN 12,900 (value for 2025) of deduction from income (or inclusion in tax deductible costs) for sole proprietorships taxed at flat rate (19%).
  * Up to 50% of health insurance contributions for those entrepreneurs paying the lump-sum tax (deduction from the tax base).
  * Up to 19% of health insurance contribution paid for those entrepreneurs using the tax card (deduction from tax).


## Property tax
Property tax is imposed on the following real properties: 
  * Buildings or parts of buildings: Taxed on usable area.
  * Structures or parts of structures used for an economic activity: Taxed on initial value adopted for tax purposes, not reduced by depreciation write-offs.
  * Land (if not subject to the farming tax): Taxed on area.


Taxpayers liable to property tax are individuals and other entities that are:
  * the owners or independent possessors of properties,
  * possessors of properties that are state-owned, or
  * permanent landholders.


Property tax rates for buildings and land are established on a yearly basis fixed by municipalities within limits set in the Law on Local Taxes and Fees. In 2025, land used for business purposes is subject to a rate limit of PLN 1.38 per square meter. Buildings used for business purposes are subject to a rate limit of PLN 34.00 per square metermetre. From 2024 the obligation to pay 2% of tax on civil law transactions (so-called ‘PCC’) when purchasing the first apartment from the secondary market has been eliminated.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Polish gift and inheritance tax is levied on the value of assets and property rights located in Poland that are transferred on death to an heir and on lifetime gifts. Polish gift and inheritance tax may be imposed on assets and property rights located abroad if the heir or donee is a Polish national or is a Polish permanent resident at the time of the transfers or death or when the donation contract is concluded.
Non-residents who do not hold Polish citizenship are not obligated to pay gift and inheritance tax if movable property and property rights are inherited or donated in the Polish territory, provided that the donor is not a Polish resident and has no Polish citizenship.
The following are examples of some of the most common exemptions from gift and inheritance tax:
  * Acquisition of property and property rights by means of inheritance and donation by members of the transferor’s/donor’s nearest family (e.g. spouse, children, parents, stepparents, brothers, sisters; except for children-in-law and parents-in-law) provided that they fulfil reporting requirements described in the Polish gift and inheritance tax law.
  * Acquisition of a farm (except buildings).


There are some tax-free amounts. The tax-free amounts depend on the character of the personal relationship between the purchaser and the person from whom assets and property rights are acquired.
In the case of multiple acquisitions from the same person (within the last five years), the value of all acquisitions are accumulated for gift and inheritance tax calculation purposes, and the total sum is reduced by the amount of tax already paid. Gift and inheritance tax is payable by the donor in case of a gift, and by the heir in case of inheritance. Tax is charged on the fair market value of the gift or inheritance on the day when the tax point arises (i.e. when the heir/donee accepts inheritance/donation), less a deduction for any debt or burdens on the amount transferred, that is, the net value. The tax varies according to the relationship with the deceased or the donor.
As of 1 January 2019, an important change concerning the sale of real estate received by inheritance was implemented. Until 2019, the law provisions exempted from tax the sale of real estate property after five years from the date of opening the inheritance, which is usually the date of death of the testator. In respect to the new law provisions, the five-year period will be counted from the date of acquisition of real estate by the testator. The taxpayer will also be allowed to use the housing allowance for the extended time period. The previous provisions have released income from the sale of real estate under condition that the funds for one's own housing purposes were spent within two years after the sale. Starting from 1 January 2019, the deadline is extended to three years. In order to benefit from the exemption, the taxpayer should become the owner of the property.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The VAT rates are 23% (standard rate), 8%, 5%, 0%, and exemption. _See in the Corporate tax summary for more information._
## Luxury and excise taxes
Excise duties are levied on the production, sale, import, and intra-community acquisition of ‘excise goods’, which are listed in the excise duty law and include (among others) alcohol, cigarettes, energy products (e.g. petrol, oils, gas), passenger cars, and electricity. _See in the Corporate tax summary for more information._
## Exit tax
The introduction of exit tax to the Polish tax system, as of 2019, results from an obligation to implement the Directive (UE) 2016/1164, adopted in 2016. The mentioned Directive establishes provisions in order to prevent tax avoidance practices, which may have an indirect impact on the functioning of the internal market.
A crucial assumption of the exit tax is taxation of unrealised profits in connection with moving one’s assets to another country, as well as those that are part of a PE.
The tax will also be due in case of change of the residency status of a taxpayer that deprives Poland from taxation of income that arises in connection with disposal of the individual’s property.
The general assumption of introduction of exit tax was only to cover assets with value exceeding PLN 4 million. This is the case involving moving of assets abroad.
### Tax rate
The exit tax rate is equal to 19% and 3%. The lower rate is applicable when the income is not to be decreased by tax deductible costs. In practice, the most common tax rate will be 19%.
### Type of assets covered by exit tax
In case of moving the tax residency abroad, exit tax will be due only on the following assets:
  * Rights and obligations in a partnership.
  * Shares in a company.
  * Stock and other securities.
  * Derivatives and certificates.


It should be emphasised that exit taxation will not be limited to assets acquired during one’s Polish tax residency but will also apply to assets acquired before the individual’s arrival in Poland.
### Postponement of the provisions on exit tax
Another change in PIT is to extend the exit tax deadline to:
  * the seventh day of the month following the month in which the taxpayer lost all or part of the assets subject to taxation of that tax if all or part of the assets were lost before 1 December 2025, and
  * 31 December 2025 in other cases.
