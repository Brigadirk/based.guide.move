## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year for CIT purposes is the calendar year. For new business entities, the fiscal year is considered the period beginning with the registration date until the end of the calendar year. Taxpayers have the right to choose a tax period different from the calendar one, subject to specific conditions.
For WHT and VAT purposes, the fiscal period is the calendar month starting the first day of the month. The VAT period for non-residents providing services through electronic networks to Moldovan resident individuals (B2C transactions) is the calendar quarter.
## Tax returns
An annual CIT return must be submitted to the MTA by the 25th day of the third month following the end of the tax period.
WHT and payroll liabilities must be declared and settled monthly, no later than the 25th day of the month following the reporting one.
Farming enterprises and individual entrepreneurs with an annual average number of employees not exceeding three and not registered as VAT payers must submit a unified annual tax return, provided certain conditions are met.
As of 1 January 2023, all taxpayers (except individuals) will be required to submit tax reports using automated electronic reporting methods.
### Adjusted tax returns
Taxpayers who discover that the tax return previously submitted contains an error are able to submit an adjusted tax return, provided that no written decision was issued by the tax authority in order to initiate a tax audit and the related tax period is not covered by a tax control.
As of 01 January 2025, taxpayers have the right to present the corrected tax return related to social security contributions no later than six years after the deadline for presenting the corrected tax return.
Late interest payments will not be applicable in amounts higher than the tax liability resulting from the adjusted tax return submitted, and no fines will be applicable if the tax duties are paid before the announcement of a tax audit.
Companies that have miscalculated the taxes, and this was not detected in the previous tax audit, are absolved from fines and late interest payments for violations identified within the repeated tax audit.
## Payment of tax
Taxpayers must declare and pay the applicable CIT by the 25th day of the third month following the end of tax period. Taxpayers are also required to pay interim CIT, no later than the 25th day of each three months of the current tax period, amounts equal to 25% of either the total estimated value of the CIT due for the current fiscal period or the total value of the calculated CIT for the previous fiscal period.
Enterprises classified as micro, small, or medium, according to the criteria determined on the last day of the tax period according to the provisions of Law no. 179/2016, can pay the calculated CIT until the 25th day of the month following that in which dividends were paid, including in the form of stocks or shares, from the profit obtained in the tax periods 2023-2025 inclusive. The amount of CIT to be paid is determined by applying the pro rata ratio between the amount of CIT calculated for the tax period and the taxable income for the respective tax period.
### Fines and penalties
Among the most important fines and sanctions for non-compliance with applicable tax law, the following are worth mentioning:
  * The fine for the performance by the taxpayer of an economic activity with the issuance of a bill without using the existing cash register is from MDL 5,000 to MDL 15,000 (other fines might also be applied for non-compliance with rules related to use of cash registers).
  * The fine for the failure to provide the VAT invoice in accordance with the tax law is from MDL 3,000 to MDL 3,600 for each VAT invoice but capped to MDL 72,000.
  * The fine for hindering the execution of a tax audit by not providing access to production, storage, commercial, or other facilities is from MDL 4,000 to MDL 6,000.
  * The fine for utilisation of blanks with special regime other than those permitted by legislation is between 25% to 30% from the transaction amount.
  * The fine for reducing taxes, SSC and health insurance contributions by presenting tax returns containing incorrect data is between 20% to 30% of the reduced amount.
  * The fine for evasion from payment of taxes, SSC and health insurance contributions is between 80% and 100% of the related amount.
  * The fine for failure to comply with rules concerning the filling in and submission of tax returns is between MDL 500 to MDL 1,000 for each tax return, but not more than MDL 10,000.
  * In case of diminishing the taxable income declared by a taxpayer who benefited from the postponement of the deadline for paying the income tax related to the profit obtained for the tax period 2023-2025, a fine ranging from 12% to 15% of the undeclared/diminished taxable income is applied.


Taxpayers who settle amounts as assessed by the MTA within three business days and have no other outstanding liabilities may benefit from a 50% reduction of the fines applied by the tax authorities.
In addition, certain special provisions regarding tax evasion apply. The term 'tax evasion' is defined under Moldovan criminal law as diminishing the tax liabilities by more than 50 medium forecasted salaries (MDL 805,000 in 2025) by means of including in accounting, tax, or financial documents deliberately distorted data on income or expenses or by hiding other objects of taxation. According to the Moldovan Criminal Code, legal entities can be punished for tax evasion with a fine up to MDL 400,000 and preclusion from performing certain activities. In case the amount of diminished tax liabilities exceeds 100 medium forecasted salaries (MDL 1,610,000 in 2025), legal entities can be punished for tax evasion with a fine up to MDL 800,000 and preclusion from performing certain activities or winding-up.
As of 15 April 2022, the amount of infringement considered insignificant and not triggering fines and penalties has been increased from MDL 100 to MDL 500 for individuals and from MDL 1,000 to MDL 5,000 for legal entities.
## Tax audit process
The rules governing the tax audit process are stated in the Tax Code. Generally, the tax audit duration and frequency depend on its type. For instance, a tax audit performed at the taxpayer premises should not exceed two months (with some exceptions) and should be performed no more than once per year for the same taxes and duties, except for specific circumstances provided by law.
Also, a tax audit can be performed on a more frequent basis within certain specific circumstances (e.g. refund of VAT and other taxes, reorganisation).
A repeated tax audit for already audited periods can be performed in a number of cases, for instance:
  * If the results of previous controls are inconclusive, incomplete, or not satisfactory.
  * If certain circumstances are identified that attest to the existence of tax infringements.
  * In the event of reorganisation or liquidation.


The anti-abuse rule comes into force on 1 January 2024. In this regard, for determining the taxpayer's fiscal obligations, the state tax service will not take into account or reclassify a transaction, action, or series of transactions or actions that, when considering all the relevant facts and circumstances, reflect a different situation or economic content than the one claimed by the taxpayer and is being undertaken with the aim of obtaining a fiscal advantage.
## Statute of limitations
Under the general tax rule, as of 01 January 2025, the limitation period can be extended for a period of more than six years following the last date set for the presentation of the tax return if the taxpayer has not submitted the tax return or requests the return of overpaid amounts or of the amounts which, according to the tax legislation, are to be returned.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
There are no specific topics of focus for the tax authorities. Generally, it depends on the nature of the taxpayer and the specifics of the activity it performs. The main criterion for selection of a company to be subject to a tax audit is a risk based one.
In addition, tax authorities are currently focused on promoting voluntary compliance of the taxpayers.
## Rulings
Starting with 2017, the concept of advanced binding ruling has been introduced in the Moldovan tax law.
The binding ruling under the Moldova tax law represents an administrative act issued by the state tax service college in order to solve claims submitted by individuals and legal entities that perform entrepreneurial activity, regarding the applicability of the tax legislation on the future specific situations and/or transactions. The anticipated individual tax ruling is mandatory for MTA and other entities with tax administration attributions, provided certain conditions are met. The procedure of issuing and rejecting of advanced binding rulings is determined by the government.
The law also provides for the possibility of obtaining comfort letters. Taxpayers that inadequately computed tax liabilities due to incorrect written explanations issued by the MTA may not be subject to sanctions (i.e. fines and late-payment penalties). Tax liabilities may still be recomputed by the MTA. Written explanations are issued by the MTA free of charge and may remain valid for an indefinite period of time, unless cancelled by new legislation or other rulings. Such explanations are generally issued by the Moldovan competent authorities during a period of up to one month.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
According to Moldovan tax law, a tax resident is a legal entity organised or managed in Moldova or that has its main place of business in Moldova. In practice, tax residency is determined by the place of incorporation.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Based on the Moldovan tax law, a PE is a fixed place of business through which a non-resident carries out, wholly or partly, either directly or through a dependent agent, entrepreneurial activity in the territory of Moldova.
Due to the regulatory environment in Moldova, as well as certain difficulties in operating a PE in Moldova, foreign enterprises operating through a PE in Moldova are not common.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
As a general rule, expenses incurred by a company are deductible for CIT purposes only if they are deemed as ordinary and necessary, aimed at deriving taxable income, and justified with adequate supporting documentation.
The rate of deductible expenses for business purposes (ordinary and necessary) that are not adequately supported by necessary documentation is 0.2% from taxable income.
## Depreciation and amortisation
The threshold value of fixed assets recognised for tax purposes is established to MDL 12,000.
For entities that apply the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the calculation and deduction of depreciation related to the right to use fixed assets that are the subject of an operational leasing contract is performed by the lessee. 
As of 2025, all legal entities, except for legal entities that carry out financial insurance/reinsurance activities provided for in section К of the Activities classifier in the Moldovan economy have the right to apply the accelerated depreciation method for the first year of putting the fixed asset into operation.
The amount of amortisation of the fixed asset to be deducted is determined as follows:
  * For the first year of use, the amortisation cannot exceed 50% of the input cost of the fixed asset.
  * For the following years of use, the amortisation is calculated by dividing the unamortised value of the fixed assets by the number of years remaining in its useful life.


Intangible assets are subject to CIT amortisation according to the straight-line method.
## Goodwill
According to the National Accounting Standards, goodwill is recognised as an intangible asset. However, the Moldovan Tax Code does not expressly provide for specific rules regarding CIT deduction.
## Start-up expenses
According to the National Accounting Standards, start-up expenses incurred by companies (e.g. stamp taxes paid upon company registration, drawing up of registration documents, manufacture of stamp) are not recognised as an intangible asset. Therefore, such expenses are to be treated as current expenses.
## Interest expenses
Different CIT deductibility rules apply for interest on loans used for carrying out operational activities and for loans used for investment activities performed on an occasional basis.
As a general rule, deductions for interest expenses are allowed for CIT purposes, provided such expenses are deemed as ordinary and necessary for carrying out the activities of the business. Expenses should also be incurred for the purposes of obtaining taxable income and justified by adequate backup documentation.
If the interest paid by a Moldovan company relates to its operational or day-to-day activities, the related expenses are deductible for CIT purposes, taking into account the following:
  * Interest expenses incurred by businesses, based on loan agreements, for the benefit of individuals and legal entities (except financial institutions, micro-financing organisations, and leasing companies) are deductible for CIT purposes within a specific limit established by law. Specifically, such interest expenses are deductible up to the limit of the average weighted interest rate on credit loans offered by banks to legal entities, depending on the period of the loan and its currency (e.g. different limits are applied for loans in Moldovan lei and those in foreign currency).
  * If the loan is obtained for the purpose of acquiring/building fixed assets, the related interest expense should be capitalised to the initial fiscal value of such assets until they are put into exploitation. The deductibility of such interest expense is capped at the above limit. The excess difference is treated as a non-deductible expense for CIT purposes.


If interest relates to an investment activity, the interest expense is deductible for CIT purposes within the limit of the income derived from the investment.
## Bad debt
Bad debts are deductible for CIT purposes, provided certain conditions are fulfilled and justifying documents are made available.
Starting 01 January 2025, the threshold of bad debt with an expired statute of limitations has been increased from MDL 1,000 to MDL 2,000.
The deduction of bad debts up to MDL 2,000, for which the statute of limitation has exceeded three years, is allowed.
## Charitable contributions
Charity and sponsorship expenses are deductible for CIT purposes if borne for the benefit of public authorities and public institutions financed from the state budget, as well as non-profit organisations and family-type foster homes within certain conditions, at up to 5% of taxable income.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties related to CIT, related to other taxes and due payments to the state budget, or for violations of legal acts are not deductible for CIT purposes.

Losses may not be carried back.
## Payments to foreign affiliates

However, the payer is required to hold documentary evidence for the actually performed transactions. Certain types of expenses may follow general rules of deductibility that would limit their amount (e.g. interest expenses on loan agreements).

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
### General rules on transactions with related parties
With reference to the transactions carried out by Moldovan companies with related parties, Moldovan tax law provides the following specific provisions:
  * The income obtained from economic transactions performed with shareholders or other related parties at a price lower than market value will be adjusted for tax purposes to the market value. As of 15 August 2024, the income obtained by taxpayers carrying out entrepreneurial activity from economic transactions with individual founders or other interdependent individuals who do not carry out entrepreneurial activity, obtained at a price lower than the market price, is adjusted for tax purposes to the market price.
  * As of 01 January 2025, losses obtained following the sale or exchange of property, the performance of works and the provision of services, carried out directly or mediated between affiliated parties, will be allowed for deduction if the arm’s length principle has been applied in determining the price for these transactions. No deduction is allowed for expenses incurred in relation to related parties if no justification is available for the payments and if such expenses do not represent necessary and ordinary business expenses.


In accordance with Moldovan tax law, a company is considered the taxpayer’s related party if one of the following conditions exists:
  * The company controls the taxpayer.
  * The company is controlled by the taxpayer.
  * Both the company and the taxpayer are under common control of a third party.


From a tax perspective, control is the ownership (either directly or through one or more related parties) of 50% or more in value of the capital or voting power of one of the companies. For this purpose, an individual will be treated as owning all equity interest that is directly or indirectly owned by members of their family.
### Transfer pricing rules
The Republic of Moldova recently formally introduced its first transfer pricing regulations, which follow the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD’s) Transfer Pricing Guidelines.
Law no. 356, dated 29 December 2022, introduced the transfer pricing concept into the Moldovan Tax Code along with general rules related to transfer pricing reporting and documentation requirements.
The legislation enters into force on 1 January 2024. Further, on 09 February 2024, the Moldovan Authorities approved the secondary legislation, containing guidance on the contents of the transfer pricing documentation and details regarding the application of the law.
Multinational enterprises operating in Moldova and Moldova-headquartered groups (limited only to transactions between resident taxpayers, where one or both taxpayers are residents of free economic zones / information technology parks or they apply different rates and/or have different taxable bases for corporate income tax) should review their related-party transactions and documentation in view of compliance with the arm’s-length principle and further transfer pricing documentation requirements. Where appropriate, such groups should consider adjusting their operational and pricing models in seeking to avoid potential transfer pricing disputes with the Moldovan tax authorities and related sanctions due to non-compliance with the new regulations.
### Materiality thresholds and other legal requirements
The Moldovan government has set two materiality thresholds to be considered with regard to taxpayers that fall under transfer pricing requirements:
  * Taxpayers carrying out transactions with related parties where the total annual value of related-party transactions is equal to or exceeds MDL 20 million must prepare and present both the information on related-party transactions and the transfer pricing file only at the request of the tax authorities.
  * Taxpayers carrying out transactions with related parties where the total annual value of related-party transactions is equal to or exceeds MDL 50 million must prepare and present the information on related-party transactions and the transfer pricing file on a contemporaneous basis.


### Documentation requirements
A Moldovan taxpayer must prepare two types of documents for transfer pricing purposes:
  * A transfer pricing form, generically named 'information on related-party transactions', due by the 25th day of the third month following the end of the tax period.
  * A transfer pricing file (due within 6 months after the end of the tax period).


### Penalties
According to the new legislation, the following penalties will apply:
  * Late presentation of the information on related-party transactions is sanctioned with a fine of MDL 30,000 to MDL 50,000.
  * Presentation of incorrect information on related-party transactions (similar to a tax return) that led to the reduction or avoidance of tax obligations is sanctioned with a fine of MDL 60,000 to MDL 90,000 (applicable for tax inspections initiated by the Moldovan Tax Authorities for the tax periods starting with 2028).
  * Failure to present the information on related-party transactions is sanctioned with a fine of MDL 100,000 to MDL 150,000.
  * Late presentation of the transfer pricing file is sanctioned with a fine of MDL 30,000 to MDL 50,000.
  * Presentation of the transfer pricing file with incorrect information is sanctioned with a fine of MDL 60,000 to MDL 90,000 (applicable for tax inspections initiated by the Moldovan Tax Authorities for the tax periods starting with 2028).
  * Failure to present the transfer pricing file is sanctioned with a fine of MDL 100,000 to MDL 150,000.


As of 1 January 2025, the concept of ‘advance price agreement’ will come into force. A decision issued by the Moldovan Tax Authorities will establish and justify the conditions and the methods of formation of transfer prices during a determined period related to a controlled transaction or transactions carried out between related parties.
## Thin capitalisation
Moldovan tax law does not provide for a specific thin capitalisation regime.
_The deductibility of interest expenses follows the deductibility regime as described under Interest expenses in the section_.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Moldovan tax law does not contain CFC provisions.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Branches
Foreign legal entities are able to register branches in Moldova that do not have legal personality and may carry out commercial activity.
A branch is a separate subdivision of the legal entity, located outside its premises, having the appearance of permanence, its own management, and the material endowment necessary to carry out, wholly or partially, the activities of the parent entity. 
Moldovan law states that foreign entities may carry out activity through branches in the Republic of Moldova, subject to their registration in the public registers and obtaining the permissive documents, where the case. The foreign parent entity is responsible for the liabilities arising from the activities of its branch in the Republic of Moldova.
The modernised Civil Code modifies the concept of 'subsidiary', which, in contrast to the branch, is an entity with legal personality. The law provides that references in the legislation in force to the subsidiary or representative office of a legal entity are considered references to the branch of the legal entity until the legislation is aligned with the corporate provisions of the modernised Civil Code.
## Representative offices
Starting with 1 March 2019, the concept of 'representative office' has been excluded from Moldovan legislation. The transitory legal provisions state that all representative offices registered before 1 March 2019 will be considered as branches of the parent companies. In addition, all references in the national legislation to representative offices will be considered as references to branches of legal entities.
By 1 January 2024, legal entities that registered in the Republic of Moldova branches and representative offices are required to bring their articles of incorporation/regulations of the branches and representative offices in accordance with the provisions of the modernised Civil Code and operate the necessary modifications in the state Register of legal entities.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Foreign tax credit
Income tax paid in any foreign country, if this income is subject to taxation in Moldova, is allowed for tax credit, provided that the taxpayer submits a document that justifies payment (withholding) of the income tax outside of Moldova, certified by the competent body of the respective foreign country, with its translation into the state language.
The amount of tax credit for any taxable year should not exceed the amount that would have been estimated at the rate applicable in Moldova with regard to this income.
A tax paid in a foreign country should be creditable for the year in which the income is taxable in Moldova.
## Free entrepreneurial zones (FEZs)
FEZs are territories where domestic and foreign investors can carry out entrepreneurial activities on preferential terms (i.e. favourable tax, customs, visa, and other regimes). There are currently seven FEZs in Moldova.
The following types of activities may be carried out in an FEZ:
  * Production of goods preferentially for export, excluding alcohol and alcoholic products.
  * Sorting, packing, marking, and other similar operations of goods transiting the customs territory of Moldova.
  * External commercial activities.
  * Other supportive activities.


There is also an international free port (Giurgiulesti International Free Port) and airport (Marculesti International Free Airport) with status similar to FEZs that can benefit from specific tax and customs incentives.
### FEZ incentives
The following CIT incentives for FEZ investors are in place:
  * Entities that are established in the FEZ and export goods and services from the FEZ outside the customs territory of Moldova or deliver the produced goods to other FEZ residents for goods to be exported are entitled to apply only 50% of applicable CIT rate on such gains. For other cases, the CIT rate is 75% of the established one.
  * The income obtained from export of goods (services) originating from the FEZ outside the customs territory of Moldova or from supply of the produced goods to other FEZ residents for goods to be exported is CIT exempted for a period of one year, provided that the FEZ residents invested in the fixed assets of their enterprises and/or in development of the infrastructure of the FEZ capital equivalent to at least 1 million United States dollars (USD).
  * The income obtained from export of goods (services) originating from the FEZ outside the customs territory of Moldova or from supply of the produced goods to other FEZ residents for goods to be exported is CIT exempted for a period of three years, provided that the FEZ residents invested in the fixed assets of their enterprises and/or in development of the infrastructure of the FEZ capital equivalent to at least USD 3 million.
  * The income obtained from export of goods (services) originating from the FEZ outside the customs territory of Moldova or from supply of the produced goods to other FEZ residents for goods to be exported is CIT exempted for a period of five years, provided that the FEZ residents invested in the fixed assets of their enterprises and/or in development of the infrastructure of the FEZ capital equivalent to at least USD 5 million.
  * The income obtained from export of goods (services) originating from the FEZ outside the customs territory of Moldova or from supply of the produced goods to other FEZ residents for goods to be exported is CIT exempted for an additional period of time, provided that the FEZ residents performed additional investments in the fixed assets of their enterprises and/or in development of the infrastructure of the FEZ capital (under certain conditions).


CIT incentives will be available until 01 July 2034, or until the free economic zone ceases to operate, whichever comes first. These benefits apply to individuals or legal entities registered as residents of the free economic zone by 31 December 31 2023, and are contingent upon the size of investments made by 01 July 2024. The government will determine how these tax benefits are granted through the regional state aid scheme for enterprises in free economic zones, in accordance with the regulations set by the Competition Council and subject to certain conditions.
From a VAT standpoint, goods and services supplied in the FEZ from abroad, from the FEZ outside the customs territory of Moldova, in the FEZ from other areas of Moldova, and those supplied to residents of other FEZs are VAT exempted with deduction right (with some exceptions).
According to the customs provisions, goods are introduced into the FEZ with no VAT or customs duty and are not subject to economic policy measures, according to specific criteria. However, certain taxes in specific situations might be incurred by residents of the FEZ. Individuals or legal entities registered as residents of the free zone by 31 December 2023, are permitted to engage in activities under the customs regime regulated by Free Economic Zones until 01 January 2034, or until the specific free zone ceases operations, whichever comes first.
## Law on information technology (IT) parks

## Double tax treaties (DTTs)
The DTTs in force between Moldova and other countries may provide for more favourable tax rates than those provided by the local provisions.

The Moldovan tax law expressly provides that the DTTs prevail over the national provisions. The only exception refers to the case where the domestic norms provide for more favourable tax rates (i.e. in such circumstances, the domestic ones shall apply).
Currently, Moldova has 50 operational DTTs, as outlined below:

# Moldova
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
Resident companies generally must calculate their taxable base for CIT purposes on their worldwide income. Permanent establishments (PEs), unlike resident companies, are only required to calculate their taxable base for CIT purposes on income sourced in Moldova.
The CIT rate is 12%. 
Individual entrepreneurs are subject to a 12% CIT rate on their total income.
Farming enterprises are subject to a 7% CIT rate.
Small and medium companies that are not registered as VAT payers and correspond to specific criteria may opt for a special CIT regime of 4% on their aggregated income determined for accounting purposes, except for sources of income considered as non-taxable under the general tax regime.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate in Moldova is currently 20%. It is generally applied to local supplies of goods and services, as well as to import of goods and services through a reverse-charge mechanism.
Apart from the above, certain types of supplies are subject to reduced VAT rates. For instance, local supplies of bread and bakery products; milk and dairy products; transport and distribution of natural gases services; biofuels used for electricity, heating, and hot water production; and specific phytotechnical, horticultural, and zootechnical products are subject to the reduced 8% VAT rate.
The VAT rate for hotels, restaurants, and cafes decreased from 12% to 8% as of 10 August 2023.
As of 1 October 2021, during the national state of emergency, as declared by Parliament in accordance with the provisions of Law no. 212/2004 on the state of emergency, siege and war regime, and during the national public health state of emergency, as declared by the extraordinary national commission of public health, the VAT rate for above-mentioned activities was set at 6%.
Starting 15 April 2022, the e-book production and/or audio and electronic periodicals publications and/or audio, as well as editing services, services regarding copyright, and related rights, are VAT-exempted supply without deduction right.
The reverse-charge mechanism applies for supply of goods by insolvent economic operators. Thus, buyers are required to calculate and pay to the state budget the related VAT amounts on purchased goods.
The reverse-charge mechanism for VAT on imports of services has been implemented, so VAT payers are not required to pay VAT on such imports. The VAT amounts related to these transactions will be reflected as output VAT, and input VAT will be allowed for deduction. Non-VAT payers will be required to declare and pay VAT on the import of services.
Foreign supplies of digital services to Moldova-based individuals (B2C transactions) are taxed with a 20% VAT in Moldova. Subject to VAT are the non-resident companies performing business activity without having legal presence in Moldova:
  * that supply specific digital services and obtain income from Moldovan resident individuals who do not perform business activity, or
  * through which Moldovan resident individuals who do not perform business activity pay for specific digital services received from other non-residents, which place of supply is considered Moldova.


A number of supplies are VAT-exempt with deduction right, including international transportation and exports of goods or services. Certain supplies are VAT-exempt without deduction right.
Starting from 1 March 2024, providers of crowdfunding services are VAT-exempted without the right of deduction.
As of 15 August 2024, the settlement of additional costs or revenues from balancing the system, according to point 707 of the Electricity Market Rules, approved by the National Agency for Energy Regulation, will not constitute objects of taxation with VAT.
### Input VAT
Input VAT incurred on acquisitions of goods and/or services may be deducted, provided it is incurred by a VAT-registered payer to perform VATable supplies within its business activity.
If input VAT relates to acquisitions destined to perform mixed supplies (i.e. both VATable and VAT-exempt ones), the input VAT deduction right is allowed on a pro-rata basis.
For cases where the monthly ratio determined between the exempted supplies without deduction right and total supplies is lower than 0.05, the VAT amount paid or to be paid related to mixed procurements is fully allowed for deduction. VAT amounts previously reflected as costs or expenses in the previous tax periods for mixed procurements are deducted in the last tax period if the annual pro rata ratio is lower than 0.05.
Starting 22 November 2023, taxpayers have the right to deduct the amount of VAT paid or to be paid on acquisitions, provided that they have available the tax receipt issued by the cash register and control equipment connected to the Automated Informational System ’Electronic Sales Monitoring‘ for purchases whose value on each receipt does not exceed MDL 2,000, including VAT, but not more than MDL 10,000 for a tax period, provided that they are paid by business payment card.
As of 01 January 2025:
  * The deduction of the amount of VAT related to procurement from suppliers included in the list of taxpayers obliged to issue e-invoices will no longer be conditional on issuance through this platform.
  * The VAT amounts related to the goods purchased, as well as those related to the goods, services purchased that were used in the manufacture of goods will be allowed for deduction for cases when they were destroyed in the process of an entrepreneur’s activity as a result of exceptional situations, as defined according to Government Decision no. 1076/2010, and under the conditions in which these situations are demonstrated and confirmed.
  * The VAT paid or payable on materials and services acquired by a taxable entity for organising entertainment activities unrelated to their business operations cannot be deducted and must be reported as expenses. However, exceptions apply for those purchases made under Article 24, paragraphs (19) and (193 of the Tax Code). For taxpayers whose business involves organising entertainment and leisure activities, and where the materials and services acquired are directly used for these activities, they are entitled to deduct the VAT paid on these purchases.


### VAT refunds
Should a company register a deductible input VAT exceeding its output VAT, this balance can be partially refunded only if the company carries out a specific range of business activities (e.g. export supplies, international transportation services, production of bakery and dairy products, leasing activity). Otherwise, such VAT amount may be carried forward to the following months, offset against the company's future output VAT liabilities.
Additionally, VAT payers performing capital investments in Moldova may be entitled to refund the recoverable VAT related to these kinds of capital investments, provided such assets are used for product manufacturing, service supply, and execution of works.
Companies registered as VAT payers that register the transactions via the Automated Informational System (AIS) and/or issue tax receipts via cash machines with Electronic Sales Monitoring (ESM) have the right to refund VAT on purchased goods and services. The refund will be made for the excess amount of VAT on purchases (including VAT on imports) over the amount of VAT on supplies for transactions registered as of 1 January 2023.
The possibility to offset the VAT amounts allowed for refund against future obligations to the national public budget is also available, at the request of taxpayers not having debts to the national public budget.
### VAT administration
A company is required to register for VAT purposes if the total turnover within the last 12 consecutive months reached the threshold of MDL 1.2 million. Also, companies can follow voluntary registration for VAT purposes if they only intend to perform taxable supplies.
If the subject was previously registered as a VAT payer, the period of holding the status of VAT payer is not considered when assessing the registration threshold.
All VAT payers registered for VAT purposes must submit electronic tax returns. VAT liabilities must be declared and settled monthly no later than the 25th day of the month following the reporting one.
Non-resident legal entities providing services through electronic networks to Moldovan resident individuals or through which payment for services is made are required to follow a simplified registration procedure within the electronic system of the State Tax Service. Subsequently, they are required to calculate, report, and pay the related VAT amounts by the 25th day of the month following each quarter.
Generally, taxpayers are required to issue VAT invoices for the performed supplies, as well as to keep detailed records of their acquisitions and supplies in the correspondent VAT ledgers, according to a set of specific rules.
Starting 1 January 2021, the taxpayers performing supplies within public acquisitions are required to issue electronic tax invoices (except for the supplies of electricity, heat, natural gas, electronic communications services, and utilities).
Starting 1 May 2022, a taxable subject must provide to the buyer an electronic tax invoice for VATable supply of main petrol products (i.e. gasoline, diesel) on Moldova territory.
In the case of deliveries of goods paid for using business payment cards, when using e-invoices, the deadline for the supplier to issue a tax invoice is the tenth calendar day of the month following that in which the delivery took place.
As of 01 January 2025, the obligation has been established to issue e-invoices for the delivery of goods and/or services (except for deliveries of electricity, thermal energy, natural gas, electronic communications services and home utilities) to economic agents from the Republic of Moldova that do not have tax relations with its budgetary system or within the implementation of technical and investment assistance projects.
## Customs duties
Moldova’s current customs framework is regulated by the Customs Code, Law on Customs Tariff, international agreements concluded by Moldova to date, and by other legal acts.
The new Custom Code entered into force 1 January 2024.
Customs duties include customs procedural taxes, customs taxes, VAT, and excise duties.
### Customs regimes
The new Customs Code outlines the following regimes for placing goods: 
  * Release for Free Circulation (Import). Duties are applied based on established tariff schedules. 
  * Special Regimes. Specific duties or exemptions may apply depending on the regime's nature. These include: 
    * transit: external and internal transit of goods.
    * storage: customs warehouses and free zones. 
    * specific use: temporary admission and final destination. 
    * processing: active and passive processing. 
  * Export. Duties, if applicable, are determined by export-related policies. 


### Customs valuation
Under Moldovan customs legislation, the customs valuation is conducted in accordance with the principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
The customs value is determined based on one of the six provided valuation methods: transaction value, transaction value of identical goods or similar goods, unit price method, the calculated value of goods. If the first method is not applicable, then the second method should be applied and so forth.
### Preferential tariff treatment
Moldova has free trade arrangements (FTAs) with the most of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries and is also a contracting state of the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) and is party to the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), as well as party to EU-Moldova Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA). Under these agreements, preferential tariff treatment is granted for specific categories of goods, depending on their origin and in accordance with the FTAs to which Moldova is a party.
Also, further to the Association Agreement with the European Union (EU), the customs duties on goods originating in the other party are eliminated. The origin of goods can be certified by an EUR.1 movement certificate or an origin declaration.
Customs duties applicable on imports performed in the Republic of Moldova are eliminated, except for products free of customs duties within the limits of the tariff quotas. In case these limits are exceeded, the most-favoured-nation customs duty rate shall apply.
Customs duties applicable on imports performed from the EU are eliminated, except for the following products:
  * Products free of customs duties within the limits of the tariff quotas. In case these limits are exceeded, the most-favoured-nation customs duty rate shall apply.
  * Products subject to entry price for which the _ad valorem_ component of the import duty is exempted.
  * Products subject to the anti-circumvention mechanism.


Elimination of the customs duties on some specific categories of goods will be gradually made.
### Favourable tariff treatment
A favourable tariff treatment presumes a reduction or an exemption from customs duty upon import of specific goods into Moldova, depending on their type or final destination. This is governed by domestic customs law or international agreements to which Moldova is a party.
### Customs administration
Moldovan customs legislation provides for:
  * the concepts and procedures of post clearance audit
  * the obligation of individuals and companies to maintain the necessary documents for customs control for at least four years, and
  * the obligation of individuals and companies that perform external trade transactions to maintain the related documents for the purposes of post clearance audit for at least four years. This term runs from the end of the year in which the declarations for release for free circulation or export were accepted.


The Customs Service of Moldova uses procedures for issuing binding tariff and binding origin information. Additionally, companies may use the electronic procedure of customs clearance for the export of goods, as well as specific simplified customs procedures.
## Excise duties
Excise duties apply to the production and import of cars, tobacco, alcohol, petrol and lubricants, and other goods. Special excise rates for each type of excisable goods are established in the Tax Code. The rates are widely variable and are based on multiple factors. The excise duty rates are generally established as a percentage applied to the value of goods or as a fixed amount for a certain quantity of excisable goods. However, for specific types of excisable duties, mixed excise duty rates are applicable.
The following are subject to excise duties, unless there is a specific exemption provided:
  * Any individual or legal entity producing and/or processing excisable goods on the territory of Moldova.
