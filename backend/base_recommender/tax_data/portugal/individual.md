## Youth Personal Income Tax ("_IRS_ _Jovem_ ")
With the 2025 State Budget, the Youth Personal Income Tax (PIT) tax regime is extended, making it applicable to income from employment and self-employed work earned by taxpayers (not dependents) who are up to 35 years old, while also eliminating the condition related to the completion of a cycle of studies.
In summary and in accordance with the current regime, income from Category A (employment income) and Category B (self-employment/business income) earned by taxpayers who are up to 35 years old who are not dependents is partially exempt from PIT in the first ten years earning employment or self-employment income.
The exemption applicable corresponds to 100% of the income earned in the first year, 75% in the second, third and fourth years, 50% in the fifth, sixth and seventh years and 25% in the eighth, ninth and tenth years, capped at 55x Social Support Index (_IAS_).
A transitional regime has been created which establishes that, for purposes of exemption, taxpayers are included in the percentage corresponding to the year following the number of years of income generation from categories A and B already elapsed, not considering, for this purpose, the years in which they were considered dependents.
The exemption does not apply in the years in which income from categories A and B is not earned, resuming its application for the remaining years income is obtained by the taxpayer, until a total of ten years of exemption or the age limit of 35 years is reached.
## Former tax residents regime
In the 2019 State Budget, a new tax regime was introduced to encourage the return of emigrants to Portugal. The regime consists of a 50% relief from taxation of employment or self-employment income received after their return to Portugal.
With the 2024 State Budget, this tax relief is extended to taxpayers who become tax residents in the years 2024, 2025, and 2026, provided that they: 
  * did not qualify as tax residents in Portuguese territory in any of the five years prior to their return
  * qualified as tax residents in Portugal in any period prior to those five years
  * have their tax situation regularised, and 
  * did not apply for the register in the non-habitual residents (NHR) regime. 


This tax relief (capped at EUR 250,000 for those returning in 2024, 2025, and 2026) is applicable to income earned in the first year of residency after the return to Portugal and in the following four years, expiring after this period.
While the regime applies, entities required to withhold tax on the income covered by this regime shall apply the withholding tax (WHT) rates determined based on half of the income paid or made available (keeping in mind the EUR 250,000 cap).
## Tax Incentive Scheme for Scientific Research and Innovation (IFICI) 
With the 2024 State Budget, a tax incentive for research and innovation is created. 
The regime applies to individuals who (i) become Portuguese tax residents, under Portuguese domestic law, in a specific year, (ii) have not qualified as tax residents in Portugal in any of the previous five years, (iii) do not benefit or have benefited from the NHR regime or the former resident regime, and (iv) carry out activities provided for in the applicable legislation.
Different procedures should be enacted in order to apply for the regime, depending on the activity performed / on the criteria of eligibility.
In general terms, the regime shall provide for: 
  * A special 20% rate on net employment income (category A) and business and professional income (category B) from the activities identified in the applicable legislation. 


  * An exemption on foreign-sourced employment income, business and professional income, investment income, rental income, and capital gains (as a rule, foreign-sourced income is exemptwith the exception ofpension income and income sourced in “blacklisted” countries).


## Gains from share plans
In May 2023, Portugal introduced a special tax regime applicable to income/gains arising from share plans granted for the benefit of employees or board members (in the last case with some limitations for 2023). This regime establishes a deferral from taxation to one of the first moments foreseen in the legislation (e.g. sale of the shares/rights) and also states that gains derived from said share plans shall be taxable only on 50% of the respective amount at a flat rate of 28%, provided certain requirements and conditions are met (both by the employer and the employee).
The application of this special tax regime depends on the maintenance of the rights underlying the assets generating the gains or of the equivalent rights, for a minimum period of one year. 
Finally, this special tax regime does not apply to individuals who directly or indirectly hold a stake equal to or higher than 20% of the share capital or voting rights of the entity granting the plan.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 20 February 2025
Residents in Portugal for tax purposes are taxed on their worldwide income at progressive rates varying from 13% to 48% for 2025.
Non-residents are liable to income tax only on Portuguese-source income, which includes not only that portion of remuneration that can be allocated to the activity carried out in Portugal but also remuneration that is paid/borne by a Portuguese company or permanent establishment (PE).
Non-residents are taxed at a flat rate of 25% on their taxable remuneration (e.g. employment, self-employment, and pension income) in 2025.
## Resident income tax rates for 2025
Taxable income (EUR) | Tax rate (%) | Deductible amount (EUR)  
---|---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 8,059 | 13.00 | 0  
8,059 | 12,160 | 16.50 | 282.07

83,696 | 48.00 | 10,539.00  
For the purpose of applying the tax rate, the taxable income is divided by two if the taxpayers are married and not judicially separated, as well as in the case of  _de facto_ marriages, whatever the circumstances, should they opt for joint taxation.
Special rates apply to capital gains and investment income.
## Additional solidarity rate
In 2025, an additional solidarity rate, which varies between 2.5% and 5%, applies to taxpayers with a taxable income exceeding EUR 80,000 and EUR 250,000, respectively.
## Subsistence level
Portuguese tax legislation includes a specific rule that ensures individuals who primarily receive employment income, business and professional income, and/or pension income are guaranteed a minimum level of net income (subsistence level).

## Tax returns
PIT returns should be filed by 30 June of the year following the one the income relates to.  An extended deadline may apply if certain conditions are met.
Married couples may opt to file a joint tax return disclosing the total income earned by both. 
In case of taxpayers who do not opt for filing a joint tax return, the respective dependants should be reported in both parents’ annual income tax returns.
Foreign bank accounts are required to be disclosed on annual income tax returns.
With the 2024 State Budget, the annual PIT return shall mandatorily include information on all sources of income earned in the previous year, including income subject to final WHT rates not aggregated with other income or not subject to PIT exceeding EUR 500, as well as assets held in jurisdictions subject to a clearly more favourable tax regime. 
## Payment of tax
Portugal uses a pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system, adjusted by annual tax return filing. Additional payments or refunds are made based on the tax returns filed.
For Portuguese income tax returns electronically submitted by the legal deadline (i.e. by 30 June of the year following the one the income relates to), the Portuguese tax authorities should issue the tax assessment by 31 July of that year and the respective tax due, if applicable, should be paid by 31 August. If the Portuguese tax authorities do not issue the tax assessment by 31 July, the tax liability should be paid within one month from the issue of the referred tax assessment.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 20 February 2025
## Employment expenses
Union fees paid to Portuguese trade unions (in the part that does not constitute a direct contribution for health, education, elderly support, home, insurance, or social security benefits) may be deducted against employment or pension income. The deduction is 200% of total fees, up to a limit of 1% of the taxpayer’s gross employment or pension income.
## Deductions against rental income
The concept of deductible expenses encompasses all the expenses effectively incurred and paid by taxpayers in order to obtain or assure rental income, excluding the financial costs, depreciation, furniture, household appliances, decorations, and comfort accessories. Regarding properties in a horizontal proprietorship, other mandatory expenses incurred by the owner of each fraction will be also deductible.
The expenses incurred in the 24 months prior to the beginning of the lease/rent, concerning repair and maintenance expenses of the property, can also be deducted, provided that during such period the property has not been used for another purpose than the lease.
## Personal allowances
In Portugal, personal allowances take the form of tax credits (_see the section for more information_).

## Treatment of trusts
Regarding the taxation of income from trusts, the Portuguese legislation provides rules to tax the following realities:
  * Amounts received by individuals from liquidation, revocation, or extinction of ‘fiduciary structures’.
  * Distributions made by ‘fiduciary structures’ other than as a result of any of the above operations.


The amounts received as a result of liquidation, revocation, or extinction of ‘fiduciary structures’ are:
  * Taxable as capital gains (Category G) whenever the recipients are settlors of the trust. Taxation arises either at 28% or at 35%, in the latter case if the structure is considered to be ‘domiciled’ in a jurisdiction that is on the ’black list’ of tax havens published by the Portuguese authorities.
  * Subject to stamp duty whenever the recipients are not settlors of the trust. The liability of transfers for no consideration to stamp duty follows the territorial principle, meaning that only assets that are located or deemed to be located in Portugal are subject to taxation. Taxable transfers are subject to a 10% flat rate. 


Regarding the distributions paid by fiduciary structures, the amounts either paid or made available to a taxpayer from ‘fiduciary structures’, other than those arising from a liquidation, revocation, or extinction, are taxable as investment income (Category E) and subject to taxation at a flat rate of 28% or of 35% (if the trust is considered to be domiciled on a 'blacklisted' jurisdiction), regardless of whether the recipients are settlors or not.
The transfer for consideration of rights on trusts, including the transfer for consideration of the beneficiary position, qualifies as a capital gain subject to taxation.
The rate is 35% in case of trusts domiciled in countries, territories, or regions subject to more favourable tax regimes.
A trust is considered as having its domicile in a country, territory, or region subject to a more favourable tax regime if the head office or place of effective management of the trustee is domiciled therein. If the trustee is a natural person, the same applies if one is resident for tax purposes therein.
Capital gains derived from the transfer for consideration of rights on trusts are considered as having Portuguese source if the assets of the trust are comprised directly or indirectly in more than 50% of real estate or rights in rem of real estate located in the Portuguese territory. Reference is made to any moment of a period of 365 days prior to the transfer.
## Tax treatment of crypto assets income
Based on the legislation in force (since 2023), the definition of crypto assets includes all digital representations of values or rights that can be transferred or stored electronically using distributed ledger technology or similar. Unique and non-fungible crypto assets are excluded from this definition (e.g. NFTs).
In general terms, as a rule, the new regime establishes that:
  * Gains obtained with the transfer for a consideration of crypto assets that are not securities are regarded as capital gains (Category G) for tax purposes. A relief from taxation applies in the case of crypto assets held for 365 days or more. Moreover, no taxation arises on crypto assets held for less than 365 days whose consideration on a transfer is also crypto assets.
  * Activities involving mining or on-chain or the validation of crypto assets transactions through consensus mechanisms (e.g. staking) shall be considered commercial and industrial activities, taxed accordingly within the scope of the Category B of income (Business and Professional Income). Income derived from these transactions is deemed realised on the moment of the transfer of the crypto assets for consideration.
  * Any type of remuneration derived from investment of crypto assets qualifies as investment income (Category E) for tax purposes (e.g. delegated staking). In case the income is received in the form of crypto assets, taxation occurs considering it as a capital gain (Category G), rather than investment income (Category E). In this case, the taxation is deferred to the moment in which the crypto assets received (the above-mentioned 'remuneration') are transferred for consideration and some exclusions may apply.


Both the termination of the (self-employment) activity and the cease of Portuguese residency are equivalent to transfers for consideration (exit tax).


# Portugal
## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 20 February 2025
## Employment income
Employment income/remuneration is specifically defined in the Personal Income Tax (PIT) Code and covers all payments made by the employer, such as salary, bonuses, commissions, tax reimbursements, redundancy payments, pensions, allowances (e.g. cost-of-living and housing allowances), and benefits in kind (e.g. company cars), regardless of where the payment originates.
Domestic and foreign travel allowances, as well as mileage and lunch allowances in excess of those permitted to employees of state departments, are also taxable as employment income.
### Benefits in kind
In general, benefits in kind provided by an employer are subject to income tax at the employee level. There are specific provisions on taxation of employer-provided housing or housing allowances, use and acquisition of company cars, and share plans.
For PIT purposes, the taxable benefit from the use of a company car is taxable at the employee level if there is a written agreement between the employer and the employee regarding the allocation of a specific car to the last. In these circumstances, the benefit corresponds to 0.75% of the market value of the car, multiplied by the number of months of use of the car. If the company car is then acquired by the employee, a further benefit in kind will correspond to the positive difference between the market price of the car and the total amount already taxed as a benefit in kind to the employee as a result of using the car plus the acquisition price. The market price corresponds to the difference between the acquisition price and the balance derived from that value considering a depreciation factor published by the relevant authorities.
As a temporary measure, there is an exemption from PIT and social security contributions on the benefit in kind derived by employees (allowances excluded) resulting from the use of permanent housing in the Portuguese territory made available by the employer. This shall apply from 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2026. The exemptions are capped at the limit of the value of the rents foreseen in the Programme to Support Rental (_Programa de Apoio ao Arrendamento_). 
The exemption shall not apply to taxpayers that hold, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the share capital or of the voting rights of the employer. 
### Termination of employment
Redundancy payments are taxable on the portion that exceeds the average remuneration paid during the last 12 months of employment, multiplied by the number of years of employment, unless a new employment contract or service contract is concluded with the employer or a related person within 24 months from the date of termination of the employment contract.
However, in case of a manager or administrator, the redundancy payments are fully liable to taxation. This measure is also applicable for public sector managers and PE representatives.
### Pensions
EUR 4,462.15 of pension income is tax exempt.
## Business and professional income
Income from a commercial, industrial, or agricultural activity and income from a sole trader (including scientific, artistic, or technical services) or from intellectual rights (when earned by the original owner) may be taxed either in accordance with a simplified regime or based on the taxpayer’s accounts. The simplified regime will apply only to taxpayers who, not having opted for organised accounts, have a turnover or a gross business and professional income lower than EUR 200,000 (for 2025) in the previous year. Under this simplified regime, the above income is taxed on 0.15% of sales of products or 0.75% of income arising from business and professional services listed in the table referred to in Article 151 of the PIT Code.
A coefficient of 0.35 is applicable to services not expressly foreseen in the table referred to in Article 151 of the PIT Code.
The income 'deduction' arising from the application of the coefficients of 0.75 and 0.35 (i.e. the generality of the service-rendering activities) is partially conditioned by the verification of expenses and charges effectively incurred and related to the activity. Therefore, to the taxable income determined by applying the coefficients will be added the positive difference between 15% of the gross income and the sum of the following amounts:
  * EUR 4,462.15 or, when higher, the total amount of mandatory social security contributions (in the part not exceeding 10% of the gross income received).
  * Staff expenses, wages, or salaries communicated to the Portuguese tax authorities.
  * Property rentals allocated to the professional activity communicated through the issue of an electronic receipt or a specific statement, whose invoices and other documents are communicated to the Portuguese tax authorities (if only partially assigned to the professional activity, it is considered only 25% of the total amount).
  * 1.5% of the tax registration value of the properties assigned to the business or professional activity or 4% of the tax registration value of properties assigned to hotel or letting activities (if only partially assigned to the professional activity, it is considered only 25% of the total amount).
  * Other expenses with the acquisition of goods and services related to the activity, duly communicated to Portuguese tax authorities, namely expenses with current consumption materials, electricity, water, transports and communications, rents, litigation, insurance, leasing rents, mandatory fees paid to professional associations and other organisations representing professional activities to which the taxpayer belongs, travels and stays of the taxpayer and one's employees (if only partially assigned to the activity, it is considered only 25% of the total amount).
  * Imports and intra-Community acquisitions of goods and services related to the activity.


In addition to the amount of the above deduction, the amount of mandatory social security contributions paid, exceeding 10% of gross income and related to such professional activities, may also be deducted to the self-employment income if not deducted for other purposes.
## Capital gains
As a general rule, capital gains will be subject to tax at a flat rate of 28%. Only 50% of capital gains arising on the sale of shares held on micro and small companies not listed in the stock exchange will be subject to taxation.
As of 1 January 2023, the positive balance between capital gains and capital losses arising from the transfer for consideration of shares and other securities is mandatorily aggregated if the following conditions are met:
  * The assets have been held for less than 365 days.
  * The taxable income of the taxpayer, including the balance of the capital gains and capital losses, amounts to or exceeds EUR 83,696.


These rules apply also to the balance between capital gains and capital losses subject to the aggravated 35% tax rate (country, territory, or region subject to a clearly more favourable regime).
According to recent changes that have been introduced to the PIT Code in 2024, in general terms, gains/losses resulting from the disposal of securities admitted to trading or participation units in investment funds/open collective investment undertakings may benefit from an exclusion from taxation of:​
  * 10 % of the gain, if resulting from assets held for a period of more than 2 years and less than 5 years.​
  * 20 % of the gain, if resulting from assets held for a period equal to or greater than 5 years and less than 8 years.​
  * 30% of the gain, if resulting from assets held for a period equal to or greater than 8 years.​


Since 2023, similarly to the regime applicable to tax residents, in the case of non-residents, only 50% of capital gains arising from the sale of real estate is taxed. This income is taxed at the marginal rates varying between 13% and 48% (plus the solidarity rate, if applicable) for 2025. In the case of non-tax residents, in order to determine the tax rate applicable to those capital gains, it is considered the worldwide income received (even if not taxed in Portugal). 
In the case of tax residents, there are some circumstances under which the gain may be wholly or partially exempt (provided certain requirements are met), such as in case the property being sold was the taxpayer's primary residence in the last 12 months and the sale proceeds, reduced by the value of any outstanding loans relating to the purchase of the property being sold, are reinvested in the acquisition, improvement, or construction of another primary residence in Portugal or within the European Union (EU) within 36 months from the sale or in the period of 24 months previous to the sale. Other exemptions may also apply on the capital gains arising from the sale of real estate.
## Dividend and interest income
Dividends and interest are liable to taxation at a flat rate of 28%. However, the taxpayer may opt to be liable to tax on dividends and interest received at the marginal rates varying between 13% and 48%, plus the solidarity tax rate, if applicable (in 2025).
A credit against the Portuguese tax liability is available for the lower of the tax paid in the foreign country on those dividends and interest or the amount of tax payable in Portugal on that income. For dividends and interest paid by countries with which Portugal has signed a double taxation treaty (DTT), the tax credit should not exceed the percentage established in the treaty.
If the taxpayer opts to tax dividends at the marginal tax rates in force,only 50% will be liable to taxation if the paying company is tax resident in an EU country and complies with the requirements set out in the Directive on the common system of taxation applicable in the case of parent companies and subsidiaries of different Member States.
Interest income arising from current or saving accounts on Portuguese banks is taxed at 28% for residents. Interest paid by non-resident entities to tax resident individuals is also taxed at a rate of 28%.
Investment income paid or made available to recipients resident in the Portuguese territory by non-resident entities that also do not have a PE in the Portuguese territory, but which are domiciled in a blacklisted jurisdiction, are liable to a tax rate of 35% (in 2025), either by WHT or by the application of a special rate.
## Rental income
As a rule, rental income earned by tax residents and non-tax residents is liable to a special tax rate of 28%. Rental income from residential rentals is taxed at 25% for contracts signed/renewed from October 2023 onwards (some exceptions may apply, determining the date as from which this rate starts to be applicable). The taxpayers have the option for the inclusion of such income in the total aggregated income in some situations. Special reductions or exemptions may apply, provided certain conditions are met.
The rental income that results from a consistent practise of the lease of properties, by option of the taxpayer, may be taxable as income from business and professional activities (self-employment [Category B]). However, in order to determine the income subject to taxation, the same rules used for determination of the rental income in ‘Category F’ should be taken into account.


# Portugal

## Non-habitual residents (NHR) regime
The NHR regime was revoked with effect from 1 January 2024 onward. However, the regime is still applicable to those who (i) are already registered as NHR on 1 January 2024 or (ii) by 31 December 2023 meet the conditions for registration as NHR. 
The regime is also applicable to individuals who became tax residents until 31 December 2024, provided certain conditions were met. 
### Conditions, taxation, and other specificities 
A taxpayer who became tax resident in Portugal for a certain year and has not been taxed as resident in Portugal for any of the previous five years are eligible for the special tax regime for non-habitual tax residents (additional conditions imposed by law apply for those who became tax residents in 2024 in order for them to be entitled to the special regime).
An application for the non-habitual residents tax regime has to be submitted electronically by 31 March, inclusive, of the year following the year in which the taxpayer became tax resident in Portugal (those who became tax residents in 2024 and are eligible for the regime under the special conditions imposed by law have until 31 March 2025 to submit the application).
In general terms, non-habitual residents are taxed at a flat rate of 20% in respect of employment income (Category A) and self-employment income (Category B) arising from high-value activities of a scientific, artistic, or technical nature.
A tax exemption (with progression, depending on the category of income) applies on foreign-source income (e.g. property income, interest, and dividends), provided certain conditions are met. In most cases, capital gains on the sale of securities are taxable at a flat rate of 28%. In addition, a flat tax rate of 10% is applicable on pensions from a foreign source, as well as to other payments from pension funds and similar retirement schemes.
A non-habitual resident acquires the right to be taxed as such during a ten-year period.
## Tax Incentive Scheme for Scientific Research and Innovation (IFICI) 
With the 2024 State Budget, a tax incentive for research and innovation is created. 
The regime applies to individuals who (i) become Portuguese tax residents, under Portuguese domestic law, in a specific year, (ii) have not qualified as tax residents in Portugal in any of the previous five years, (iii) do not benefit or have benefited from the NHR regime or the former resident regime, and (iv) who carry out activities provided for in the applicable legislation. 
Different procedures should be enacted in order to apply for the regime, depending on the activity performed / on the criteria of eligibility. 
In general terms, the regime shall provide for: 
  * A special 20% rate on net employment income (category A) and business and professional income (category B) from the activities identified in the applicable legislation. 


  * An exemption on foreign-sourced employment income, business and professional income, investment income, rental income and capital gains (as a rule, foreign-sourced income is exempt with the exception of pension income and income sourced in “blacklisted” countries).

With the 2025 State Budget, the Youth Personal Income Tax (PIT) tax regime is extended, making it applicable to income from employment and self-employed work earned by taxpayers (not dependents) who are up to 35 years old, while also eliminating the condition related to the completion of a cycle of studies.
In summary and in accordance with the current regime, income from Category A (employment income) and Category B (self-employment/business income) earned by taxpayers who are up to 35 years old who are not dependents is partially exempt from PIT in the first ten years earning employment or self-employment income.
The exemption applicable corresponds to 100% of the income earned in the first year, 75% in the second, third and fourth years, 50% in the fifth, sixth and seventh years and 25% in the eighth, ninth and tenth years, capped at 55x Social Support Index (IAS).
A transitional regime has been created which establishes that, for purposes of exemption, taxpayers are included in the percentage corresponding to the year following the number of years of income generation from categories A and B already elapsed, not considering, for this purpose, the years in which they were considered dependents.
The exemption does not apply in the years in which income from categories A and B is not earned, resuming its application for the remaining years income is obtained by the taxpayer, until a total of ten years of exemption or the age limit of 35 years is reached.

## Social security contributions
### Employees
Social security contributions are shared by the employee and the employer. In general terms, the contributions are due on the employee’s gross remuneration at rates of 11% and 23.75% by the employee and the employer, respectively. These contributions cover family, pension, and unemployment benefits.
In addition to social security contributions at a general rate of 23.75%, employers must buy an insurance premium to cover occupational accidents. The premium varies according to work and risk classification.
### Members of the board
Regarding members of the board, the social security rates correspond to 9.3% with respect to the individual contributions and 20.3% for employer contributions. However, the contribution rate applicable to members of statutory boards who are considered as managers or administrators is set at rates of 23.75% and 11% to employers and members of statutory boards, respectively. The contributions of members of statutory boards are based on their effective remuneration but subject to a monthly minimum income level of EUR 522.50.

### Self-employees
The contributions rate applicable to self-employees corresponds to 21.4%. For self-employees under the simplified tax regime, the monthly contribution basis corresponds to 1/3 of the relevant remuneration determined in each reporting period and produces effects in that month and in the following two months. For the determination of the relevant remuneration of the self-employee, it is considered the income received in the three months previously to the reporting month. The relevant remuneration corresponds to 70% of the income from services rendered and to 20% of the income related to the production and sales of products. 
The basis of contributions considered in each month has a limit of 12 times the IAS.
A 10% contribution rate is due by employers if 80% or more of the fees earned by the self-employee come from services for the same company, for the same person with a business activity, or to the same group. A 7% contribution rate is due by employers when the economic dependence of the self-employee varies between 50% and 80%. The contribution is payable upon the issue of a tax assessment by the social security authorities.
