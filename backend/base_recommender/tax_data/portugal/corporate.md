## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year is, as a general rule, the calendar year. A different tax year is allowed in the case of companies obligated to accounting consolidation and of PEs of non-resident entities, which can adopt the tax period of the non-resident company. The different tax year should, however, coincide with the period to which the financial statements concern. If the option of a tax year different from the calendar year is taken, the new tax period must be maintained for a minimum of five years. The five-year minimum period is not applicable if the taxpayer is transferred to a group of companies that are subject to consolidation of financial statements and the holding company has a fiscal year different from the one that was being adopted by the taxpayer.
## Tax returns
The annual CIT return must be submitted by electronic data transmission by the last day of May of the year following the year of income. Whenever the tax year ends on a date other than 31 December, the annual CIT return shall be submitted by electronic data transmission by the last day of the fifth month following the year-end. The system is one of self-assessment.
## Payment of tax
Tax is paid in instalments. Three payments on account are due in July, September, and up to 15 December of the year in which taxable income arises corresponding to 95% of the previous year's corporate tax assessment (for taxpayers with a turnover above € 500,000; 80% if below this amount). Payments on account are not required if the previous year's corporate tax assessment is less than € 200. The third payment may be suspended upon declaring that no further tax is due in respect of the current year. However, interest is assessed at a rate of 4% if this results in postponing more than 20% of the tax that would otherwise have been paid.
A last instalment is paid (or received) through self-assessment upon filing the annual tax return in May of the following year.
If the tax year ends on a date other than 31 December, interim payments take place in the seventh, ninth, and up to the 15th of the 12th month of the tax year.
Filing of the annual tax return together with the final payment is in the fifth month following the close of the tax year.
Three additional payments on account of _Derrama Estadual_ (or _Derrama Regional_ , in the case of the Autonomous Regions of Madeira and of the Azores) are due on the same dates as the interim payments mentioned above. The additional payments on account correspond to 2.5% of the taxable profit above € 1.5 million and up to € 7.5 million, 4.5% of the taxable profit above € 7.5 million and up to € 35 million, and 8.5% of the taxable profit above € 35 million, assessed in the previous year.
### Interest and penalties
Late assessment interest is due in case of delay on the assessment of taxes due. Late assessment interest is computed on a daily basis. The current rate of late assessment interest is 4% (year).
Late penalty interest is due in case of delay in the payment of the tax assessed. The current rate is 5.997%. Late penalty interest is computed on a daily basis. Tax penalties for companies are capped at € 165,000 in the case of intention and € 45,000 in the case of negligence. In general, in case of failure or late payment of CIT, companies are liable to a penalty varying between 30% and 100% of the tax due, capped at € 45,000 (in case of negligence).
Specific tax penalties apply regarding transfer pricing documentation (including CbC reporting) and the CFC regime (between € 1,000 and € 10,000 for companies) and regarding omissions or inaccuracies regarding ruling requests (between € 750 and € 22,500 for companies in the case of urgent rulings or 25% of the previous amounts in the case of non-urgent rulings).
There is the possibility of applying for penalty reduction, provided certain requirements are met (e.g. regularisation of the tax situation/payment of the tax due; situation where there was no damage to the Revenue).
## Tax file
Taxpayers followed by the Unit of Large Taxpayers are required to send the tax file to the PTA, including the transfer-pricing file, by 15 July following the end of the tax period (15th day of the seventh month for entities with a tax year different from calendar year).
## Tax audit process
Taxpayers are audited by the PTA based on several criteria, as detailed in a specific document prepared by the PTA.
The PTA must notify the taxpayers of the preliminary conclusions reached in cases where these may lead to tax assessment acts unfavourable to the taxpayers, further to which taxpayers may present their argumentation.
The PTA must then prepare a final report of the tax audit performed, identifying the facts detected.
Tax audits may be initiated within the statute of limitations (_see below_).
Tax audits must be concluded within six months. A prorogation of the deadline to one year may apply under certain conditions (e.g. complexity of the facts involved, necessity to make use of mechanisms of mutual assistance on tax matters, additional/new information being provided by the taxpayer).
The PTA releases, on a periodical basis, a list of taxpayers that, due to the nature of their activities, their turnover, or other criteria, are subject to regular monitorisation. There is also a specific department for large taxpayers.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations period is four years. Regarding facts involving black-listed jurisdictions, the statute of limitations for the right to assess taxes is extended to 12 years while the time period allowed to collect taxes is extended to 15 years. The statute of limitations period is also increased from four to 12 years in case of facts related to deposit and securities accounts in financial institutions outside the European Union.
When a tax inspection is legally suspended, the statute of limitations period is also suspended.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The criteria for the selection of taxpayers for tax audits is foreseen in the Tax and Customs Audit Procedure legal framework (_Regime Complementar do Procedimento de Inspecção Tributária e Aduaneira_ or RCPITA) and in the annual national activity plan for tax and customs audits (_Plano Nacional de Atividades da Inspeção Tributária e Aduaneira_ or PNAITA). These criteria consider EU and international guidelines, whistleblowers complaints, as well as significant deviations from standard economic patterns in the taxpayers’ behaviour in view of the activity developed or the assets it owns, or any acts or omissions that may indicate a tax infraction. There is a special focus on tax planning, including the general and the specific anti abuse-rules, transfer pricing, corporate restructuring, derivatives, and non-residents without a PE. 
In addition, general criteria are made available in the annual report on the fight against tax and customs fraud and evasion. The 2022 annual report, published June 2023, stated the following criteria: tax fraud, aggressive tax planning, cross-border transfers of funds, sale of real estate, board members with low income reported, use of credit and debit cards, VAT recurrent credit position without refunds being requested, control of taxpayers that request VAT refund without being audited, control of VAT deductions and margins, excessive allowances (such as travels and meal expenses), control of initial and final inventories, R&D tax incentives, income tax discrepancies, impairment losses, goodwill amortisation, and variations in worth.
Finally, the Tax Authority 2023 public activity plan (_Plano de Atividades 2023_) , released November 2023, states the intention of strengthening and empowering the resources of the Tax Authority to deal with aggressive tax planning mechanisms, leveraging on the existing legal reporting framework for domestic as well as cross-border arrangements (e.g. to ensure the compliance with Council Directive (EU) 2018/822, of 25 May 2018, amending Directive 2011/16/EU, of 15 February, hereafter ’DAC 6‘, as regards the mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation). There is also the intention to continue applying international cooperation instruments, such as exchange information agreements, tax treaties, protocols, and administrative cooperation.
## Anti-avoidance
A general anti-avoidance provision is in force, pursuant to which contracts and other acts are ineffective whenever it is demonstrated that they were put in place for the main purpose or one of the main purposes of reducing the taxation that would be due under contracts bearing a similar economic effect, in which case taxation would be based on the latter. This general anti-avoidance provision was revised to be in line with the provisions of the EU Directive 2016/1164 (ATAD I).
The anti-avoidance procedure is initiated within the general term foreseen (statute of limitations) and is flexible in terms of proof by the PTA.
Anti-avoidance rules are not applicable in cases where a request for obtaining binding information is not answered by the PTA within 150 days.
## Binding rulings
Binding rulings can be:
  * Urgent: A decision should be taken in 75 days; these are subject to the payment of a fee ranging between € 2,550 and € 25,500, depending on the complexity of the matter; if no decision is taken within the deadline established, there is a tacit approval of the taxpayer's understanding of the tax matter.
  * Non-urgent: A decision should be taken in 150 days; no fees are charged; a decision is required (no tacit approval, as in case of an urgent ruling).


## Fight against tax fraud and evasion
It is mandatory that payments above € 1,000 are made by a means that allows the identification of the recipient of the income (e.g. bank transfer, nominative cheque, direct debit).
Council Directive 2011/16/EU, on the matter of administrative cooperation in the field of taxation, has been transposed to the Portuguese legislation, reviewing the exchange information mechanisms between tax authorities and aiming at a more effective action against tax evasion and fraud at an international level.

The profits of a Portuguese branch are taxed on the same basis as corporate profits. 
The taxable profit of a PE in Portugal of a non-resident entity also includes:
  * Income derived from the sale of goods and services made by the head office to natural or legal persons that are resident for tax purposes in Portugal, provided that such goods and services are identical or similar to those sold through the PE. 
  * All other income obtained in the Portuguese territory derived from activities that are identical or similar to those carried out through the PE.

  * Exchange of information, with the conclusion of agreements with black-listed jurisdictions, introduction of exchange of information clauses in existing tax treaties and in the new tax treaties signed, amendment of patent box regime, very much in line with BEPS Action 5 and following the transposition of EU Council Directive 2011/16/EU and its subsequent amendments (Directive on Administrative Cooperation or DAC).
  * Anti-treaty shopping and limitation on benefits clauses in tax treaties, very much in line with BEPS Action 6.
  * Mandatory disclosure of aggressive tax planning schemes, very much in line with BEPS Action 12 and following the EU DAC6.

  * Pillar Two mechanisms, namely the IIR, the UTPR and a QDMTT, generally in line with the EU Directive 2022/2523 and the OECD/Inclusive Framework administrative guidance.


Portugal was one of the signatory countries of the Multilateral Instrument (MLI) in June 2017, which is effective from 1 June 2020 onwards, following the deposit of the instrument of ratification in February 2020.
## Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
Since 2014, Portugal has embraced and implemented the FATCA and the global CRS for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information (the AEOI standard).
The implementation of the FATCA was made on an intergovernmental basis, through a Model 1 FATCA Intergovernmental Agreement. In 2014, the FATCA obligations were introduced in the Portuguese legal system, through the approval of the Financial Information Reporting Regime (FIRR). Two years later (2016), additional FATCA Complementary Regulations were approved, laying down rules on due diligence procedures and deadlines.
Also, Portugal is one of the CRS’s early adopters. On 29 October 2014, it signed the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) for the CRS, formally reaffirming its commitment to start exchanging financial information automatically under the AEOI standard from 2017.
In October 2016, Portugal introduced into its domestic legal system a mechanism for reciprocal automatic exchange of information, with respect to residents in other EU member states and any other CRS participating jurisdictions, through the enactment of the Decree-Law No.64/2016, of 11 October. This law also transposed the Council Directive 2014/107/EU, of 9 December 2014 (also known as DAC2), amending the Council Directive 2011/16/EU as regards mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation.
With the adoption and implementation of these mechanisms, Portugal became part of the first set of jurisdictions that are exchanging financial account information with other jurisdictions committed to the CRS, on an automatic basis and at a global and multilateral level.
The State Budget Law for 2023 has changed the deadline for fulfilling the reporting obligation of the CRS regime. Therefore, for the purposes of the CRS regime, reporting financial institutions must report information regarding each account subject to communication by 31 May of each year (previously, 31 July).
Additionally, the communication and reporting deadline for the FATCA regime has not undergone any changes, so the deadline for fulfilling the reporting obligation of the FATCA regime remains 31 July of each year, with reference to 31 December of the previous year.
## Transfers to countries, territories, and regions with a more favourable tax regime
Following Law 14/2017, of 3 May, that amended the General Tax Law, the Portuguese tax authorities are required to publish on their website, on an annual basis, all transfers, including respective amount and reason, as well as statistics about those transfers, whose beneficiaries are in countries, territories, and regions with a more favourable tax regime (_see list below_).
List of countries, territories, and regions that provide a more favourable tax regime:
American Samoa | Dominica (1) | Liechtenstein | Saint Pierre and Miquelon  
---|---|---|---

  2. Alderney, Brechou, Great Sark, Guernsey, Herm, Jersey, Jethou, Lihou, and Little Sark.


## Automatic access of the Portuguese Tax Authority (PTA) to financial information of residents
Law 17/2019, of 14 February, approved the regime for the automatic exchange of financial information with respect to accounts with a balance or value that exceeds € 50,000 held by individuals or entities residing in the Portuguese territory (IFR regime).
Reporting financial institutions must report to the PTA, by 31 July of each year, regarding the IFR regime, the following information regarding each account subject to communication, with reference to 31 December of the previous calendar year:
  * The name, address, Tax Identification Number (TIN), and date and place of birth (in the case of an individual) of each reportable person that is an account holder. In the case of any entity, the name, address, and TIN, as well as the name, address, TIN, and date and place of birth of each of its controlling persons that is deemed reportable.
  * The account balance or value (including, in the case of a cash value insurance contract or annuity contract, the cash value or surrender value) as of the end of the relevant calendar year or, if the account was closed during such year, the closure of the account.
  * In the case of any custodial account: (i) the total gross amount of interest, the total gross amount of dividends, and the total gross amount of other income generated with respect to the assets held in the account, in each case paid or credited with respect to the account during the calendar year; and (ii) the total gross proceeds from the sale or redemption of financial assets paid or credited to the account during the calendar year with respect to which the reporting financial institution acted as a custodian, broker, nominee, or otherwise as an agent for the account holder.
  * In the case of any depository account, the total gross amount of interest paid or credited to the account during the calendar year or other appropriate reporting period.
  * In the case of any other account, the total gross amount paid or credited to the account holder with respect to the account during the calendar year with respect to which the reporting financial institution is the obligor or debtor, including the aggregate amount of any redemption payments made to the account holder during the calendar year or other appropriate reporting period.


This regime covers financial accounts whose holders or beneficiaries are resident on national territory with respect to the information related to 2018 and following years.
## The new digital platform reporting rules - DAC 7
The Directive (EU) 2021/514 of 22 March 2021, hereafter referred to as DAC 7, represents a new amendment, specifically the seventh, to Directive 2011/16/EU on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation. On 26 July 2023, Law No. 36/2023 was published, transposing DAC 7, in Portugal.
Reporting platform operators are required to report to the PTA specific information with respect to the operator itself and also with respect to the reportable sellers by 31 January of the year following the calendar year in which the seller is identified as a reportable seller. Tax administrations have until the end of February to exchange information between Member States.
The first reporting year was 2023, so the first declaration should have been submitted by the reporting platform operator by 31 January 2024 (covering the 2023 calendar year), and the tax administrations exchanged information between Member States by the end of February 2024.
The reporting deadlines are the same for subsequent years, both for reporting platform operators (31 January, referring to the previous calendar year) and for tax administrations (by the end of February of the calendar year following the one being reported).
In the event of non-compliance, by the reporting platform operator, to comply with DAC 7 reporting obligations, the PTA is expected to impose penalties.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
### VAT rates
There are three VAT rates: the standard rate of 23% (22% in the Autonomous Region of Madeira; 16% in the Autonomous Region of the Azores), the reduced rate of 13% (12% in Madeira; 9% in the Azores), and the super-reduced rate of 6% (4% in Madeira from 1 October 2024 onward, 4% in the Azores).
The reduced rate is applicable to the supply of several products and services, including meals at restaurants and take away, musical instruments, and agricultural tools.
The super-reduced rate is applicable, among others, to the supply of some essential food products, periodic publications, books, pharmaceutical products, hotel accommodation, agricultural products, passenger transport, acquisition and supply and installation of devices, machines and other equipment intended exclusively or mainly for the capture and use of solar, wind, and geothermal energy, and other alternative forms of energy. It is also applicable to the supply of electricity for consumption for a contracted power that does not exceed 6.90kva.
Exports and intra-EU supplies of goods are zero-rated.
As of 4 January 2024, the basic food basket no longer benefits from a zero VAT rate.
### Supplies of goods
Supplies of goods are subject to VAT in Portugal if the goods are located in Portugal at the moment their transport or dispatch to the customer begins. If the goods are located in Portugal and there is no transport or dispatch, then supplies of the goods are subject to VAT at the moment they are put at the disposal of the customer.
### Supplies of services
Supplies of services are, in general, subject to VAT in Portugal whenever: (i) acquired by taxable persons that have their business, a fixed establishment, domicile, or residence in Portugal to which the services are provided (B2B rule) or (ii) supplied to non-taxable persons if the provider has established its business, a fixed establishment, domicile, or residence in Portugal from where these services are provided (B2C rule).
Regardless of the place where the service provider and the acquirer are established, and of the acquirer being a taxable person, the supply of the following services is subject to VAT in Portugal if physically carried out in Portugal:
  * Services connected with immovable property in Portugal.
  * Passenger transport for the distances covered in Portugal.
  * Admission to cultural, artistic, scientific, sporting, educational, entertainment, or similar events in Portugal.
  * Restaurant and catering services in Portugal.
  * Short-term hiring of a means of transport (up to 30 days, for boats up to 90 days) if the means of transport are put at the disposal of the customer in Portugal.


The supply of the following services is subject to VAT in Portugal if physically carried out in Portugal and if the acquirer is a non-taxable person:
  * Transport of goods, other than intra-Community transport of goods, for the distances covered in Portugal.
  * Intra-Community transport of goods if the place of departure is Portugal.
  * Valuations of and work on movable property.
  * Services and ancillary services relating to cultural, artistic, sporting, scientific, educational, entertainment, or similar activities, such as fairs and exhibitions, including the supply of services of the organisers.
  * Hiring of a means of transport, other than short-term hiring, when the acquirer is established, has one’s permanent address, or usually resides in Portugal.


Telecommunications, broadcasting, television, and electronic services supplied to non-taxable persons are taxed in Portugal if:
  * the service provider is established, has a permanent address, or usually resides in Portugal
  * the acquirer of the services resides in another member state, and
  * the total value of such services does not exceed € 10,000, with reference to the previous or current year.


However, such services shall not be taxed in Portugal if the service provider has its head office, PE, or domicile in another member state and provided that:
  * the total value of such services does not exceed € 10,000, with reference to the previous or current year, and
  * the acquirer is not a VATable person and does not reside in the same member state as the service provider.


Furthermore, the EU e-commerce VAT package established some changes with effect from 1 July 2021, including the extension of the mini one stop shop (MOSS) to a one stop shop (OSS) to allow suppliers to account for the VAT due in the member state of consumption on: (i) all types of cross-border services to private consumers (where the place of taxation is in the European Union) as well as on (ii) intra-EU distance sales of goods, for which VAT is, in principle, due in the member state of destination.
## Customs duties
Customs duties are regulated by the Community Customs Code. Therefore, the rules foreseen for the import and export of goods in Portugal are similar to the rules applicable in other EU member states.
The customs duties' rates applied in Portugal vary according to the origin of the goods. There are several origin agreements that exempt from customs duties the importation of goods from certain countries or that determine reduced rates.
## Excise duties
There are different types of excise duties, such as petroleum and energy products tax, alcohol and alcoholic beverages tax, tobacco tax, and vehicle tax.
The tax applicable to petroleum and energetic products depends on the goods supplied, for example:
  * For diesel, it varies between € 278 and € 400 per 1,000 L.
  * For the supply of natural gas, when used for carbonate fuel the tax applicable is € 0.307/GJ, and when used as propellant the tax applicable is € 1.15/GJ.


The tax applicable to alcohol and alcoholic beverages also depends on the type of good supplied, varying between € 9.64 and € 33.85 per hectolitre for beer and € 1,602.51 per hectolitre for spirits.
Non-alcoholic beverages with added sugar are also liable to excise duties, depending on the added sugar amounts.
The tax applicable to tobacco (_ad valorem_) also varies in accordance with the type of product supplied (e.g. cigarettes, heated tobacco and fine-cut tobacco for rolling, cigarillos, tobacco used in a water pipe, and liquids for electronic cigarettes).
The tax applicable to vehicles varies in accordance with the type of vehicle, the fuel used, CO2 emissions, and the cylinder of the vehicle.
The environment component CO2 emissions is measured based on the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP).
An excise duty on consumption of electricity is due by producers, traders, self-producers, and consumers that buy electricity in organised markets.
Please note that the rates for petroleum and energy products, tobacco, and alcoholic beverages may differ depending on whether the tax is due on the mainland, in the Autonomous Region of Azores, or in the Autonomous Region of Madeira.
## Property tax (_Imposto Municipal sobre Imóveis_ or IMI)
IMI is a municipal property tax on the tax registration value (TRV) of urban and rural properties located in Portuguese territory. For urban properties, the TRV is determined by means of a valuation, based on the type of property, calculated by reference to a formula based on objective criteria, such as the construction cost per square metre, area, age, construction quality, and comfort indexes. IMI is owed by the real estate owner, the usufructuary, or the holder of the surface right of a real estate unit with reference to 31 December of the year that it concerns.
IMI is levied at the following rates, in addition to corporate or individual tax assessed on actual income generated by real estate:
Real estate type | IMI (%)  
---|---  
Urban real estate | 0.3 to 0.45  
Rural real estate | 0.8  
Real estate owned by residents in a black-listed jurisdiction (except individuals) and by entities in a direct or indirect domain or control relation with entities domiciled in tax havens | 7.5  
Annual IMI rates are increased three times when urban real estate is in ruins or vacant for a period of over one year. In the case of real estate which conservation status results from natural disaster or calamity, this aggravated IMI rate does not apply. The same is valid for the additional increase of the IMI rate by 30% in the case of degraded buildings. 
Municipalities are allowed to increase the IMI rate applicable to buildings or part of buildings located in urban pressure areas as follows: (i) up to 100% in the case of buildings for local lodging (_alojamento local_) and (ii) up to 25% in the case of residential buildings that are not rented or allocated to the taxpayer’s permanent abode. The increase can go up to 50% if the taxpayer is a collective person or other equivalent entity for tax purposes.
Municipalities can increase the IMI rate applicable to urban real estate properties that have been vacant for more than one year, to buildings in ruins, and to land for construction intended for residential purposes when located in designated areas of urban pressure. In this situation, the IMI rate can be increased ten times, with a possible additional increase of 20% in each of the following years, capped at 20 times the applicable IMI rate. However, the aggravated rate (20 times the IMI rate for urban building) can be increased upon decision of the municipality as follows: (i) by 50% in the case of residential building or unit that is not rented or used for permanent abode in the respective year and (ii) by 100% if the taxpayer is a collective person or other equivalent entity for tax purposes.
### IMI exemptions and reductions
#### Urban real estate subject to urban rehabilitation
There is an IMI exemption available to urban real estate subject to urban rehabilitation for a three-year period, renewable for an additional five-year period in case of buildings intended for leasing for permanent abode or main permanent abode.
This exemption is only available to buildings located in urban rehabilitation areas or buildings that have been built more than 30 years ago.
#### Historical stores
Historical stores, recognised by municipalities as establishments of historical, cultural, or social interest and that integrate the national inventory, will be IMI exempt for the year in which these situations occur.
#### Other benefits of environmental status attributed to real estate
By resolution of the municipal assembly, municipalities may determine a reduction of up to 25% of the IMI rate, applicable to urban real estate with energy efficiency.
#### Tax incentives for forestry activity
An IMI exemption is applicable to rural real estate within forest areas covered by a forest intervention zone and to rural real estate intended for forestry exploitation under a forest management plan.
#### Tax regime for investment promotion (RFAI)
Companies with investments that qualify for the RFAI can benefit from an IMI reduction or exemption for a period of up to ten years in relation to any real estate acquired and regarded as an eligible investment.
#### Properties intended for residential purposes
An IMI exemption is applicable to land for housing construction when there has not yet been a final decision regarding the prior control procedure for construction works and properties regarding which the final decision for residential purposes has not yet been issued.
#### Lease Support Program ( or PAA)
An IMI exemption is applicable to urban buildings or autonomous units acquired, rehabilitated, or constructed to be allocated to the PAA.
#### Rental contracts concluded before the Urban Lease Regime
Buildings subject to a rental contract for housing, concluded before the Urban Lease Regime, in case of tenants with a corrected annual gross income (RABC) of less than five annual national minimum wages (RMNA) or aged 65 years or more over or disabled with a degree of disability equal to or higher greater than 60% are exempt from IMI.
### Additional to the IMI (AIMI)
AIMI is owed by individuals and corporations, as well as by structures or collective bodies without autonomous legal personality and undivided inheritances, that are owners, usufructuaries, or have the surface right of urban properties located in Portugal.
Urban properties classified as for ‘trade, industry, or services’ and ‘others’ are excluded from AIMI.
In the case of real estate financial leases, lessors are not allowed to charge AIMI on lease payments if the tax registration value of the property does not exceed € 600,000.
The taxable basis corresponds to the sum of the TRV of all the urban properties held by each taxpayer, reported as of 1 January of each year.
Properties that benefited from an IMI exemption in the previous year are excluded from the taxable basis.
The applicable rates are 0.4% for corporations, 0.7% for individuals and undivided inheritances, and 7.5% for urban properties owned by entities in tax havens.
AIMI is assessed by the Portuguese Tax Authority (PTA) in June of each year, with the respective payment being made in September.
Construction and housing cooperatives are no longer AIMI exempt when they own, have the right of surface of, or the usufruct of, exclusively, properties intended for social housing or for rent-controlled apartments.
On the other hand, the exclusion of taxation of properties that are exclusively intended for the construction of social housing or controlled-costs owned by construction and housing cooperatives or residents' associations is established.
The properties owned by construction and housing cooperatives, as well as residents' associations, will be excluded from taxation.
#### CIT credit
Taxpayers have the option to deduct the AIMI paid, limited to the fraction of the tax corresponding to the income generated by properties subject to AIMI, in the scope of lease or accommodation activities. This deduction option (deduction to the CIT fraction) jeopardises the deduction of AIMI in the determination of income subject to CIT.
## Property transfer tax (_Imposto Municipal sobre as Transmissões Onerosas de Imóveis_ or IMT)
IMT is a municipal tax levied on the transfer for consideration of real estate located in the Portuguese territory. The tax is owed by the acquirer at the rates shown below, and the taxable basis is the Tax Registration Value or for the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whichever is higher. Note that the direct acquisition of at least 75% of a Portuguese company’s shares, whose assets derive directly or indirectly by more than 50% from real estate located in Portugal, is also subject to IMT, as long as the properties are not directly allocated to a commercial, industrial, or farming activity (except for real estate buy-sell activity). The direct acquisition of at least 75% of the units of close-ended real estate investment funds is also subject to IMT.
Real estate type | IMT (%)

## Payroll taxes
There are no payroll taxes other than social security contributions (_see below_).
## Social security contributions
As a rule, employers are required to make monthly social security contributions at the standard rate of 23.75% on the monthly gross remuneration of their employees.
Social security contributions are deductible for CIT purposes.
## Bank levy and solidarity surcharge on the banking sector
Portuguese headquartered credit institutions, Portuguese subsidiaries of foreign credit institutions, as well as branches in Portugal of foreign credit institutions, including those resident in the European Union, are subject to a bank levy, applicable on a two-pronged tax base, as follows:
  * Base I: Liabilities less the amount of the deposits covered by deposit guarantee schemes, such as the Deposit Guarantee Fund, the Mutual Agricultural Credit Guarantee Fund, or other officially recognised deposit guarantee scheme under the EU Directives. For this purpose, liabilities are defined as the set of elements accounted for in the balance sheet representing liabilities towards third parties, irrespective of their form or nature (excluding, amongst others, items accounted for as equity, liabilities for defined benefit retirement plans, provisions, liabilities concerning the revaluation of financial derivatives).
  * Base II: The notional amount of off-balance sheet financial derivatives, excluding hedging derivatives and back-to-back derivatives.


The bank levy rate is set at a maximum of 0.11% on Base I and of 0.00030% on Base II.
In addition to the bank levy, the aforementioned credit institutions are also subject to a solidarity surcharge, levied upon the same taxable base as the bank levy. The solidarity surcharge rate is 0.02% on Base I and 0.00005% on Base II.
Both the bank levy and the solidarity surcharge have been widely challenged in court.
## Carbon tax on air and sea travels
A carbon tax due by the user in the amount of € 2 applies on air, sea, and river travels.
This carbon tax is levied on the issuance of transport tickets in respect of:
  * passenger commercial flights departing from airports and airfields located in the Portuguese territory, and
  * landing of passenger vessels on terminals located in the Portuguese territory, in respect of fuelling, repair, embarking, and disembarking of passengers.


As of 1 July 2023, a carbon tax is also levied on consumers of commercial and non-commercial flights departing from airports and airfields located in the Portuguese territory in the case of aircraft with up to 19 passengers. The applicable rate results from applying a formula that considers, among other circumstances, the aggravated pollution coefficient _per capita_ and the maximum passenger capacity of the aircraft.
## Levy on single-use packages and plastic bags
A levy is due for all single use packages, including composed packaging, acquired in ready-to-eat meals, for take-away, home delivery, and to store meals ready for consumption in the place of supply to the final consumer.
The levy is set at € 0.10 per package in Portugal mainland and can be passed along the economic chain. The final charge levy to the final consumer cannot be less than € 0.20 per package.
Regarding the plastic bags, it is foreseen a levy of € 0.08 for plastic bags and of € 0.04 for lightweight plastic bags.
