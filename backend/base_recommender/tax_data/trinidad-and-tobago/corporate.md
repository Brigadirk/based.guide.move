## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 31 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year is the calendar year. Companies are assessed by reference to their accounting period, which for tax purposes cannot exceed 12 months other than in the year of cessation of the business.
## Tax returns
The taxpayer is required to file a tax return with the BIR by 30 April following the end of the fiscal period. An automatic six-month grace period is allowed, following which a penalty is imposed of TTD 1,000 for every six months or part thereof that the return remains unfiled.
## Payment of tax
Corporation tax, business levy, and green fund levy are payable quarterly in advance on 31 March, 30 June, 30 September, and 31 December. Any balance of tax due is payable on or before 30 April of the following year. Instalments of corporation tax are based on an estimate of the current year’s liability or on the actual chargeable profits for the previous year, whichever is greater. If the current year’s estimate is lower, the company may apply to the BIR to reduce its quarterly instalment. The levy liabilities are based on the actual receipts for the quarter.
## Tax audit process
Tax audits are conducted by the BIR. There is no specific timeframe to conduct an audit, but, generally, companies are selected for varying reasons, including where large refunds are claimed. The BIR usually notifies the company of the intended audit and requests that the books and records be made available for inspection. An assessment is generally raised after the audit.
## Statute of limitations
A company carrying on business in Trinidad and Tobago is required to keep proper accounts and records and is required to retain these accounts for a period of at least six years after the completion of the transactions, acts, or operations to which they relate or three years after the filing of its return (whichever is later).
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The following issues are currently the focus of the tax authorities:
  * Transfer pricing. 
  * CARICOM tax planning structures. 
  * Management and other fees paid to non-resident persons.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 31 January 2025
Corporate residence is determined by reference to the location of the central management and control of the business of a company.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
A non-resident company is subject to corporation tax on its income derived from trading within Trinidad and Tobago. A company is deemed to be engaged in or carrying on trade or business in Trinidad and Tobago if it has an office or place of business or has a branch or agency within Trinidad and Tobago. The local legislation does not make any reference to the term ‘permanent establishment’; however, this term is used generally in the treaty context. Subject to the terms of specific double taxation treaties (DTTs), a non-resident company will have a PE in Trinidad and Tobago where:
  * it has a fixed place of business in Trinidad and Tobago through which the business of the company is wholly or partly carried on, or 
  * it has an agent acting on behalf of the company and that agent has the authority to bind the company. 


The term ‘fixed place of business’ has been generally defined to include a place of management, a branch, office, factory, a workshop, an installation or structure for the exploration of natural resources, or a building, construction, or installation project.
Most treaties outline circumstances under which a company will not be deemed to have a PE, and these include where the activities of the company are merely of a preparatory or auxiliary nature.


# Trinidad and Tobago
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 31 January 2025
## Depreciation
Tax depreciation rates (wear-and-tear allowances) have been standardised by statute. Fixed assets are to be classified into one of four classes:
Asset class | Depreciation rate (%)  
---|---  
Class A: Buildings and improvements | 10  
Class B: Motor vehicles, furniture and fittings, plant and machinery | 30  
Class C: Heavy equipment, motor lorries, trucks, and computer equipment | 33.3  
Class D: Extra heavy equipment, airplanes | 40  
The allowance is calculated at the rate applying to aggregate expenditure incurred on assets within the class on a declining-balance basis.
Accelerated tax depreciation is allowed to manufacturers in the form of an initial allowance at the rate of 90% on capital expenditure on plant and machinery. The allowance is to be claimed in the year that the asset is first brought into use. For those companies engaged in the refining business, production of sugar or petrochemicals, or enjoying concessions under the Fiscal Incentives Act, the rate is 20%.
Gains on the sale of tax-depreciable assets are taxable as ordinary income (i.e. a balancing charge) but only when the written-down value of the assets of a class goes into credit. Prior to this, the proceeds of sale are credited to the particular class, thereby reducing the written down value of the class. Tax depreciation is not required to conform to book depreciation.
### Petroleum operations
A company engaged in the petroleum production business is entitled to capital allowances on tangible costs and intangible drilling and development costs as follows:
  * Effective from 1 January 2020, tangible and intangible exploration and development expenditure is computed on a straight-line basis over five years (20% _per annum_).
  * A company engaged in exploration activities in a deepwater block is granted an uplift of 140% of capital expenditure incurred on drilling of exploration wells, on which capital allowances can be computed.


There is no timing in respect of claiming of allowances (e.g. on achievement of commercial production). A claim for capital allowances cannot be deferred.
## Goodwill
Goodwill expense is generally not allowable in arriving at chargeable income.
## Start-up expenses
No specific rules exist in respect of start-up expenses, but, generally, these expenses are not deductible.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses incurred by a company in the production of its income are generally allowed as deductions. However, in the case of interest payable or paid by the company, there are certain restrictions that exist in the taxing Acts, as well as in practice by the tax authority, that could restrict a company’s ability to deduct interest paid or payable in its computation of tax for a particular year of income. The criteria laid down by the legislation for the deductibility of interest are:
  * The sums borrowed are wholly and exclusively incurred in the production of income.
  * The interest is revenue in nature.
  * The interest income earned is either chargeable to tax or exempt under the Trinidad and Tobago legislation.
  * Where the interest payment is being made to a non-resident, the payer has accounted for and paid over WHT to the BIR.


## Bad debt
A specific provision for bad debt will be deductible for tax purposes where:
  * it is in respect of a revenue expenditure
  * it is made in accordance with acceptable accounting principles
  * it is specific, and
  * it becomes bad in the year in which the claim is made.


## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions under deeds of covenant to approved charities are deductible, up to a maximum of 15% of total income.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are not generally deductible.
## Taxes
Other than SPT, taxes or levies are not generally deductible in arriving at taxable profit.
## Other significant items
Contributions by local insurance companies to 'catastrophe reserve funds' are deductible for tax purposes, up to the value of 20% of net premium income from property insurance business.
## Net operating losses
A trading loss may be carried forward indefinitely to be set-off against future profits. Effective 1 January 2020, the Income Tax Act was amended to restrict the use of the tax losses carried forward by companies engaged in the petroleum production business to 75% of the otherwise chargeable profits. Loss carrybacks are not permitted.
A limited form of group loss relief exists, whereby current year losses may be surrendered to a claimant company within a group, except that the claimant’s tax liability cannot be reduced by more than 25%. Such companies must be resident in Trinidad and Tobago.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
A corporation engaged in business in Trinidad and Tobago may claim a deduction for royalties, interest, and service charges paid to foreign affiliates, provided the appropriate WHT is deducted and properly accounted for. For interest to be deductible for tax purposes, the funds borrowed must have been utilised in the production of income and the recipient must be subject to tax in Trinidad and Tobago or otherwise specifically exempt from local tax.
Deduction for management charges (as this term is defined) paid to a non-resident is restricted to the lower of the management charges or 2% of deductible outgoings and expenses, exclusive of the charges. Tax depreciation allowances may not be treated as an expense for this purpose. WHT may also be applicable to management charges paid to non-resident persons.


# Trinidad and Tobago
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 31 January 2025
There is no provision for group taxation in Trinidad and Tobago; however, a limited form of group loss relief is available (_see Net operating losses in the section_).
## Transfer pricing
There are no specific transfer pricing rules in Trinidad and Tobago. However, the legislation empowers the tax authority to disregard any transactions that it views as artificial or fictitious. This general power has been utilised by the tax authority in dealing with related parties and large multinational companies to evaluate whether transactions are at arm’s length.
It should also be noted that the Minister of Finance recently announced the proposed enactment of Transfer Pricing (TP) laws which is expected to be introduced in 2025 and aligned to the OECD guidelines.

Corporations are subject to a business levy at the rate of 0.6% of gross revenue or receipts where the levy exceeds the corporation tax liability. Exemption is available for certain companies, including petroleum companies and companies whose annual turnover is less than TTD 360,000. The levy is a non-deductible expense for corporation tax purposes.
The business levy rates for small and medium enterprise (SME) companies listed on the Trinidad and Tobago Stock Exchange, within the first ten years from listing on such stock exchange, are broken down and calculated into five-year periods as follows:
  * 0% for the first five years from listing.
  * 50% of the rate of the business levy for the next five years immediately following the previous period and thereafter at the standard rate.


Effective 1 January 2024, there is an exemption from business levy on revenue earned by a manufacturer from export sales.
## Green fund levy
A green fund levy of 0.3% on gross income is applicable to companies and partnerships doing business in Trinidad and Tobago. This levy is payable quarterly and is neither a deduction in computing chargeable income nor a credit against corporation tax due.

## Excise taxes
Excise taxes are imposed at varying rates on certain manufactured goods, including tobacco, alcohol, and petroleum products.
## Property taxes
All ‘land’ in Trinidad and Tobago is subject to property tax. Land under the Property Taxes Act (PTA) is broadly defined to include land covered with water and all buildings, structures, machinery, plant, pipelines, cables, and fixtures erected or placed upon, in, over, under, or affixed to land. The PTA stipulates the process for arriving at the quantum of tax payable as follows:
  * The Commissioner of Valuations is to assess the annual rental value (ARV) of the property.For the purposes of computing the ARV where a rental value is not readily available, the capital cost of the property is used and converted by applying the following factors: 
    * Residential: 3.5%.
    * Commercial: 5%.
    * Industrial: 5%.
    * Plant and machinery not housed in a building: 3%.
  * The Board of Inland Revenue (BIR) will determine the annual taxable value (ATV) using the ARV less such deductions as it sees fit for voids or loss of rent of 10% of the ARV.
  * The applicable tax rate is then applied to the ATV, as follows: 
    * Agricultural property: 1%.
    * Residential property: 2%.
    * Commercial property: 5%.
    * Industrial plant and machinery housed in a building: 6%.
    * Plant and machinery not housed in a building: 3%.


Only Residential property tax has been implemented currently.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is levied on instruments of all types (e.g. deeds of conveyance, mortgages, debentures, trust deeds, leases, insurance policies, annuity policies, agreements, share transfers). The rate of stamp duty varies from TTD 25 on a trust deed to up to 10% of market value on property conveyances.
## Payroll taxes
