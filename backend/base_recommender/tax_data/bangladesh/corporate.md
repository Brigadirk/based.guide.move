## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
## Taxable period
The prescribed tax year in Bangladesh (other than for banks, insurance companies, or financial institutions) is from 1 July to 30 June of the following year.
The prescribed tax year for banks, insurance companies, and financial institutions is from 1 January to 31 December.
A subsidiary or holding company in Bangladesh having a foreign parent has an option to adopt a different financial year to keep themselves aligned with their foreign parent.
## Tax returns
Companies are required to file their tax returns within the due date, known as ‘Tax Day’. The due date for filing the income tax return for companies is the 15th day of the seventh month following the end of the income year or the 15th day of September following the income year if the 15th day of the seventh month as mentioned above falls prior to this date. 
In case of failure to file the return within the Tax Day, additional tax is levied at 2% per month on the difference between the tax assessed on the total income and tax already paid or deducted for the period commencing from the first day immediately following the Tax Day to the date of filing the return (where the return is filed) or the date of regular assessment (where the return is not filed).
Moreover, to claim certain tax incentives or deductions, taxpayers have to furnish their tax returns on or before the due date specified for filing the tax returns.
Relief from filing an income tax return has also been specified for certain classes of taxpayers.
## Payment of tax
Tax is payable in advance in specified instalments on or before 15 September, 15 December, 15 March, and 15 June of the tax year (this also applies in case a taxpayer is assessable to income tax in Bangladesh for the first time and whose total income for that financial year is likely to exceed BDT 600,000). Any remaining tax due based of the return must be paid on a self-assessment basis before the income tax return is filed.
Interest is levied at 10% _per annum_ (15% if the return is filed after Tax Day) on the amount of shortfall if taxes paid are less than 75% of the amount of assessed tax payable. Interest is computed from 1 July following the relevant financial year to the date of regular assessment or a period of two years starting from 1 July, whichever is shorter.
### Penalties
Penalty for shortfall in payment of Advance Tax (AT) is equal to the amount of AT that has been short paid.
## Tax audit process
The Board, or any authority under the Board, is authorised to select returns for audit and send them to the Commissioner of Taxes. The Commissioner of Taxes appoints an inquiry team, an audit team, and an audit curator for each audit case. The DCT issues a notice to the taxpayer informing her or him of the audit and sends a copy of such notice to the inquiry team. The inquiry team, audit team, and the audit curator undertake the audit procedure and submit the final audit report to the DCT to either complete the audit proceedings or to initiate assessment proceedings. Based on the report, the Commissioner of Taxes takes a decision, and the DCT informs the taxpayer of the next course of action. The audit process must be completed within two years from the end of the year of selection for the audit.
## Statute of limitations
The Board grants a time period of two years from the end of the AY to issue a notice for audit selection. The audit is to be completed within two years from the end of the year in which the notice for audit selection has been issued.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Some of the topics of focus for tax authorities in Bangladesh are as follows:
  * Simplifying and clarifying the income tax provisions and procedures to facilitate compliance and reduce disputes.
  * Widening the tax base and scope by introducing new measures, such as taxing undisclosed income and wealth, expanding the definition of deemed dividends, and imposing minimum tax on more sources of income.
  * Enhancing the use of technology and digital platforms for filing returns, making payments, preserving records, and conducting audits and assessments.
  * Rationalising the tax rates and incentives for individuals and corporations, especially in sectors such as information technology, manufacturing, and economic zones.
  * Strengthening the enforcement and penalty mechanisms for tax evasion, non-compliance and fraud, and streamlining the appeal and dispute resolution processes.


## Anti-avoidance rules
The General Anti-Avoidance Rules (GAAR) in Bangladesh are designed to prevent tax evasion and avoidance through various means. These rules are part of the country’s tax legislation and are aimed at ensuring that all taxable income is properly reported and taxed.
The DCT has the authority to adjust tax benefits if a taxpayer is found to have misused tax arrangements. The adjustments can include enhancement of income, amendment of tax liability, adjustment of tax refund, revision of allowances, concessions, and revoking any tax benefits.
These adjustments are intended to be comprehensive and affect all relevant aspects under the Act. The procedure for making these adjustments begins with the DCT issuing a notice to the taxpayer, which outlines the reasons for believing there has been an abuse of the tax system and requests the necessary documentation and information for review.

### Determination of purchase price of asset for depreciation
  * The purchase price of a motor vehicle shall be deemed to be not more than BDT 3 million. This limit is not applicable to buses or minibuses used for the transportation of students, teachers, or employees of the taxpayer.
  * The value of allowance, subsidy, rebate, or commission and assistance received from the government or any other taxpayer shall be excluded.
  * Acquisition value of used assets (except motor vehicle) is not to exceed the FMV.
  * In case of foreign currency loan or foreign currency exposure, the purchase price is to be calculated after making the following adjustments: 
    * Exchange rate fluctuation losses or exchange rate hedging expenses to be added.
    * Foreign exchange gain to be deducted.


## Amortisation
  * Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis.
  * Pre-commencement expenditure is amortised at the rate of 20%.
  * Research and development (R&D) expenses are amortised at the rate of 10%.
  * Computer software and application shall be amortised at the rate of 20% if developed in Bangladesh and 10% if developed outside Bangladesh.
  * Any expenditure disallowed during the course of tax assessment that is capital in nature shall be amortised at the rate of 10%.
  * Amortisation of license fee paid by a cellular mobile phone operator shall be allowed at a proportionate rate up to the last year of the license period.


## Start-up expenses
With a view to providing impetus to start-ups and to facilitate their growth in the initial phase of their business, the minimum tax rate for registered start-ups in a growth year is set at a nominal 0.1%. A ‘start-up’ is characterised as a company with an annual turnover not exceeding 100 crore of rupees in any financial year; incorporated under the Companies Act, 1994; engaged in innovation or technology-driven new products, processes, or services; and not formed by amalgamation or demerger.
Start-ups granting permanent access to their systems or accounts to the income tax authorities are relieved from reporting duties; however, income tax returns are required to be filed. Start-ups registered under the Act will benefit from tax exemptions in their growth years, as certain specified disallowances and provisions of special business income do not apply when determining their ‘income from business’. In case a registered start-up faces losses during a growth year that are not compensated for in that tax year, these losses can be carried forward and adjusted over the subsequent nine years.
Start-ups must register with the Board to utilise the benefits. New start-ups are required to be registered within the same financial year. (i.e. by 30 June following the year of incorporation). Growth years are the first five years after the year of incorporation.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses incurred for the purpose of business and profession are allowed as tax-deductible expenditure.
## Bad debt
The amount of any debt or part thereof that has become irrecoverable and has been written off in the books of accounts of the taxpayer is allowed as tax-deductible expenditure.
## Charitable contributions
The amount donated to specified institutions or funds and for specified purposes are allowed as a deduction for income-tax purposes.
## Expenditure incurred on corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities
CSR expenditure is allowable, subject to certain limits and fulfilment of specified conditions.
Allowable limit: The maximum limit of allowable expenditure under the head CSR is 20% of the total income or BDT 120 million, whichever is lower.
Tax rebate: Tax rebate will be computed at 10% on such expenditure for CSR within the maximum limit.
## Pension expenses
Any sum paid by the employer as contribution towards an approved pension fund is allowed as tax deductible expenditure.
## Payments to directors
Payment of any commission or discount by a company to a shareholder director is not allowed while computing business income and is taxable at the regular rate of tax.
## Research and development (R&D) expenses
Any expenditure incurred for the purpose of scientific research in Bangladesh and related to the business carried on by the taxpayer is allowed as deduction. Moreover, any sum paid to a scientific research institute, association, or other body carrying out scientific research, or university, college, technical school, or other institution, for the purpose of scientific research or technical training relating to the class of business of the taxpayer is allowed as a deduction.
Note that R&D expense is amortised at the rate of 10% (_see above_).
## Bribes, kickbacks, and illegal payments
Expenditure incurred by a taxpayer that is illegal is deemed to have not been incurred for the purposes of the business or profession. Hence, such expenses are not deductible.
## Fines and penalties
There are various procedural compliances (_viz._ submission of tax returns, disclosure of particulars of income, etc.) that taxpayers must comply with by the respective due dates prescribed therein. Non-compliance or delayed compliances with these procedures attract interest and penal consequences. There are prosecution provisions as well for certain offences.
Penalties and fines paid for infraction of, or non-compliance with, any law is not deductible as business expenditure.
## Net operating losses
Losses can be carried forward and set off against income from subsequent year(s) for certain periods and as mentioned below:
  * Speculation business loss can be set off or carried forward for set off only against speculation business income.
  * Set off of capital loss can be made only with capital gains.
  * Loss from any exempted source cannot be set off or carried forward for set off against any income.
  * Carry forward and set off of loss is denied if minimum tax, on the basis of WHT, is applicable.
  * Loss of business in the tobacco business can only be set off from the income of the tobacco business.
  * Business loss and capital loss may be carried forward for six successive AYs.
  * Unabsorbed depreciation may be carried forward perpetually.


There are no provisions in Bangladesh for carrying back losses to earlier years.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments to foreign affiliates are allowed as a deduction if these are incurred for the purpose of business transactions, which are being transacted at arm’s-length and are not of capital nature. In case taxes are not withheld as per the laws or exceed the permissible threshold limits, such payments are disallowed.
Interest exceeding BDT 1.5 million payable by a resident person (other than banks and financial institutions) to an associate enterprise requires approval from the Board to be eligible for deduction.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
There is no concept of group taxation in Bangladesh.
## Transfer pricing
### Transfer pricing on international transactions
The Bangladesh Finance Act, 2014 built upon the separate code on Transfer Pricing Regulations, which are largely based on Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines, and describe the various transfer pricing methods, impose transfer pricing documentation requirements, and contain penal provisions for non-compliance.
The Bangladesh Transfer Pricing Regulations prescribe that income arising from ‘international transactions’ between AEs should be computed having regard to the ‘arm’s-length price’, including an allowance for any expense or interest arising from an international transaction. It also includes an allocation or apportionment of, or any contribution to, any cost or expense incurred or to be incurred in connection with a benefit, service, or facility provided or to be provided to any one or more of such enterprises.
### Transfer pricing filing requirements and compliance
#### Statement of international transactions
Every taxpayer who has entered into an international transaction is required to furnish a statement of international transactions along with the return of income.
#### Documentation
Taxpayers whose aggregate value of international transactions exceeds BDT 30 million are required to maintain information and documentation, as part of their transfer pricing documentation, to demonstrate that the pricing policy complies with the arm’s-length principle.
#### Accountant’s report
Every taxpayer who has entered into international transaction(s) whose aggregate value exceeds BDT 30 million is required to obtain an independent accountant’s report in respect of all international transactions between AEs.
### Rules prescribing the use of ‘range’ and multiple-year data
The ‘range concept’ shall be applicable when (i) the most appropriate method is either the comparable uncontrollable price method, the resale price method, the cost plus method, or the transactional net margin method, and (ii) there are at least six comparables. Where these conditions are not fulfilled, the ‘arithmetic mean’ shall apply.
For the determination of the arm’s-length range, the transaction point would be the data points lying between the 30th and 70th percentile of the data set.
## Thin capitalisation
Bangladesh does not have a specific thin capitalisation regime; however, while prescribing regulatory requirements for foreign loans, the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority has recommended that the debt-to-equity ratio in a Bangladeshi company must not exceed 70:30.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no taxation rules for CFCs in Bangladesh.


# Bangladesh
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Branches of a foreign company are chargeable to tax in Bangladesh on income received or deemed to be received in Bangladesh or income that accrues or arises, or is deemed to accrue or arise, in Bangladesh. The tax rate will be as applicable to an unlisted company on net income (i.e. income less allowable expenses).
## Branch profit remittance tax
Remittance of profits (after tax) earned by a branch to its head office attracts a branch profit tax at 20% of such remittance. The remittance is not allowed by the authorised dealer bank unless the branch profit tax has been duly deposited.


# Bangladesh
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Tax incentive provisions normally have conditions applicable for the period within which the preferred activity should be undertaken and the period for which the tax incentive is available. It may also be necessary to fulfil certain other conditions, such as the ‘forming’ of a ‘new’ undertaking.
There are certain income-based and location-based incentives in Bangladesh. The major sectors are mentioned below.
Major income-based incentives:
  * Power sector
  * Export of goods
  * Public private partnership
  * ITeS
  * Auto sector
  * Industrial establishments engaged in specified activities
  * Computer-based product manufacturing
  * ICT manufacturing
  * Healthcare industry
  * Educational and training activities
  * Agro-based industry
  * Light engineering manufacturing
  * Production of home and kitchen appliances
  * Textiles
  * Jute products


Major location-based incentives:
  * Economic zones
  * Hi-tech parks (HTPs)
  * Export processing zones


Conditions to avail any tax exemption:
  * Income tax return to be filed by the Tax Day.
  * Appropriate tax deduction and tax collection should be done.
  * Exempt income to be received through bank transfer.


## Foreign tax credit
A Bangladeshi company is taxed on its global income. A foreign company is taxed only on income that is received in Bangladesh, or that accrues or arises, or is deemed to accrue or arise, in Bangladesh. This income is subject to any favourable DTAA provisions. Taxpayers can claim a credit for foreign taxes paid against their Bangladeshi tax liability, subject to the terms of international agreements. However, this credit is not available if the taxpayer is not a resident during the period on the basis of which such income is assessed. The credit is also limited to the amount of tax assessed at the average rate on double-taxed income.
Residents of Bangladesh who earn income outside the country and pay tax in that foreign country may be exempt from double taxation. The DCT can assess tax on such income at the lower of the average tax rates of Bangladesh or the foreign country. Claims for foreign tax credit must be made within two years of the tax year in which the income was chargeable in Bangladesh. However, this time limit does not apply if adjustments result in reassessment or refund claims due to DTAA provisions.
### Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs) and WHTs
Agreements may exempt certain types of income earned by residents of contracting countries from Bangladeshi tax, with provisions for tax deduction at source.
A certificate from the Board is required to be obtained to apply the tax rate as per the DTAA.

## Exchange controls
The provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947 (‘the FERA’) deal with the allowability of various types of foreign exchange transactions in Bangladesh. The Bangladesh Bank (i.e. the Central Bank of Bangladesh) issued ‘Guidelines for Foreign Exchange Transactions, 2018’ (GFET) to provide general guidelines to authorised dealer banks (‘AD Bankers’) for undertaking certain prescribed foreign exchange transactions, subject to fulfilment of conditions, in line with guidelines and circulars issued by the Bangladesh Bank from time to time.
## Business combinations
Special income tax rules apply in case of amalgamation and demerger.
The expression ‘amalgamation’ means, in relation to a company, the amalgamation of one or more companies with another company or the amalgamation of two or more companies into a new company by such process, wherein:
  * All the assets and liabilities of the amalgamating company become the assets and liabilities of the amalgamated company.
  * Shareholders holding shares representing at least 75% of the voting power in the amalgamating company should become shareholders in the amalgamated company.
  * The consideration for the amalgamation should be paid only in the form of issue of additional equity shares to the shareholders of the amalgamating company.
  * The amalgamated company can carry forward and adjust the amalgamating company’s accumulated losses or unexpired depreciation allowances as if they were its own.
  * The value of the amalgamated company’s capital assets must not exceed the depreciated value from the amalgamating company’s accounts, and no depreciation claims are allowed on revaluation surpluses.


The expression ‘demerger’ means an arrangement whereby a demerged company transfers one or more of its undertakings to a resulting company in such a manner that:
  * All the assets and liabilities of the undertaking of the demerged company become the assets and liabilities of the resulting company.
  * Capital gains from capital asset transfers during a demerger are not taxed unless shareholders receive non-share investments or shares exceeding the value of their proportionate shares in the demerged company, which are then taxable.
  * The resulting company can treat the demerged company’s accumulated loss or unexpired depreciation allowance as its own, with specific conditions for direct and indirect relations to the transferred undertaking.
  * The value of the resulting company’s capital assets must not exceed the depreciated value from the demerged company’s accounts in the demerger year, with no depreciation claims on revaluation surpluses.


## Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
Bangladesh has been progressively adopting the IFRS, which are issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB) is the primary body responsible for the adoption and implementation of IFRS in the country. The ICAB has been working on converging the local accounting standards, known as Bangladesh Financial Reporting Standards (BFRS), with the IFRS.
Currently, Bangladesh has adopted most of the IFRS, with certain modifications to suit the local economic and regulatory environment. These modified standards are referred to as BFRS.
Note that percentage of completion method is to be followed in case of long-term contracts.


# Bangladesh
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
As per the Bangladesh tax laws, income is categorised into seven areas, namely, income from employment, income from rent, agricultural income, income from business or profession, capital gains, income from financial assets, and income from other sources.
## Inventory valuation
There is no separate method in the tax laws for inventory valuation. _See Adoption of IFRS in the section for more information_.
## Capital gains
_See Capital gains taxes in the section for more information._
## Dividend income
Any dividend paid by a Bangladeshi company is deemed to accrue or arise in Bangladesh and is taxable in Bangladesh.
Tax-paid dividend distributed in favour of a company, if the company distributing such dividend income maintains a separate account for such tax-paid dividend, is excluded from the gross total income.
Dividend is taxable in Bangladesh at 20% in the hands of a company. The WHT deducted on dividend is considered as minimum tax in the hands of the recipient.
## Interest income
Interest income deemed to accrue or arise in Bangladesh includes interest payable by the government, residents (except when interest is paid for business or profession carried out outside Bangladesh or for earning income from outside Bangladesh), and non-residents (in case interest is paid for business or profession carried out in Bangladesh or earnings in Bangladesh).
Interest income is chargeable to tax at regular tax rates.
## Rental income
Any income earned from the renting of any property after deducting allowable expenses is taxable as ‘income from rent’. Property means house property, land, furniture, fixtures, factory buildings, business premises, machinery, personal vehicles, and any other tangible capital asset that can be rented.
House property refers to any house, building, or structure, which includes furniture, fixtures, and fittings that are an integral part of the house and the land upon which the house is situated. Buildings used solely as warehouses or factory buildings where rent is part of the payment for plant and machinery are not considered as house property.
Allowable expenses from rental income include the following:
  * Costs for insuring the property against loss or damage.
  * Interest or profit paid on loans from banks or financial institutions for buying, building, renovating, or reconstructing the property.
  * Any taxes, fees, or annual charges on the property, as long as they are not capital charges.
  * Pre-rental period interest on loans for the property’s acquisition, construction, repair, or reconstruction before it was rented out.
  * Standard deduction related to rent collection, utilities (water, sewerage, electricity, gas), service charges, and repair and maintenance, as well as other basic service charges:
    * House property used for commercial purposes: 30%.
    * House property used for non-commercial purposes: 25%.


When a house property is rented out only partially, the expenses related to the property can be claimed as deductions in proportion to the rental income received. 
If a house property is rented out for only a portion of the income year, the expenses that can be claimed as deductions should be proportionate to the duration for which the property was rented.
## Royalty income
Royalty earned in respect of business or profession carried out in Bangladesh or for the purpose of earning income in Bangladesh is taxable in Bangladesh. Royalty income is chargeable to tax at normal corporate tax rates.
## Partnership income
A partnership firm is taxable as an individual. _Please refer to Treatment of flow-through business entities in the section of the Individual tax summary for details_.
## Unrealised gains or losses
Unrealised gains and losses are not considered for the purpose of computing income from business.
## Foreign currency exchange gains or losses
Only realised gains and losses from foreign currency exchange are considered for computing income from business.
## Other significant items
### Special areas considered as income from other sources (IFOS)
  * If any asset is purchased (other than commercial stock or financial asset) below the FMV, then the difference of purchase price and FMV is taxable as IFOS.
  * Purchase price of any asset is taxable as IFOS in case tax is not deducted or collected at the time of making payment.
  * For any profit or benefit received due to waiver of loan or liability (whether convertible or not), the monetary value of such loan or liability is taxable as IFOS.
  * Income from winning a lottery, word game, card game, online games, or games of any nature is taxable as IFOS.
  * Receipt of paid-up share capital by an unlisted company in cash is taxable as IFOS, except receipt of any assets or services in the form of share capital in accordance with the Companies Act, 1994.
  * Borrowing of any amount from any other person other than through a banking medium is taxable as IFOS. Such borrowing will be deductible in the year of repayment.
  * If the value of a motor car or jeep exceeds 10% of the paid-up share capital and reserves along with accumulated profits, then 50% of such excess is deemed to be IFOS.


## Foreign income
A Bangladeshi company is taxed on its global income. A foreign company is taxed only on income that is received in Bangladesh, or that accrues or arises, or is deemed to accrue or arise, in Bangladesh. This income is subject to any favourable DTAA provisions. There is no anti-deferral regime in Bangladesh.


# Bangladesh
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
A resident company is taxed on its worldwide income. A non-resident company is taxed only on income that accrues, arises, or is received in Bangladesh, or that is deemed to accrue, arise, or be received in Bangladesh.
Assessment year (AY) is defined as the period starting from 1 July of a year after the end of any tax year or accounting year of the company.
For example:
  * For a tax year from 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023, the AY will be from 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024.
  * For a tax year from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022, the AY will be from 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024.
  * For a tax year from 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024, the AY will be from 1 July 2024 to 30 June 2025.
  * For a tax year from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023, the AY will be from 1 July 2024 to 30 June 2025.


A subsidiary or a branch of a foreign company may apply to the Board and seek approval for a different tax year in Bangladesh in alignment with its parent’s tax year.
The CIT rates applicable to a Bangladeshi company and a foreign company for AYs 2024/25 and 2025/26 are as follows:
Category of taxpayer | Applicable tax rate in case conditions are met (%) * | Applicable tax rate (%)  
---|---|---  
Publicly traded company that issues shares worth more than 10% of its paid-up capital through an initial public offering (IPO) | 20.00 | 22.50  
Publicly traded company that issues shares worth 10% or less than 10% of its paid-up capital through an IPO | 22.50 | 25.00  
Non-publicly traded company | 25.00 | 27.50  
One person company | 20.00 | 22.50  
Publicly traded bank, insurance, or financial institution (except merchant bank) | 37.50 | 37.50  
Non-publicly traded bank, insurance, or financial institution | 40.00 | 40.00  
Merchant bank | 37.50 | 37.50  
Company producing all types of tobacco items, including cigarette, bidi, chewing tobacco, and gul | 45% + 2.5% (surcharge) | 45% + 2.5% (surcharge)  
Publicly traded mobile operator company | 45.00 | 45.00  
Non-publicly traded mobile operator company | 45.00 | 45.00  
Association of persons (AOP) | 20.00 | 27.50  
Fund, trust, and other taxable entities | 25.00 | 27.50  
Private university, private medical college, private dental college, private engineering college, or private college solely dedicated to imparting education on information and communication technology | 15.00 | 15.00  
* Conditions:
  * All receipts and income must be transacted through bank transfer.
  * All expenses and investments over 500,000 BDT individually (BDT 3.6 million if aggregated annually) must be made through bank transfer.


## Minimum tax regime
A three-way comparative is required between regular tax on profits, WHT under certain sections, and tax on gross receipts, and the higher of the three is considered as the final tax liability for a taxpayer.
The tax on gross receipts is applicable to all companies and only to firms having gross receipts of over BDT 5 million and other persons having gross receipts of over BDT 30 million.
The rate of tax on gross receipts is as follows:
Class of taxpayer | Rate of minimum tax on the gross receipts (%)  
---|---  
Manufacturer of cigarettes, bidi, chewing tobacco, smokeless tobacco, or any other tobacco products | 3.00  
Carbonated or sweetened beverages | 3.00  
Mobile phone operator | 2.00  
Natural-person taxpayer other than manufacturer of cigarettes, bidi, chewing tobacco, smokeless tobacco, or any other tobacco products | 0.25  
Any other case | 0.60  
However, the rate of tax would be 0.10% of the gross receipts for an industrial undertaking engaged in the manufacturing of goods for the first three income years since the commencement of commercial production.
In a scenario where the taxpayer enjoys exemption from income or the income is taxable at a reduced rate of tax, the minimum tax would be calculated by applying the rates mentioned above as reduced in proportion to the tax exemption.


# Bangladesh
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is an indirect tax, which is a transaction-based taxation regime enacted in 2019 under the VAT and Supplementary Duty Act, 2012 (the VAT Act) replacing the older VAT Act, 1991. The VAT regime in Bangladesh is governed by the Board under the Ministry of Finance.
The standard VAT rate in Bangladesh is 15% for the majority of goods and services. However, some specific goods and services have reduced VAT rates at 5%, 7.5%, and 10%.
Specified goods mentioned in the Second Schedule of the VAT Act manufactured in Bangladesh and specified services are subject to Supplementary Duty (SD), ranging from 5% to 65.5%. While VAT is payable at each stage of supply, SD is payable only at the first stage of supply.
Goods and services notified under the First Schedule of the VAT Act are exempted from the payment of VAT. Moreover, goods and services notified by the government are also exempted from the payment of VAT at different stages of supply. 
While VAT and SD are payable on the value of supply in respect of most goods, both of these are payable on the maximum retail price (MRP) in respect of specified products, such as tobacco and goods containing alcohol. Such VAT and SD are payable only by the manufacturer at the first stage of supply.
### Registration
VAT registration is to be obtained once turnover exceeds BDT 30 million. Mandatory VAT registration is to be obtained in respect of supply of specified goods and services irrespective of the turnover limit. Mandatory VAT registration is also to be obtained by a supplier engaged in the import or export of goods, supply against tender, as well as by the branch or liaison office of a foreign company. However, a supplier may apply and obtain registration _suo-motu_ even if the turnover does not exceed the threshold limit.
VAT registration is to be obtained online through the Board portal upon furnishing the requisite information and documents. No government fee is payable for obtaining VAT registration. Generally, such registration is granted within a period of one to two weeks.
### Turnover tax
Suppliers of goods and services with turnover ranging from BDT 5 million to BDT 30 million are liable to pay turnover tax at 4% on their turnover and are required to obtain registration in the form of an ‘Enlistment Certificate’.
### Import of goods and services
Import of goods is subject to payment of import duties, which includes 15% VAT, unless exempted through an official notification. This is payable by the importer on record at the time of import and collected by the Customs authority.
Import of services is subject to payment of VAT at 15% under the reverse-charge mechanism by the recipient or importer of service.
### Zero-rated supplies and export of goods and services
Export of goods and services is zero-rated; consequently, VAT is not payable.
The following supply of goods and services is also zero-rated:
  * Goods supplied outside Bangladesh that are meant for import and consumption within Bangladesh.
  * Goods supplied by a local supplier against ‘warranty provided by a non-resident supplier’ under an agreement with such non-resident supplier.
  * Goods and services supplied to foreign-going vessels or aircraft meant for repair and maintenance.
  * Services provided on goods physically located outside Bangladesh.
  * Services provided by a local supplier against ‘warranty provided by a non-resident supplier’ under an agreement with such non-resident supplier.
  * Insurance service provided in relation with international transportation of goods.


### Input tax credit (ITC)
ITC is eligible in respect of procurement of goods or services provided the output supply is made by the supplier at the standard rate of 15%. ITC is also eligible in respect of zero-rated supply of goods and services. The supplier engaged in the supply of exempted goods and services would not be eligible for ITC.
Suppliers engaged in taxable as well as exempted supply would be eligible to avail proportionate ITC in respect of inputs used for the supply of taxable supplies.
The following major restrictions and conditions are applicable to claim ITC:
  * Output supply cannot be made at a price lower than the cost price.
  * The inputs are to be used for the manufacture of taxable goods or provision of taxable services.
  * Payment to be made through banking channel for supply beyond BDT 100,000.
  * In respect of import of service on which 15% VAT is payable under reverse-charge, VAT liability on import of service to be disclosed as output VAT in the return.
  * Credit is to be claimed in the month of receipt or within the next four months.
  * The procurement must be recorded in the statutory purchase register.
  * The tax invoice in Form Mushak 6.3 must be received, and it must contain the name, address, and Business Identification Number (BIN) of both the buyer and seller.


The following procurement of goods and services is not eligible for ITC:
  * Supply or import related to passenger vehicle and maintenance thereof.
  * Supply or import of goods or services used for the purpose of entertainment.
  * Admission or membership fee of any club or association.
  * Supply of transportation service exceeding 80% of such cost.
  * Labour, land, buildings, office equipment, furniture and fixture, office supply, stationery, refrigerators, freezers, air conditioners, generators, and their maintenance.
  * Interior design, architecture, planning, and design.
  * Vehicle purchase, rent, or lease.
  * Goods or services used for the travel, entertainment, development, and welfare of employees.
  * Rent of places and establishments.


### VAT deduction at source (VDS)
A VAT withholding entity is required to withhold VAT at the time of making payment to vendors. The following entities are considered as VAT withholding entities:
  * Government entities.
  * Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) approved by the NGO Affairs Bureau or the Directorate General of Social Welfare.
  * Banks, insurance companies, or similar financial institutions.
  * Secondary or post-secondary educational institutions.

However, VDS is not required in respect of procurement of the following services:
  * Payment of fuel, gas, Water and Sanitization Authority (WASA), electricity, telephone, and mobile phone bills.
  * Suppliers of furniture and advertisement services provided valid Mushak 6.3 duly attested by the concerned Revenue Officer is available.
  * Procurement of goods or services against receipt of invoice issued from electronic fiscal devices or sales data controller, provided the name and BIN of the buyer is mentioned in the invoice.


#### VDS rate in respect of procurement of goods
If any supplier (other than a manufacturer) supplies goods charging VAT at 7.5%, then such supply would be considered as a supply made by a ‘procurement provider’. Accordingly, VAT is required to be withheld from payment made to such procurement provider. In addition, goods supplied by a ‘trader’, charging VAT at 5% to the VAT withholding entity, would also be considered as supply made by a ‘procurement provider’; in such cases, even if the supplier charges VAT at 5%, VDS at 7.5% is to be withheld considering the supplier as a ‘procurement provider’.
VDS will not be required in respect of the following cases of procurement of goods:
  * Procurement of goods from a manufacturer, provided the tax invoice is issued in Mushak 6.3.
  * Procurement of goods where the supplier (other than the manufacturer) issues a tax invoice in Mushak 6.3 charging VAT at 15%, provided the supplier produces certificates evidencing regular submission of VAT return or tax honour cards.


#### VAT compliance in respect of VDS
  * Deducted VDS is required to be deposited in the government treasury within seven days from the end of the month.
  * Upon deposit of the VDS amount in the treasury, the withholding entity is required to issue a VDS certificate in Mushak 6.6 in favour of the supplier within three working days from the date of deposit.


### **VAT compliance**
#### Filing of VAT return
A VAT-registered person is required to file a monthly VAT return in Form Mushak 9.1 within the 15th day of the succeeding month. In case the 15th day is a holiday, the VAT return can be filed on the next working day. Presently, VAT returns can be filed both manually (physically at the VAT office) and online through a designated Board portal. Other than the monthly VAT return, no other VAT return is required to be filed by a registered person.
A person dealing with goods and services covered under the First Schedule of the VAT Act is neither required to obtain VAT registration nor required to follow any VAT compliances. However, a person dealing with goods and services that are exempted under the notification must obtain VAT registration and adhere to all other VAT compliances.
#### Payment of output VAT
A VAT-registered person is required to deposit output VAT within the 15th day of the succeeding month. Evidence of such payment is to be submitted along with the VAT return.
#### Filing of declaration in respect of purchase or sales exceeding BDT 200,000 
A VAT-registered person is required to file a declaration in Mushak 6.10 containing details of purchases and sales exceeding BDT 200,000. Such declaration is to be filed on or before filing the monthly VAT return.
#### Filing of audited financial statements
A VAT-registered person is required to file audited financial statements before the VAT Commissionerate within six months from the end of the financial year. Such period may be extended for another six months by the Commissioner against the application filed by the VAT-registered person.
#### Filing of input output co-efficient
A VAT-registered manufacturer of goods is required to file an input output co-efficient statement in Mushak 4.3 before the supply of goods. This statement contains details of the cost of raw materials and overheads required for the manufacture of each unit of goods.
#### Statutory registers to be maintained
A VAT-registered person is required to maintain the following records in the statutory format prescribed by the law:
  * Purchase book (Mushak 6.1).
  * Sales book (Mushak 6.2).
  * Sales invoice (Mushak 6.3) (to be issued at the time of supply and to accompany during the transportation of goods).
  * Invoice for contractual manufacturing (Mushak 6.4).
  * Invoice for transfer of goods (Mushak 6.5).
  * Certificate for VDS (Mushak 6.6).
  * Credit note (Mushak 6.7).
  * Debit note (Mushak 6.8).


Such records are to be maintained at the registered premises and preserved for a period of five years from the end of the tax period (month).
#### Use of VAT software
Every registered or to be registered person whose sales turnover exceeds BDT 50 million in the previous financial year is mandatorily required to use Board-approved software. Otherwise, the software used by the registered person has to be approved by the Board for maintenance of statutory registers as well as preparation of the monthly VAT return.
Such software is required to be integrated with ERP or software maintained by the registered person for its own maintenance of books of accounts.
If any registered person fails to comply with the provisions, it will be penalised with a minimum of BDT 10,000 and maximum of BDT 100,000. 
#### VAT audit or assessment
The following VAT authorities operating under the Board are empowered to conduct VAT audit of a registered person:
  * Jurisdictional Customs, Excise, and VAT Commissionerate.
  * Central Intelligence Cell.
  * Directorate of Audit, Intelligence, and Investigation.


It may be noted that anyone of the aforesaid authorities is empowered to conduct the audit for a particular period. Therefore, the audit is not allowed to be conducted by more than one authority for the same period.
The audit could be initiated within five years from the end of the tax period (month) in respect of all VAT-registered persons except the person registered as a 100% export oriented unit (EOU) where the audit could be initiated within three years from the end of the tax period.
#### Penalty and interest
Interest is payable at 1% per month for delay in deposit of output VAT within the due date and at 2% every six months for delay in deposit of VDS within the due date. Such interest is payable for a maximum period of 24 months from the due date of payment.
Penalty is payable against any offence established by the authority. Various penalty amounts are stipulated in the VAT Act for specific offences.
#### Refund
Excess ITC reported in the VAT return is allowed to be carried forward to the next month’s VAT return. There is no time limit to carry forward such excess ITC. A registered person is eligible to claim refund of excess ITC reported in the VAT return after six months of such VAT return. However, a 100% EOU is eligible to claim refund of any excess ITC immediately without carrying it forward to the next return period.
Diplomatic missions and international organisations are eligible to obtain refund of VAT payable on local procurement of goods and services that are covered under the international convention applicable in Bangladesh.
### Sale of going concern
Sale of business as a going concern is not considered as a ‘supply’ in Bangladesh; consequently, VAT is not applicable on such sale of business as a going concern. Moreover, a business division that is capable of operating independently after sale is also considered as sale of a going concern on which VAT is not payable.
### VAT liability of non-resident service providers
A non-resident service provider supplying ‘electronic services’ to VAT-unregistered customers in Bangladesh is liable to obtain VAT registration by appointing a VAT agent and is liable to discharge VAT in Bangladesh. Such non-resident service providers are neither required to establish their presence nor required to open a bank account in Bangladesh.
Such non-resident service providers are required to deposit VAT and are also required to file monthly VAT returns in Mushak 9.1 within the 15th day of the subsequent month.
### VAT exemption on specified supplies and procurement of goods and services

## Import duties and tariffs
Import of goods is generally governed under the Customs Act, 2023 read with various rules and regulations. In respect of import of goods, the importer on record (IoR) is liable to discharge the applicable import duties on such goods. The actual duty rates depend on the Harmonised System (HS) code of imported goods in accordance with the First Schedule of the Customs Tariff Schedule and corresponding exemption notification (if any) issued by the Board.
The components of import duties in Bangladesh include the following:
  * Customs Duty (CD): Imposed under the First Schedule of the Customs Act, 2023.
  * SD: Imposed under the VAT Act.
  * VAT: Imposed under the VAT Act.
  * Advance Income Tax (AIT): Imposed under the Act.
  * AT: Imposed under the VAT Act.
  * Regulatory Duty (RD): Imposed under the Customs Act, 2023.


The afore-mentioned duties are collectively called Total Tax Incidence (TTI).
A TTI calculation template is depicted below:
Particulars | Rate | Basis |  Amount  
---|---|---|---  
Basic value | A | 100,000  
CD | 25% | B = A * 25% | 25,000  
RD | 5% | C = A * 5% | 5,000  
D = A+B+C | 130,000  
SD | 0% | E = D * 0% |  -   
F = D+E | 130,000  
VAT | 15% | G = F * 15% | 19,500  
H = F+G | 149,500  
AIT | 5% | I = A * 5% | 5,000  
AT | 5% | J= F * 5% | 6,500  
Total | B+C+E+G+I+J | 61,000  
### Importer of record (IoR) eligibility
To be an IoR in Bangladesh, the importer must be a resident entity and possess or comply with the following:
  * The importer must have a renewed Import Registration Certificate (IRC) issued by the Chief Controller of Import and Export. To obtain an industrial IRC, the IOR needs to obtain industrial undertaking registration from the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA).
  * The importer must have a 13-digit VAT registration certificate.
  * The importer must obtain a Letter of Credit (LC) from a designated bank in Bangladesh issued in favour of the exporter.
  * The invoice issued by the exporter shall be in the name of the IoR.


### Elements of duty eligible for credit or set off
  * CD, SD, and RD payable at the time of import will not be available as credit and become a cost to the importer.
  * VAT and AT payable at import stage are available as ITC or decreasing adjustment and can be adjusted against the output VAT payable.
  * AIT can be adjusted against the CIT payable for the financial period.


Therefore VAT, AT, and AIT will not become a cost in the hands of the importer.
### Valuation of imported goods
Customs Valuation (Valuation of Imported Goods) Rules 2000 (Valuation Rules), as notified vide SRO No. 57-AIN/2000/1821/Customs dated 23 February 2000, provide detailed guidelines for the valuation of imported goods.
According to the Valuation Rules, ‘transaction value’ is the basis for determining the assessable value of imported goods where the following costs are required to be considered for determining the transaction value:
  * Commission and brokerage other than buying commission.
  * Cost of packaging and packing material expenses.
  * Royalty and license fee.
  * Any indirect payment made by the importer in relation to the sale of imported goods.


Where the transaction value is not ascertainable, the following valuation process is to be followed chronologically:
  * Transaction value of identical goods.
  * Transaction value of similar goods.
  * Deductive value.
  * Computed value.
  * Other method.


In respect of import from ‘related’ entities, the transaction value is accepted in the following circumstances:
  * Where, from the circumstantial evidence, it is established that the price is not influenced by the relation of the two entities.
  * The importer is able to establish that, during the relevant period, the declared value (transaction value) of the imported goods is equivalent to the value of the following upon consideration of other costs and services: 
    * Price charged to an unrelated Bangladeshi customer that is equivalent to the price of identical or similar goods.
    * Deductive value of identical or similar goods.
    * Computed value of identical or similar goods.


Therefore, in respect of import from related entities, where the Customs authority does not agree to accept the transaction value, the other valuation methods mentioned above must be followed chronologically.
### Authorised Economic Operator (AEO)
Authorised Economic Operator (Recognition and Operation) Rules, 2024 have been introduced, vide SRO No.217-AIN/2024/67/Customs dated 4 June 2024, replacing AEO (Recognition) Rules, 2018.

## Property taxes
Property tax is levied by the governing authority of the jurisdiction in which the property is located. The rate of tax levied varies from city to city in Bangladesh and is generally related to the prevailing market prices for property in each locality.
## Transfer taxes
Transfer tax for the transfer of any land or building or apartment by the transferor engaged in the real estate or land development business varies depending on the location of the land, building, or apartment; size of the apartment; and purpose of the building or apartment, and will be payable for registering under the Registration Act, 1908.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is a tax charged on certain documents (known as ‘instruments’) as mentioned in Schedule 1 to the Stamp Act 1899. The stamp duty rates for various instruments are mentioned in the First Schedule of the Finance Act 2022.
## Environmental taxes
According to the VAT Act, 1% environment protection surcharge is payable by identified business entities contributing to the pollution of the environment (_see above_). The time and process of collection of the surcharge is governed under the prevailing VAT laws.
## Travel tax
The Travel Tax Act, 2003 imposes a tax on passengers for travel within Bangladesh or from Bangladesh by air, land, or sea. The tax is collected by the person or organisation responsible for issuing the ticket or boarding pass and deposited to the government treasury within the prescribed time.
The tax rate varies depending on the destination, mode of transport, and age.
## Capital gains taxes
Capital gains are defined as the profits and gains that arise from the transfer of ownership of capital assets. Transfer includes sale, exchange, or relinquishment or extinguishment of any title to the asset, but does not include the following, namely:
  * If the transfer of the capital asset is made by way of gift, under will, bequest, or an irrevocable trust.
  * If the assets of the company are distributed in any way to the shareholders on the winding up of the company.
  * At the time of dissolution of the firm or other private associations, or if any capital asset is distributed on the partition of an HUF.


Notional gains or profits, which are calculated based on the fair market value (FMV) method as per International Accounting Standards or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) without an actual transfer of the asset, are excluded from being treated as capital gains.
For corporate taxpayers, there is no concept of short-term capital asset or long-term capital asset or indexation of cost in Bangladesh.
The computation mechanism of capital gains is shown below in a tabular form:
Particulars | Amount | Amount  
---|---|---  
A. Full value of consideration for the shares transferred | XXX  
B. Open market value (FMV) of the shares transferred | XXX  
**C. Higher of A or B** | **xxx**  
D. Cost of acquisition of the shares | (XXX)  
E. Expenditure incurred solely for transfer of shares | (XXX)  
**Capital Gains [C-D-E]** | **XXX**  
In case the fair value of any asset is more than 15% or 25% of the declared value by the taxpayer, the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes (DCT) may determine the FMV or offer to purchase the asset.
Capital gains from the transfer of all assets of a partnership firm to a new company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1994 are exempt from tax if the transfer consideration is invested in the equity of the new company.
Capital gains are taxed at 15%.
Where the capital gains arise in favour of a non-resident person from the transfer of shares in a company, the person, as the case may be, the authority responsible for the transfer of shares, shall not effectuate the transfer unless the tax applicable on such capital gains has been paid.
## Social security contributions
Social security is not mandatory in Bangladesh.
Social security in Bangladesh is broadly governed by the Bangladesh Labor Act 2006, namely, in the form of employees’ provident fund and gratuity.
An establishment in the private sector is required to constitute a provident fund for the benefit of its workers if at least three-fourths of the total number of workers employed therein so demand to the employer by an application in writing. Employees (including foreign nationals) are liable to contribute towards the provident fund at the rate of 7%-8% of their salary. The employer is required to make a matching contribution and deposit both the employer’s and employee’s contributions in the provident fund of the employee every month.
Gratuity is payable to workers on the termination of employment in addition to any compensation or wages or allowance payable on termination of employment.
Additionally, certain companies are required to contribute to the Workers’ Profit Participation Fund (WPPF).
There are specific provisions for getting recognition for the provident fund and approval of gratuity funds under the Act.
## Provincial / local taxes other than income taxes
There are no provincial or local taxes in Bangladesh at present.
