## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
## Foreign tax relief
A deduction for the avoidance of double taxation is allowed for foreign-source income and capital gains taxed by Spanish PIT, calculated as the lesser of:
  * The actual foreign tax paid on the foreign-source income, by reason of a tax identical or analogous in its nature to Spanish PIT or NRIT.
  * The result of applying the average effective PIT rate to the foreign-source income taxed abroad.


Any foreign tax withheld (or paid) may be eligible for this deduction; however, if a DTT is applicable, its terms should be taken into account when determining the method to calculate the deduction and making the calculation.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
Over the past year, the following significant reforms have been made to Spanish law on direct taxation of individuals: 
## Royal Decree-Law 10/2024
Royal Decree-Law 10/2024, passed on 23 December 2024, establishing a temporary energy tax in 2025, was published in the Spanish Official Gazette on 24 December.
The Royal Decree-Law was not ratified by Parliament, and its repeal was agreed during its sitting of 22 January 2025. 
## Royal Decree-Law 9/2024
Royal Decree-Law 9/2024, adopting urgent measures in economic, tax, transport and social security matters and extending certain measures to address situations of social vulnerability, was approved on 23 December 2024 and published in the Spanish Official Gazette on 24 December.
The Royal Decree-Law was not ratified by Parliament and its repeal was agreed during its sitting of 22 January 2025,.
## Act 7/2024
Act 7/2024, of 20 December 2024, that amends some of the Personal Income Tax Act provisions, bringing in measures to mitigate the economic consequences of the DANA flood in the Autonomous Region of Valencia, and other measures to increase revenue collection, such as, an increase in the savings tax rate.
The most important measures contained in this legislation that affect individual taxation are:
  * The increase of the savings base maximum tax rate from 28% to 30%.
  * The tax exemption for Personal Income Tax purposes (and Gift taxes) with respect to certain gifts made by companies to their employees affected by the DANA flood and their families.
  * The establishment of a specific procedure to obtain a reduction in the amount to be included as employment income in the Personal Income Tax return when certain retirement or disability pensions are received by _mutualistass_ whose contributions could not be subject to a reduction or deduction in taxable income at the time they were made. 
  * A 30% reduction in tax on income from literary, artistic or scientific works and employment income obtained by artists under a special employment relation, when certain requirements are met.


## Organic Law 1/2025
Organic Law 1/2025, of 2 January, introduces measures to the Justice System for efficiency purposes. Since it establishes mandatory mediation (or an alternative method to resolve disputes) before the filing of a lawsuit, within civil, commercial and social processes, the Law adapts the tax exemption on compensation received as a result of civil liability for personal damages, regulated in the Personal Income Tax Law, which was applicable only when it was established by a judgement.
As a consequence of this measure, the law provides that it will also be applicable when the compensation is agreed through alternative dispute resolution methods and payment is made by the insurance company.
## Royal Decree-Law 4/2024
Royal Decree-Law 4/2024, which extends certain measures to address the economic and social consequences of the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and by which urgent tax, energy, and social measures are adopted, was passed on 26 June 2024 and published in the Spanish Official Gazette on 27 June 2024. The main tax measures included that affect individuals’ taxation are the following:
  * The tax incentives established in the Municipal Real Estate Tax and the Business Activity Tax for the Island of La Palma are extended during 2024.
  * The threshold to file personal income tax (PIT) returns for taxpayers who obtain employment income from more than one payer if the amounts obtained through the second and subsequent payers exceed 1,500 euros (EUR) is increased from EUR 15,000 to EUR 15,876 with effect from 1 January 2024.
  * The reduction applicable to employment income when it does not exceed EUR 19,747.50 and the taxpayer does not obtain other non-exempt income over EUR 6,500 is also increased.
  * The tax credit for the obtention of income in Ceuta and Melilla will also be applicable to PIT payers who are resident for tax purposes in the Island of La Palma in tax period 2024.


The corporate income tax (CIT) free depreciation incentive provided for investments in new vehicles and new charging infrastructures for electric vehicles used for business purposes that come into operation in the tax periods starting in 2024 will also be applicable to PIT payers that carry out the economic activities in which the vehicles and charging infrastructures are used. When such vehicles or charging infrastructures are transferred, the tax depreciation that exceeds that which would have been applicable had the free depreciation incentive not been applied will not reduce the acquisition value for the purposes of calculating the capital gain or loss arising from such transfer. This excess will be considered business income obtained in the tax period in which the assets are transferred.
## Royal Decree 142/2024
Royal Decree 142/2024, dated 6 February 2024, amends the Regulation of Personal Income Tax, approved by Royal Decree 439/2007, dated 30 March 2007, regarding withholdings and payments on account.
To prevent workers receiving the minimum interprofessional wage from being subject to withholdings or payments on account, paragraph 1 of Article 81 of the Personal Income Tax Regulation is amended, indicating the new amounts of employment income to which withholdings and payments on account are applied, based on the number of children and other dependants and the taxpayer's situation.
The Royal Decree raises the minimum amount to apply withholdings from EUR 15,000 to EUR 15,876, which will allow those who earn the minimum wage in 2024 to not have PIT withholdings applied to their payroll.
This modification aims to exempt the minimum interprofessional wage from withholdings; in addition, salaries close to the minimum interprofessional wage will also see a reduction in the applicable withholding.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
The Spanish system for direct taxation of individuals is mainly comprised of two personal income taxes: Spanish personal income tax (PIT), for individuals who are resident in Spain for tax purposes, and Spanish non-residents' income tax (NRIT), for individuals who are not resident in Spain for tax purposes who obtain income in Spain. Therefore, persons who obtain income in Spain are either liable to pay Spanish PIT or Spanish NRIT.
Residents in Spain are generally subject to PIT on their worldwide income, regardless of where it is generated, which is taxed, following statutory reductions, at progressive rates.
Non-residents are subject to NRIT only on their Spanish-source income.
There are two types of taxable income for Spanish PIT purposes: general taxable income and savings taxable income.
Savings taxable income is basically composed of the following:
  * Dividends and other income generated from holding interests in companies.
  * Interest and other income generated from transferring the taxpayer’s own capital to third parties. As an exception, when capital transferred to a related company exceeds three times the latter’s equity, the interest corresponding to the excess is taxed as general taxable income.
  * Income generated from capitalisation transactions and life and disability income insurance.
  * Capital gains generated from transfers of assets.


General taxable income includes:
  * All income that is not savings taxable income.
  * Capital gains not generated from transfers of assets (such as lottery prizes).
  * Income allocations, attributions, or imputations, as established by law.
  * Interest and other income generated from transferring the taxpayer’s own capital to a related company when the capital exceeds three times the latter’s equity and for the part corresponding to the excess.


Regarding NRIT, income not obtained through a permanent establishment (PE) is taxed on each individual total or partial accrual of income subject to tax. This means that losses cannot be offset against gains.
Taxable income for non-residents without a PE is generally the gross income stipulated in Spanish PIT law, and no reductions are applicable. As a special rule, in the case of provisions of services, technical assistance, installation and assembly work resulting from engineering contracts and, in general, economic activities or operations carried out in Spain without a PE, taxable income is the difference between gross income and the expenses generated by staff, or for the procurement of materials incorporated in the works and supplies, in accordance with the requirements established in the regulations implemented under Spanish NRIT law.
When calculating the net income of taxpayers without a PE that are resident in other EU member states, a distinction is made between individuals and companies. In each case, the tax deductible expenses are established in accordance with the PIT and CIT legislation, respectively. In both cases, the taxpayer will need to prove that taxable expenses are directly related to the income obtained in Spain and that they have a direct and indisputable economic link to the activity carried out in Spain.
### Exemption for work performed abroad
PIT is not levied on employment income obtained by persons who are tax resident in Spain for work effectively carried out outside Spain, up to the limit of EUR 60,100, if the following requirements are met:
  * The employee is resident in Spain for tax purposes.
  * The work is effectively carried out outside Spain.
  * The work is carried out for a company, entity, or PE that is not resident in Spain for tax purposes.
  * A tax which is identical or similar to Spanish PIT is levied in the country where the employee carries out the work.


This tax exemption is incompatible with the tax regime for non-taxable excess amounts, in accordance with which the amounts paid to employees of companies who are assigned abroad above the total compensation that they would have obtained had they stayed in Spain are not subject to Spanish PIT.
In this case, the taxpayer may choose to apply the tax regime for non-taxable excess amounts instead of this tax exemption.
## Personal income tax (PIT) rates
Savings taxable income is taxed at the following rates:
  * 19% for the first EUR 6,000 of taxable income.
  * 21% for the following EUR 6,000 to EUR 50,000 of taxable income.
  * 23% for the following EUR 50,000 to EUR 200,000 of taxable income.
  * 27% for the following EUR 200,000 to EUR 300,000 of taxable income.
  * From 2025, 30% (instead of 28%) for any amounts over EUR 300,000.


For general taxable income, progressive tax rates are applied (which are the sum of the applicable rate approved by the state and the applicable rate approved by each autonomous community of Spain in their progressive tax rate scales). Tax liability may therefore differ from one autonomous community to another.
The following tables show the tax scale for withholdings approved by the state. This scale can be used as a guideline of the progressive tax rates applicable for general taxable income. For the reasons stated above, the scale applicable in the corresponding autonomous community of Spain should always be consulted to calculate the total progressive tax rate.
Tax scale for withholdings applicable in 2024:
Taxable income (up to EUR) |  Tax liability (EUR) |  Excess of income base(up to EUR) |  Tax rate (%)  
---|---|---|---  
0 |  0 |  12,450 |  19  
12,450 |  2,365.50 |  7,750 |  24  
20,200 |  4,225.50 |  15,000 |  30  
35,200 |  8,725.50 |  24,800 |  37  
60,000 |  17,901.50 |  240,000 |  45  
300,000 |  125,901.50 |  Remainder |  47  
### Non-resident income tax (NRIT) rates
For non-residents, income obtained without a PE is taxed at the following rates:
  * General rate: 24%. For residents in other EU member states or European Economic Area (EEA) countries with which there is an effective exchange of tax information, the rate is 19%.
  * Capital gains generated from transfers of assets: 19%.
  * Interest: 19%. Interest is tax exempt for EU residents. Double taxation treaties (DTTs) normally establish lower rates.
  * Dividends: 19% (DTTs normally establish lower rates).
  * Royalties: 24% (DTTs normally establish lower rates).
  * Pensions are taxed at progressive rates (between 8% and 40%).

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year is generally the calendar year.
## Tax returns and payment of tax
As a general rule, Spanish tax returns should be filed and paid between 11 April and 30 June following the end of the tax year. The period for declaring and paying PIT is established annually by a ministerial order. It usually ends on 30 June.
In general, a PIT return should be filed by a person resident in Spain whose gross employment income exceeds EUR 22,000 (for joint and separate returns) during the calendar year or EUR 15,876 for taxpayers who obtain employment income from more than one payer if the amounts obtained by the second and subsequent payers exceed EUR 1,500. Persons resident in Spain are also required to file a tax return if they obtain other personal incomes in excess of certain amounts specified by law.
Individual taxation is the basic way of being taxed for PIT, but the members of family units may opt to be taxed jointly in accordance with the following rules:
  * Family units composed of non-legally separated spouses and, if any: 
    * Minor children, unless, with the consent of their parents, they live independently.
    * Disabled adult children judicially subject to extended or rehabilitated custody.
  * In cases of legal separation, or when there is no marriage bond, family units formed by the father or mother and all children living with either of them who meet the above requirements.
  * A person may not form part of two family units at the same time.
  * Members of the family unit are determined in accordance with the family situation at 31 December each year.


Non-residents are taxed on an individual basis and cannot opt to be taxed jointly. Income not obtained through a PE is taxed on each individual total or partial accrual of taxable income.
## Withholdings on personal income
Withholdings are levied on employment income at the progressive tax rates established (_see the_ _section for further information_).
For income generated from professional activities, the general rate of withholding is 15%, with certain exceptions.
The same withholding rates will apply to earned income generated from teaching courses, conferences, symposia, seminars, and the like, or from the production of literary, artistic, or scientific work, provided that the right to trade on such works is transferred.
In both cases, the withholding rates will be reduced by 50% if income qualifies for the tax credit for income obtained in Ceuta and Melilla.
Withholdings at the rate of 19% are also levied on the following:
  * Income from capital.
  * Capital gains generated from transfers or payments of shares of joint investment institutions.
  * Capital gains generated from forest use or exploitation by persons residing in public woodland which are established in the regulations implemented under Spanish PIT law.
  * Prizes awarded in games, competitions, lotteries, or promotional draws, whether or not they are linked to the offer, promotion, or sale of certain goods, products, or services not subject to special tax on gaming income.
  * Income generated from leases or sub-leases of urban real property.
  * Income generated from intellectual or industrial property, provision of technical assistance, leases or sub-leases of movable property, businesses, or quarries.


Withholdings are levied on employment income obtained by directors and members of boards of directors or boards or committees representing such directors, and other representative bodies at the rate of 35% (19% for companies whose turnover in the previous tax year was less than EUR 100,000).
The withholding rate on amounts allocated to transfers of image rights by PIT payers who have an employment relationship with a person or company/entity is 19% if the taxpayer has transferred to such person or company/entity the right to trade on or the consent or authorisation to use one's image in acts with persons or companies/entities resident or not resident in Spain. The withholdings for other transfers of image rights is 24%.
Prizes on lotteries and games are subject to a 20% withholding or advance payment of the special tax on gaming income.
Withholdings are credited against the total tax due.
## EUR 1,000 limit on cash payments
Payments in cash over EUR 1,000 are not allowed for transactions in which at least one of the parties is a person carrying on a business or professional activity, and fines of up to 25% of the amount are payable by both the payer and the recipient of these cash payments.
## Obligation to disclose assets located overseas
Law 7/2012 introduced the obligation to disclose assets such as accounts, shares, or real estate located overseas. Severe fines were envisaged (a minimum of EUR 10,000) for breaching this obligation.
In addition, assets regarding which the information disclosure obligation is not met within the established period are treated as unjustified capital gains for PIT payers and allocated to the earliest tax period of those which are not statute barred. Breaches of the obligation to declare this income used to be very serious infringement and fines of 150% of the gross tax liability were imposed.
However, in January 2022, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) concluded, after some years of uncertainty in relation to the above penalty system, that such a system was against EU law.
Consequently, the Spanish tax system was updated, reviewing and considerably reducing the previous established penalty system.
Order HFP/886/2023, of 26 July 2023, that came into effect on 27 July 2023, brought in the obligation to report cryptocurrencies located overseas, through tax form 721. The deadline for reporting cryptocurrencies located overseas owned by the taxpayer in tax year 2024 is 1 January 2025 to 31 March 2025.
## Tax inspections
The Spanish tax authorities have a department for tax inspections that is responsible for, amongst other things, verifying that tax obligations are correctly complied with and, if necessary, for adjusting the taxpayer's tax situation by issuing one or more tax assessments.
As part of its responsibilities, the tax inspection department may investigate taxpayers to see if any facts regarding tax obligations have been ignored by the tax authorities or check the accuracy of filed tax returns.
The tax returns examined by the tax inspection department are chosen on the basis of different criteria (randomly, due to differences of income or capital gains detected by comparing the returns of different taxpayers, significant differences of wealth declared in two consecutive years, or external signs of wealth such as acquisitions of residential properties, luxury cars, financial assets, or leisure vessels for significant sums of money).
If taxpayers disagree with a tax assessment issued by the tax inspection department as a result of a tax inspection, they may file an appeal firstly with the economic-administrative tribunal, and if the appeal is not upheld by the tribunal, with the ordinary courts.
If taxpayers have paid incorrect amounts of tax, they may claim a refund of the tax paid in excess from the tax authorities within the statute of limitation period (four years) by means of a special proceeding that commences with the filing of a request with the tax authorities.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations for taxes is four years in Spain commencing from the day following the termination of the voluntary tax filing period.
This four-year period may re-start for a taxpayer if the tax authorities carry out any actions or proceedings, with the formal acknowledgement of the taxpayer, to acknowledge, adjust, review, inspect, guarantee or collect all, or any part of a tax obligation, or due to actions by the taxpayer such as the filing of a new or late tax return that alters or rectifies a previous tax return or the filing of an appeal or claim regarding the tax.
## Topics of focus for the tax authorities
Every year the Spanish tax authorities issue general guidelines on the authorities’ annual tax and customs control plan. These guidelines identify areas where the tax authorities intend to adopt a greater role of verification, inspection, and monitoring during a certain tax year.


# Spain
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
## Employment expenses
The following, amongst others, can be deducted from gross employment income for PIT purposes:
  * Social security contributions (employee contributions).
  * Mandatory contributions to mutual benefit societies, providing for widows/widowers and orphans upon the death of the participant.
  * Dues to unions and compulsory contributions to professional colleges, up to a maximum of EUR 500.
  * Legal defence expenses, up to a maximum of EUR 300.
  * 'Other expenses' deduction of EUR 2,000. This deduction is higher for workers who accept a work post in another town/city or for disabled workers.


Employment income (with certain exceptions) with a vesting period of more than two years that is not obtained on a regular or recurring basis and employment income that is obtained on a notably irregular basis in accordance with the regulations implemented under Spanish PIT Law is reduced by 30% if, in both cases, the income is recorded in a single tax period (except in the case of income resulting from the termination of an ordinary or special employer/employee relationship). The amount regarding which the 30% reduction can be applied should not exceed EUR 300,000.
The reduction will not apply when it has been applied on income generated over more than two years obtained in the previous five tax periods, unless the income is generated from the termination of an ordinary or special employer/employee relationship.
When employment income is between EUR 700,000.01 and EUR 1 million and is generated from the termination of an employment or commercial relationship, the 30% reduction is applied on the amount resulting from the following calculation: EUR 300,000 - (severance pay - EUR 700,000). When the income generated is EUR 1 million or more, the income on which the 30% reduction can be applied is zero.
As for 2025, a new 30% reduction has been approved on the business income from economic activities derived from the creation of literary, artistic or scientific works, and on the income from work obtained by artists and their technicians or assistants, which exceeds 130% of the average amount of income obtained in the three previous tax periods. The maximum base on which the reduction can apply is EUR 150.000.
Taxpayers whose net employment income is under EUR 19,747.50 and who have no other non-exempt income over EUR 6,500 can reduce their net employment income by the following amounts:
  * EUR 7,302 for taxpayers whose net employment income is EUR 14,852 or less.
  * EUR 7,302.00 - (1.75 x [employment income - EUR 14,852.50]) for taxpayers whose net employment income is between EUR 14,852.50 and EUR 17,673.52.
  * EUR 2,364.34 - (1.14 x [employment income - EUR 17,673.52]) for taxpayers whose net employment income is between EUR 17,673.52 and EUR 19,747.50.


This general reduction for employment income and its application is limited to income under EUR 19,747.50. Higher reductions are established for employees over 65 years of age, unemployed persons who accept a job that requires a change of their place of permanent residence, or persons with a recognised disability.
The amount resulting from the application of the aforementioned reductions may not be negative.
Effective as of 17 July 2023, the tax exemption for travel expenses to be compensated by the company to its employees has been increased from EUR 0.19 to EUR 0.26 per kilometre covered if the reality of the displacement is justified. The amount of toll charges and parking expenses are also exempt from taxation.
## Business expenses
Net business income is calculated by deducting from gross business income the expenses incurred to obtain it.
PIT payers who determine their business income using the direct evaluation method apply CIT regulations with some exceptions. Therefore, to calculate net business income, expenses are those which are not non-deductible for CIT purposes.
Net business income is calculated in accordance with Spanish CIT laws with the application of some specific regulations.
Tax amortisation of goodwill is deductible up to an annual rate of 5%, provided that certain requirements are met.
Tax amortisation of other intangible assets whose useful life may not be reliably estimated is deductible up to an annual rate of 5% if certain requirements are met.
Supply expenses (water, electricity, gas, telephone, Internet) are partially tax deductible when taxpayers partially use their habitual residence to carry on a business activity. The deduction is 30% of the expenses in proportion to the square metres of the home used for the activity with respect to its total area, unless the taxpayer can prove any other proportion.
Maintenance expenses incurred to carry on the business activity are also tax deductible, when the activity is carried on in catering and hospitality establishments and the expenses are paid using any electronic means of payment. The limits of the deductible amount are the same as those for employed persons.
Health insurance premiums paid by the self-employed person are deductible in the part corresponding to their own coverage and that of their spouse and children under 25 who live with them. The maximum deduction limit will be EUR 500 for each of the persons indicated above or EUR 1,500 for each of them with a disability.
Gross business income generated over a period of more than two years or that is evidently irregular income in accordance with the regulations implemented under Spanish PIT law, when recorded in a single tax period, qualifies for a 30% reduction with certain limits and requirements. The amount on which the 30% reduction can be applied should not exceed EUR 300,000.
Net business income is reduced by EUR 2,000.
In addition, net business income is reduced by:
  * EUR 6,498.00 for taxpayers whose business income is EUR 14,047.50 or less.
  * EUR 6,498.50 - (1.14 x [business income - EUR 14,047.50]) for taxpayers whose business income is between EUR 14,047.50 and EUR 19,747.50.


Higher reductions are provided for persons with a recognised disability.
These reductions can only be applied if the following requirements are met:
  * Net business income is determined using the direct evaluation method.
  * All supplies of goods and services are made to one non-related person or company or the taxpayer is considered to be a self-employed person who economically depends on a client which is not a related company.
  * The total taxable expenses corresponding to all of the taxpayer’s business activities do not exceed 30% of the taxpayer’s gross income.
  * All formal information, control, and verification obligations established in Spanish PIT law are complied with by the taxpayer during the tax period.
  * The taxpayer does not generate employment income during the tax period. Nevertheless, this requirement will still be met if a taxpayer receives unemployment or any of the income referred to in article 17.2.a) of the PIT Law within the fiscal year if such income is not higher than EUR 6,500.
  * At least 70% of the taxpayer’s turnover for the tax period is subject to withholdings or advance payments of tax.
  * The taxpayer does not carry on any business activities through a flow-through company during the tax period.


A reduction of up to EUR 1,620 is established for taxpayers who do not meet these requirements and whose non-exempt income, including business income, in the tax period is under EUR 8,000. When such business income amounts to between EUR 8,000 and EUR 12,000, a reduction of EUR 1,620 - (0.405 x [business income - EUR 8,000]) will be applicable instead.
## Deductions from real estate income
The following expenses are deducted from gross income generated from real estate owned by PIT payers (generally lease income):
  * All expenses needed to obtain the income. These include, amongst others, the following:
    * Interest on capital borrowed to acquire or improve the property and repair and maintenance expenses incurred for the property. Expenses may not exceed the gross income from the property. Any excess amount is deductible in the following four tax periods.
    * Certain taxes, such as local property tax.
    * Bad debt provisions that meet the requirements laid down in Spanish PIT Law.
    * Amounts payable to third parties for the provision of personal services.


  * Depreciation of the property, providing that it is in line with its effective deterioration and complies with the requirements established in Spanish PIT law. Depreciation complies with the requirement of effective deterioration when it does not exceed the amount resulting from applying 3% to the higher of the following values: acquisition cost or rateable value, without including the land value.


Positive income declared for leases of real estate used for residential purposes is reduced by 60%.
Real estate income generated over a period of more than two years or that is evidently irregular in accordance with the regulations implemented under Spanish PIT law and recorded in a single tax period qualifies for a 30% reduction. The amount on which the 30% reduction can be applied should not exceed EUR 300,000.
## Deductions from moveable capital income
In determining net income from dividends, interest, or other types of income from capital established by Spanish PIT law as income from capital different to real estate, only the following expenses may be deducted from the gross income:
  * Expenses incurred for administering and depositing negotiable securities. Amounts that are paid as consideration for discretionary and individual management of investment portfolios, where the investments are made on behalf of the owners in accordance with their instructions, are not deductible.
  * For income generated from the provision of technical assistance and the lease or sub-lease of moveable properties, businesses, or mines, the expenses needed to obtain such income and, if the case, the deterioration of the items or rights from which the income is generated are deducted from gross income.
  * Certain moveable capital income generated over a period of more than two years or that is evidently irregular in accordance with the regulations implemented under Spanish PIT law and recorded in a single tax period qualifies for a 30% reduction. The amount on which the 30% reduction can be applied should not exceed EUR 300,000. This reduction may be applied for the following types of moveable capital income:
    * Income generated from intellectual property when the taxpayer is not the author, and from industrial property not used to carry out the taxpayer's business activities.
    * Income generated from providing technical assistance unless the provision of technical assistance is a business activity of the taxpayer.
    * Income generated from the lease of property, business, or mines that is not a business activity of the taxpayer.
    * Income generated from the transfer of a right to trade on image rights, or the consent or authorisation to use them, unless such transfer is carried out as part of the taxpayer's business activities.


## Reductions to net taxable income
### Alimony and child support payments
Alimony paid to an ex-spouse in accordance with a court decision is deductible from the taxpayer's PIT taxable income. Child support is not deductible from taxable income, although the progressive tax scales can be applied separately for this amount if the taxpayer is not entitled to the allowance for relatives in a descending line.
### Contributions to pension plans
A taxpayer's annual contributions to qualifying pension plans is deductible up to a maximum of EUR 1,500 per year. The limit will be increased by EUR 8,500 when it comes from business contributions or employee contributions to the same social security instrument for an amount equal to or less than the amounts resulting from the following table, depending on the amount of the business contribution:
Annual contribution amount |  Maximum employee contribution  
---|---  
EUR 500 or less |  The result of multiplying the business contribution by 2.5  
Between EUR 500.01 and EUR 1,500 |  EUR 1,250, plus the result of multiplying by 0.25 the difference between the business contribution and EUR 500  
More than EUR 1,500 |  The result of multiplying the business contribution by 1  
However, in any case, the multiplier 1 will be applied when the employee obtains in the fiscal year employment income of more than EUR 60,000 from the company making the contribution. 
The amount may not exceed 30% of total individual net income from employment and business activities.
In addition, taxpayers whose spouses do not obtain income from employment or business activities over EUR 8,000 can deduct the contributions made to qualifying pension plans from their own taxable income on behalf of the spouse, up to a maximum of EUR 1,000 per year.
## Personal and family allowances
In 2025, the following allowances apply:
  * A personal allowance, which is generally EUR 5,550. The allowance is EUR 6,700 when the taxpayer is over 65 years of age and EUR 8,100 when the taxpayer is over 75 years of age. When the taxpayer is disabled, allowance is increased by EUR 3,000 or, if the disabled taxpayer's level of disability is 65% or more, by EUR 9,000. This minimum is increased by EUR 3,000 of care assistance expenses when the taxpayer can justify that one needs the care or has reduced mobility or a disability of at least 65%.
  * A minimum family allowance of:
    * EUR 1,150 for each relative in an ascending line over 65 years of age who forms part of the taxpayer's household and is dependent on the taxpayer and whose annual income does not exceed EUR 8,000. The allowance is EUR 2,550 when the relative is over 75 years of age.
    * EUR 2,400 for the first relative in a descending line who forms part of the taxpayer's household and whose annual income is not over EUR 8,000. For the second, third, and subsequent relatives in a descending line, the allowance is EUR 2,700, EUR 4,000, and EUR 4,500, respectively. The allowance is increased by EUR 2,800 when the relative is under three years of age.
  * A minimum family allowance for disability of relatives in an ascending and descending line of EUR 3,000 for each relative or EUR 9,000 when the level of disability is 65% or more. This minimum is increased by EUR 3,000 of care assistance expenses for each relative that can justify that one needs the care or has reduced mobility or a disability of at least 65%.


When two or more taxpayers are entitled to apply these allowances, they are equally divided between the taxpayers. However, when taxpayers have different degrees of kinship, the allowance is applied by the taxpayer with the nearest kinship unless their annual income, excluding exempt income, does not exceed EUR 8,000, in which case the allowance is applied by the taxpayer with the next degree of kinship.
The allowance cannot be applied when the income of the relatives in ascending or descending order with respect to which this allowance may be applied is over EUR 1,800 and these persons file their own tax returns.
The minimum thresholds stated above will apply to the personal and family circumstances existing on the date on which the tax becomes due and payable (generally, 31 December).
In the cases of legal marital separation, the allowance for relatives in a descending line is applied by the parent who is assigned the guardianship and custody of the child/children at the date of accrual (generally, 31 December) as this is the person who the child/children live with.
When guardianship and custody is shared, the allowance is pro-rated between the parents, regardless of which parent the child/children lives with at the date of accrual.
## Losses
Capital losses arising from transfers of assets are included in savings income and can only be offset against capital gains included in savings income of the tax period. If the result of offsetting capital losses is negative, they may only be offset against certain positive moveable capital income, with the limit of 25% of such positive moveable capital income. If the result of this last offsetting is still negative, they may only be offset against capital gains (or 25% of positive moveable capital income) included in savings income generated in the following four years.
Capital losses that do not arise from transfers of assets are included in general income and can only be offset against capital gains included in general income of the tax period. If the balance is negative, the amount should be offset against the positive balance resulting from compensating the tax period’s income and allocated income included in the general tax base up to the limit of 25% of that positive balance. If, following this compensation, there is still a negative balance, the amount of the balance should be offset over the following four years.

## Trusts
The legal concept of trusts does not exist in Spanish law and so it is not recognised by the Spanish tax authorities or the Spanish courts. Therefore, the tax treatment of trusts may vary on a case-by-case basis and the Spanish tax authorities usually consider that the economic reality of the trust should be analysed rather than its legal nature. A trust should always take the form of a legal entity recognised by Spanish law.
As Spanish tax law does not specifically regulate the taxation of trusts, the tax treatment of the legal relationships involved in trusts should be determined abstractly based on the general guiding principles of the Spanish tax system. This task is further complicated by the fact that scientific and administrative doctrine on the subject is scarce and not based on any clearly defined criteria. In practice, this means that the economic relationships between the members of a trust should be regarded as held directly between them and the tax implications of this should be analysed accordingly.
## Treatment of flow-through business entities
Under Spanish law, there are several types of partnerships, and it is important to distinguish between business entities, which are CIT payers, and partnerships, which are flow-through business entities. As a general rule, business entities with separate legal personality are treated as CIT payers and business entities without separate legal personality are treated as flow-through business entities. Spanish law establishes a specific tax regime called the ‘income allocation regime’ for income generated by business entities without separate legal personality. As from 2003, under Spanish law, business entities set up outside Spain that have the same or a similar legal nature to that of a Spanish business entity taxed under the income allocation regime also fall within the scope of this regime.
On 6 February 2020, the Spanish General Directorate for Taxes issued a binding resolution, setting out the following basic requirements that a foreign entity must meet for it to be considered to have the same or a similar legal nature to that of a Spanish business entity taxed under the income allocation regime:
  * The entity must not be subject to PIT in the country of its establishment.
  * The income generated by the entity should be fiscally allocated to its partners or participants in accordance with the legislation of its country of establishment. The partners or participants should be the ones subject to taxation for this income in their PIT. This allocation should occur simply because the income is obtained by the entity, regardless of whether the income has been distributed effectively to the partners or participants.
  * The income obtained by the entity through the allocation of income and allocated to the partners or participants should retain, in accordance with the legislation of its country of establishment, the nature of the activity or source from which it arises for each partner or participant.


Mainly, there are two types of situations where non-residents may be liable to tax in Spain in connection with partnerships: (i) non-residents who are members of a Spanish partnership; or (ii) foreign business entities which, on complying with certain conditions, may be considered to be a partnership for Spanish tax purposes and either the foreign partnership or their members may be subject to tax in Spain if they have any kind of interests in Spain.
Under Spanish NRIT law, the legal features of a foreign partnership are the main factor to determine whether it is a flow-through business entity for Spanish tax purposes. Nevertheless, rulings of the Spanish tax authorities are taking the simpler view that a foreign partnership is a flow-through business entity when it is not liable to tax in its country of residence.
In addition, as previously stated, Spanish NRIT law distinguishes between non-resident flow-through business entities with a presence in Spain and non-resident flow-through business entities without that presence.
If the Spanish/non-resident entity carries on a business activity in Spain, its non-resident members operate in Spain through a PE. That means that the income generated by the entity is directly taxable at the level of the entity. The mechanisms used to tax these entities are similar to those used to tax non-resident taxpayers with a PE in Spain, although other regulations also apply.
If the Spanish/non-resident entity does not carry on a business activity, its non-resident members are taxed under Spanish NRIT law and therefore there is no taxation at the level of the entity. Instead, in accordance with Spanish tax law the income is allocated to the entity’s members as if the entity had not existed. Whilst Spanish resident members would include their share of the income in their return for direct taxes (PIT or CIT), non-resident members would be taxed by NRIT.
## Work and residence permits for Spain
International assignees from EU countries do not need to obtain a work and residence permit. If the assignee plans to stay in Spain for more than three months, they should register in the Central Registry of Foreigners (_Registro Central de Extranjeros_) to obtain a foreigner’s ID number in Spain.
Please note that after Brexit, United Kingdom (UK) citizens are no longer considered EU citizens. Only those UK citizens registered as living in Spain before 2021 are beneficiaries of the withdrawal agreement and can maintain their status.On the other hand, international assignees from outside the European Union wishing to engage in technical or professional profit-making activities in Spain, either as employees or as self-employed persons, should obtain a work and residence permit before they commence their employment activity. As a general rule, if the assignee is an employee and, due to the characteristics of one's job, the assignee must comply with the provisions of the National Employment Situation (_Situación Nacional de Empleo_), applications for work and residence permits in Spain are made in three stages:
  * The employer publishes the job offer on the national employment system and needs to prove that there is not a suitable candidate for the position in the Spanish labour market. This process takes about a month.


  * The employer applies for the work and residence permit in Spain. If all the required documents are filed with the application, the immigration office will issue a letter approving the work and residence permit, which can take between three and six months.


  * The international assignee will have to apply for an entry visa at the Spanish consulate in their home country within a period of 30 days after receiving the letter from the Spanish immigration office, which can take up to one month. Once in Spain, the assignee needs to request their residence card with the first 30 days.


It should be noted that there are situations where the first step related to the National Employment Situation is not necessary. These situations are as follows:
  * When the occupation is included in the catalogue of hard-to-cover occupations published quarterly by the Public Employment Service.


  * In occupations not classified as hard-to-cover when the employer demonstrates to the Immigration Office the difficulty of filling the vacant positions with workers already in the internal labour market. For this purpose, the Immigration Office will consider the report presented by the competent Public Employment Services on the insufficiency of job applicants to fill the position and the job offer presented, as well as the urgency of the hiring certified by the company, if applicable.


  * When the hiring is directed to nationals of states with which Spain has signed International Agreements (Chile and Peru).


  * When it is a case provided for in Article 40 of Organic Law 4/2000.


Work and residence permits are issued for a maximum period of one year and an application can be made for their renewal within the two months prior to their expiry date and, in some cases, within the three months after their expiry, notwithstanding the penalties that may arise from the application in the three months following.
## Work and residence permits in Spain for highly qualified workers, entrepreneurs, and investors
With effect from 29 September 2013, immigration procedures for certain individuals have been streamlined for reasons of economic interest in the following cases:
  * Capital investors. The investment may be either: (i) EUR 500,000 in real estate, (ii) EUR 2 million in Spanish public debt, (iii) EUR 1 million in Spanish companies’ shares or bank deposits in Spanish entities, (iv) EUR 1 million in investment funds, closed-end investment funds, or venture capital funds established in Spain, or (v) a business project to be developed in Spain that is considered and accredited as being of general interest or making a significant contribution to scientific and/or technological innovation. 


  * Intra-corporate transferees/Persons on international assignments (*).


  * Entrepreneurs.


  * Highly qualified professionals (**).


  * Researchers.


  * International remote workers (***)


Under this law, as a general rule, work and residence permits may be issued for a maximum period of three years and can be renewed for an additional two years.(*) In May 2014, a Directive on Intra-Corporate Transferees was adopted by the European Union, which introduced a common set of rules to make it easier for companies outside the European Union to send key staff to their branches in the European Union.
Under the new Directive, once foreign nationals are granted an intra-corporate transfer (ICT) permit to work in an EU member state, they can be transferred within the European Union almost freely, provided that they work for the same company or group of companies. Under the Directive, they will have the same protection as EU-posted workers and are required to receive the same remuneration as local hires.
The main benefits for intra-corporate transferees and highly qualified professionals are that the position does not need to be published on the national employment system and that the issuance of the letter approving the work and residence permit will take between one and three months.
(**) Law 11/2023, of 8 May 2023, transposing European Union Directives on the accessibility of certain products and services, migration of highly qualified persons, tax matters, and digitisation of notarial and registry actions, and amending Law 12/2011, of 27 May 2011, on civil liability for nuclear damage or damage caused by radioactive materials, modifies certain articles of Law 14/2013, of 27 September 2013, on support for entrepreneurs and their internationalisation in relation to highly qualified professionals, establishing that to determine that the worker is highly qualified, it will be considered that the job and functions can be assimilated to Groups 1 and 2 of the National Classification of Occupations 2011 (CNO-11) in Spain. This will be related to the job profile, employment contract, professional classification, and applicable Collective Agreement. Thus, professionals in jobs not included in the said catalogue may be eligible for authorisation once the other information in the file has been evaluated, such as remuneration, productive sector, or qualifications, among other aspects.
Distinguishing between two types of authorisations: (i) residence authorisation for highly qualified professionals holding an EU Blue Card and (ii) national residence authorisation for highly qualified professionals. 
The first applies to cases where foreign workers are going to perform a job that requires qualifications derived from higher education training of a minimum duration of three years, equivalent at least to Level 2 of the Spanish Qualifications Framework for Higher Education, or who have a minimum of five years of knowledge, skills, and competencies backed by professional experience that can be considered equivalent to this qualification and relevant to the profession or sector specified in the employment contract or firm job offer. 
The second option is for cases where foreign workers are going to perform a job or professional activity that requires a qualification equivalent at least to Level 1 of the Spanish Qualifications Framework for Higher Education, or knowledge, skills, and competencies backed by at least three years of professional experience that can be considered equivalent to this qualification.
(***) In the case of international remote workers, in the event of exercising a professional activity, the holder of the authorisation for international remote work will be allowed to work for a company located in Spain, provided that the percentage of such work does not exceed 20% of their total professional activity. The visa for international remote work will have a maximum validity of one year unless the work period is shorter, in which case the visa will have the same validity as this period, and the remote worker must request (if they wish to remain in Spain) its transformation into a residence permit for international remote workers, which has a maximum validity of three years.
## Exchange control regulations
Under the exchange control regulations established in Spain, a Spanish non-resident can open a bank account in euros or any other currency in Spain. To open the account, and in accordance with anti-money laundering regulations, the non-resident should provide at least one's passport and, if possible, a document issued by the Spanish Home Office certifying Spanish non-resident status. A Foreigners’ Identity Number (NIE) might also be requested.
Spanish residents opening bank accounts abroad or transferring funds into or out of a non-resident’s bank account are required to make some notifications to the Statistics Department of the Bank of Spain, as indicated below.
A Spanish resident who carries out bank transactions with non-residents or has financial assets and liabilities abroad amounting to more than EUR 1 million should notify the Statistics Department of the Bank of Spain of the details of the bank account where the transaction is made and its holder, amongst other matters. This notification is not required for transactions under EUR 1 million unless the Bank of Spain asks for this information, which should be made available within two months of the date of the request.
These notifications are regulated in the Bank of Spain Circular 4/2012, which establishes the notifications that should be made at different time intervals (monthly, quarterly, or annually) when the total amount of the bank transactions carried out or financial assets and liabilities existing abroad in a year is over EUR 1 million and depending on their total amount in the year. In addition, the Spanish General Tax Act 58/2003, of 17 December 2003, establishes an obligation to disclose accounts located overseas for resident individuals and companies, PEs in Spain of non-resident companies, and the entities indicated in Section 35.4 of the Spanish General Tax Act (estate of deceased persons, community estate, and other entities without legal personality that constitute a taxable economic unit or assets).
Similarly, under EU and Spanish law, any persons entering or leaving Spain with payment means amounting to EUR 10,000 or more (or the equivalent value in foreign currency) should declare them at the border (Customs services).
Finally, regarding transactions carried out in the European Union, as of 1 February 2014, the current regulations on euro credit transfers and direct debits are the SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) rules. There is a new case of retail payments as a result of the SEPA instruments, which are currently the same for all the countries in SEPA.
## Special expatriate tax regime
Prior to the implementation of the recently approved Law to promote the Spanish ecosystem for emerging companies (‘Start-up Law‘; Law 28/2022), only the taxpayers acquiring tax residence in Spain as a result of an employment contract (with the exception of the special employment relationship of professional sportspeople) or as a result of acquiring the condition of director in a company (with certain requirements) may opt to be taxed under Spanish NRIT law instead of Spanish PIT law in the year when the option is exercised and in the following five years. 
With effect from 1 January 2023, the abovementioned Start-up Law has introduced new scenarios, apart from the three explained above, to opt to be taxed under Spanish NRIT law instead of Spanish PIT law for taxpayers acquiring tax residence in Spain, as follows:
  * To work remotely from Spain (remote work scenario). This requirement will be deemed fulfilled by employees who have a visa for international remote working.
  * To carry out in Spain an economic activity that qualifies as an entrepreneurial activity.
  * To be a highly qualified professional who provides services in Spain to start-ups or who carries out training, research, development, and innovation activities in return for remuneration that represents more than 40% of the total income that the taxpayer earns.


In addition, the Start-up Law has eliminated for the taxpayers coming to Spain as a result of acquiring company director status the previous requirement that such a taxpayer and the company cannot be related parties but only keeping such a requirement when the company consists of assets not linked to the company’s activity of more than 50%.
Furthermore, the Start-up Law has extended the application of this Special Tax Regime to the taxpayer’s spouse and children under the age of 25 (or those of any age if they are legally considered disabled) when certain requirements are met, as follows:
  * That they come to Spain along with the main taxpayer or prior to the end of the first fiscal year of application of the Special Tax Regime.
  * They become a Spanish Tax Resident.
  * They have not been Spanish Tax Residents in Spain in the previous five fiscal years prior to arrival in Spain and that they do not obtain income qualified as income obtained through a PE in Spain.
  * The sum of the taxable base of the spouse and children is not lower than the main taxpayer’s (the taxpayer applying for this Special Tax Regime).


For family members moving to Spain together with the main taxpayer, the regime will apply until the last year of application for the main taxpayer. Family members must apply for this regime within six months of their arrival in Spain or after the date of registration of the main taxpayer with the social security authorities.
Finally, the last amendment that the Start-up Law has introduced in this Special Tax Regime refers to benefit-in-kind income obtained by these taxpayers, extending the tax exemptions provided in article 42.3 of the Spanish PIT Law (applicable to regular tax resident taxpayers) under the Special Tax Regime. These tax exemptions on certain benefit-in-kind income are related to the supply of products at discounted prices in canteens to employees, to contributions to insurance companies for sickness cover for the employees, beyond others.
In such cases, taxpayers are taxed on their Spanish-source income and capital gains. As an exception, taxpayers will be taxed on their employment income obtained worldwide. The applicable tax rate is 24% for the first EUR 600,000 of taxable income and 47% on any excess, except for income from non-resident accounts, at a 19% tax rate up to the first EUR 6,000 of income, a 21% tax rate for the following EUR 6,000 to EUR 50,000 of income, a 23% tax rate for the following EUR 50,000 to EUR 200,000, a 27% tax rate for the following EUR 200,000 to EUR 300,000, and a 28% tax rate on any remaining income over EUR 300,000.
To opt for this special tax regime, taxpayers cannot have been tax resident in Spain for a period of five years prior to the tax year in which they move to Spain.
An application to be taxed under the special expatriate tax regime should be filed within six months following the date when the person starts working in Spain (i.e. the date of registration with the Spanish social security authorities or the date indicated in the documents that allows the person to continue applying the home country’s social security regime).
The taxpayer should not obtain income through a PE in Spain, unless the special tax regime has been granted due to an economic activity.
If any of the requirements stated above are not met, taxpayers forfeit their entitlement to avail themselves of this special tax regime.
By virtue of Royal Decree 1008/2023, it has been established that if there is an economic activity, only professionals applying this special tax regime will be subject to WHT. Also, it is stated that invoices issued while the regime is applicable will include the corresponding WHT. The Royal Decree also provides that taxpayers obtaining income due to their economic activities must fulfil certain formal obligations, such as keeping books of income and expenses and records of invoices issued.
## Tax equalisation policies
Certain companies apply tax equalisation policies to guarantee that assigned employees do not have any kind of advantage or disadvantage in either their net income or social security contributions in the host country with respect to their home country.
These policies also ensure that the assigned employee’s tax burden is similar to the tax that would have been paid in the home country. For this purpose, the company assumes the payment of the employee’s personal income taxes in the host country, and the employee pays the tax that would have been paid in the home country based on the employee's personal circumstances.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
## Employment income
For the purposes of PIT, all remunerations, regardless of their name or nature, whether they are in cash or in kind, generated directly or indirectly from personal work or from an employment or statutory relationship, and which are not business earnings, are employment income.
Amongst others, the following income is regarded as gross employment income:
  * Salaries or wages.
  * Living allowances.
  * Housing allowances.
  * Bonuses.
  * Tax reimbursements
  * Remunerations in kind (e.g. schooling and rent-free housing).
  * Pension income.
  * Amounts paid to deputies, senators, councillors and the like for the performance of their work.
  * Remunerations of directors and members of boards of directors.
  * Income from literary, artistic, or scientific works when the trading rights for such works have been transferred.
  * Income generated from providing courses, conferences, seminars, etc.
  * Income from involvement in humanitarian or welfare activities organised by non-profit organisations.
  * Alimony received from an ex-spouse and non-exempt annuities for food.
  * Non-exempt grants.


PIT is levied on severance pays awarded for dismissals over the limit established in Spanish employment law. The part of the awarded severance pay under the limit that exceeds EUR 180,000 is also subject to and not exempt from PIT.
Employment income is included in the PIT general base and taxed at progressive tax rates, which vary depending on the autonomous community where the taxpayer is situated (_see the Taxes on personal income section for further information_).
Withholdings and advance tax payments are payable on salaries and wages and on benefits.
Non-residents obtaining employment income in Spain are taxed at the general NRIT rate of 24%. For residents of other EU member states or EEA countries with which there is an effective exchange of tax information, the rate is 19%. Pensions are taxed at special rates.
## Equity compensation
Shares granted to employees are generally regarded as employment income and, at granting, are considered to be remuneration in kind at their market value.
However, under PIT regulations, company or group shares awarded to employees free of charge or for a price that is lower than market price are not remunerations in kind, up to the limit of EUR 12,000, provided that the terms and conditions of the offer are the same for all employees.
In addition, with effect from 1 January 2023, the recently approved Law to promote the Spanish ecosystem for emerging companies (’Start-up Law’; Law 28/2022) has introduced a favourable tax treatment for the award of shares or stock options to start-up employees (according to the definitions established in the Law 28/2022). The referred preferential tax treatment consists of the following:
  * Tax exemption increase: An increase in the above-mentioned tax exemption up to a maximum annual gross amount of EUR 50,000 per employee for start-up employees. Only with respect to the award of shares or stock options to start-up employees, it will now not be required to award such shares to all company employees under the same terms with respect to the application of this tax exemption, but it will be sufficient that the shares are awarded as part of the employer’s general remuneration policy.


  * Deferred taxation: Any non-tax-exempt income derived from the award of shares or stock options to start-up employees will be subject to taxation when the first of the following events takes place in the future:
    * The awarded shares are listed on a regulated stock exchange in Spain or abroad.
    * The shares are disposed of by the taxpayer.
    * A ten-year period has passed since the award.


  * Special valuation rule: This special valuation rule on the award of shares to start-up employees involves that, in case that independent third parties have subscribed a share capital increase in the preceding year, the delivered shares to the start-up employees will be valued at the same value at which such independent third parties would have subscribed for the same start-up shares. However, in case that an independent third party has not subscribed a share capital increase in the preceding year, the value of the delivered shares will be the fair market value (general valuation rule).


## Carried interest
With effect from 1 January 2023, the Spanish law on the promotion of the emerging company ecosystem (‘Start-up Law‘; Law 28/2022) introduced into Spanish PIT for the first time the figure of carried interest, providing for its taxation according to the Spanish PIT Law.
The aim of this new regulation is to predict the taxation in Spain of the income obtained from the successful management of private equity (alternative investment funds defined in the EU Directive 2011/61/EU included in any of the following categories: (i) private equity defined in article 3 from the Law 22/2014, (ii) European private equity funds, (iii) European social entrepreneurship long- term funds, and (iv) any equivalent investment vehicle.
The tax treatment of such carried interest income consists of the following:
  * The resulting income will be considered employment income under the Spanish PIT Law.
  * 50% of the carried interest income will be taxed (without applying any tax exemption or tax reduction) when the following requirements are met:
    * The economic rights must be contingent on the rest of the investors obtaining a minimum profit to be defined in the entity’s articles of association.
    * The entity’s shares or economic rights must be maintained for a minimum period of five years unless there is an inheritance transfer (_mortis causa_), there is an early liquidation, or they are cancelled due to a change in the managing entity.
    * This tax treatment will not have an effect when the special economic rights derive directly or indirectly from an entity that is a tax resident of a non-cooperative jurisdiction or a jurisdiction with which there is no regulation on mutual assistance regarding the exchange of tax information.


## Business income
For the purpose of PIT, business income is income generated by a person from a combination of personal work and capital, or only one of these factors, for the production or distribution of goods or services as a result of the person’s own organisation of the means of production and/or human resources of the business.
Specifically, income generated from extraction, manufacturing, trade or service activities, including income obtained from handicraft activities, agriculture, forestry, livestock farming, fishing, building, mining and the practice of liberal, artistic, or sporting professions is considered business income.
Leases of properties are only considered a business activity when at least one person is employed on a full-time basis to organise the lease activity.
Net business income is calculated in accordance with Spanish CIT laws with the application of some specific regulations.
Business income is included in PIT general income and is taxed at the progressive tax rates applicable for each autonomous community (_see the Taxes on personal income section for further information_).
Self-employed persons who are tax resident in Spain and who carry on an economic or business activity are required to make advance payments of PIT during the year (in April, July, October, and January). The tax base and percentage of these advance payments will depend on the evaluation method applicable.
  * If the person applies the direct evaluation method (normal or simplified), the tax base is determined in accordance with CIT regulations with certain specific differences, and the percentage of the advance payment is 20%.
  * If the taxpayer applies the objective evaluation method, the tax base for the advance payment is determined in accordance with income indicators established by Spanish law (signs, indexes, and modules). In this case, the percentage of the advance payment is generally 4%.


Business income obtained in Spain by Spanish non-tax residents acting without a PE is taxed at the general NRIT rate of 24%. For residents of other EU member states or EEA countries with which there is an effective exchange of tax information, the rate is 19% .
## Capital gains
Capital gains and losses are variations in the value of a person’s wealth due to an alteration in its composition that are not considered to be income under Spanish PIT law.
It is important to note that capital gains can arise on all _inter vivos_ transfers, but not on _mortis causa_ transfers.
When the capital gain or loss is generated from the transfer of an asset, it is calculated by deducting the previous acquisition value from its transfer value; otherwise, the capital gain or loss is the market value of the asset.
Capital gains arising from transfers of assets are included in savings income and are taxed at the corresponding progressive tax rates of between 19% and 30%.
A transitory tax regime may be applied for transfers of assets or rights that are not used to carry on a business activity and were initially acquired before 31 December 1994. In accordance with this regime, reduction coefficients (14.28%, 25%, or 11.11% per year, depending on the type of assets, for each year that the assets or rights have been held between the acquisition date and 31 December 1996) may be applied on the proportional part of the capital gain generated from the date of acquisition up to 19 January 2006. Therefore, if the transitory regime is applicable, the total capital gain should be divided into two parts:
  * The part of the capital gain generated from the acquisition date up to 19 January 2006, on which the reduction coefficients is applied.
  * The part of the capital gain generated from 20 January 2006 up to the date of the transfer. This part is taxed at a progressive tax rate of between 19% and 28% and no reduction coefficients apply.


With effect from 1 January 2015, this transitory tax regime is applied when the value of the transfer does not reach EUR 400,000 per taxpayer. For this purpose, the transfer values of all assets transferred from 1 January 2015 on which this transitory regime may be applied should be added together, and if the total amount exceeds the threshold, the transitory regime is applied proportionally to the part of the transfer value that does not exceed the threshold.
The capital gain generated from the sale of a person’s home is tax exempt for the same proportion as the amount that is reinvested in a new home, provided that the new home is purchased within two years.
Capital gains not generated from transfers of assets (such as some lottery prizes) are included in the general tax base and are taxed at progressive tax rates, which are different for each autonomous community (_see the Taxes on personal income section for further information_).
Capital gains obtained in Spain by non-residents without a PE are taxed at a rate of 19% when they are generated from transfers of assets otherwise they are taxed at the general NRIT rate of 24% (for residents of other EU member states or EEA countries with which there is an effective exchange of tax information, the rate is 19%).
The transitory tax regime for transfers of assets and rights not used to carry on an economic/business activity and initially acquired before 31 December 1994 is also applicable for capital gains obtained in Spain by non-residents without a PE.
Capital gains arising from transfers of assets by PIT payers over the age of 65 are tax exempt if the total amount of income obtained from the transfer is used within six months to establish an assured life annuity for the taxpayer. A maximum of EUR 240,000 may be used to establish an assured life annuity. For partial reinvestments, only the part of the capital gain obtained that corresponds to the reinvested amount will be tax exempt.
For transfers of properties located in Spain by non-residents without a PE (individuals), the purchaser is required to deduct 3% of the price of the transfer and deposit it with the local tax authorities. This withholding is treated as an advance payment of capital gains tax for the seller. The non-resident seller must be formally represented in the transaction by a lawyer or legal representative.
## Dividend income
Dividends and other income generated from holding interests in companies are included in PIT savings income and taxed at a 19% tax rate up to the first EUR 6,000 of income, a 21% tax rate for the following EUR 6,000 to EUR 50,000 of income, a 23% tax rate for the following EUR 50,000 to EUR 200,000, a 27% tax rate for the following EUR 200,000 to EUR 300,000, and a 30% tax rate on any remaining income.
Dividend income obtained by Spanish non-resident persons without a PE is taxed by Spanish withholding tax (WHT) at the flat rate of 19% (DTTs normally establish lower rates).
## Interest income
Interest and other income generated from transferring a person’s own capital to third parties are included in PIT savings income and taxed at a 19% tax rate up to the first EUR 6,000 of income, a 21% tax rate for the following EUR 6,000 to EUR 50,000 of income, a 23% tax rate for the following EUR 50,000 to EUR 200,000, a 27% tax rate for the following EUR 200,000 to EUR 300,000, and a 30% tax rate on any remaining income.
As an exception, when capital transferred to a related company exceeds three times the latter company’s equity, the interest corresponding to the excess will be included in general taxable income and taxed at the progressive tax rates, which are different for each autonomous community (_see the Taxes on personal income section for further information)._
Interest income received by non-residents without a PE is taxed by Spanish WHT at a flat rate of 19%. An exemption is applicable for EU residents. DTTs normally establish lower rates.
## Lease income
Income generated from leases of properties by taxpayers is included in PIT general taxable income and taxed at progressive tax rates which are different for each autonomous community (_see the Taxes on personal income section for further information_).
PIT is levied on any residential properties owned by taxpayers (excluding the taxpayer’s habitual residential property) that have not been leased out. An income allocation of 1.1% or 2% of the property’s rateable value is included in PIT general taxable income and taxed at progressive tax rates. A 24% tax on 1.1% or 2% of the property’s rateable value is also levied on non-resident taxpayers (individuals) without a PE with properties in Spain that are not leased out. For residents of other EU member states or EEA countries with which there is an effective exchange of tax information, the rate is 19%.
WHT is levied on rent payments received by non-residents from leases and sub-leases of properties in Spain at the flat rate of 24%. For residents of other EU member states or EEA countries with which there is an effective exchange of tax information, the WHT is 19%.
EU citizens may deduct all costs incurred for the maintenance of property from taxable income. Non-EU residents cannot deduct any costs.
## Exempt income
The following incomes are specifically exempt from PIT (usually subject to certain limits on the amounts involved):
  * Certain literary, artistic and scientific awards.
  * Severance pay for dismissals, up to the limit established in Spanish employment law. The tax exemption is limited to EUR 180,000.
  * Social security benefits or benefits from any other authorities replacing the social security authorities due to total permanent incapacity for work or sever invalidity.
  * Child support received by a parent following a court judgement.
  * Employment income earned for work carried out abroad if this income is subject to an identical or similar tax to Spanish PIT, subject to certain limits and conditions (_see the Taxes on personal income section for further information_).

Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
## Habitual residence tax credit
The tax credit for investments in habitual dwellings is eliminated as of 2013. This tax credit was approximately 15% (depending on the autonomous community) of the amounts paid during the corresponding tax year for the acquisition or restoration of properties that were or would be the taxpayer’s habitual residence. A transitory regime was established in accordance with which the following taxpayers continued to qualify for the tax credit:
  * Taxpayers who bought their habitual dwelling prior to 1 January 2013 or who had paid amounts prior to that date for its construction.
  * Taxpayers who had paid amounts prior to 1 January 2013 for refurbishment work on or the extension of the habitual dwelling, provided that the work was completed by 1 January 2017.
  * Taxpayers who had paid amounts prior to 1 January 2013 for work and installations to adapt the habitual dwelling of disabled persons, provided that the work or installations was completed by 1 January 2017.


The taxpayer could apply this tax credit for amounts paid in a tax period to acquire or construct property and accrued before 1 January 2013, unless Section 68.1.2. of the Spanish PIT Act in force on 31 December 2012 is applicable. This regulation refers to cases where a habitual dwelling has been acquired and the tax credit has previously been applied for the acquisition of other habitual dwellings.
For taxpayers qualifying for the transitory regime, the habitual residence tax credit is applied in accordance with the law in force on 31 December 2012.
## Tax credits applicable to PIT payers who carry on business activities
PIT payers who carry on business activities can apply any tax credits that may be applied by CIT payers for the promotion of certain activities, except for the tax credit for research and development (R&D) and technological innovation, and can even obtain a tax refund for these activities.
S _ee CIT relief in the_ _section of the Corporate tax summary for information on tax credits established for CIT payers._
## Tax relief for investments in shares in newly or recently created companies, and tax exemption for reinvestments of these shares
  * A tax relief is envisaged in Spain for amounts paid during the tax period to subscribe shares in newly or recently created companies that comply with certain requirements. The tax relief, which is applied on the part of the PIT liability corresponding to the state, is a 50% tax credit. The tax base for the tax relief is the acquisition value of the shares, up to an annual limit of EUR 100,000.
  * Capital gains generated from disposals of shares with respect to which the taxpayer has applied the tax relief referred to above will be exempt from PIT if the total amount obtained from the disposal is reinvested in the acquisition of shares in newly or recently created companies, provided that certain requirements are met.


When taxpayers dispose of shares of newly or recently created companies and opt to apply the tax exemption for reinvestments referred to above, only the part of the reinvestment that exceeds the total amount obtained from the disposal will be the tax relief base for the new shares.
## Tax credit for dues and contributions to political parties
A tax credit is established for dues and contributions to political parties. The tax credit is 20% of the dues or contributions paid, up to EUR 600 in the tax credit base.
## Tax credit for large families and dependent relatives in an ascending or descending line
Taxpayers who work outside the home and have dependent relatives in an ascending or descending line or who form part of a large family can apply a EUR 1,200 tax credit for each of these situations. This tax credit is compatible with the current tax credit for maternity.
The tax credit can be increased by up to EUR 600 for each child in a large family that exceeds the minimum number to be a large family. 
## Temporary tax credits for energy efficiency improvement works in dwellings
Temporary tax credits for works to improve the energy efficiency of dwellings are available for PIT payers for amounts invested in refurbishment works that contribute to achieving certain improvements in the energy efficiency of the usual dwelling or dwelling rented for use as a dwelling in accordance with the legislation on urban leases, so that their primary purpose is to meet the tenant's permanent housing needs, and in residential buildings, accredited by means of an energy efficiency certificate.
## Charitable donations
Tax credits may be applied for donations to non-profit organisations that comply with certain requirements. These tax credits range from 40% of the donation to the following scale, depending, mainly, on the organisation receiving the donation:
Donation | (%)  
---|---  
Up to EUR 250 | 80  
Excess:  
In the two previous tax years, donations on which the tax credit can be applied have been made to the same organisation for the same or a higher amount in this tax year and in the previous one compared to the donation made in the immediate previous tax year. | 45  
Other situations. | 40  
The base for this tax relief may not exceed 10% of the taxpayer’s net PIT taxable income, except for donations to listed priority sponsorship activities where the limit is 15% of the taxpayer’s net PIT taxable income.
When donations are made to legally recognised foundations that report to a board of trustees (_protectorado_) and associations declared of public interest not included in the scheme provided in Law 49/2002, the deduction may amount to 10%.
## Tax credit for lease of main residence
The tax credit for lease of main residence has been eliminated with effect from 2015. A transitory regime is established for taxpayers who have signed a lease contract and paid rent before 1 January 2015, provided that they were entitled to apply this tax credit for the same main residence during a previous tax period.


# Spain
## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
Individuals are resident in Spain for tax purposes if they meet at least one of the following criteria:
  * Spend more than 183 days in Spain during a calendar year. In determining the period of stay, temporary absences are included in the count, except when the tax residence in another country can be proven. Special anti-avoidance rules are established for tax havens. Temporary visits to Spain to comply with contractual obligations under cultural and humanitarian collaboration agreements with the Spanish authorities which are not remunerated are not included when calculating the 183-day residence period.
  * Have Spain as their main base or centre of activities or economic interests. It is presumed, unless proven otherwise, that a taxpayer’s habitual place of residence is Spain when, on the basis of the foregoing criteria, the spouse (not legally separated) and underage dependent children permanently reside in Spain. Spanish PIT law contains specific anti-avoidance rules regarding this matter.


Persons who do not meet any of the foregoing criteria are not resident in Spain for tax purposes. In such cases, Spanish-source income and capital gains in Spain are subject to NRIT.
Under Spanish law, the concept of part-year resident does not exist. An individual is either resident or non-resident and is taxed as such for the entire tax year.
However, in certain situations, a person may be resident for tax purposes in two different countries. This could be the case, for instance, of expatriates working in Spain who are resident in both Spain and their home country. A person who is resident in another country may qualify for a relief or exemption of Spanish tax under DTTs between the home country and Spain.
In such situations, the relevant DTT should be consulted to determine the country where the person is resident (_see Double tax treaties [DTTs] in the_ _section for furthe_ _r information_).
Most DTTs signed by Spain consider the following to be relevant when determining place of residence:
  * Permanent home.
  * Personal and economic relations (centre of vital interests).
  * Habitual dwelling.
  * Nationality.

## Social security contributions
**Social security contributions** Under the general regime, social security contributions are paid on wages and salaries. In Spain, the minimum monthly base is EUR 1,323 and the maximum is EUR 4,909.50 in 2025. The general contribution rates are 6.48% for employees, depending on the type of contract, and 30.57% for employers, plus a variable rate for occupational accidents (e.g. 1.50% office work).Certain persons may be exempt from paying social security contributions, provided that the following requirements are met:
  * There is a social security agreement in force between Spain and the person's home country that allows for this possibility.
  * The employment relationship with the home country employer is maintained and the person continues to pay social security contributions to their home country social security system.
  * The person's stay in Spain is limited to a few years (usually between one to five years, depending on the social security agreement in force between Spain and the home country).


To qualify for the exemption, nationals of EU countries must obtain a document certifying continuing liability in their home country and nationals from other countries must obtain a document certifying coverage by the social security authorities in their home country.
On the other hand, the contribution system for the self-employed is modified, establishing a system whereby the self-employed will have to pay contributions according to the income they obtain. This system is made up of 15 economic brackets, and inclusion will vary depending on the income obtained by the self-employed. Within the bracket in which they are included, they will be able to choose the level of contributions they wish to pay. The minimum contribution for the lower bracket is set at EUR 653.59, while the maximum contribution in the upper bracket is set at EUR 4,909.50. Social security benefits would depend on the contributions paid by the self-employed, the general rate being 31.4%, which is applied on a monthly social security contribution base chosen by the self-employed.
Effective January 1, 2025, the additional solidarity contribution will come into force for employees whose remuneration exceeds the established maximum contribution base. This contribution will apply exclusively to the portion of the monthly salary that surpasses the maximum contribution base, calculated through a progressive tier system that determines the applicable percentage based on the amount of salary earned. The first tier includes the portion between the maximum base and up to 10% above it, subject to a rate of 0.92% in 2025. The second tier covers the portion between 10% and 50% above the maximum base, with a rate of 1% in 2025. The third tier applies to the portion exceeding 50% above the maximum base, with a rate of 1.17% in 2025. These rates will increase by 0.25% annually until 2045. The solidarity contribution will follow the same allocation scheme as contributions for common contingencies, with the majority of the burden assigned to employers: 83.39% borne by the employer and 16.61% by the employee. It will not affect employees whose income remains below the maximum contribution base, nor self-employed workers, regardless of their income. 
## Value-added tax (VAT)
Spanish VAT is payable on supplies of goods and services carried out in Spanish VAT territory and on imports/intra-EU acquisitions of goods and services. There are three rates for the different types of goods and services, which are as follows:
· Standard rate of 21%, for regular supplies of goods and services.
· Reduced rate of 10%, for basic necessities (e.g. food and agricultural products not included in the ‘super reduced’ 4% rate, dwellings, other qualifying services). Live cultural events and cinema tickets are taxed at the reduced rate of 10% too. 
· Super reduced rate of 4%, for basic necessities other than those classified under the reduced rate (e.g. bread, milk, books, medicine).
Temporary reductions in rates can apply for specific reasons (e.g. for sanitary reasons, for economic reasons, etcetera). On the other hand, certain activities are VAT exempt , including, among others, financial and/or insurance activities, medical activities, educational services. These activities do not grant the right to deduct input VAT. Having said that, some supplies are VAT exempt and grant the right to deduct input VAT, namely, the performance of intra-EU supplies of goods and exports of goods provided that certain conditions are met. 
In the Canary Islands, a specific tax is applied instead of VAT, called the Canary Island General Indirect Tax (IGIC). IGIC is pretty similar to VAT although there are some differences, mainly in relation to the applicable rates that are normally lower than VAT. Guidelines given by the Spanish mainland authorities are normally also followed by the authorities in the Canary Islands.
In Ceuta and Melilla, a specific sales tax called IPSI is applied. IPSI has rules different from the VAT and, in general terms, its application is only for some activities/taxable events.
##  Wealth tax
Wealth tax is levied on Spanish tax residents' worldwide net assets and on Spanish non-residents' goods and rights that are located, may be exercised, or should be complied with in Spain.
The tax is levied on the assets held by the taxpayer as of 31 December (accrual date).
Law 38/2022, of 27 December 2022, for the establishment of temporary energy taxes and taxes on credit institutions and financial credit establishments, which creates the temporary solidarity tax on large fortunes and modifies certain tax regulations has extended the individuals to which wealth tax applies.
For tax period 2022 onwards, shareholdings when at least 50% of the total assets of the company consists, directly or indirectly, of Spanish real estate assets are subject to wealth tax. For these purposes, the value of the real estate assets would not be the book value reported for accounting purposes by the company, but the value arising from specific wealth tax rules for real estate assets. This value would be the higher of the acquisition value, the cadastral value, and any other value assessed by the tax authorities for tax purposes.
The following tax relief is applicable for this tax:
  * A minimum tax-exempt amount. All autonomous communities of Spain can establish their own minimum tax-exempt amount.
  * If an autonomous community does not establish its own minimum tax-exempt amount, the amount established by Spanish law (EUR 700,000) will apply.
  * In the case of non-tax residents, they have the option to apply either the state regulations or the autonomous community regulations (including the minimum tax-exempt, tax reliefs, and tax rates) governed by the territory in which the highest value of their assets and rights located in Spain is found.
  * Habitual dwellings are tax exempt up to EUR 300,000.
  * Interests in family companies or business assets may also benefit from a tax exemption if certain requirements are met.


The tax liability is calculated by applying the progressive rates established by the autonomous communities in Spain to net taxable income (i.e. after applying tax relief). If the corresponding autonomous community does not establish its own scale of progressive rates, the following scale will apply:
Taxable income (up to EUR) |  Tax liability (EUR) |  Rest of taxable income (up to EUR) |  Applicable rate (%)  
---|---|---|---  
0.00 |  0.00 |  167,129.45 |  0.2  
167,129.45 |  334.26 |  167,123.43 |  0.3  
334,252.88 |  835.63 |  334,246.87 |  0.5  
668,499.75 |  2,506.86 |  668,499.76 |  0.9  
1,336,999.51 |  8,523.36 |  1,336,999.50 |  1.3  
2,673,999.01 |  25,904.35 |  2,673,999.02 |  1.7  
5,347,998.03 |  71,362.33 |  5,347,998.03 |  2.1  
10,695,996.06 |  183,670.29 |  and above |  3.5  
Autonomous communities may establish their own tax relief for wealth tax or an abatement of the tax. Several autonomous communities have already stated that they intend to establish a full tax abatement for wealth tax.
Taxpayers are required to file wealth tax returns if they have a tax liability or their wealth (exempt or not) exceeds EUR 2 million.
## Solidarity tax on large fortunes
Law 38/2022, of 27 December 2022, for the establishment of temporary energy taxes and taxes on credit institutions and financial credit establishments, creates the temporary solidarity tax on large fortunes.
This was a temporary tax that, in principle, was established only for the tax period 2022 and 2023, but finally it has become permanent, and is applicable to residents whose net asset value on 31 December is equal to or higher than EUR 3 million.
The tax base is determined by the application of the wealth tax regulations. The same occurs with the exemptions except for the EUR 700,000 exemption, which applies to both tax residents and non-tax residents in Spain.
The tax liability is calculated by applying the following progressive rate:
Taxable income (up to EUR) |  Tax liability (EUR) |  Rest of income base (up to EUR) |  Applicable rate (%)  
---|---|---|---  
0 |  0 |  3,000,000.00 |  0  
3,000,000.00 |  0 |  2,347,998.03 |  1.7  
5,347,998.03 |  39,915.97 |  5,347,998.03 |  2.1  
10,695,996.06 |  152,223.93 |  Onwards |  3.5  
This tax is complementary to wealth tax, so the wealth tax debt paid in relation to the same tax period should be deducted from the solidarity tax amount.
## Gift and inheritance tax
Spanish gift and inheritance tax is levied on goods and rights acquired by Spanish tax residents by inheritance, legacy or other type of succession, or by donation or other _inter vivos_ legal transfers with no charge.
Spanish gift and inheritance tax is also levied on goods and rights acquired by Spanish non-residents in the manners stated above, whatever their nature, which are located, may be exercised or should be complied with in Spain. However, if a DTT has been signed between Spain and the non-resident's country of residence, taxation will depend on the DTT applicable.
The tax is levied on the assets' net acquisition value.
The tax liability will depend on different matters such as the relationship between the taxpayer and the donor/deceased, or the taxpayer's previous wealth.
Spain's autonomous communities have extensive powers that enable them to pass their own laws regulating different aspects of this tax, and many autonomous communities have established significant tax relief.
Spanish gift and inheritance tax regulations have been reformed with effect from 1 January 2015 as a result of a judgement given by the EU Court of Justice on 3 September 2014, which established that these regulations are an obstacle to free movement of persons and capital and breach the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union by allowing discrimination in the tax treatment of gifts and inheritances between resident and non-resident successors and donees and between gifts and similar disposals of property located in and outside Spain. The reform introduces several rules to equate the tax treatment for the discriminating situations listed by the EU Court of Justice.
The general tax rates are as follows (although they can be modified by autonomous communities):
Taxable income (up to EUR) |  Tax liability (EUR) |  Rest of taxable income (up to EUR) |  Applicable rate (%)  
---|---|---|---  
0 |  7,993.46 |  7.65  
7,993.46 |  611.5 |  7,987.45 |  8.50  
15,980.91 |  1,290.43 |  7,987.45 |  9.35  
23,968.36 |  2,037.26 |  7,987.45 |  10.20  
31,955.81 |  2,851.98 |  7,987.45 |  11.05  
39,943.26 |  3,734.59 |  7,987.45 |  11.90  
47,930.72 |  4,685.10 |  7,987.45 |  12.75  
55,918.17 |  5,703.50 |  7,987.45 |  13.60  
63,905.62 |  6,789.79 |  7,987.45 |  14.45  
71,893.07 |  7,943.98 |  7,987.45 |  15.30

159,634.83 |  23,063.25 |  79,754.30 |  21.25  
239.389,13 |  40,011.04 |  159,388.41 |  25.50  
398,777.54 |  80,655.08 |  398,777.54 |  29.75  
797,555.08 |  199,291.40 |  and above |  34.00  
## Property tax
Property tax is a local tax levied on the owners of properties located in Spain.
The tax liability is a percentage of the rateable value of the property depending on the type of the property (i.e. rural or urban) and the municipality where it is located.
Rates can be fixed by each municipality, with a minimum and a maximum that can be increased slightly if certain requirements are met:
Urban property (%) |  Rural property (%) |  Special properties (%)  
---|---|---  
Minimum |  0.4 |  0.3 |  0.4  
Maximum |  1.1 |  0.9 |  1.3  
## Tax on the increase of urban land value
When urban properties are transferred, a local tax is levied on the theoretical increase of the property's value (tax on the increase of urban land value). Taxable income for the calculation of the tax takes into account the rateable value of the property and the duration of ownership.
On 11 May 2017, the Spanish Constitutional Court stated that regulations laid down by law that tax where there is no increase in value of the urban property transferred are unconstitutional and, consequently, null and void. Consequently, taxpayers that have paid incorrect amounts of tax, where there was no increase in the value of the property, may claim a refund of the tax paid within the statute-of-limitation period by means of a special procedure that commences with the filing of a request with the tax authorities.
Later, on 9 November 2021, Royal Decree Law 26/2021, of 8 November, was published in the Official State Gazette, introducing a new case of non-taxation for these cases in which there is no increase in value in the difference between the values of said land on the dates of transfer and acquisition.
The tax is paid by the transferor of the property (provided that the transfer is not a donation).
Whereas Law 31/2022, of 23 December 2022, increased the maximum amount of the coefficients to be applied to the value of the land at the time of accrual, based on the period of generation of the value increase, Royal Decree-Law 8/2023, of 27 December 2023, decreased the aforementioned coefficients.
Period of generation |  Coefficient  
---|---  
Less than 1 year |  0.15  
1 year |  0.15  
2 years |  0.14  
3 years |  0.14  
4 years |  0.16  
5 years |  0.18  
6 years |  0.19

## Exit tax
### Income not yet allocated 
If PIT payers cease to be PIT payers in Spain as they change their place of residence for tax purposes, they should declare any income not yet allocated in their last PIT return or file a supplementary tax return to declare this income (tax return filed without applying penalties, late payment interest, or surcharges).
When the taxpayer's place of residence is changed to another EU member state, the taxpayer may opt to include any income not yet allocated in one's last PIT return or to file a supplementary tax return to declare such income when each item of income to be declared is obtained (tax return filed without applying penalties, late payment interest, or surcharges).
### Latent capital gains on qualifying shares or interests in Collective Investment Institutions (CIIs)
If taxpayers resident in Spain change their tax residence to another country during at least ten of the 15 tax periods prior to the last tax period for which a PIT return should be filed, in general, the taxation of latent capital gains on shares or interests in companies or CIIs classified according to their value (EUR 4 million) or the interest percentage (25% for EUR 1 million and over) is brought forward.
Payment may be deferred in the event of temporary relocation for work reasons or if the relocation is to a country or territory with which Spain has signed a DTT with an exchange-of-information clause. If, during the following five years (which may be extended for a further five years for cases of relocation for work reasons), taxpayer status is acquired again without any transfer of the shares or interests, the deferred debt and any accrued interest shall be waived by the tax authorities. In this case, the taxpayer may ask the tax authorities to rectify the self-assessment and claim a refund of tax paid.
Special rules are established for changes of tax residence to another EU member state or EEA country.
## Special tax on gaming income
A special 20% tax is levied on the following prizes:
  * Prizes received from lotteries and games organised by the State Lottery and Gaming Corporation and regional bodies or entities, draws organised by the Spanish Red Cross, and the types of games that the Spanish Organisation for the Blind is authorised to conduct.
  * Income from lotteries, games, and draws organised by public bodies or entities that carry on social or welfare non-profit-making activities in other member states of the European Union and have the same business aims as the bodies or entities indicated above.


The tax-exempt net amount for lotteries and games organised from 2020 onwards is EUR 40,000.
The tax base for this special tax is the amount of the prize that exceeds the tax-exempt amount. The tax rate is 20%, which is applied on the tax base minus any withholdings and advance payments applied.
