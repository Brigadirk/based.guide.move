## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Law No. 44 of 2014, followed by Law No. 53 of 2014, ('the new laws') were enacted in June 2014 to amend some of the provisions of the Egyptian Income Tax Law (No. 91 of 2005). The major amendments of the Law include the following:
  * Worldwide taxation of individuals.
  * Tax on dividend income.
  * Tax on capital gains.


Ministerial Decree No. 172 for the year 2015 ('the new executive regulations') was enacted in April 2015 to amend some of the provisions of the executive regulations of the Egyptian Income Tax Law (No. 91 of 2005). The major amendment of the new executive regulations includes the worldwide taxation of individuals.
The Law introduced the new concept that Egypt should be the individual's centre of commercial or industrial activities in order for foreign-source income to be subject to Egyptian individual income tax.
The executive regulations defined the centre of commercial or industrial activities to be the seat where the individual's decisions necessary for conducting one's activities take place and where one's vital interests are located.
In August 2015, a new law was introduced (Law No. 96 of 2015) that introduced some amendments to the Egyptian Income Tax Law (No. 91 of 2005). The major amendments of the law include the following:
  * The application of the tax on dividend income.
  * The application of the tax on capital gains.
  * Payroll tax rates and their applicable brackets.
  * The 5% surtax was abolished.


In June 2023, additional amendments were introduced (Law No. 30 of 2023) to the Egyptian Income Tax Law (No. 91 of 2005). The major amendments of the law include the following:
  * An additional tax bracket of 27.5% is added for individuals earning over 1.2 million Egyptian pounds (EGP) annually.
  * The application of the tax on returns received from funds.
  * Certain capital gains reliefs upon meeting specific criteria.


Furthermore, the new amendments have introduced some changes to the payroll tax calculation for employees receiving salary from a non-principal employer, as follows:
  * The non-principal employer is required to withhold 10% (as an initial payroll tax that should be settled by the principal employer from the payments done to resident individuals) and remit it to the relevant tax authority within the first 15 days of each month.
  * The non-principal employer should inform both the principal employer and the tax authority about the amount received by the individual and the tax deducted.


In addition to the above, changes have taken place with regard to the withholding tax (WHT) on dividends made by Egyptian companies to resident and non-resident individuals. _Please refer to the section for more details_.

Also, tax is imposed on the income of non-resident individuals for their income earned in Egypt.
Earned income (EGP) | Tax rate on bracket (%)  
---|---  
From 1 to 40,000 | 0  
40,000 to 55,000 | 10.0

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Taxable period
The taxable period is the calendar year starting 1 January and closing on 31 December or any period of 12 months taken as a basis for income tax calculation.
## Tax returns
Individuals are required to submit an annual tax return to the tax authorities. The submission deadline for an individual is on or before 31 March following the end of the fiscal year to which the return relates.
Tax on employment income is withheld at source on a monthly basis. Employers are required to file quarterly tax statements in January, April, July, and October of each year.
Employers should submit an annual tax reconciliation to the tax authority on the first of January each year showing the annual salaries and wages of each employee accompanied with the unpaid payroll tax amounts.
## Payment of tax
Within the 15 days of the subsequent month following the date of payment.
## Tax audit process
The audit cycle proceeds as follows.
### Inspection
The tax authority inspects the company based on its documents and records in order to assess the total tax due on the company and determines the difference in tax due as per the company declaration and the tax authority assessment. The authority issues an assessment including the total tax due on the company. If the company objects the inspection result within 30 days of receiving the decision, the dispute is transferred to the Internal Committee.
### Internal Committee
The dispute is transferred to the Internal Committee to discuss the dispute points that arose from the inspection further to issue a modified assessment based on its opinion. If the company objects to the Internal Committee result, the dispute is transferred to the Appeal Committee to review the dispute points arising from the Internal Committee.
### Appeal Committee
The Appeal Committee’s decision is final and binding on the company and the tax department, unless a case is appealed by either of them at the court within 30 days of receiving the decision. Based on the fact that the total taxes due on the assessment as per the Appeal Committee are considered final, if they are not paid within the appropriate period, there will be penalties for the late payment.
### Court
If the decision of the Appeal Committee is not satisfactory for either party, the case will be transferred to the court system, which is considered the final stage of the disputes. Normally, the court will appoint an expert witness to investigate the case and prepare a report. The court process usually takes a long period of time.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations is five years.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Individual income tax is imposed on the total net income of the resident individuals for income earned in Egypt, as well as the income earned outside Egypt for resident individuals whose centre of commercial, industrial, or professional activities is in Egypt. Also, tax is imposed on the income of non-resident individuals for their income earned for work provided in Egypt, regardless of the source of payment, as well as the income earned from an Egyptian source.
## Employment income
Reimbursement for expenses of spouses and dependants is considered taxable income. In addition, school tuition fees, long-term living expenses, and overseas and hardship allowances are taxable.
The current tax law exempts severance pay, pension payments after the fulfilment of specific conditions, and employees’ profit share.
The following benefits are tax exempted, provided that the benefits are in kind and given for all employees. The benefits are:
  * Meals distributed to the workers, provided that they are provided at the workplace.
  * Group transportation of workers or equivalent transportation costs.
  * Health care.
  * Tools and uniforms necessary for performing the work.
  * Residence provided by the employer to the workers for performing their work, provided that the residence is owned or leased by the owner. However, it is worth noting that housing is a bit of a grey area in the Egyptian Income Tax Law as there is no clear-cut definition for the conditions to qualify for the exemption.


## Equity compensation
Tax is due upon exercise on the difference between the fair market value (FMV) of the shares and the purchase price paid by the employee when the employee obtained beneficial ownership of the stock. Hence, there will be Egyptian payroll tax due in Egypt as the shares are exercised.
## Business income
For self-employment income, the employer is taxed at the normal tax brackets.
## Capital gains
The income tax law defines capital gains as the difference between the acquisition cost and the fair value/selling price of the share. As for listed shares acquired before 1 July 2014 and sold after that date, the capital gain will be calculated as the difference between either the acquisition price or the closing price on 30 June 2014 (whichever is higher) and the selling price.
### Capital gains tax (CGT) treatment applicable to resident individuals
  * Capital gains realised by resident shareholders from the disposals of listed shares on the EGX should be subject to CGT at the rate of 10%.
  * On the other hand, capital gains realised from the sale of unlisted shares/securities should be subject to the individual income tax brackets. 
  * Foreign shares/securities (invested abroad): Capital gains realised from shares invested abroad would be subject to the individual income tax brackets (if Egypt is the centre of commercial industrial or professional activity of such individual).


The latest tax law amendments (Law No. 30 of 2023) provide additional CGT relief for individuals upon meeting specific criteria.
### Capital gains tax treatment applicable to non-resident individuals
  * Capital gains realised by non-resident shareholders from the disposals of listed shares on the EGX should not be subject to CGT (including T-bonds). 
  * Capital gains realised from the sale of unlisted shares/securities should be subject to personal income tax (PIT) with progressive rates going up to the rate of 27.5% with the exception of the gains realised from the T-bills that are not taxable.
  * Capital gains realised from shares invested abroad should not be taxed in Egypt.


## Returns received from funds
Under the newly amended tax law treatment, the gains/returns received from funds by natural persons will be subject to a flat tax rate of 5%.
## Dividend income
### Dividend income treatment applicable to resident individuals
A 10% WHT will be imposed on dividends paid by Egyptian companies unlisted on the EGX to resident shareholders. A 5% WHT will be imposed on dividends paid by Egyptian companies listed on the EGX to resident shareholders.
### Dividend income treatment applicable to non-resident individuals
A 10% WHT will be imposed on dividends paid by Egyptian companies unlisted on the EGX to non-resident shareholders. A 5% WHT will be imposed on dividends paid by Egyptian companies listed on the EGX to non-resident shareholders.
_For more details, please refer to the section of the Corporate tax summary_.
## Interest income
Interest income received from local banks is not taxable for residents in Egypt.
Interest income received from treasury bonds and treasury bills are subject to WHT at the rate of 20%.
The reduced rate from double taxation treaties (DTTs) applies for non-residents.
## Rental income
According to article 39 of the Egyptian Income Tax Law, taxable revenue shall be determined on the basis of the actual rental value after deducting 50% there from in return for all costs and expenses concerning the revenues resulting from renting any realty or part of it according to the provisions of the Civil Code.
The normal tax brackets are imposed on the rental amount after the deduction of the 50% mentioned above.
## Exempt income
Income from pensions and end of service bonuses are exempt from income tax.

Accordingly, as of 1 January 2024, the minimum social insurance salary will be EGP 2,000; whereas, the maximum will be EGP 12,600.
Year | Minimum wage (EGP) | Maximum wage (EGP)  
---|---|---  
2022 | 1,400 | 9,400  
2023 | 1,700 | 10,900  
2024 | 2,000 | 12,600

## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate is 14% (_see the section_ _in the Corporate tax summary for more_ _information_).
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Egypt.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There are no inheritance, estate, and gift taxes in Egypt.
## Property taxes
The real estate tax law takes into consideration the different variables that can affect the value of a property, such as location, value of similar buildings, and the economic situation of the district in which the property is located. This is to be updated every five years.
Real estate tax is levied annually on all constructed real estate units. This covers land and building, excluding plant and machinery.
Such tax is assessed based on the rental value of the land and building, and these value assessments are set by the committees, after approval of the Minister or whomever the Minister delegates, and published in the Official Journal. Based on the announcement, any taxpayer can appeal the rental value assessment within 60 days following the publication date in the Official Journal.
The real estate tax rate is 10% of the rental value, and the calculation of the rental value differs for residential units and non-residential units. Specific percentages of deductions are provided by the law to account for all the expenses incurred by the taxpayer, including maintenance costs.
The real estate's definition was recently amended to replace the original land spaces’ provision by the following: 'Actually exploited lands, whether independent or attached to buildings, fenced or not (as determined by the relevant executive regulations).'
A new article was recently introduced to the Real Estate Tax Law, allowing, by means of a decision from the Egyptian Cabinet, real estate tax exemption for the real estate actually exploited in the production and services activities stated by the Egyptian Cabinet, provided that the decision includes the below, for each production or service activity:
  * The percentage of exemption.
  * Its duration.


## Luxury and excise taxes
The sales tax law includes an excise tax on some products, such as the tobacco, alcohols, and medicines.
## Other non-income taxes
### Transfer tax
There is a 2.5% transfer tax on sales of built real estate or land prepared for building, assessed on the total disposal value of the property without any deductions except for villages under certain conditions mentioned in the law.
### Stamp tax
There are two distinct types of stamp tax, which are imposed on legal documents, deeds, banking transactions, company formation, insurance premiums, and other transactions, as follows:
  * The nominal stamp tax is imposed on documents, regardless of their value. The tax rate for items such as contracts is EGP 1 for each paper (per each copy).
  * Percentage or proportionate stamp tax is levied based on the value and nature of transactions.


A proportional stamp tax at the rate of 0.4% annually (i.e. 0.1% per quarter) is imposed on the bank's loan and shared by the bank and the client. This stamp tax is due on a quarterly basis on the beginning balance of each quarter of credit facilities and loans and advances provided by Egyptian banks or branches of foreign banks during the financial year in addition to the amounts utilised within this quarter. 
Loans from other establishments are not subject to this tax.
In addition to the above, stamp duty is imposed on the total proceeds (i.e. value of the transaction) from buying or selling any kind of stocks/securities (with very limited exceptions for the T-bonds and T-bills), regardless of whether they are Egyptian or foreign, listed or non-listed, without deducting any costs, where buyer and seller should each apply the stamp duty on the total proceeds realised.
This type of stamp tax has also been among the changes announced by the Egyptian government, _as explained in the section of the Corporate tax summary_. 
Based on the current law, resident investors trading in or holding Egyptian shares/securities unlisted on the EGX and whether buyers or sellers should be subject to 0.05% stamp tax on the total proceeds realised without deducting any costs (for the transactions involving less than 33%). On the other hand, resident investors trading in listed shares should not be subject to stamp tax (for the transactions involving less than 33%). However, non-resident investors should pay 0.125% on the total value of the transaction for listed and unlisted shares (for transactions involving less than 33%). 
However, for the transactions exceeding 33%, then the stamp tax rate should be 0.3% imposed on each of the buyer and the seller (i.e. the party exceeding the threshold) whether resident or non-resident for listed and unlisted shares.
