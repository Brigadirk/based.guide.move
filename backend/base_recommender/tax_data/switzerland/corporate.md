## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
**BEPS 2.0****–****Pillar****Two**
During its meeting on 4 September 2024, the Federal Council decided to bring the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) into force with effect from 1 January 2025. This international supplementary tax will complement the Qualifying Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax (QDMTT) already introduced on 1 January 2024. The implementation of the other elements of the Pillar Two Rules, i.e., the Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR), was postponed to a later date.
**Revision of Value Added Tax Act and Ordinance**
The Federal Council implemented the partial revision of the Value Added Tax Act (VAT Act) in August 2024, which was passed by Parliament in June 2023, and will enter into effect on 1 January 2025. At the same time, the partially revised Value Added Tax Ordinance (VAT Ordinance) will enter into effect as well. The partially revised VAT Ordinance includes both the implementing provisions for the amended VAT Act and independent adjustments, particularly concerning the net tax and flat tax rate method as well as portal obligations. Further changes are postponed to 1 January 2027, i.e., the portal obligation for the areas of net tax rate as well as flat tax rate method, group taxation, and deregistration as a taxable person.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year is the business year. Thus, the basis for corporate taxation is the applicable accounting period, which may end at any date within a calendar year.
## Tax returns
The tax system for corporate income and capital taxes is based on taxpayers' declarations, with subsequent assessments being issued by the tax authorities based on the tax returns filed. The tax return must be filed annually (an exemption exists in the first business year in case an extended business year shall apply). The filing deadlines vary from canton to canton (usually between six and nine months after the close of the business year). Companies are initially assessed on a provisional basis, with the final assessments being issued after the tax base was either subject of a tax audit or declared final by the authorities.
## Payment of tax
Unless instalment payments are specifically requested, federal, cantonal, and communal taxes on income and capital are, in most cantons and for federal tax purposes, payable only upon receipt of a demand based on a provisional or final assessment.
Note that cantonal exceptions apply. As an example, based on the date of maturity of the respective tax year (30 September), the canton of Zurich levies late payment interest to the extent that the full (final) tax amount had not been paid in time (independent from any earlier provisional tax invoices). About one month before the due date, a (provisional) tax bill based on the latest tax return filed or the assessment of the preceding period is sent to the taxpayer. Payment is usually made in two or three instalments. If the entire amount is paid up front, a discount may be granted.
The provisional federal CIT is usually due by 31 March of the year following the tax period at question. The due date of the final federal CIT and the provisional or final cantonal CIT varies.
## Tax audit process
Swiss CIT law does not outline specifics of the tax audit process. At first, the tax authorities review the tax return and its enclosures as filed by the taxpayer. Such review is usually desk-related work. The competent tax authorities are obligated and entitled to clarify all relevant information necessary to assess taxpayers on a true and complete base. The tax authorities may request further information/documentation or may inspect the taxpayer’s premises.
## Statute of limitations
As a general rule, the right to assess a taxpayer in relation to corporate income and capital taxes expires five years after the end of the corresponding tax period (relative statute of limitations). Under certain conditions (e.g. where the relative statute of limitations is interrupted), the absolute statute of limitations of 15 years applies.
In case of tax fraud (_‘Steuerbetrug’_) or tax evasion (_‘Steuerhinterziehung’_ ; e.g. where specific information was not available to the tax inspector at the time of the assessment), finally assessed tax periods can be reopened. The statute of limitations to reopen finally assessed tax periods is ten years after the end of the corresponding tax period.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The Swiss tax authorities do not communicate specific topics of focus. The tax authorities do normally start their assessment with reviewing the tax return and its enclosures as filed by the taxpayer (_see Tax audit process above_).

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
A company is considered resident in Switzerland if its domicile is in Switzerland. Residency is also linked to the place of effective management, which may be the place from which day-to-day activities are directed and/or the place from which managerial decisions are taken.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
For Swiss tax law purposes, the term 'permanent establishment' means a fixed place of business through which the business activity of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on. In particular, PEs are branches, factories, workshops, sales agencies, permanent representations, mines and other places of extraction of natural resources, as well as building or construction sites that are maintained for at least 12 months. This definition is generally in line with the criteria according to the current Article 5 paragraph 2 of the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital.


# Switzerland
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
The statutory accounts of a Swiss company are the basis for determining taxable income. To be tax deductible, an expense must be booked in the statutory accounts accordingly.
Generally, all business expenses that are booked in the statutory accounts are tax deductible, assuming they are economically/commercially justified from a tax perspective. If an expense is not a justifiable business expense in the sense of the tax law, it will be added back to taxable income. Examples typically include excessive depreciation, non-justified payments to related parties (e.g. hidden profit distributions), etc.
## Depreciation and amortisation
Maximum safe harbour depreciation/amortisation rates allowed for tax purposes are issued by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration. Higher depreciation/amortisation is allowed for tax purposes if the taxpayer can prove that such higher depreciation/amortisation is required (and not only allowed) from a statutory accounting perspective. Some cantons follow the federal guidelines, whereas some cantons apply their own (more liberal) depreciation/amortisation rates.
The following summary of the rates specified by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration provides the general range of tax-accepted depreciation:
Assets | Declining-balance (%) | Straight-line (%)  
---|---|---  
Commercial buildings:  
Buildings alone | 4 | 2  
Buildings and land combined | 3 | 1.5  
Equipment:  
Office furniture and equipment | 25 | 12.5  
Computer hardware and software | 40 | 20  
Other assets:  
Motor vehicles | 40 | 20  
Intangible assets | 40 | 20  
Some cantons (e.g. Basel-City, Bern, Grisons, Zurich) take a more liberal approach and even permit, for tax purposes, an immediate write-down of certain assets (including fixed assets) to 20% or nil of the purchase price in the first year, provided that such write-downs do not, in the aggregate, result in a drastic decline in taxable income or even a tax loss. For CIT purposes, such immediate write-downs must be booked in the statutory accounts and generally disclosed in the tax return. As the cantonal tax authorities are responsible for assessing not only cantonal/communal CIT but also federal CIT, the immediate write-down will typically be accepted for federal CIT purposes as well.
## Goodwill
Only acquired goodwill (derivative goodwill) may be capitalised in the statutory accounts and be amortised. Amortisation is generally allowed straight-line over five years. Special limitations apply to acquired shares, where the purchase price for these shares partly represents inherent goodwill.
## Start-up expenses
The Swiss code of obligations does not contain any specific Swiss statutory accounting provision regarding start-up expenses. For Swiss statutory accounting purposes, start-up expenses shall be expensed as incurred. For Swiss CIT purposes, business-related start-up expenses as booked in the statutory profit and loss statement are likely fully tax deductible.
## Interest expense
Interest paid by a corporation to a third party is a deductible business expense. Interest paid to related parties (especially affiliated companies and shareholders) has to reflect the fair market rate and is subject to limitations (_see Thin capitalisation in the section_).
With respect to related parties, the Swiss Federal Tax Administration annually issues safe harbour interest rates to be used on loans denominated in Swiss franc on the one hand and in foreign currencies on the other hand. The corporation may deviate from these safe harbour rates as long as it can prove with hard facts that the rates used are arm’s length and more appropriate in the present case. The cantons usually follow these federal guidelines.
The safe harbour rules for loans denominated in Swiss franc applicable as of 1 January 2024 are as follows:
For loans to related parties | Minimum interest rate (%)  
---|---  
Financed from equity | 1.5  
Financed from debt (actual costs plus at least):  
On amount up to and including CHF 10 million | Own cost plus 0.50  
On amounts of more than CHF 10 million | Own cost plus 0.25  
But in all cases at least | 1.5  
For loans from related parties | Maximum interest rate (%)  
---|---  
Type of loan | Home construction/ agriculture | Industry and business  
Real estate loans: | 2.25 | 2.75  
A loan up to the amount generally acceptable for mortgages (i.e. ⅔ of the market value of the real estate)  
Rest, whereby the following maximum interest rates for debt are applicable: | 3.00* | 3.50*  
Land, villas, condominiums, vacation homes, business premises up to 70% of the market value  
Other real estate up to 80% of the market value  
Operational loans up to CHF 1 million:  
Granted to trading and production companies | - | 3.75*  
Granted to holding and asset administration companies | - | 3.25*  
Operational loans above CHF 1 million:  
Granted to trading and production companies | - | 2.00*  
Granted to holding and asset administration companies | - | 1.75*  
* In calculating the amount of the maximum interest permissible from a tax perspective, any potentially existing deemed or hidden equity (based on Swiss thin capitalisation rules; _see Thin capitalisation in the_ _section_) has to be considered.
## Notional interest deduction (NID)
The Federal Act on the Harmonisation of Direct Taxation at Cantonal and Communal Levels allows cantons to introduce a notional interest deduction (NID) on excess equity, if certain conditions are fulfilled. Currently, the NID is only available for companies that are tax resident in the canton of Zurich. The NID rate on such excess equity is generally based on the 10-year Swiss government bond rate. To the extent it relates to inter-company loans, an arm’s-length rate can be applied.
## Bad debt provision
Based on a longstanding practice in Switzerland, it is admissible to set up a statutory accounting provision for specific impaired receivables, which will be accepted for CIT purposes. Unlike most other countries, it is also possible to account for an additional ('lump sum') bad debt provision of 5% on most domestic and 10% on most foreign receivables (i.e. a provision in addition to the provision for specific impaired receivables). The most common exceptions are for inter-company receivables and receivables to the public, enabling the taxpayer to defer the related tax liability until this provision has been released. Some cantons, such as Zurich, accept an even higher reserve (i.e. 10% on domestic and 20% on foreign receivables). This additional bad debt provision may have the character of a 'hidden' (i.e. undisclosed) reserve and is appropriate because the Swiss statutory accounting standards favour prudence over true and fair view accounting principles.
## Obsolete inventory provision
Similarly to the bad debt provision, it is possible to account for an additional (i.e. undisclosed) reserve on a company’s inventory. This provision, which must also be booked in the statutory accounts, is on most inventory categories accepted for tax purposes (like the bad debt provision). Specifically, a company may book a provision for specific obsolete inventory as well as a general provision of up to one-third (slightly varies per canton) on the inventory value after deduction of the obsolete inventory.
## Charitable contributions
At the federal level, charitable contributions of up to 20% of the net profit (after tax) of a company are tax deductible, provided certain criteria are met. In particular, the charitable contribution must be remitted to (i) Swiss legal entities that are exempt from taxation based on their public welfare or exclusively charitable objective or to (ii) the Swiss Federation, a Swiss canton or municipality, or their agencies (‘ _Anstalten_ ’). The cantons usually apply the same rules and similar thresholds.
Sponsoring contributions are only tax deductible if commercially justified (without specific thresholds).
## Royalties
Royalty payments are generally deductible for tax purposes if the royalty rate is arm’s length.
## Costs of employee share plans and stock option plans
The cost of employee share plans and stock option plans are generally deductible, assuming the employees eligible for the plan are employed by the Swiss company. The same holds true for the recharge of costs for plans covering local employees.
## Costs for job-related training and continuing education of employees
As far as they are recognised as an expense in the statutory books, costs incurred for job-related training and continuing education of employees are generally tax deductible.
## R&D super deduction
The Federal Act on the Harmonisation of Direct Taxation at Cantonal and Communal Levels provides all cantons with the option to introduce an R&D super deduction at the cantonal and communal levels. Upon request by the taxpayer, an additional deduction of up to 50% (depending on cantonal rules) may be granted on qualifying Swiss R&D personnel expenses as well as expenses for third party contract R&D in Switzerland.
## Fines and penalties
Under Swiss tax law, fines imposed as a penalty, as well as financial administrative sanctions, insofar as they have a punitive purpose, are not tax deductible. Fines imposed in the context of skimming of profits, insofar as they do not have a punitive purpose, are tax deductible.
## Tax expenses
Corporate income and capital taxes paid to the federal government, as well as to the cantons and the municipalities, are tax deductible. Indirect taxes (e.g. real estate transfer tax) are tax deductible as well.
## Net operating losses
Tax losses can be carried forward for a maximum of seven years and can be offset against the taxable income of the following seven years. There is no carry back of tax losses in Switzerland. According to an ongoing legislative project, Switzerland may extend the loss offsetting period for companies from seven to ten years.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Management and service fees paid by a Swiss company to a related party are generally tax deductible if the fees are arm’s length.


# Switzerland
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
Tax is levied on each corporation as a separate entity. A parent company and its Swiss subsidiaries are taxed separately. Only the dividends from the subsidiaries (but not their profits) are taxable in the parent company’s hands. However, usually for dividend income, participation relief is available (_see Participation relief in the_ _section_). For corporate income and capital taxes, no rules on group taxation exist.
## Transfer pricing
So far, Switzerland has not introduced specific transfer pricing regulations. There is, however, an increasing awareness of transfer pricing matters and a related concern on the part of the Swiss tax authorities that taxpayers may transfer profits without sufficient economic justification either to countries with strict transfer pricing rules and documentation requirements in order to avoid challenges by the respective local tax authorities or to offshore locations. In this context, Swiss tax authorities take an increasing interest in a company’s transfer pricing position in order to defend their own position. Some cantonal as well as the federal tax authorities have started to particularly focus on low risk/low profit entities located in Switzerland.
Switzerland follows the OECD Guidelines as closely as possible and recognises the arm’s-length principle based on interpretation of actual legislation. To clarify transfer pricing issues, Switzerland offers an informal procedure for agreeing to pricing policies in advance. In an international context, such agreements are subject to the spontaneous exchange of information (_see spontaneous exchange of information in the_ _section_).
## Thin capitalisation
Swiss thin capitalisation rules are, in general, only applicable for related parties. In case of a thin capitalisation, the related party debts can be treated as taxable equity. The respective circular letter 6a issued by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration provides for debt-to-equity ratios as safe harbour rules. As an example, the debt-to-equity ratio is generally fixed at 6:1 for finance companies (safe harbour). Interest paid on loans that exceed the relevant ratios are generally not tax deductible; further, such interest may be deemed as a hidden distribution subject to Swiss WHT. There are no limitations on the financing of Swiss corporations by independent third parties (e.g. banks).
Interest rates paid to affiliated companies are also subject to periodically fixed safe harbour interest rates (_see Interest expense in the section_). The tax deduction of interest in excess of the permitted safe harbour rate may be disallowed and treated as a hidden distribution subject to Swiss WHT.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
In Switzerland, no CFC or 'subject to tax' rules exist. Foreign companies are therefore recognised for Swiss tax purposes if they are managed and controlled offshore and are not set up purely for the reason of avoiding Swiss taxes.


# Switzerland
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
Foreign legal entities having a branch in Switzerland are subject to limited taxation in Switzerland. Such branches generally qualify as PEs in line with the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital. The branch's income is, in general, subject to the same CIT rules that apply for Swiss corporations. It is worth noting that there is no Swiss withholding tax (WHT) on profit transfers from the Swiss branch to its foreign head office.


# Switzerland
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
Generally, cantons offer competitive CIT rates for cantonal and communal tax purposes. Depending on the specific cantonal and communal tax location in Switzerland, the ordinary overall (federal, cantonal, and communal) CIT rates applicable on profit before tax may vary between 11.9% and 20.5% (_see the Overall tax rates in the_ _section_). The cantons continually try to improve their attractiveness as business locations. It is at the sole discretion of the cantons to credit CIT against the capital tax to reduce the overall tax burden (_see Capital tax in the_ _section_). With the Swiss tax reform, a patent box was introduced at cantonal and communal levels on 1 January 2020 reducing CIT on license income from qualifying patents upon request. There is further, in most of the cantons, the option to apply for an R&D super deduction.
In addition, many cantons offer tax incentives for newly established companies or for expansion investments, such as tax holidays or significant tax relief for cantonal and communal tax purposes for up to ten years. In some specific economic development regions and regional centres, a tax holiday may even be granted for federal CIT purposes if certain conditions are met.
## Patent box
On 1 January 2020, a patent box was introduced at cantonal and communal levels reducing CIT on income from qualifying patents upon request. The proportion of income from patents and similar rights to the extent it is based on qualifying R&D expenses in Switzerland is exempt from CIT up to a maximum of 90% (depending on the cantonal implementation) capped with a maximum relief that is linked to overall relevant income of the company. To enter the patent box, previously incurred R&D expenses that arose to develop the respective patents will have to be taxed at the applicable CIT rate based on a company’s location of corporate residence in Switzerland. The magnitude of the patent box benefits varies from canton to canton.
## Foreign tax credit
Swiss tax resident corporations and branches may suffer foreign non-recoverable WHTs on dividend, interest, and royalty income derived from foreign sources. As such foreign-source income is generally subject to corporate income taxation in Switzerland, a double taxation occurs. In case a double tax treaty (DTT) exists and in order to reduce or to eliminate double taxation, Switzerland usually applies the credit method (for branches as of 1 January 2020). Specific conditions and formalities will need to be met to benefit from foreign tax credits.


# Switzerland
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
This section shall provide a general overview and an indication of the residual WHT on outbound payments from Switzerland. There might be certain exceptions or further reductions available in the DTT, which, for the sake of clarity, are not reflected in the table below. Accordingly, the table below does not replace a thorough assessment of a specific case based on the applicable DTT in force.
The statutory rate of Swiss WHT is 35%. Relief, if any, is generally granted by refund. With respect to dividends between qualifying related companies, a mere notification/reporting procedure may be requested for the fraction of the Swiss WHT exceeding the residual WHT (which is 0% in many cases). Starting 1 January 2023, newly issued notification certificates are valid for five years (previously limited to three years). The table further below shows the residual/remaining tax for the recipient. Credit for the unrelieved portion of Swiss WHT may be available in the country of the recipient.
In Switzerland, there is no WHT on interest deriving from regular loan agreements. Swiss WHT of 35% is only levied on interest paid by banking institutions (or paid by entities tax-wise qualified as 'banking institutions') to non-banks, interest on bonds, and interest on bond-like loans. The residual rates in the table below show the standard treaty rates and do not reflect further reliefs available in certain DTTs (e.g. on traded bonds or other traded securities).
With respect to royalties, Switzerland does not levy WHT.
Many of the DTTs concluded between Switzerland and other jurisdictions contain a full relief if dividends or interest is paid to governments (including political subdivisions and other governmental institutions), central banks, or pension funds.
Note that in the DTTs concluded between Switzerland and other jurisdictions, the reduced WHT for substantial holdings usually is only available if the recipient of the dividend is a corporate body (e.g. not taxed as a partnership).
Interest paid on contingent convertible bonds (CoCos) and on write-off bonds (bonds with claim waiver) of systematically important banks is exempt from Swiss WHT. The WHT exemption is restricted to bonds issued by the respective institutions between 2013 and 2026. Additionally, interest of certain bail-in bonds issued by the respective institutions between 2017 and 2026 is not subject to WHT. These bonds must, furthermore, fulfil specific criteria in order to benefit from the WHT exemption. During its meeting on 21 August 2024, the Federal Council approved a temporary extension of the special rules on WHT for too-big-to-fail (TBTF) instruments to 31 December 2031. The effective implementation into the law is to be monitored.
## Capital contribution principle
The capital contribution principle allows the repayment of qualifying shareholders’ capital contributions without deduction of Swiss WHT at the level of the distributing company and without income tax implications at the level of Swiss individual shareholders (holding the shares as private wealth). In general, the capital contribution principle applies for premiums, additional paid-in capital, and contributions into the reserves of a company without increasing the nominal share capital.
It should be noted that since 1 January 2020 there have been restrictions to the amount that a company listed at the Swiss stock exchange may distribute as capital contribution reserves. There are no restrictions for any other companies.

* Switzerland and the European Union (EU) signed an Agreement regarding the Introduction of the Global Automatic Exchange of Information Standard on 27 May 2015, applicable as of 1 January 2017. The Agreement signed is a protocol of amendment that replaces the Savings Agreement between Switzerland and the European Union, which has applied since 1 July 2005. Article 9 of the Automatic Exchange of Information Agreement (AEOI) provides the same benefits as the former Savings Agreement, as follows:
Upon request, Swiss WHT on dividends paid by a Swiss subsidiary company to its EU parent company may be reduced to 0% (reduction at source) and is only subject to a notification/reporting procedure, provided the following key conditions are cumulatively met:
  * Direct minimum holding of 25% of the subsidiary’s capital for at least two years.
  * Both companies are subject to CIT.


Upon request, WHT on interest and royalty payments made between associated companies or their PE resident, respectively situated in Switzerland and the European Union, may be reduced to 0% (reduction at source) in the source state, provided the following key conditions are cumulatively met:
  * Direct minimum holding of 25% for at least two years (parent/subsidiary) or direct holding by a third company of minimum 25% in the capital of both companies for at least two years (sister companies).
  * Both companies are subject to CIT.


The application of the Bilateral Agreement is subject to foreign and Swiss misuse conditions.
** Upon exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 31 January 2020, a transition period running until 31 December 2020 applied during which bilateral agreements between Switzerland and the European Union, including the AEOI between Switzerland and the European Union, continued to apply to the United Kingdom. After this transition period, the AEOI is no longer applicable to the United Kingdom as the treaty with the European Union no longer applies to the United Kingdom. It is worth noting that the treaty with the European Union also applied to Gibraltar as a European territory for whose external relations a member state is responsible. Being that this member state is the United Kingdom, with the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the AEOI no longer applies to Gibraltar either.
DTTs between Switzerland and EU countries with more favourable tax treatment of dividend, interest, and royalty payments remain unaffected.
Notes
  1. There is no Swiss WHT on royalties, licences, and similar fees payable by Swiss individuals or corporations (provided that the dealing at arm’s-length principle is met).

  13. Full relief if paid to a related entity in the form of a corporation.
  14. Since 30 November 2022, 0% WHT if minimum shareholding is at least 10% for at least 1year.
  15. Switzerland levies a WHT on interest paid on bonds issued in Switzerland and on bank accounts with Swiss banks. Generally, no WHT is levied on interest paid on loans. However, from a Swiss WHT perspective, a loan may be requalified as a bond under certain circumstances.
  16. Application of the DTT between Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
  17. The DTT between Switzerland and Kosovo is applicable since 1 January 2019.
  18. Since 1 January 2019, the residual WHT is 0% on dividends for shareholdings of at least 10% held for a period of at least one year.
  19. An agreement was signed on 24 January 2019, aiming a modification of the DTT by (i) reducing the percentage of minimum shareholdings from 20% to 10% to benefit from qualifying investment and (ii) setting the residual WHT rate on interest to 5%. The date of entry in force is not yet known.
  20. Dividends paid to individual pension institutions (in Switzerland, so-called pillar 3a pension funds) are exempt from WHT from 1 January 2020.

## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Reorganisations
Most corporate reorganisations (e.g. mergers, de-mergers, transfer of business assets within a group of companies, vertical and horizontal spin-off of business or part of business, share-for-share transactions and cross-border reorganisations where the Swiss tax residency and Swiss taxation of assets is maintained, and like-kind exchange of participations) are typically possible without triggering adverse Swiss tax consequences (tax neutrality is available). In addition, special rules provide for a legal framework to tax neutrally substitute assets and qualifying shareholdings. For reorganisations, it is best practice to apply for advance tax rulings with the competent tax authorities. Advance tax rulings covering certain cross-border reorganisation aspects may be subject to the spontaneous exchange of information (_see Spontaneous exchange of information below_).
## Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
In 2013, Switzerland and the United States (US) signed a bilateral FATCA agreement. The FATCA agreement will help Swiss financial institutions by means of simplifications in the implementation of the US FATCA legislation. The FATCA agreement and the implementing Swiss act entered into force on 2 June 2014 and 30 June 2014, respectively.
The FATCA agreement shall ensure that accounts held by US persons with Swiss financial institutions are disclosed to the US tax authorities either with the consent of the account holder or through ordinary administrative assistance channels (no automatic information exchange).
## Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS)
Based on the results of the BEPS project, Switzerland has launched several actions in order to implement BEPS measures into the Swiss tax law, in particular:
  * Country-by-country (CbC) reporting: On 1 December 2017, the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on the Exchange of CbC reports, as well as the corresponding Swiss law, have entered into force. Generally, Swiss-headquartered multinationals with a revenue exceeding CHF 900 million are required to prepare a CbC report. They had to draw up a first CbC report in the year 2019 for the year 2018. The automatic exchange of these reports between the partner states started in 2020. Switzerland and its partner states will therefore exchange CbC reports from 2020 onwards.
  * Multilateral Instrument (MLI): Switzerland signed the MLI on 7 June 2017 and ratified it on 29 August 2019. The MLI entered into force on 1 December 2019. Switzerland will implement minimum standards either within the framework of the MLI or by means of the bilateral negotiation of DTTs. Switzerland has already finished first bilateral negotiations in order to implement BEPS minimal standards within existing DTTs. The MLI includes a principal purpose test (PPT), based on which treaty benefits may be refused if an abusive arrangement exists.
  * Pillar Two (minimum tax rate): The Federal Council in January 2022 decided to implement the minimum tax rate agreed by the OECD and G20 member states by means of a constitutional amendment, subject to a public vote. The constitutional amendment was adopted in the public vote on 18 June 2023 and entered into force on 1 January 2024. By means of a temporary ordinance, the Federal Council decided on 22 December 2023 to implement in a first step the Qualifying Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax (QDMTT) for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2024. Starting 1 January 2025, the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) will be implemented.With respect to the Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR), the Federal Council postponed the implementation for the time being. 


The implementation of further BEPS actions into the Swiss tax law and DTTs is an ongoing process.
## Automatic information exchange
In view of the OECD’s developments on a new standard for the automatic exchange of information, Switzerland switched to an automatic exchange of information between the competent authorities on a reciprocal basis.
Switzerland has agreed on the automatic exchange of information in respective agreements with numerous partner states (e.g. the EU member states, many offshore countries, as well as most of the OECD member states).
## Spontaneous exchange of information
The ordinance on international administrative assistance in tax matters (StAhiV) contains rules on the spontaneous exchange of information. A spontaneous exchange of information is an unrequested exchange of information available to the competent Swiss tax authorities that may be of interest to the competent foreign tax authority.
The spontaneous exchange of information covers the following advance tax rulings:
  * Advance tax rulings relating to preferential tax regimes.
  * Unilateral advance pricing agreements (APA) or other transfer pricing rulings.
  * Downward adjustment rulings.
  * PE rulings.
  * Conduit rulings.


The relevant information regarding such advance tax rulings shall be spontaneously exchanged with the competent foreign tax authorities within three months after the receipt of the information by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration.


# Switzerland
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
The statutory accounts of a Swiss company (or in the case of a non-resident company, the branch accounts) serve as the basis for determining taxable income. There are generally very few differences between statutory profit and taxable profit apart from the participation relief for dividend income and capital gains (_see below_), adjustments required by the tax law, and the usage of existing tax loss carry forwards (_see Net operating losses in the section_).
## Inventory valuation
Swiss CIT treatment does, in principle, follow underlying Swiss statutory accounting treatment. Inventory valuation is therefore determined according to the accounting rules of the Swiss code of obligations. As the Swiss code of obligations and hence the Swiss accounting rules favour the prudence principle, a valuation allowance is allowed to be recorded on the inventory in excess of the actual devaluation of the inventory due to a lower market value (_see Obsolete inventory provision in the section_). Such valuation allowance is accepted for tax purposes in an amount up to a maximum of one-third of the inventory’s acquisition costs or its production costs, respectively its lower market value.
Accordingly, the maximum inventory value represents the inventory’s acquisition costs or its production costs. In case these costs exceed the inventory’s market value at the balance sheet date, the latter lower market value must be applied. In order to determine the inventory’s acquisition or production costs, various methods exist.
It is at the corporate taxpayer’s discretion to determine which method shall apply (e.g. weighted average method, first in first out [FIFO], last in first out [LIFO], highest in first out [HIFO]).
## Participation relief
Participation relief is the term generally used for the tax relief on qualifying dividend income and capital gains from the disposal of a subsidiary. Participation relief is not an outright tax exemption, but rather a tax abatement mechanism. It is therefore also commonly referred to as 'participation deduction' or ‘participation exemption’.
Participation relief is a percentage deduction from CIT that is equal to net participation income divided by taxable income. Net participation income consists of the gross participation income from qualifying dividends and (usually) qualifying capital gains less related administration and financing costs and any depreciation of the participation that is linked to the dividend distribution. In most cases, the participation relief results in a full exemption of participation income from CIT, or to an exemption close thereto. Note that the participation relief may be diluted in certain cases (e.g. if tax loss carry forwards are offset).
The participation relief on dividend income is mandatory at the federal CIT as well as at the cantonal/communal levels. The participation relief on capital gains is voluntary for cantonal/communal tax purposes, but nonetheless implemented by all cantons.
### Dividend income
Dividends qualifying for participation relief are those from participations representing at least 10% of the share capital or 10% of profits and reserves of another company and/or those having a market value of at least CHF 1 million. Note that there is neither a minimum holding period nor a requirement that the dividend paying subsidiary is liable to CIT in its jurisdiction of residence.
### Capital gains
Capital gains derived from the disposal of a qualifying participation are generally entitled to participation relief if the following conditions are cumulatively met:
  * The participation sold was owned by the company for a period of at least one year.
  * The participation sold consists of an investment of at least 10% of the share capital or entitles to at least 10% of the profits and reserves of the underlying subsidiary. If a residual participation is less than 10% due to a previously qualifying partial sale, further participation relief on a capital gain is only possible if the residual participation’s market value at the beginning of the year amounted to at least CHF 1 million.


It is noteworthy that capital gains are only entitled to participation relief to the extent the sales price exceeds the original investment costs (commonly also referred to as 'acquisition costs') of the participation, whereas the so-called 'recaptured depreciation' (i.e. the amount of former depreciations) is taxable.
## Interest income
Interest income earned is taxable income. It is of no relevance whether the payment of the interest was made by a related party (affiliated company or shareholder) or by a third party (_see Interest expense in the section_).
## Royalty income
Royalty income represents taxable income. It is generally subject to ordinary CIT at federal, cantonal, and communal levels.
With the Swiss tax reform, a patent box was introduced at cantonal and communal levels on 1 January 2020. It reduces CIT on license income from qualifying patents (i.e. reduced taxation of income realised from patents) upon request. There is further the option for cantons to introduce an R&D super deduction.
## Foreign exchange gains
Realised foreign exchange gains in relation to a transaction (transaction gains) are included in the tax basis of a corporation as taxable. Realised and, as a result of the prudence principle of the Swiss accounting rules, unrealised transactional foreign exchange losses are tax deductible. Based on a federal court decision in 2009, foreign exchange gains (or losses) resulting from the translation of financial statements in a foreign (functional) currency to Swiss franc (presentation currency) are not taxable (respectively tax deductible).
## Foreign income
Swiss tax resident corporations are basically taxed on their worldwide income. However, income attributable to a foreign PE (i.e. a PE outside of Switzerland) is not taxed in Switzerland. Such income may only be taken into account to determine the applicable tax rate, in case progressive tax rates apply. The same rule applies for income from real estate property situated abroad.
Dividends, interest, and royalties from Swiss or foreign sources are included in taxable income. However, in certain cantons, special methods of assessment may apply for dividend and other income originating outside Switzerland. For dividend income, a relief generally is available for CIT purposes at the federal, cantonal, and communal levels (_see Participation relief above_). The irrecoverable portion of foreign WHT of most treaty countries can be credited against the related Swiss CIT on the same income. Foreign WHT of non-treaty countries generally is not creditable but is deductible for CIT purposes.
There are no controlled foreign company (CFC) rules in Switzerland. Consequently, undistributed income of foreign subsidiaries is usually not taxed in Switzerland (_see Controlled foreign companies [CFCs] in the_ _section_).

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
Resident companies are subject to Swiss corporate income tax (CIT) on their taxable profits generated in Switzerland. CIT is levied at the federal, cantonal, and communal levels. Foreign-source income attributable to foreign permanent establishments (PEs) or real estate property located abroad is excluded from the Swiss tax base and only taken into account for rate progression purposes in the cantons that apply progressive tax rates.
Non-resident companies may be subject to Swiss CIT if they (alternatively) have a PE in Switzerland, own real estate property in Switzerland, are partners of a Swiss business, have loan receivables secured by a mortgage on Swiss real estate property, or deal with or act as a broker of Swiss real estate property. Non-resident companies are taxed on their income generated in Switzerland (_see the section_).
## Federal level
Switzerland levies a direct federal CIT at a flat rate of 8.5% on profit after tax. Accordingly, CIT is deductible for tax purposes and reduces the applicable tax base (i.e. taxable income), resulting in a direct federal CIT rate on profit before tax of approximately 7.83%. At the federal level, no corporate capital tax is levied.
## Cantonal/communal levels
In addition to the direct federal CIT, each canton has its own tax law and levies cantonal and communal corporate income and capital taxes at different rates. Therefore, the tax burden of income (and capital) varies from canton to canton. Some cantonal and communal taxes are imposed at progressive rates.
## Overall tax rates
As a general rule, the overall approximate range of the maximum CIT rate on profit before tax for federal, cantonal, and communal taxes is between 11.9% and 20.5%, depending on the company’s location of corporate residence at a specific capital of a canton in Switzerland. With the entry into effect of the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV (old-age and survivors' insurance) Financing (TRAF) as of 1 January 2020, the cantons introduced internationally accepted measures, such as an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) compliant patent box, a research and development (R&D) super deduction, and other measures. These measures can lead to lower effective tax rates.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
As a matter of principle, proceeds of sales made and services provided in Switzerland are subject to VAT at the standard rate of 8.1%. Goods for basic needs are subject to VAT at the reduced rate of 2.6%. Furthermore, services in connection with the provision of lodging (accommodation) are subject to VAT at the special rate of 3.8%.
Any person, regardless of legal form, objects, and intention to make a profit, is liable to VAT if that person carries on a business and is not exempt from the tax liability. A person carries on a business if the person independently performs a professional or commercial activity with the aim of sustainably earning income from supplies and acts externally under the person's own name. Taxable persons must register with the Swiss Federal Tax Administration of their own accord in writing within certain deadlines. A registered taxpayer generally is entitled (in the course of its business activity) to offset the amount of VAT charged by suppliers or paid on imports against the VAT payable.
The tax liability of foreign companies that supply goods to Switzerland is calculated on their worldwide turnover. Accordingly, if a company generates less than 100,000 Swiss francs (CHF) from the supply of goods to Switzerland, but at least CHF 100,000 in turnover globally, it is liable for VAT in Switzerland from its first Swiss franc of turnover.
Since 1 January 2019, foreign-based mail-order companies are liable for VAT in Switzerland if they generate at least CHF 100,000 annual turnover from small consignments to Switzerland. Such foreign-based mail-order companies are equated with the Swiss companies for VAT purposes.
The VAT rates are dependent on the goods sold or the services provided. Some supplies are exempt from tax without credit (e.g. hospital treatment, cultural services, insurance and reinsurance turnovers, specific turnovers in the field of money and capital transactions), and some supplies are fully exempt from tax (e.g. supply of goods that are transported or dispatched directly abroad / export). The difference relates to the fact that input VAT related to supplies exempt from tax without credit cannot be deducted, whereas supplies exempt from tax are fully eligible for input VAT deduction.
**Upcoming changes in VAT – 2025**
The Federal Council implemented the partial revision of the Value Added Tax Act (VAT Act) in August 2024, which was passed by Parliament in June 2023, and will enter into effect on 1 January 2025. At the same time, the partially revised Value Added Tax Ordinance (VAT Ordinance) will enter into effect as well. An exception is the portal obligation for the areas of net tax rate as well as flat tax rate method, group taxation, and deregistration as a taxable person, which will not be introduced until 1 January 2027. The partially revised VAT Ordinance includes both the implementing provisions for the amended VAT Act and independent adjustments, particularly concerning the net tax and flat tax rate method as well as portal obligations.
Additionally, the amendment to the VAT Ordinance at the level of net tax rates will also enter into effect on 1 January 2025. The review of net tax rates, conducted every seven years, has resulted in tax rate adjustments for approximately 15% of industries and activities.
**Introduction of a tax liability for online platforms**
One of the important elements of the partial revision of the VAT Act is the introduction of platform taxation. Starting 1 January 2025, a ‘deemed supplier concept’ will be introduced for sales of goods conducted through online platforms, thus, the obligation to register for VAT will shift from the supplier to the platform. From a VAT perspective, there are not just one but two deliveries: a first supply of goods is assumed to be between the seller and the platform operator. A second supply of goods is assumed to be between the platform operator and the Swiss customer; thus, the platform has to charge, declare, collect and remit the VAT on the supplies of goods to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration (SFTA).
Furthermore, an obligation to provide information is introduced for all online platforms (i.e. upon request by the SFTA, they must provide information on suppliers offering supplies via the platform to an extent that could trigger VAT liability. To enforce the new rules, the SFTA can take administrative measures if mail order platforms or companies have wrongfully failed to register or if they do not meet their billing and payment obligations. The SFTA can impose an import ban on deliveries from the company in question and as a last resort, order the destruction of the items. In addition, the SFTA can publish the names of the companies against which such measures are applied in order to protect customers.
**Simplifying VAT O****b****ligations for SME’s**
Currently, VAT can be settled quarterly, half-yearly or monthly. As of 1 January 2025 SMEs can also voluntarily settle VAT annually (i.e. submitting an annual VAT return), making the settlement process more efficient. This option is only available to VAT-liable persons who generate an annual turnover of a maximum of CHF 5,005,000. Annual settlement is linked to the obligation to pay instalments. The instalments are set by the SFTA, usually based on the tax claim from the last tax period.
**Fiscal representation (platforms)**
The SFTA has the option to waive the requirement for appointing a tax representative, if the fulfillment of procedural obligations is ensured in another way (according to the draft practice publications, this is option is only foreseen for online platforms). Platform operators can confirm in writing to the SFTA that they meet the conditions set by the SFTA. In the event of an inspection by the SFTA or the initiation of administrative or criminal proceedings by the SFTA, the platform operator must provide a domestic correspondence address.
It is not yet clear how often the SFTA will actually waive this requirement. Also, it is not yet clear how the SFTA will determine when a tax representative is still required (e.g. when registering a foreign entity for Swiss VAT).
**Reduction and Exemptions of VAT**
Newly exempt from VAT (without credit) as of 1 January 2025 are:
  * Travel services and related services resold by domestic and foreign travel agencies (foreign travel agencies will therefore not be subject to VAT in Switzerland when organizing travel to Switzerland);


  * Active participation in cultural events;


  * Services related to coordinated care in medical treatments (Managed Care);


  * Provision of infrastructure for attending physicians in out-patient facilities and day hospitals;


  * Care and household services provided by private home care organizations (Spitex);


  * Provision of staff by all non-profit organizations;


  * Offering of investment groups by investment foundations in accordance with the Swiss Federal Act on Occupational Old Age, Survivors', and Invalidity Pension Provision (OPA) and the management of investment groups in accordance with the OPA.


**Serial****Defaulters**
As of 1 January 2025, the SFTA can demand a security from individuals responsible for a legal entity (i.e., members of the board etc.) if there is a range of indications that their conduct could endanger taxes, interest and costs (procedural and enforcement costs). It aims at members of executive bodies who deliberately cause serial bankruptcies by robbing companies of their assets and, for example, transferring them to straw men who bring about liquidation. It must be clear from the totality of the circumstances that there is non-compliant behaviour that could give rise to criminal prosecution.
**Acquisition tax on transfer of emission rights**
The acquisition tax (reverse charge mechanism) will apply when trading/transferring emission rights, certificates for reducing emissions, proof of electricity sources, and similar documents as of 1 January 2025. Sales to domestic companies will be subject to acquisition tax, even if the seller is VAT-registered in Switzerland or Liechtenstein. This measure addresses VAT fraud risks in the transfer of such rights and certificates.
**S****ubsidies (legal fiction)**
According to the new provision of the VAT Act, a subsidy always exists if a public authority expressly describes the funds as a subsidy or other public-law contribution (legal fiction).
The VAT ordinance clarifies that public authorities can classify funds as subsidy or other public contribution until the finalization deadline for the tax period in which the payment was made.
## Customs duties
All goods arriving in Switzerland from abroad are generally subject to customs duty and import VAT. The customs duty is calculated on the gross weight of imported goods, where category-specific weight rates apply. Products like alcoholic drinks, tobacco products, food, and textiles are typical categories of higher duty rates. Furthermore, imported goods are subject to import VAT of generally 8.1%. A reduced rate of 2.6% applies on certain goods (e.g. food, non-alcoholic beverages, books, magazines, pharmaceutical products).
## Excise taxes
In Switzerland, various excise taxes are levied. To name a few, the following excise taxes are levied at the federal level:
  * VAT (_see above_)
  * Petroleum tax
  * Performance-related Heavy Vehicle Fee
  * National road tax (motorway tax sticker)
  * Beer excise tax/Tax on alcohol
  * Tobacco excise tax
  * Radio and television fee (corporate fee)


## Property taxes
With regard to the ownership and the transfer of real estate property in Switzerland, property taxes may apply. Depending on the location of the real estate property, ownership-related property taxes are levied at the cantonal and/or communal levels or do not exist at all.
In case of the sale of real estate property, real estate transfer tax and taxes on the capital gain may apply.
At the federal level, capital gain realised on the sale of real estate property is subject to ordinary CIT. At the cantonal and communal levels, depending on the canton concerned, capital gain realised is either subject to the ordinary CIT (dualistic method) or subject to a special real estate capital gain tax (monistic method).
It is at the discretion of the authority of the cantons to decide how real estate capital gains shall be taxed within their territory.
## Securities transfer tax
Swiss securities transfer tax (often known as 'securities turnover tax' or 'transfer stamp tax') is levied on the transfer of Swiss or foreign securities, in which Swiss security dealers participate as contracting parties or as intermediaries. The ordinary tax rate of Swiss securities transfer tax is 0.15% for securities issued by a tax resident of Switzerland and 0.3% for securities issued by a tax resident of a foreign country.
Swiss security dealers are defined as any person professionally engaged in buying or selling of securities for one's own account or for another person, including Swiss banks and other Swiss bank-like institutions. The definition also includes companies holding taxable securities whose book value exceeds CHF 10 million and remote members of a Swiss stock exchange.
Taxable securities include, but are not limited to, shares and bonds. Options and many other derivative instruments are not subject to Swiss securities transfer tax. However, the exercise of such financial instruments or derivatives may result in a taxable transfer of a security.
Various transactions are exempt from the Swiss securities transfer tax. Generally, no Swiss securities transfer tax is levied in the case of a merger or a reorganisation in which a Swiss security dealer is involved, and taxable securities (including participation) are transferred. Furthermore, the like-kind exchange of a participation by a Swiss security dealer is also exempt from the Swiss securities transfer tax. This is particularly important for holding companies, which may qualify as Swiss security dealers.
## Issuance stamp tax
Issuance stamp tax (often known as ‘capital duty’) on equity contributions to Swiss corporations is levied at the rate of 1% on the fair market value of the contribution. An exemption on the first CHF 1 million of equity in exchange for ownership rights applies, whether made in an initial or subsequent contribution.
A multitude of transactions qualify for an issuance stamp tax exemption. In particular, special tax provisions allow for most reorganisations to take place on a tax neutral basis. In addition, an existing non-resident company may generally redomicile to Switzerland without incurring Swiss issuance stamp tax. However, if the company was formed abroad and re-domiciled to Switzerland exclusively or mainly in order to avoid Swiss stamp taxes, issuance stamp tax may apply.
The issuance of Swiss bonds and money market instruments is not subject to Swiss issuance stamp tax.
In addition, the conversion of certain contingent convertible bonds (CoCos) into equity will also not trigger Swiss issuance stamp tax on the newly created equity. In more detail, this relief applies to CoCos according to the Swiss banking law only; other convertible bonds will still trigger Swiss issuance stamp tax if converted into equity.
## Capital tax
Corporate capital tax is only levied at the cantonal and the communal levels (not at the federal level). It is based on a corporation’s equity (i.e. the taxable equity corresponds to the sum of nominal capital, paid in surplus, retained earnings, other equity reserves, and, according to Swiss thin capitalisation rules, potentially existing deemed or hidden equity). The ordinary capital tax rates vary between 0.001% and 0.5%, depending on the company’s location of corporate residence in Switzerland. The Federal Act on the Harmonisation of Direct Taxation at Cantonal and Communal Levels allows the cantons to introduce an adaptation of the capital tax base for participations, patents, and loans to group companies.
The cantons are further allowed to foresee in their tax law that CIT is creditable against a corporation’s capital tax. By now, many cantons have introduced such a credit mechanism.
## Wage tax withholding (tax at source)
Employees meeting certain criteria (e.g. Swiss tax resident foreign nationals without a permanent residence permit, non-Swiss tax resident individuals) are subject to wage tax withholding. In such case, it is the employer’s obligation to withhold the appropriate wage tax on the employee’s gross salary. The wage taxes cover the employee’s federal, cantonal, and communal taxes as well as church tax (if applicable) (_see the section of Switzerland’s Individual tax summary_).
## Social security contributions
Employers, in general, are required to account for social security contributions on the salaries of their employees. If the employee is subject to the Swiss social security system, the following compulsory social security contributions are concerned (_see the_ _section of Switzerland’s Individual tax summary_):
  * Old-age, survivors’, and disability insurance (2024: 10.6%; divided equally between employer and employee).
  * Unemployment insurance (2.2% on income up to CHF 148,200; the employee’s share is one half).
  * Family compensation fund (0.3% to 3.5%; usually fully employer financed).
  * Occupational accident insurance (approximately 0.17%; fully employer financed).
  * Non-occupational accident insurance (generally 1% to 4%, depending on the field of activity and company’s insurance contract; borne by the employee in principle).
  * Occupational pension scheme (2nd pillar) (contributions depend on pension plan; the employee’s share is usually half of the total contribution, whereas the employer bears the other half).
