## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Foreign tax relief
As far as a DTT is applicable, irrecoverable foreign taxes on investment income (interest, dividends) are usually credited against and up to the respective actual Swiss tax on this income. Unused credits cannot be carried forward.
For all other income and assets, Switzerland applies the ‘exemption with progression’ method with regard to treaty countries to avoid double taxation. Therefore, Switzerland will not grant a credit for foreign taxes. The only exception applies with regard to the treaty rate on foreign source interest, royalties, and dividends.
Income and wealth taxes levied in countries with which Switzerland has not concluded a DTT can neither be credited against Swiss taxes nor is the underlying income or assets exempt from Swiss taxation. However, the taxpayer may apply for a pre-tax deduction in the amount of irrecoverable foreign taxes.
## Tax treaties
Switzerland has a rather exhaustive network of income tax treaties with currently over 100 jurisdictions.
Most treaties follow, in principle, the OECD model treaty. Double taxation is generally avoided by applying the ‘exemption with progression’ method, i.e. all income is considered in order to determine the applicable tax rate, but on the exempted income no taxes are actually levied. Irrecoverable foreign taxes on investment income (interest, dividends) are usually credited against and up to the respective actual Swiss tax on this income. Unused credits cannot be carried forward.
Income and wealth taxes levied in countries with which Switzerland has not concluded a DTT can neither be credited against Swiss taxes nor is the underlying income or assets exempt from Swiss taxation. However, the taxpayer may apply for a pre-tax deduction in the amount of irrecoverable foreign taxes.

### Social security agreements/totalisation agreements
Switzerland has a network of social security agreements with currently over 30 jurisdictions. Switzerland also has a bilateral agreement with the European Union, covering all 27 EU-countries and adapting more or less the rules already applicable within the European Union. A similar agreement exists with the EFTA-countries. Whether a social security agreement is applicable or not is often linked to the nationality of the individual. If applicable, assigned employees can usually remain (for a limited duration) in the home country social security system and are exempted from being subject to the host country system.
### Brexit – New Swiss-UK social security agreement
The new Swiss-UK social security treaty is provisionally applicable as of 1 November 2021, until final agreement of both parties. The new agreement intends to ensure the coordination between the social security systems of both states in the long run.
The new social security agreement largely grants insured persons equal treatment and facilitated access to social security benefits. It avoids over insurance and insurance gaps for persons who come into contact with the social security systems of both states. This also includes the temporary deployment of workers in the respective other state. The agreement largely corresponds to the coordination of social security systems in the new Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is based on the principles of EU coordination law, which Switzerland applies under the Free Movement of Persons Agreement (FMPA).
### Estate and gift tax conventions
Switzerland has concluded tax treaties on estate taxes with ten jurisdictions (Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States). All these treaties only cover estate/inheritance taxes, while gift taxes are not covered in any of the treaties.
### Tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs)
Switzerland has concluded a small number of separate TIEAs with countries with which Switzerland has not concluded an ordinary DTT. For other countries, these questions are treated within the specific DTTs. Based on recent international developments, Switzerland has renegotiated some of the DTTs with regard to these specific provisions.

## Individual - Significant developments

## Cross-border home office: Tax agreement between Switzerland and France
As of 1 January 2023, and renewed under the mutual agreement dated December 2024, the cross-border agreement between France and Switzerland authorises cross-border commuters to work up to 40% from home. There is a sustainable tax regime for all cantons: 40% of the working time can be performed from home per year without having an impact on the state of taxation of the employment income. This new rule is applicable to cross-border commuters who are otherwise commuting on a daily basis between their home and their employer in the other state, and not to extensive business travellers. Indeed, only ten business travel days are tolerated in this agreement and count toward the 40% threshold. The employer must provide to each cross-border commuter a certificate indicating the percentage of working time (or the number of days) realized from home. This certificate may be requested by the tax authorities.Automatic exchange of information in this regard is delayed and will likely beeffective as from 2027.  The social security affiliation position is not part of this agreement and is treated separately.
## Cross-border home office: Social security multilateral agreement
Switzerland and some European Union (EU) states signed a multilateral agreement that contains a derogation in the area of insurance subordination in order to facilitate teleworking after 30 June 2023 in the interest of employees and their employers. The agreement provides that persons who work in the state in which their employer’s registered office is located may perform up to 49.9% cross-border telework in the state of residence and remain affiliated in the state of the employer’s registered office for social security purposes. This exception is only applicable to situations involving two states that have signed the agreement. Switzerland, as well as Germany, Liechtenstein, Austria and Italy have signed it. This multilateral agreement is meant to cover teleworking of cross-border commuters and not multi-state workers who may work in other countries on top of the residency and employer’s country. These business travellers are covered by the existing 25% multi-state activity provisions. In both cases, an A1 must be applied for in order to validate the country of social security affiliation.
## Double Tax Treaty (DTT): German cross-border and managerial staff
According to art. 15 para. 4 of the DTT between Switzerland and Germany, the income of an individual who is resident in one contracting state but works as a director, managing director, or authorised signatory of a corporation that is resident in the other contracting state may be taxed in the second state, unless the activity is limited to tasks outside this state. If the second state does not tax the income, it may be taxed in the state of residency (so-called ‘Leitender Angestellter / Executive Clause’).
The definition of individuals falling under this clause has been the basis for disputes between the national tax authorities of the two countries. In a consultation agreement dated 18 September 2008, the two countries agreed on a more restrictive interpretation, stating that the clause should only apply to employees with procura resp. signatory rights for the company or if the individuals function as listed in art. 15 para. 4 is stated in the commercial register.
In contrast, the new consultation agreement dated 6 April 2023 allows a broader interpretation of the clause. It now applies to individuals who are listed in the commercial register with individual or collective signatory rights without designation of the function. It also applies to individuals who are not listed in the commercial register at all but, from a civil law perspective, occupy a position within a corporation that is comparable to the functions mentioned in art. 15 para. 4 and representation authority, taking into account the overall circumstances of the individual case. The management function and representation authority must be equivalent to at least a procura. This may be proven with a respective power of attorney to represent the company, e.g. through a circulation resolution, internal signatory regulations, or company statutes.
When analysing the overall circumstance of the individual, the following factors should be considered:
  * Individual falls into one of the top salary grades within the company.
  * Profit-sharing agreements and royalty gains.
  * Granting of special benefits-in-kind or on-cash benefits.
  * Reporting lines and number of subordinated employees.
  * Independent hire and fire powers.
  * Promotion/advancement associated with a change or expansion of the scope of activities.
  * Exempt from legal limitation of maximum working hours.


The new consultation agreement is to be applied to all open cases and its duration is limited until 31 December 2025, unless the competent authorities agree on a continuation of the agreement.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
All tax-resident individuals are taxed on their worldwide income and wealth. Non-tax-resident individuals are only taxed on Swiss sources of income and wealth.
Income taxes are levied at three different levels: at the federal level (which is the same all over Switzerland), at the cantonal level (which is the same within a certain canton and is based on the canton's own tax law and tax rates), and at the municipal level (municipalities follow the cantonal tax law, but are entitled to set their own communal tax rate within certain parameters). Income tax rates are progressive at the federal level and in most of the cantons. Some cantons have recently introduced flat rate taxation.
All income is taxed on the basis of the same tax return with generally the same tax rate (i.e. all income sources are added together), and from such total income all applicable deductions are subtracted. This results in an applicable tax rate that is levied on all taxable income. Based on applicable DTTs, the actual taxable income in Switzerland may differ from the tax rate determining income. Furthermore, dividend income from substantial participations may be taxed at a lower tax rate based on domestic federal and cantonal law.

#### V - Calculation of effective taxes
For Zurich cantonal taxes, the above rates have to be multiplied with 0.98. For the additional municipal taxes, the above rate has to be multiplied by the respective municipal tax factor, which varies between 0.72 and 1.30 (City of Zurich: 1.19). For church tax the basic tax above is multiplied by the church tax factor, which is between 0.06 and 0.17.
### Geneva cantonal tax (basic tax) 
The Geneva tax table is quite complex as it does not apply a tax bracket system. The tax rates are increasing continuously in small increments with each increase in income. The table below therefore only provides a general overview (for 2023).
**Taxable income (CHF)** | **Tax Rate (%)**  
---|---  
**From** | **To**  
0 | 18,479 | 0.00  
18,480 | 22,264 | 8.00  
22,265 | 24,491 | 9.00  
24,492 | 26,717 | 10.00  
26,718 | 28,943 | 11.00  
28,944 | 34,509 | 12.00  
34,510 | 38,962 | 13.00  
38,963 | 43,416 | 14.00  
43,417 | 47,868 | 14.50  
47,869 | 76,811 | 15.00  
76,812 | 125,793 | 15.50  
125,794 | 169,208 | 16.00  
169,209 | 191,473 | 16.50  
191,474 | 273,850 | 17.00  
273,851 | 291,661 | 17.50  
291,662 | 410,775 | 18.00  
410,776 | 643,435 | 18.50  
More than 643,436 | 19.00  
The tax rate applicable to a married couple or individuals in a Swiss registered partnership is the rate applicable to 50% of their combined income (so-called 'splitting'). The tax rate applicable to single, widowed, divorced, or separated individuals living with a dependant (child or adult) is the rate applicable to 50% of the income.
The above tax rates are basically applicable to taxpayers filing a tax return. Effective cantonal income and wealth tax is determined by multiplying the basic tax by the multiplier applicable for the tax (calendar) year in question, and then by adding the supplementary tax on wealth.
Developments in individual taxation in Geneva – single/divorced/separated parents:
starting 2024, single, divorced or separated parents will each benefit from a partial splitting (reduction of the tax rate – until then integral splitting attributed only to one parent) if they are both providing support with the other parent for the care, maintenance and expenses for their children. Several conditions will apply.
## Local income taxes 
### Geneva communal tax 
Each commune of the canton of Geneva determines the multiplier applied on the cantonal tax rate and hence its communal tax rate autonomously depending on its financial needs. As result, the communal taxes can vary significantly. The communal taxes are, as mentioned above, a percentage of the cantonal taxes, and are levied in conjunction with the cantonal taxes. For example, the effective communal tax of the city of Geneva is 45.5% of basic cantonal tax. The highest communal tax rate is 51% of the basic cantonal tax and is levied in the communes of Chancy and Avully. On the contrary, the lowest communal tax rate is applicable in the communes of Genthod (25%), Cologny (27%), and Collonge-Bellerive or Vandoeuvres (both 29%).
## Withholding requirements for sales of property, dividends, interest and royalties
In general, interest and dividend income derived from Swiss sources is subject to a 35% withholding tax (WHT), which tax has to be withheld from the paying party (e.g. bank or Swiss company) and is directly deducted from the gross amount paid to the recipient. Based on the facts and circumstances, this tax may be credited towards the overall income tax liability in Switzerland or may be refunded. 
On payments received for loans secured by a property located in Switzerland (without repayment amounts, e.g. mainly mortgage interest) a tax at source may be due if the creditor (individual or legal entity) is domiciled abroad. Tax at source has to be withheld by the payer of the interest. Applicable DTTs may cap or abolish the applicable cantonal tax rates.


# Switzerland
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year in Switzerland is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
The respective tax return has to be filed by 31 March of the following year (a few cantons have different deadlines) in the canton where the taxpayer has been resident at the end of the respective tax period. Filing extensions are usually granted until September/November upon request. Married couples mandatory file a joint Swiss tax return and are assessed together.
### Resident foreign nationals
Resident foreign nationals, who are taxed through the wage withholding system, can only (and have to) file a tax return if their gross employment income exceeds CHF 120,000 per year. If the threshold is not exceeded, there may still be a requirement to file a supplementary tax return if the individual has other reportable income or wealth. For this, the cantons have set different _de minimis_ amounts.
If the taxpayers want to apply for such supplementary tax return, they must submit a corresponding application to the competent cantonal tax administration by March 31 of the tax year following the due date of the benefit.
When submitting a retrospective ordinary assessment, utmost caution is required, as this may also result in a worse position. An application for a retrospective ordinary assessment for persons resident in Switzerland also has a legally binding effect for all future years. In other words, this person will always be subject to a retrospective ordinary assessment in the future. Thus, the voluntary application for a subsequent ordinary assessment requires a careful analysis.
Non-resident individuals (Swiss and foreign nationals) subject to wage withholding taxes usually cannot file a tax return for their employment income. Individuals who cannot file a tax return may claim a correction of the withheld wage taxes in order to claim certain additional deductions or to correct a wrongly used tariff. Such wage tax corrections have to be filed by 31 March of the following year with no filing extension available.
If a non-resident individual owns property in Switzerland, they have to file a special tax return in the canton where the property is located.
### Note recent changes for non-resident individuals
As of 1 January 2021, the construct of 'quasi-residency' has been officially introduced throughout Switzerland.
In order to meet the demand for equal tax treatment of Swiss and foreign nationals, a completely new construct was introduced in the Federal Law on Direct Federal Tax (DBG) as well as in the new Withholding Tax Ordinance (QStV): Quasi-residence. It applies to persons liable to withholding tax who are tax resident abroad. These employees, who meet the requirements for quasi-residency, have the right to submit an application for subsequent ordinary assessment to the competent cantonal tax administration for each year until 31 March of the tax year following the due date of the benefit.
The requirements for a subsequent ordinary assessment in the case of quasi-residence are met if at least 90% of the worldwide gross family income is taxable in Switzerland in the corresponding tax year. In principle, this request can be made every year.
This construct requires increased attention and attentiveness since the spouse living in a legally and actually inseparable marriage is also added for the calculation of the worldwide income of the withholding taxpayer or for the 90% rule.
## Payment of tax
Resident individuals, who are not subject to wage withholding taxes, are paying their taxes through filing a tax return. Cantonal and municipal taxes are usually collected on a provisional basis throughout the respective tax year. Cantonal rules differ. Federal taxes are paid on a provisional basis by 31 March of the year following the respective tax year. Final tax payments or tax refunds are due once the tax return has been finally assessed by the authorities. If there is a balance in favour of the tax authorities (i.e. the final tax liability minus any pre-payments), interest is usually levied between a certain due date and the date of the assessment as compensation for being able to use these monies in this period for private investments. Payment due date after having received the final tax assessment and bill is usually 30 days. After this, late payment interest is normally levied.
Foreign nationals who are resident in Switzerland (except those having a permanent residence permit or are married to a Swiss spouse or a spouse holding a permanent residence permit) are subject to wage tax withholdings on a monthly basis. The wage taxes cover federal, cantonal, and municipal taxes, and, if applicable, church taxes. If the employee is obligated to file a Swiss tax return, the final tax liability is assessed on the basis of the tax return and the already withheld wage taxes will be credited against this.
Non-resident taxpayers, regardless of their nationality, usually pay their taxes via wage withholding, which is normally the final tax liability, i.e. there are no further tax payments or refunds. Exceptions apply to non-resident owner of Swiss real estate, as they have to file a tax return and pay the respective taxes based on this return.
## Tax audit process
Every tax return filed goes through a formal tax assessment process with the tax authorities in charge. In the course of the tax assessment process, the tax authorities may ask for additional information and statements. In the end a formal tax assessment is issued, in which the taxable factors, i.e. taxable and tax rate determining income and assets are noted. If no legal action is taken, the tax assessment comes into legal force, and based on this final tax bills are issued.
## Statute of limitations
The right to assess a filed tax return by the authorities in general lapses five years after the tax period in question has elapsed. The tax authorities can open a special tax procedure up to ten years after the tax period has elapsed, if they identify that a previously assessed tax return has been faulty (or that no assessment was issued at all) if new facts or evidence is brought forward that was previously not known to the tax authorities.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Each and every income tax return is reviewed and assessed by the tax authorities. Currently, the tax authorities are especially looking into expatriate status and the respective income/deductions declared in the tax return.
The authorities have begun to compare financial information received under the program for automatic exchange of information with the declarations in the tax return. They are requesting clarification from individuals where they spot inconsistencies.


# Switzerland
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
All deductions are subtracted from the total income as per the tax return. If the individual is performing a self-employed activity and having related business assets, special deductions in relation to this may be applicable; however, as this is rather in the realm of corporate tax, no further information will be provided in this section.
Based on a court decision, guidance has been published regarding the treatment of non-resident employees when it comes to claiming deductions. The guidance allows for more deductions for non-resident individuals who earn the majority of their income (at least 90% of the worldwide family gross income) in Switzerland and which would then be considered as taxable in Switzerland. Currently, the new favourable tax treatment is limited to European Union (EU)/European Free Trade Association (EFTA) individuals who reside in an EU or EFTA country.
## Employment expenses
An employee’s social security contributions are deductible from gross employment income. Contributions to foreign social security systems may be deductible as well. Usually, the employer’s share of the social security contributions is not seen as taxable income and is thus tax-free for the individual.
Tax resident individuals are entitled to deduct several business-related expenses, such as actual commuting costs (capped for federal tax purposes and in most cantons), additional costs for meals at place of work (lump-sum), general business-related expenses (actual or lump-sum), and costs related to further education (actual or lump-sum). If both spouses are performing a gainful activity, double earner deductions may be applicable as well. As cantonal law regulates these deductions at the cantonal level, there are substantial differences per canton regarding the type of deductions as well as the maximum amounts. Such deductions can also be claimed at federal level in accordance with the federal tax law.
Tax-residents and non-tax-residents may claim expatriate tax deductions.
## Personal deductions
Several other deductions can be claimed in the tax return as listed below. Cantonal law may allow for further deductions. Conditions and limitations are defined by federal law as well as per canton and may therefore vary substantially.
### Alimony
Alimony and subsistence payments paid to minor children are tax deductible for the payer and taxable for the recipient for federal tax purposes and in many cantons. Subsistence payments paid to children of age (18+) are no longer deductible but may allow for a lump-sum child deduction under certain circumstances.
### Charitable contributions
A deduction (actual) for donations made to a qualifying Swiss based charity organisation can be claimed on the tax return. On the federal level, and in many cantons, the deduction is capped with a certain ratio of the taxable income.
### Day-care expenses
Depending on the circumstances, actual childcare costs up to a capped amount may be claimed at federal level and in many cantons.
### Life insurance premiums
Generally, actual insurance premiums are not deductible; however, cantons may provide a standard deduction for insurance premiums (lump-sum, capped) based on the status of the taxpayer (i.e. married, single, or number of children).
### Mortgage deduction
A deduction for interest payments for mortgages and other loans/debts may also be claimed on the tax return. Amortisation payments are not deductible. Certain caps regarding the deductible interest payments (in relation to investment income) are applicable.
### Social security and pension schemes
Social security contributions of the employee, if not already deducted from the gross employment income, can be claimed as a deduction. Payments made to recognised pension schemes (actual) and other recognised retirement schemes (actual, capped). If made to non-Swiss schemes, deductibility needs to be assessed.
Switzerland has a very attractive pension system, allowing employees to make additional contributions for missing years or for increases in salary. Such additional contributions are fully deductible in the tax return and therefore can result in substantial tax savings. While this principle is untouched, a court decision has ruled that additional contributions made less than three years before a lump-sum withdrawal (e.g. retirement) of pension funds can no longer be deducted for tax purposes. Based on this court decision, the Swiss Tax Conference (a body formed by the cantonal tax administrations) has issued a new guidance in this regard, which should be thoroughly considered before making substantial voluntary contributions into Swiss pension schemes. Potential taxes at the time of a pay-out (annuity or lump-sum) should also be considered, especially if the potential pay-out happens while resident in another country.
### Real estate costs
A deduction can be claimed on the tax return for maintenance costs for self-owned real estate (actual or lump-sum).
### Bank charges
A deduction can be claimed on the tax return for qualified bank charges (actual; or lump-sum, capped).
### Medical expenses
A deduction can be claimed on the tax return for un-reimbursed medical expenses (actual, exceeding threshold).
## Personal allowances (for 2024)
Certain personal allowances may be provided based on the individual's personal circumstances (married, single, number of children, or age). If the taxpayer provides financial support for individuals who are unable to work or who do not work full-time (with the exception of a spouse and their own children), an additional deduction may be granted if all conditions specified by the canton are met.

## Business deductions
### Accrued expenses
In general, accrued costs/debts (e.g. a pending tax bill that has not yet been formally issued by the tax authorities) can only be considered for wealth tax purposes, but not for income tax purposes.
For self-employed individuals, limited possibilities for deducting accrued costs from the taxable income may exist depending on the accounting standard applied for their mandatory accounting.
### Contingent liabilities
Self-employed individuals may be able to claim this as an accrual against their taxable income. The likelihood of occurrence of the contingent liability will determine whether this will be accepted or not. Otherwise, contingent liabilities could only be considered for wealth tax purposes.
### Depreciation of fixed assets/amortisation of intangibles
Self-employed individuals may be able to claim depreciation expenses in relation to their business assets as a deduction against their taxable income. Otherwise, depreciation of fixed assets is usually only possible for cars as part of the declarable assets for wealth tax purposes. Depreciation expenses that do not relate to qualifying business assets of self-employed individuals cannot be set off against taxable income.
The following deductions are not specifically considered by Swiss tax law and are thus, in general, not tax deductible:
  * Bad debt.
  * Fines and penalties.
  * Consideration on sale of business such as personal goodwill.


## Losses
There is no carry forward of losses to future tax years if, for example, the total deductions are higher than the total income. Capital losses from movable assets are not deductible, as likewise capital gains from movable assets are tax free.
## Related party transactions/payments to foreign related parties
Payments made to e.g. family members or other persons are in general not deductible from the taxable income. Under certain circumstances (recipient was in financial need of the payment, federal and/or cantonal thresholds are met) a capped deduction may be available. Depending on the tax domicile of the payer/donor and the recipient/donation recipient and the degree of relationship between these two parties, gift taxes could be triggered.

## Treatment of business entities
Principal forms of doing business:The usual form of doing business is setting up an AG/SA (a corporation) or a GmbH/Sarl (a limited liability company or LLC), even for smaller businesses. Those are treated as non-transparent from a tax perspective, whilst partnerships are treated as transparent.
Asset protection via family limited partnerships: These are not common in Switzerland.
Foreign trusts: They are usually treated as transparent for either the settler or the beneficiary depending on the type and conditions of the trust. Only rarely will the tax authorities consider a trust as an independent asset.
Aircraft: No special provisions exist in Switzerland for the treatment of aircraft.
## Residence and work permits
Individuals must obtain a residence and work permit for the canton in which they intend to stay before entering Switzerland. Employees from EU member states only require a residence permit. A residence permit is issued if the individual has a Swiss employment contract and is subject to quotas and control of wage and work conditions. A new provision in the Swiss constitution foresees a limitation of migration into Switzerland, which may result in an annual maximum quota of residence/work permits also for EU citizens.
For employees with a non-Swiss employment contract, or for non-EU/EFTA states (including the United Kingdom), evidence must be provided by the employer of a search for a candidate with the required classification. These permits are subject to quotas and are bound to the canton that grants them.
The State Secretary of Economy has issued a directive regarding body leasing within a group of companies. Therein, it is stated that also within a group of companies the same restriction applies with regard to body leasing as between unrelated third parties (i.e. permits may be required and body leasing from abroad into Switzerland is generally not allowed). It may affect common secondments or transfers from abroad into Switzerland. Therefore, it may affect the staffing of Swiss-based projects with foreign group employees. The directive may have an impact on the process of obtaining a work permit.

# Switzerland
## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Employment income
All gross remuneration from employment, whether in cash or in kind, is subject to taxation at the time the employee has received the remuneration or has received an irrevocable right to the remuneration. It is irrelevant whether the remuneration results from a Swiss or foreign employment or whether the remuneration is paid to a Swiss bank account or not.
Payments made to an employee to compensate for business related expenses are not taxable as long as these payments are not considered as covering cost of living expenses for the employee or persons related to the employee.
## Assignment related income
Generally, income exclusively relating to an assignment of an employee to Switzerland is subject to taxation. However, various cantonal and federal regulations exempt certain types of income from taxation if they can be considered special expenses for the expatriate. These exceptions are strictly limited. Depending on how the benefits are delivered and on the individual circumstances, such expatriate benefits may either be tax-free income or allow the expatriate to claim a special deduction in the tax return.
  * Relocation costs: Actual moving costs to and back home from Switzerland (e.g. transportation of household goods) as well as travel expenses for expatriates and their families at the beginning and at the end of the assignment.
  * Housing: Reasonable housing costs in Switzerland if the expatriate maintains the principal residence in the home country during the assignment (not rented out). Limitations apply, with cantonal differences.
  * School fees: Actual tuition fees for private/international schools if the public schools cannot provide adequate education to the children of expatriates, usually due to the difference in languages.
  * Commuting costs: Actual costs of the expatriate’s home leave if the family of the expatriate remains in the home country.


Only expatriates are entitled to these deductions. The law defines an expatriate as a managerial employee or a specialist temporarily seconded to Switzerland for a period of up to five years, i.e. the (assignment) contract has to be limited in time for a maximum of five years. An employee with a local contract may also be considered an expatriate if the duration of the contract is limited for a period of up to five years maximum and the foreign employer guarantees re-employment afterwards. Foreign and Swiss employer must be of the same group of companies. Other foreign local hires are usually not considered expatriates and cannot claim these special deductions.
## Equity compensation
Income from stock options that were acquired privately is generally exempted from income taxation. However, if stock options, or other equity participation instruments, were acquired through employment, income derived from such equity participation instruments is qualified as employment income and subject to income taxation.
There is a Swiss law on the taxation of equity-based compensation, which is in force since 1 January 2013. Based on this law, taxation of stock options generally occurs at exercise, and taxation of restricted stock units (RSUs) at vesting. In international cases (move of tax residency to Switzerland or leave from Switzerland during the lifetime of an equity compensation instrument), a _pro rata temporis_ taxation, based on the Swiss portion of the vesting period, generally applies. It should be noted that there are some details and specialties regarding the taxation rules, which generally require detailed analysis of the specific terms and conditions of the instruments.
## Business income
If an individual is performing a self-employed activity, then basically the net profit, e.g. the gross revenue minus all business-related expenses, is taxable.
## Capital gains
Private capital gains on movable assets (e.g. shares) are normally tax-exempt throughout Switzerland as long as an individual does not qualify as being a professional securities dealer.
Capital gains realised upon selling Swiss non-movable assets, i.e. real estate, is however subject to a cantonal capital gains tax. The tax rate varies per canton and is usually progressive depending on the gain itself. Often surcharges apply for short holding periods (less than two to three years) and reductions are granted for longer holding periods (more than five years).
## Dividend income
Dividend income derived from investments is taxed at the ordinary rates together with the other income. In general, dividends from Swiss sources are subject to a 35% WHT that can be credited against the Swiss income tax liability if such dividend income is declared correctly and in full.
## Interest income
Interest income derived from investments is taxed at the ordinary rates together with the other income. In general, certain interest from Swiss sources (e.g. Swiss bank accounts) is subject to a 35% WHT. Swiss WHT can generally be credited against the Swiss income tax liability if such interest income is declared correctly and in full.
## Rental income
Rental income derived from investments is taxed at the ordinary rates together with the other income.
Income from real estate located in Switzerland is subject to tax at the ordinary rates. The owner of self-used real estate is deemed to generate income (i.e. deemed rental income). Foreign rental income is exempted with progression in Switzerland. Therefore, the actual or deemed rental income, and any maintenance or repair costs and respective mortgage interest, must be declared on the Swiss tax return to determine the applicable tax rate.
## Intellectual property
Royalties are also subject to income taxation in Switzerland.
## Exempt income
In principle, all income is subject to income taxation. For some specific circumstances, federal and cantonal tax law specifically states that no income tax is due, for example:
  * Assets received due to inheritance, gifted assets, or if received through settlement of matrimonial property (but possibly subject to gift or inheritance tax).
  * Compensation for personal suffering.
  * Some private or governmental social welfare payments.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
All tax-resident individuals are taxed on their worldwide income and wealth. An individual is deemed to be a tax-resident under Swiss domestic tax law, if: 
  * the individual has the intention to permanently establish his/her usual abode in Switzerland, which is usually where the individual has his/her centre of vital interest, and is registered with the municipal authorities, or if
  * the individual stays in Switzerland with the intention to exercise gainful activities for a consecutive period (ignoring short absences) of at least 30 days, or if
  * the individual stays in Switzerland with no intention to exercise gainful activities for a consecutive period (ignoring short absences) of at least 90 days. 


Non-tax-resident individuals are only taxed on Swiss sources of income and wealth, such as:
  * employment income derived by physically working in Switzerland
  * remunerations received as a member of the Board of Directors or the Management Board of a Swiss company
  * dividends received from a Swiss company
  * interest on Swiss bank accounts
  * real estate in Switzerland
  * pensions and similar income
  * income allocated to a fixed place of business in Switzerland. 


These rules apply with respect to federal taxes as well as cantonal taxes; they do not require a minimum presence in Switzerland.

## Social security contributions
If an individual is subject to the Swiss social security, the following social security contributions are payable (as of 1 January 2024):
Insurance  | Contribution rate | Cap (CHF)  
---|---|---  
Employer (%) | Employee (%)  
Old age, survivors’ and disability insurance | 5.3 | 5.3 | No cap  
Unemployment Insurance | 1.1 | 1.1 | 148,200  
Family Compensation Fund | 1-3 | 0 | No cap  
Occupational accident insurance | 0.17 to 3 | 0 | 148,200  
Non-occupational accident insurance | 0 | 1 to 4 | 148,200  
Occupational pension scheme | Depending on pension plan, employer specific | Depending on pension plan, employer specific  
Medical insurance | Depending on coverage, private insurance  
All social security taxes (except for the medical insurance) are the employer’s responsibility. The employer must withhold and remit the total deduction and deducts the employee’s share from his gross pay. If the individual is self-employed, they basically have to cover the employer’s and the employee’s share, however different contribution rates may be applicable.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
As a matter of principle, proceeds of sales made and services provided in Switzerland are subject to VAT at the standard rate of 8.1%. Goods for basic needs are subject to VAT at the reduced rate of 2.6%. Furthermore, services in connection with the provision of lodging are subject to VAT at the special rate of 3.8%. A registered taxpayer generally is entitled to offset the amount of VAT charged by suppliers or paid on imports against the VAT payable.
## Net wealth tax 
All cantons levy a net wealth tax based on the balance of the worldwide gross assets minus debts. Some cantons may allow additional social deductions. Reportable assets are as follows:
  * Bank account balances, bonds, shares, funds and other equities.
  * Life insurances with a surrender value.
  * Cars, boats, airplanes, etc.
  * Properties/real estate.
  * Other valuable assets, e.g. paintings, art collections, jewellery, etc. 


The fair market value of the assets is subject to taxation; consequently, some assets are subject to depreciation, which is considered for wealth tax purposes but cannot be claimed as a deduction for income tax purposes. Leased assets are not considered for wealth taxation. Movable assets are deemed to be located in Switzerland and therefore subject to wealth taxation in Switzerland. Properties abroad are only considered for tax rate determining purposes but are exempted from actual taxation in Switzerland. 
Worldwide debts (e.g. mortgages or other loans) are deductible with no applicable cap. If assets are located abroad, the total debts are subject to an international allocation in accordance with the allocation of the total gross assets. 
Household goods are not subject to wealth taxation.

For Zurich cantonal taxes, the above rates can be applied directly. For the additional municipal taxes, the above rate has to be multiplied by the respective municipal tax factor, which varies between 0.72 and 1.30 (City of Zurich: 1.19). For church tax the basic tax above is multiplied by the church tax factor, which is between 0.06 and 0.17.
### Geneva
On 18 June 2023, the Geneva citizens voted in favour of the modification of the law on real estate fiscal valuation, which will not only impact owners of real estate properties in the canton, but all Geneva domiciled persons liable to wealth tax. While the law was meant to enter into force in 2024, an appeal has been filed against this law. The modifications to the law would introduce new principles for the fiscal valuation of some real estate properties in the canton, generally leading to an increase in wealth tax for real estate owners. In parallel, the special property tax rate for principal residences would decrease from 0.1% to 0.02%, and the global wealth tax rate would generally decrease in the canton for all taxpayers. Additionally, the sale of real estate properties following a holding period longer than 25 years would no longer be exempt from real estate capital gain tax (minimum taxation of 2% is introduced). By dint of a referendum approved by the people in November 2024, a reduction in taxation of between 11.4% and 5.3% (depending on taxable income) will occur from 1st January 2025.
#### I - Wealth tax
A deduction of CHF 82,200 per adult and CHF 41,100 per child is made from the individual’s net wealth. The net wealth is divided into bands and is taxed as follows for 2025:

The above tax rates are basically applicable to taxpayers filing a tax return. Effective cantonal income and wealth tax is determined by multiplying the basic tax by the multiplier applicable for the tax (calendar) year in question, and then by adding the supplementary tax on wealth. 
## Inheritance and gift taxes
With the exception of two cantons (i.e. Schwyz and Obwalden), all cantons levy inheritance and/or gift taxes if the deceased or donor had been resident of the respective canton, or if real estate located in the canton is transferred. In all cantons, spouses are exempt from inheritance and gift taxes, and most cantons also exempt direct descendants. The tax rate is progressive and is in most cases multiplied by a factor depending on the relationship between the deceased and the recipient. Switzerland has concluded a small number of tax treaties concerning inheritance taxes, but gift taxes are not covered by any tax treaty.
## Property taxes
Some cantons levy a tax just on the holding of real estate. The tax rates and how this tax is calculated vary from canton to canton. 
## Excise taxes, turnover taxes, registration taxes, custom duties 
At the federal level, the import of goods will be subject to custom duties based on weight and/or value and depending on the type of good as well as its origin.
In addition, the cantons and municipalities levy a number of excise taxes, such as road taxes, registration taxes, fire brigade taxes etc. These are usually smaller amounts and vary often by municipality.
## Other non-income taxes 
### Stamp taxes
Stamp duties are levied on certain transactions i.e. on the issue of Swiss securities, on security transactions in Switzerland, and on certain insurance (mainly liability and household insurance). The stamp taxes are levied by the broker or the insurance company and are in the end paid by the client. Rates are 0.15% for Swiss security transaction, 0.30% for foreign security transactions and normally 5% for insurance.
### Transfer taxes
The transfer of real estate is taxed in most cantons. This tax is levied separately from a possible capital gains tax on the sale of the real estate. There is no corresponding tax at the federal level.
### Treatment of foreign owned real estate 
Real estate located abroad needs to be included in the Swiss tax return for tax rate determining purposes, but any income out of it (actual or deemed rental income) will not actually be taxed in Switzerland.
### Church tax
Almost all cantons levy a church tax for registered members of one of the respective official religious affiliations. The determination of the religious affiliation is part of registration process with the municipal authorities. Individuals without religious denomination or members of other than the official Swiss churches (e.g. Muslims, Jews, Anglo-Saxon church members) are not subject to cantonal church tax.
