# El Salvador - Corporate Tax Overview

## Corporate - Income Determination

### Inventory Valuation
For tax purposes, taxpayers are authorized to use any one of the following inventory methods, provided they are technically appropriate for the particular business, consistently applied, and easily audited. Other than the methods enumerated above, taxpayers are not permitted to use other methods for valuing their inventories except with prior authorization of the tax office, provided that in the latter’s judgment the method in question contains clear determination and bona fide elements available to the office. Once an inventory valuation method is adopted, the taxpayer may not change it without the tax office’s prior authorization.

### Capital Gains
Capital gains are taxed at a flat rate of 10% of net profits, except when gains are realized within 12 months following the purchase date, in which case they are taxed as ordinary income. Capital gains for securities are also subject to capital gains tax; however, the 12-months rule described above does not apply for securities.

### Dividend Income
Cash profits or dividends remitted or credited to shareholders are subject to a 5% WHT (25% if paid to a tax haven as considered by the Salvadoran tax administration).

### Interest Income
Interest income is taxable in El Salvador when the entity paying the interest is resident in El Salvador and when the capital is invested in the country.

### Partnership Income
Partnership income is taxable if it is Salvadorian-source income; nevertheless, no specific provisions exist in El Salvador regarding partnership income.

### Rent/Royalties Income
Rent and royalties income is taxable if it is Salvadorian-source income; nevertheless, no specific provisions exist in El Salvador regarding rent and royalties income.

### Condoned Debts
Condoned debts are considered taxable income and must be included as part of the income generated in that fiscal period.

### Foreign Income
Under the territoriality source of income principle, extraterritorial income is not taxable in El Salvador. In this case, interest arising from loans granted to a resident of El Salvador is considered as taxable income, and the person or entity making the payment should withhold 10% of the interest. If financial services are rendered between related parties, the withholding must be at 20%.

## Corporate - Taxes on Corporate Income

The corporate income tax (CIT) rate is 30%, and this rate is applicable on the total amount of the company’s revenues. There is a reduced CIT rate of 25% for companies that obtain taxable income equal to or less than 150,000 United States dollars (USD) in the fiscal year.

CIT is based on the principle of territoriality, and, by general rule, taxes are paid on goods located, activities realized, and capital invested in El Salvador as well as on services rendered or utilized in the country. Nevertheless, there is a special rule regarding securities and financial instruments, since such income is considered to be obtained in El Salvador if the issuing entity is domiciled in El Salvador.

Taxable income is equal to gross income net of costs and expenses considered necessary for generating and maintaining the related source of income and other deductions allowed by law. Gross income is comprised of income or profits collected or accrued, either in cash or in kind, from any sources in El Salvador.

Corporations are required to follow the accrual method of accounting.

### Income Tax Advance Payment
A 1.75% tax is applied to gross revenues accrued. This tax is paid monthly as an advance payment that is applied against the CIT at the end of the year.

### Local Income Taxes
There is a municipal tax related to taxpayers' income. This tax depends on the location of the operations where the taxpayer performs its activity.

## Corporate - Withholding Taxes

In September 2023, the Tax Administration issued guideline MH.UVI.DGII/006.005/2023 by which it is updating previous criteria regarding the consideration of a jurisdiction as a preferential tax regime or a low or no-tax jurisdiction by indicating that any jurisdiction not specifically named in the guide that grants an exemption on income tax (or other taxes with a similar or identical nature) or has such a tax that is inferior by more than 80% of the income tax that would be due in El Salvador will be considered a preferential tax regime or a low or no-tax jurisdiction, as well as holding companies, principal companies, auxiliary or mixed companies, service companies, finance branches, family wealth management companies, headquarters of multinational companies (SEM for its acronym in Spanish), international trust, companies with which international financial lease contracts are celebrated, and international business corporations, among others.

Payments to resident individuals with respect to services rendered, other than under a labor relationship, are subject to a 10% WHT.

Income received from securities listed on the Salvadoran stock exchange by entities not resident in El Salvador is subject to a reduced WHT rate of 3%.

The acquisition of intangible goods among resident entities in the country is subject to a 5% WHT.

Certain transactions are subject to a reduced WHT rate of 5%, such as the following:
