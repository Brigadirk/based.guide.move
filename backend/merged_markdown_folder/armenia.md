## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 27 December 2024
Taxable profits are defined as a positive difference between a taxpayer’s gross income and deductible expenses. Gross income encompasses all revenues received by a taxpayer from all economic activities, unless the revenues are expressly exempt from inclusion under the law. Deductible expenses encompass activities that result in a decrease in assets or increase in liabilities attributable to the activities carried out by an organisation, an individual entrepreneur, or a notary, which, in turn, results in a reduction in the equity of the organisation or the net assets of the sole proprietor or notary.
## Inventory valuation
Inventories are stated at their cost. First in first out (FIFO) or average cost methods of valuation are generally used for tax purposes.
The assets’ revaluation is not considered for CIT purposes, unless the revaluation of certain assets is prescribed under the law.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are included in taxable income. Non-residents are taxable on the realised capital gains from the increase of the value of the assets located in Armenia.
Capital gains, excluding those from disposal of securities, are taxed at a rate of 10%. If securities are disposed of after being held for more than two years, they are not subject to taxation. However, if securities are disposed of within two years of acquisition, the following applies: those securities held in other organisations are taxed at 18%, while securities not held in other organisations are subject to a 0% withholding tax (WHT).
## Dividend income
The dividend income should be considered received on the day of the decision by the shareholders to distribute dividends.
## Interest income
Interest income attracts normal CIT treatment.
## Royalty income
Royalty income attracts normal CIT treatment.
## Foreign income
Resident entities are liable to Armenian tax on their worldwide income. Foreign taxes should be available for credit against Armenian tax liabilities, up to the amount of Armenian tax payable on the foreign income.
There are no provisions in the Tax Code allowing any tax deferral on income earned abroad.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 27 December 2024
Armenian-resident entities, and non-resident entities doing business in Armenia through a permanent establishment (PE), are liable for corporate income tax (CIT). For tax residents, their worldwide income is taxable. For non-residents, their Armenian-source income is taxable.
The standard CIT rate is 18%.
The taxable base for CIT is the taxable income. Taxable income is the difference between a taxpayer’s gross income and deductible expenses:
The tax base for investment funds (excluding pension funds and warranty funds), which are registered in the Republic of Armenia, and for securitisation foundations, which are established based on the Law on Asset Securitisation and Asset-backed Securities, is the sum of net assets.
The dividends paid to the shareholder of investment funds or other similar allocations provided in a different manner shall not be deducted from the net assets of the investment funds.
The CIT rate for investment funds (excluding pension funds and warranty funds) registered in the Republic of Armenia, as well as for securitisation foundations, is 0.01% of the tax base.
## Micro-entrepreneurship system
Starting 1 January 2020, the Tax Code substitutes the chapter on the family entrepreneurship system and the system of taxation of self-employed entities with a newly drafted chapter on the micro-entrepreneurship system.
Within the scope of this preferential tax system, the entities will be exempted from all the main taxes and be able to involve a limitless number of physical persons (regardless of whether they are family members or not) in their activities as employees, whose monthly personal income tax (PIT) will constitute 5,000 Armenian dram (AMD). Starting from 1 July 2023, the PIT will be calculated using the general income tax rate 20%. Further, legal entities, sole entrepreneurs, as well as physical entities not considered sole entrepreneurs, can make use of this system unless their annual turnover exceeds AMD 24 million. Physical persons not registered as sole entrepreneurs can make use of this taxation system if they carry out basic activities prescribed by the Tax Code.
Accordingly, the chapter defines the conditions for qualifying to participate in the micro-entrepreneurship system, termination thereof, exemption from several taxes, transition to the general or turnover taxation systems, as well as types of entities that cannot be considered participants of the micro-entrepreneurship system.
## Local income taxes
Armenia does not have any provincial or local government taxes on income.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 27 December 2024
Individuals are classified into two categories for personal income tax (PIT) purposes:
## Unified Income Tax rates
Income from royalties is subject to 10% tax and interest (if not exempt) is subject to 20% tax starting from 1 January 2023. If paid by a tax agent (i.e. legal entity, individual entrepreneur), tax should be withheld at source.
Income from lease of property is subject to 10% tax. Starting from 1 January 2020, if the income from lease exceeds AMD 60 million during the tax year, the individual should pay 10% income tax in addition to the tax withheld by the tax agent.
The income from the sale of property is taxed at 10% or 20% (depending on the type of property and whether sold to a tax agent or individual). The sale of non-entrepreneurial property to individuals is exempt from tax. Starting from 1 January 2020, dividends received by foreigners are subject to 5% income tax (from dividends on the income generated after 1 January 2020), and dividends received by Armenian citizens are subject to 5% income tax (from dividends on the income generated after 1 January 2018).
The tax withheld from the dividends is subject to refund if the dividend received from a resident entity is invested in the capital of the same resident entity during the same tax year.
Other income paid by a tax agent is subject to final withholding on a monthly basis. The taxable base is the gross income minus deductible income. Other income will be withheld at a flat rate of 20%.

## Tax returns
Individuals who receive income that has not been subject to Armenian tax at source are required to file a personal tax return by 20 April of the following year.
## Payment of tax
Any income payment by a tax agent to an individual is subject to withholding unless the payment is to an individual entrepreneur and against appropriate invoices, and (or) the parties have signed a contract that indicates the individual’s tax identification number (TIN), passport data, domicile in Armenia, and the number of the state registration certificate issued when business activity commenced. If the purchase is not documented according to the requirements of the tax law, tax agents have to withhold income tax at the rate of 20%.
WHT from payments to individuals must be transferred to the State Budget not later than the 20th day of the following month.
The tax corresponding to the personal tax return must be paid by 20 April.

# Armenia
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 27 December 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
Armenia’s current VAT is, in general, based on the principles of the European Union (EU) VAT Directive. Armenia operates the input-output model of VAT. VAT-registered persons may deduct the VAT on their inputs from the VAT charged on their sales and account for the difference to the state budget.
The VAT recoverable amount is the negative difference between the output and input VAT. The taxpayer may claim a VAT refund from the state budget on a monthly basis.
The standard rate of VAT is 20%.
Exported goods and services are generally charged at zero-rate. Advertising, consulting, marketing, design, engineering, legal, accounting, audit, data processing, and other related services are charged at zero-rate if the receiver of the services is outside of Armenia. Various supplies, including most financial and education services, are VAT-exempt.
Reverse-charge VAT is applied to VAT payers in Armenia if they receive services from non-residents who do not have a PE in Armenia and the place of supply of the received services is Armenia.
Non-residents that do not have a registered PE in Armenia bear the responsibility to account for and pay the VAT for the transactions that result in Armenian VAT if the contractual party is not a VAT payer.
The turnover tax (*see below*) generally replaces VAT obligations for SMEs. One of the requirements is that the taxpayer must not cross the income threshold of AMD 115 million for the previous year. Certain ownership and inter-relation thresholds and restrictions on types of business activities are also applicable for entities to be considered as turnover taxpayers.
VAT payers should file unified return of VAT and excise tax on a monthly basis before the 20th day of the month following the reporting period (inclusive).
### VAT compliance for electronic services
In 2022, the definition of electronic services was stated in the tax law. In particular, electronic services include software development, use of databases, provision of remote access, advertising, and consulting services that are provided via the Internet.
VAT liability from electronic services arise when the services are provided to Armenian customers.
A non-resident company should register with tax authorities, submit the VAT report, and pay VAT monthly if the electronic services are provided to Armenian legal entities that are not VAT payers and quarterly if the electronic services are provided to individuals.
The applicable VAT rate for electronic services is 20%.
## Customs duties
Armenia is a member of the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) along with Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Belarus. The EEU’s aim is to create a common market for the member states to raise the competitiveness of the national economies and to cooperate for sustainable growth. The EEU introduces the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people, creating a platform for common transport and reduced economic isolation.
The customs relations in EEU member states are regulated by The Customs Code of EEU that entered into force on 1 January 2018.
Customs levies are payable by persons whose goods cross the customs border of Armenia. Customs levies consist of customs duties, taxes, duties, and other mandatory charges. Customs duty is collected on the customs value of the imported goods. Importers must take into account specific EEU rules to determine the customs value on which the import tax will be applied. The general rule is that the customs value will be the price actually paid or payable for the goods when sold for export to Armenia.
Under the EEU regulations, goods imported from member countries are free of custom duties. The unified custom tariffs are applicable for the goods imported from non-member states.
VAT for the goods imported from the EEU member countries is not calculated by the customs authorities. Instead, taxpayers should calculate and pay VAT by the 20th day of the month following the month of the importation. In the meantime, within this timeframe, the taxpayer should submit the tax declaration and the statement on imported goods to tax authorities.
## Excise tax
Excise tax is payable on alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, and petroleum products, whether imported or produced domestically.
The excise tax rates for certain types of goods are as follows:
| Goods | Unit of measure | Tax per unit of measure (AMD) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Beer | 1 litre | 150 |
| Grape wines | 1 litre | 165 |
| Vermouth and other grape wines | 1 litre | 1,100 |
| Vodka made of fruits and/or berries | 1 litre | 4,200 |
| Cognac, brandy, and other spirits | 1 litre (by recalculation of 100% spirit) | * 3,300 (1 to 3 years old spirit) * 3,800 (4 to 5 years old spirit) * 6,500 (6 to 10 years old spirit) * 9,300 (11 to 15 years old spirit) * 15,300 (16 to 19 years old spirit) * 24,000 (more than 20 years old spirit) |
| Other brewed drinks (apple cider, pear cider, honey-drinks) | 1 litre | 165 |
| Ethyl spirit | 1 litre (by recalculation of 100% spirit) | 6,900 |
| Spirituous liquors | 1 litre | 4,200 |
| Whisky and rum and other spirits | 1 litre | 8,000 |
| Tobacco products | 1,000 units | 16,100 |
| Cigars | 1,000 units | 660,000 |
| Cigarillos | 1,000 units | 18,000 |
| Lubricating oil | 1 kilogram | 550 |
| Tobacco substitutes | 1 kilogram | 1,640 |
| Raw oil and oil materials | 1 ton | 29,450 |
| Gases produced from oil and other hydro-carbons (except compressed natural gas) | 1 ton | 1,100 |
| Compressed natural gas | 1,000 m³ | 37,100 |
| Petrol | 1 ton | 43,600 |
| Diesel fuel | 1 ton | 14,200 |
Taxpayers producing excisable goods in Armenia should submit monthly VAT and excise tax unified returns and make excise tax payments by the 20th day of each month following the reporting period.
## Tax on immovable property
Starting from 1 January 2021, the tax on immovable property and vehicle property entered into force, and the property tax and land tax are no longer in force.
Immovable property tax is assessed and collected at the municipal level on the buildings, land, and its improvements.
The land cadaster (valuation system) is used to determine the value of the land. Tax on land for agricultural land is calculated at 15% of the net income determined by the cadastrial evaluation. For non-agricultural land, the rate is 0.25% to 1.0% of the cadastrial value. Cadastrial value should be assessed based on the market value.
The tax rate on public importance buildings should be calculated at the following rates:
Legal entities should pay immovable property tax to the municipal budget annually by 1 December of the tax year. The municipal bodies are liable to calculate the annual tax amount and publicly inform the taxpayers no later than 1 November of the tax year. Starting from 1 January 2021, the Tax Code does not define a requirement for submission of the returns on the immovable property tax.
## Tax on vehicles
Tax on vehicles with up to ten seats is calculated as follows:
| Capacity (horsepower) | Tax rate (per horsepower) |
| --- | --- |
| Up to 120 | AMD 200 |
| 121 to 250 | AMD 300 + AMD 1,000 per horsepower in excess of 150 |
| 251 and over | AMD 500 + AMD 1,000 per horsepower in excess of 150 |
Tax on vehicles with more than ten seats is calculated as follows:
| Capacity (horsepower) | Tax rate (per horsepower) |
| --- | --- |
| Up to 200 | AMD 100 |
| 201 and over | AMD 200 |
The annual property tax on motorcycles is calculated at the rate of AMD 40 for each horsepower of tax base. The annual rate of property tax on watercraft is calculated at AMD 150 for each horsepower of tax base.
Beginning from the fourth year after the year of production, the tax base for motor vehicles and means of water transport is reduced by 10% per year, up to a maximum reduction of 50%.
Legal entities should pay vehicle tax to the municipal budget annually by 1 December of the tax year. The municipal bodies are liable to calculate the annual tax amount and publicly inform the taxpayers no later than 1 November of the tax year. Starting from 1 January 2021, the Tax Code does not define a requirement for submission of the returns on the vehicle tax.
## Transfer taxes
Armenia does not have any transfer taxes.
## Stamp taxes
Armenia does not have any stamp taxes.
## Turnover tax
The turnover tax replaces VAT and (or) CIT obligations for SMEs, with the exception of individual entrepreneurs and notaries for whom it replaces only VAT.
There are certain revenue thresholds that taxpayers should not exceed to be considered as turnover taxpayers (*see description of Value added tax [VAT] above*).
Businesses producing/importing excisable goods are required to account for VAT on their sales.
Certain ownership and inter-relation thresholds are also applicable for entities to be considered as turnover taxpayers.
The taxpayer should file an application to the tax authorities before 20 February of the calendar year to become a turnover taxpayer. Note that there are also some other requirements that the taxpayer should meet to become a turnover taxpayer. Subdivisions of foreign companies in Armenia (i.e. PEs) cannot become turnover taxpayers.
The turnover tax is imposed on the reporting period income (revenue) as follows:
| Type of income | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Trading activities \* | 10.0 |
| Production activities | 7.0 |
| Rental income, interest, royalties, and assets' disposal (including estate property) | 10.0 |
| Income from activities included in the list of high-tech activities established by the government | 1.0 |
| Income on public food organisation | 12.0 |
| Other revenues from the activities not included in the public food organisation section of the economic activity classifier of the turnover taxpayers operating in the public catering sector | 20.0 |
| Income from the disposal of other assets, including real estate | 10.0 |
| Income on other type of activities | 10.0 |
\* The tax rate on the sale of secondary raw materials is 5%. Turnover taxpayers engaged in trade activities may deduct 9.5% of cost of the goods for sale (including imported goods) purchased during the reporting period from the turnover tax payable for that period, provided such purchases are properly documented. However, the final tax payable for the trading activities, after the deductions, should not be less than 1% of the taxable turnover for the reporting period. The purchases not deducted in the reporting period because of the limitations above may be deducted in the future periods.
Starting from 1 January 2020, excise taxpayers may also be considered turnover taxpayers.
Taxpayers who are engaged in public catering activities may be considered taxpayers on their request, regardless of whether they qualify for a turnover taxpayer.
Turnover taxpayers are required to submit tax calculation on a quarterly basis and make tax payment within 20 days following the end of the reporting period.
## Payroll taxes
Payroll income paid by the employer (tax agent) is subject to final withholding on a monthly basis.
Starting 1 January 2020, PIT as part of dividends received by foreign citizens from Armenian sources, just like that of Armenia citizens, is calculated at 5% (instead of 10%). This rate applies to dividends received from net profits attributable to 2020 and reporting periods succeeding it.
The tax withheld from the dividends is subject to refund if the dividend received from a resident entity is invested in the capital of the same resident entity during the same tax year.
## Social security contributions
Mandatory contributions to pension funds are applicable for both Armenian and foreign citizens who were born after 1 January 1974 (inclusive). However, some employees could have suspended the payment of social contributions until 1 July 2018 by submitting an appropriate application.
Employers should withhold social contributions from the monthly employment income according to the following rates:
The maximum threshold for the calculation of the pension contribution is AMD 1,125,000.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 27 December 2024
## Taxable period
In Armenia, the taxable period is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
The annual CIT return for resident entities must be filed by 20 April.
## Payment of tax
The annual CIT should be paid to the state budget by 20 April.
Starting from 18 June 2020, taxpayers should make advance CIT payments by the 20th day of the last month of each quarter in the lower amount of 20% of the CIT calculated in the previous tax year and 2% of the income generated from the supply of goods, performance of works, and/or provision of services during the previous quarter. For payments before the previous year’s tax is calculated (e.g. January to March), tax is paid based on the last filed tax return, and an adjustment is made in the first advance tax payment made after the previous year’s tax is calculated to correct the amount paid. If advance payments exceed the CIT liability for the year, the excess may be refunded.
Newly registered companies don’t pay CIT prepayments for the year of the registration.
## Tax audit process
### Risk based audits
For the purposes of planning audits, the authorities develop risk criteria that are approved by the Armenian government. Based on the risk criteria, entities are classified into the following three categories:
### Tax audits
The tax authorities may carry out scheduled audits a maximum of once each year for high risk taxpayers, once each three years for medium risk taxpayers, and once each five years for low risk taxpayers.
Business entities must be notified of the audit in writing at least three days before the scheduled audit.
The tax inspector must present a written order to the taxpayer outlining the scope and period of the tax audit before starting the audit. The written order specifies the names of the officials who may participate in the audit.
For normal business entities, the scheduled audit should be carried out within 15 business days, although the period may be extended by up to ten days. For companies whose annual revenue exceeds AMD 3 billion, the period may be extended by up to 75 business days.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations is three years.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 27 December 2024
A resident company of the Republic of Armenia is an organisation that is registered in the Republic of Armenia. A non-resident company is a company that is not considered a resident company.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The domestic definition of a PE, in general, adopts the definition for PE found in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Tax Convention.
Mainly, the non-resident’s PE in Armenia is defined as the place of business in Armenia registered at the tax authorities as a taxpayer through which the non-resident performs business activity in Armenia, regardless of the period of the activity.
In particular, this will include the following:
In addition, a non-resident’s activities will create a PE if the non-resident provides services in Armenia through its employees or other hired personnel for 183 or more days in any tax year starting from the day of activities within the framework of one project or more than one related project.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 27 December 2024
## Depreciation and amortisation
Fixed assets owned (leased) by the taxpayer and ready for use should be depreciated using the straight-line method. The minimum periods for depreciation (to be applied on the initial value) for depreciating fixed assets are:

## Goodwill
Payments with respect to goodwill and impairment losses of goodwill are not deductible in Armenia.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses are fully deductible, provided they are properly documented.
## Interest expenses
As a general rule, interest is deductible if the related debt is used to fund business activities of the taxpayer. However, the following items are not deductible from gross income:
Equity is the difference between assets and liabilities calculated for tax purposes.
In the event of a negative amount of equity on the last day of the fiscal year, interest on loans attracted from non-bank and non-credit organisations should not be deducted from the gross income.
The above provisions do not apply to interest on loans received from international development institutions included in the list specified by the Armenian government, as well as on interest on borrowing attracted from placement of debt securities through public offerings.

## Charitable contributions
Expenses on aid, food organisation for individuals, as well as organisation of social-cultural events for them, are deductible in amounts of up to 0.25% of gross income.
## Fines and penalties
Commercial fines and penalty expenses are deductible for CIT purposes. Fines and penalties paid to the state or municipal budgets are not deductible.
## Taxes
Non-refundable (non-credited) taxes (e.g. property tax, land tax, expensed VAT), duties, and other obligatory payments are deductible for CIT purposes.
## Other significant items
The deductibility of the following common items is limited for CIT purposes:
## Net operating losses
Companies are entitled to carry forward losses to the five subsequent income years. Armenian law does not allow the carryback of losses.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 27 December 2024
There are no group taxation provisions available in Armenia.
## Transfer pricing
The transfer pricing regulations entered into force on 1 January 2020. It defines the concept of transfer pricing, methods, comparability factors, documentation procedures, and sources of information about uncontrolled and controlled transactions.
### Overview of the transfer pricing regulations
Transfer pricing rules apply to transactions between related parties that are controlled and if the amount of all controlled transactions carried out by the taxpayer during the tax year exceeds AMD 200 million (net of VAT, excise tax, and environmental tax).
The tax authorities check the compliance of controlled transactions with the principle of market relations, as well as the completeness of the calculation and payment of CIT and payment for the use of mineral resources (royalty).
If the amount of all controlled transactions during the tax year exceeds the threshold of AMD 200 million, the taxpayer must submit a notification of controlled transactions to the tax authorities no later than 20 April of the year following the tax period.
Taxpayers must submit documentation on control transactions to the tax authority within 30 working days from the date of receipt of the written notification.
### Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
CbC reporting requirements entered into force on 1 January 2024, and the regulation is applicable to tax years beginning 1 January 2025. CbC reporting is mandated by the parent organisation of a multinational corporation if its gross income exceeds 750 million euros (EUR) based on the previous tax year's results. Generally, CbC reporting in Armenia includes the following:
Taxpayers must submit CbC reporting to the tax authority immediately after the end of each tax year, within a 12-month period.
## Thin capitalisation
Armenia does not have thin capitalisation rules. However, there are certain limitations on deductibility of interest expenses (*see Interest expenses in the [Deductions](deductions.html) section*).
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no CFC rules in Armenia.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 27 December 2024
When a non-resident company conducts business in Armenia through a subdivision (i.e. a branch or a representative office) and maintains separate accounting records for that subdivision, taxable income generally should be determined on the same basis as for resident entities. Note that a subdivision is taxable on dividends received from Armenian companies.
The non-resident taxpayers conducting activity in Armenia through subdivision (i.e. PE) should keep separate accounting books.
Armenia has no special tax rules for non-commercial representative offices established to engage in liaison-type activities. Such offices are subject to the normal CIT, but an exemption from CIT may be available under a relevant tax treaty if the activities of the representative office are not sufficient to constitute a PE for the foreign entity.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 27 December 2024
The CIT for the resident companies implementing special construction projects exclusively outside Armenia and approved by the government is reduced to a 5% rate.
Taxpayers engaged in agricultural production are exempt from CIT on that income until 31 December 2024.
Taxpayers engaged in production of hand-made carpets are exempt from CIT on the income received from the sale of hand-made carpets.
Taxpayers operating in free economic zones are exempt from CIT in respect of income received from activities performed in free economic zones in Armenia. Armenian resident companies implementing a business plan approved by the government may deduct the amount of the annual salaries for the new jobs created from the CIT liability of that year, but not greater than 30% of the actual CIT calculated. The incentive is applicable for five fiscal years, in addition to the year of the start of the business.
The government of the Republic of Armenia provides the following tax incentives to start-ups and exiting companies in the IT sector:
## Foreign tax credit
Tax residents are allowed to credit foreign taxes paid on income received abroad against their Armenian tax liabilities. The amount of foreign tax credit is limited to the amount of Armenian tax that would arise from the equivalent income in Armenia.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 27 December 2024
Starting from 1 January 2023, income tax should be calculated at a 20% flat rate.
Income tax that has not been duly withheld can be withheld for the period of no more than the last three months, and the excess tax withheld from the taxpayer shall be offset against future withholdings or should be refunded within one month after it has become known but no more than for the last three years.
From 1 July 2018, all employees, notaries, and individual entrepreneurs born after 1 January 1974 should make funded pension contributions.
Starting from 1 January 2023, the maximum threshold for the calculation of the pension contribution is AMD 1,125,000 Armenia dram (AMD) (15 times the minimum monthly salary of AMD 75,000). Please note that from 1 January 2023 the minimum monthly salary is increased from AMD 68,000 to AMD 75,000.
