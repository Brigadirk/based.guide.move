## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
## Social security contributions
Indonesia does not have a comprehensive social security system; however, there is a worker’s social security program (*BPJS Ketenagakerjaan*) that provides work accidents protection, death insurance, old age savings, healthcare, and pension. The program is maintained by a designated state-owned company, *BPJS Ketenagakerjaan,* which has conducted the social security schemes in Indonesia and calls for premium contributions for the following:
| Areas covered | As a percentage of regular salaries/wages | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Borne by employer (%) | Borne by employee (%) |
| Working accident protection (1) | 0.24 to 1.74 | - |
| Death insurance (1) | 0.3 | - |
| Unemployment insurance (*Jaminan Kehilangan Pekerjaan*) – for workers affected by lay-off | Reallocated from working accident protection and death insurance | - |
| Old age saving (1) | 3.7 | 2 |
| Healthcare (2) | 4 | 1 |
| Pension (3) | 2 | 1 |
Notes
1. Calculation base is basic salary plus fixed allowance.
2. Maximum calculation base is IDR 12 million/month starting 1 January 2020.
3. Maximum calculation base is updated annually based on BPJS regulation.
Employers are responsible for ascertaining that their employees are covered by workers' social security programs under two government social security agencies as follows:
Employees’ contributions are collected by the employer through payroll deductions. These must be paid to BPJS together with the contributions borne by the employers.
## Public housing savings
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
Services performed within the Customs Area for customers outside of the Customs Area are considered as locally delivered and are therefore subject to the regular VAT rate of 12% starting 1 January 2025 onwards. Inbound use or consumption of foreign services or intangible goods, with a few exceptions, is also subject to a self-assessed VAT at a rate of 12% starting 1 January 2025 onwards.
The VAT law allows the government to change the VAT rate within the range of 5% to 15%.
In general, VAT collection is based on the accrual principle, whereby VAT must be collected at the time of delivery of taxable goods or services. The term delivery, in this case, is defined as the time when risk and ownership of goods have been transferred or when income from a service delivery can be reliably estimated or measured. In the accrual system, income or receivables are acknowledged when a transaction takes place, regardless of whether the transaction has been paid for or not. The recognition of revenue or receivables is indicated by the issue of a commercial invoice, which is a source document for this recognition and a basis for recording it.
Starting 1 April 2022, the HPP Law changes the status of several non-VATable objects under the existing law. Some remain as non-VATable objects but with certain requirements, and some become VATable objects but with an exemption and/or non-collection of VAT facility.
Individuals may be designated as taxable entrepreneurs (*Pengusaha Kena Pajak* or PKP) if they have their own business activities that deliver VAT-able goods/services with an annual value of a minimum of IDR 4.8 billion. PKPs are required to report their business activities and settle the VAT liabilities on these every month, with payment and filing being due no later than the last day of the month following the taxable delivery.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Indonesia.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There are no inheritance, estate, and gift taxes in Indonesia. Income from lottery prizes is subject to a 25% final income tax.
## Property taxes
Land and buildings tax (*Pajak Bumi dan Bangunan* or PBB) is due annually at maximum 0.5% of the regional government-determined market value.
A transfer of land and building will cause income tax on the deemed gain on the transfer/sale to be charged to the transferor/seller. The tax is set at 2.5% of the greater of the gross transfer value or the regional government-determined market value.
In a land and building transfer, the acquirer is liable for duty on the acquisition of land and building rights (*Bea Pengalihan Hak atas Tanah dan Bangunan* or BPHTB) at 5% of the greater of the transaction value or the regional government-determined market value.
## Sale of shares taxes
Generally, capital gains from sale of shares are subject to normal income tax. Sale of shares on Indonesian stock exchanges is subject to a 0.1% final income tax rate on the proceeds. Founder shareholders may choose to pay tax at 0.5% of the market price of their shares upon listing. If they do not choose this, gains on subsequent sales are taxed under ordinary rules (under certain tax treaties, this tax may not be due).
## Luxury-goods sales tax (LST)
In addition to VAT, some goods are subject to LST upon import or delivery by the manufacturer to another party at rates currently ranging from 10% to 95%.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is nominal and payable as a fixed amount of IDR 10,000 on certain documents.
## Carbon taxes

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
## Inventory valuation
Inventories must be measured at cost by using either the average or first in first out (FIFO) method. Once a costing method is adopted, it must be applied consistently.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are generally assessable together with ordinary income and subject to tax at the standard CIT rate. However, gains from the transfer of land and buildings are not subject to regular CIT, but rather are subject to final income tax at a rate of 2.5% of the transaction value or the government-determined value, whichever is higher.
The proceeds from sales of shares listed on the Indonesian stock exchange are not subject to normal CIT. Instead, the proceeds are subject only to a final WHT of 0.1% of the gross sales consideration. An additional tax of 0.5% applies to the share value of founder shares at the time an initial public offering takes place, irrespective of whether the shares are held or sold. Shareholders may elect not to pay this tax, in which case the actual gain will be subject to normal tax at the time the shares are sold.
## Dividend income
Dividends paid by companies abroad received by domestic taxpayers may be exempted if the dividends are reinvested or used for business activities in Indonesia within a certain period.
The same rules apply to stock dividends (bonus shares), including dividends paid out of share premium (*agio*).
## Interest income
Interest income on time or saving deposits and on Bank of Indonesia Certificates (SBIs) received by a resident company or a PE is taxed at a final tax rate of 20%, whilst interest income on bonds is subject to a final income tax rate of 10%.
Income from interest other than the above is subject to tax and will be taxed by a WHT mechanism. The WHT rate on interest is 15% of the gross amount for resident taxpayers and 20% of the gross amount for non-resident taxpayers or the reduced rate set out in a tax treaty. The domestic WHT on this interest can be used as a tax credit against the normal income tax of 22% for corporate taxpayers and/or 35% (max) for individual taxpayers.
## Royalty income
Income from royalty is subject to tax and will be taxed by a WHT mechanism. The WHT rate on royalty is 15% of the gross amount for resident taxpayers and 20% of the gross amount for non-resident taxpayers or the reduced rate set out in a tax treaty. The domestic WHT on this royalty can be used as a tax credit against the normal income tax of 22% for corporate taxpayers and/or 35% (max) for individual taxpayers.
## Exchange gains and losses
Gains and losses arising from currency fluctuations are generally recognised on an accrual basis in accordance with the prevailing Indonesian Accounting Standards, which resemble International Accounting Standards in most respects.
## Foreign income
Certain income of a controlled foreign company (CFC) is subject to deemed dividend rules in Indonesia. This income includes dividends, interest, rentals, royalties, and gains from sales or transfer of assets, with certain limitations. A CFC is a foreign entity that is at least 50% owned by an Indonesian taxpayer or at least 50% collectively owned by Indonesian taxpayers. The scope of CFC income also covers income from indirectly owned CFCs with a minimum of 50% ownership by another CFC, collective ownership by an Indonesian taxpayer’s CFC, or collective ownership by a number of CFCs (including under the same or different Indonesian taxpayers).
The ownership threshold that is used to determine the CFC status is the ownership percentage at the end of the Indonesian taxpayer’s fiscal year, which is based on either the percentage of paid-up capital or the percentage of paid-up capital with voting rights. The only situation in which the rules do not apply is when the CFC’s shares are listed on a recognised stock exchange.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
Indonesian income tax is collected mainly through a system of WHTs. Where a particular income item is subject to WHT, the payer is generally held responsible for withholding or collecting the tax. These WHTs are commonly referred to using the relevant article of the Income Tax (*Pajak Penghasilan* or PPh) Law, as follows.
## Article 23/26 Income Tax (PPh 23/26)
Domestic Article 23 WHT is payable at the rate of 2% for most types of services where the recipient of the payment is an Indonesian resident and 15% for a variety of payments to resident corporations and individuals.
For non-residents, Art. 26 WHT of 20% is applicable. The WHT rate for bond interest income, including the capital gain (i.e. premium and discount) enjoyed upon disposal, that is received or obtained by non-residents other than PEs can be given a lower WHT rate of 10%. Under the operation of a tax treaty, lower rates may be applicable at the following rates:
| Recipient | WHT (%) | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dividends | | Interest | Royalties | Branch profits (8) |
| Portfolio | Substantial holdings |
| Resident corporations | 15 | 0 | 15 | 15 | N/A |
| Resident individuals | 10 | 10 | 15 | 15 | N/A |

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year is the same as the calendar year, or 1 January through 31 December.
## Payments of tax and tax returns filing
Tax liabilities for a particular period or year must typically be paid to the State Treasury through a designated tax-payment bank (*bank persepsi*) and then accounted for to the DGT office through the filing of an annual tax return.
A summary of individual tax obligations is as follows:
| Type of tax return | Tax payment deadline | Tax return filing deadline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Monthly Individual Income Tax (Article 25 Income Tax) | The 15th day of the following month. | The 20th day of the following month. |
| Annual Individual Income Tax | The end of the third month after the calendar year end before filing the tax return. | The end of the third month after the calendar year end. |
### Penalties
Late payment of tax incurs interest penalties with a rate resulting from the application of the MoF Interest Rate (MIR) plus a surcharge. Part of a month (e.g. a single day) is considered a full month. Late filing of annual tax return incurs an administrative penalty of IDR 100,000.
### E-filing
An individual taxpayer can submit an annual tax return through the e-filing system provided by the Indonesian Tax Office (ITO).
## Tax assessment and audit process
Indonesia uses a self-assessment system under which taxpayers are trusted to calculate, pay, and report their own taxes in accordance with prevailing tax laws and regulations. However, the DGT may issue tax assessment letters to a particular taxpayer if it finds that, based on a tax audit or on other information, the taxpayer has not fully paid all tax liabilities. A tax assessment letter may also be issued by the DGT to a taxpayer who ignores a warning letter to file a tax return within a specified period. Most tax refund requests will trigger a tax audit, except for taxpayers eligible for early tax refunds. Due to the requirement for the DGT to decide on a refund request within 12 months, a tax audit will typically begin within a few weeks to several months from the refund request date.
## Statute of limitations
Under the current Tax Administration Law, the DGT can issue an underpaid tax assessment letter within five years after the incurrence of a tax liability, the end of a tax period (month), or the end of (part of) a tax year.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
A tax resident is generally taxed on worldwide income, although this may be mitigated by the application of double taxation agreements (DTAs). However, the Omnibus Law has added a provision to the Income Tax Law stipulating that foreigners who have become domestic tax subjects by reason of becoming tax resident in Indonesia can be taxed only on Indonesian-sourced income (including if paid offshore) if they meet certain skill requirements. This will only be available for the first four years they become tax resident. This territorial taxation system may not be applicable when the foreigner receives income from overseas and utilises the applicable tax treaty between Indonesia and the source country. Indonesian citizens that are living outside of Indonesia for more than 183 days in 12 months and meet certain requirements can also be considered as foreign tax subjects.
Non-resident individuals are subject to a general WHT at 20% in respect of their Indonesian-sourced income. Concessions are, however, available where a DTA is in force.
The rates applied to taxable income are shown below.
## Individual tax rates
| Taxable income (IDR\*) | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Up to IDR 60 million | 5 |
| Above IDR 60 million to IDR 250 million | 15 |
| Above IDR 250 million to IDR 500 million | 25 |
| Above IDR 500 million to IDR 5 billion | 30 |
| Above IDR 5 billion | 35 |
\* Indonesian rupiah
## Tax on severance payments
Severance payments are taxed separately at the following rates\*:
| Taxable income (IDR) | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Up to IDR 50 million | 0 |
| Above IDR 50 million to IDR 100 million | 5 |
| Above IDR 100 million to IDR 500 million | 15 |
| Above IDR 500 million | 25 |
\* The rates are final and applied only if the payment is made at once, or in two years at the maximum if the payment is made in sequence. For payments for year three onwards, the ordinary individual tax rates apply.
## Tax on lump-sum pension payments
| Taxable income (IDR) | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Up to IDR 50 million | 0 |
| Above IDR 50 million | 5 |
\* The rates are final and applied only if the payment is made at once, or in two years at the maximum if the payment is made in sequence. For payments for year three onwards, the ordinary individual tax rates apply.
## Local income taxes
There are no local taxes on individual income in Indonesia.

## Social security contributions
Indonesia does not have a comprehensive social security system; however, there is a worker’s social security program (*BPJS Ketenagakerjaan*) that provides work accidents protection, death insurance, old age savings, healthcare, and pension. The program is maintained by a designated state-owned company, *BPJS Ketenagakerjaan,* which has conducted the social security schemes in Indonesia and calls for premium contributions for the following:
| Areas covered | As a percentage of regular salaries/wages | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Borne by employer (%) | Borne by employee (%) |
| Working accident protection (1) | 0.24 to 1.74 | - |
| Death insurance (1) | 0.3 | - |
| Unemployment insurance (*Jaminan Kehilangan Pekerjaan*) – for workers affected by lay-off | Reallocated from working accident protection and death insurance | - |
| Old age saving (1) | 3.7 | 2 |
| Healthcare (2) | 4 | 1 |
| Pension (3) | 2 | 1 |
Notes
1. Calculation base is basic salary plus fixed allowance.
2. Maximum calculation base is IDR 12 million/month starting 1 January 2020.
3. Maximum calculation base is updated annually based on BPJS regulation.
Employers are responsible for ascertaining that their employees are covered by workers' social security programs under two government social security agencies as follows:
Employees’ contributions are collected by the employer through payroll deductions. These must be paid to BPJS together with the contributions borne by the employers.
## Public housing savings
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
Services performed within the Customs Area for customers outside of the Customs Area are considered as locally delivered and are therefore subject to the regular VAT rate of 12% starting 1 January 2025 onwards. Inbound use or consumption of foreign services or intangible goods, with a few exceptions, is also subject to a self-assessed VAT at a rate of 12% starting 1 January 2025 onwards.
The VAT law allows the government to change the VAT rate within the range of 5% to 15%.
In general, VAT collection is based on the accrual principle, whereby VAT must be collected at the time of delivery of taxable goods or services. The term delivery, in this case, is defined as the time when risk and ownership of goods have been transferred or when income from a service delivery can be reliably estimated or measured. In the accrual system, income or receivables are acknowledged when a transaction takes place, regardless of whether the transaction has been paid for or not. The recognition of revenue or receivables is indicated by the issue of a commercial invoice, which is a source document for this recognition and a basis for recording it.
Starting 1 April 2022, the HPP Law changes the status of several non-VATable objects under the existing law. Some remain as non-VATable objects but with certain requirements, and some become VATable objects but with an exemption and/or non-collection of VAT facility.
Individuals may be designated as taxable entrepreneurs (*Pengusaha Kena Pajak* or PKP) if they have their own business activities that deliver VAT-able goods/services with an annual value of a minimum of IDR 4.8 billion. PKPs are required to report their business activities and settle the VAT liabilities on these every month, with payment and filing being due no later than the last day of the month following the taxable delivery.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Indonesia.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There are no inheritance, estate, and gift taxes in Indonesia. Income from lottery prizes is subject to a 25% final income tax.
## Property taxes
Land and buildings tax (*Pajak Bumi dan Bangunan* or PBB) is due annually at maximum 0.5% of the regional government-determined market value.
A transfer of land and building will cause income tax on the deemed gain on the transfer/sale to be charged to the transferor/seller. The tax is set at 2.5% of the greater of the gross transfer value or the regional government-determined market value.
In a land and building transfer, the acquirer is liable for duty on the acquisition of land and building rights (*Bea Pengalihan Hak atas Tanah dan Bangunan* or BPHTB) at 5% of the greater of the transaction value or the regional government-determined market value.
## Sale of shares taxes
Generally, capital gains from sale of shares are subject to normal income tax. Sale of shares on Indonesian stock exchanges is subject to a 0.1% final income tax rate on the proceeds. Founder shareholders may choose to pay tax at 0.5% of the market price of their shares upon listing. If they do not choose this, gains on subsequent sales are taxed under ordinary rules (under certain tax treaties, this tax may not be due).
## Luxury-goods sales tax (LST)
In addition to VAT, some goods are subject to LST upon import or delivery by the manufacturer to another party at rates currently ranging from 10% to 95%.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is nominal and payable as a fixed amount of IDR 10,000 on certain documents.
## Carbon taxes

## Payments of tax and tax returns filing
Tax liabilities for a particular period or year must typically be paid to the State Treasury through a designated tax-payment bank (*bank persepsi*) and then accounted for at the DGT office through the filing of the relevant tax returns. The tax payments and tax return filing for a particular tax must be undertaken monthly or annually, depending upon the tax obligation in question. These payments and filing obligations can also be conducted electronically. Tax payments should generally be conducted electronically.
Taxpayers can use a tax deposit to settle a tax payment through an overbooking (*pemindahbukuan*) process. A tax deposit is a tax payment to the taxpayer's account in the DGT system that has not been allocated to a specific tax liability.
Corporate tax liabilities may be settled either by direct payments, third party withholdings, or a combination of both. Monthly tax instalments constitute the first part of tax payments to be made by taxpayers as a prepayment of their current year CIT liability. A monthly tax instalment is generally calculated using the most recent CIT return. The tax withheld by third parties on certain income or tax to be paid in advance on certain transactions (i.e. imports) also constitute prepayments for the current year corporate tax liability of the income recipient or the party conducting the import. If the total amounts of tax paid in advance through the year are less than the total CIT due, the company concerned has to settle the shortfall before filing its CIT return. Returns for transaction taxes, such as WHT, must be filed on a monthly basis.
A summary of these tax obligations is as follows:
### Monthly tax obligations
WHTs must generally be paid and reported by the 15th and the 20th day of the following month, respectively. VAT and LST must generally be reported by the end of the following month, and the payment must be made prior to the filing of the tax return.
### Annual tax obligations
| Type of tax | Tax payment deadline | Tax return filing deadline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CIT | The end of the fourth month after the book year-end before filing the tax return | The end of the fourth month after the book year-end |
| PBB | Six months after the receipt of a Tax Due Notification Letter from the regional government | N/A |
### Penalties
Late payments of the above taxes incur interest penalties with a rate resulting from the application of the MoF Interest Rate (MIR) plus a surcharge. Part of a month, for example a single day, is considered a full month.
Late filing of a tax return or failure to file a tax return incurs an administrative penalty at the following amounts:
| Type of tax return | IDR |
| --- | --- |
| VAT return | 500,000 |
| Other monthly tax returns | 100,000 |
| CIT return | 1,000,000 |
## Tax assessments
Indonesia uses a self-assessment system under which taxpayers are trusted to calculate, pay, and report their own taxes in accordance with prevailing tax laws and regulations. However, the DGT may issue tax assessment letters to a particular taxpayer if it finds that, based on a tax audit or on other information, the taxpayer has not fully paid all tax liabilities. A tax assessment letter may also be issued by the DGT to a taxpayer who ignores a warning letter to file a tax return within a specified period. Failure to maintain books in accordance with the prescribed standards is another condition that may lead the DGT to issue an official tax assessment.
## Tax audit process
The tax audit of a company may cover only a particular tax or all taxes for a particular tax period (a tax month) or tax year. It may be conducted at the company’s premises, at the DGT offices, or at both.
### Conditions triggering a tax audit
Most tax refund request will trigger a tax audit, except for taxpayers eligible for early tax refunds. Due to the requirement for the DGT to decide on a refund request within 12 months, a tax audit will typically begin from a few weeks to several months from the refund request date. A CIT refund request will normally trigger a complete tax audit covering all taxes. A refund request of any other tax will normally trigger a tax audit covering only one particular tax. The DGT will likely broaden the tax audit scope to include other taxes.
Other events that may trigger a tax audit include the following:
## Statute of limitations
The DGT can issue an underpaid tax assessment letter within five years after the incurrence of a tax liability, the end of a tax period (month), or the end of (part of) a tax year.
Indonesia is largely a self-assessment tax environment, and enforcement remains a priority of the tax authorities. The DGT continues its efforts in improving compliance by targeting tax audits on high-risk taxpayers. On the other hand, the DGT has also made some efforts to collect more information from various sources and is issuing several incentives to increase tax compliance as well as boosting national tax revenue.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
The VAT law allows the government to change the VAT rate within the range of 5% to 15%. With a few exceptions, VAT is applicable on deliveries (sales) of goods and services within Indonesia at a rate of 12% starting 1 January 2025 onwards. VAT on export of goods is zero-rated, whilst the import of goods is subject to VAT at a rate of 12% starting 1 January 2025 onwards. Services performed within the Customs Area for customers outside of the Customs Area are considered as locally delivered and are therefore subject to the regular VAT rate of 12% starting 1 January 2025 onwards. Zero-rated VAT is also applicable on exported services, but subject to a Ministry of Finance (MoF) limitation. The range of services subject to 0% VAT has been expanded as of 1 April 2019 as follows:
Inbound use or consumption of foreign services or intangible goods, with a few exceptions, is also subject to a self-assessed VAT at a rate of 12% starting 1 January 2025 onwards.
The utilisation of foreign intangible goods and services provided via e-commerce system to users in Indonesia’s Customs Area will be imposed with a VAT rate of 12% starting 1 January 2025 onwards.
The delivery of taxable goods on consignment as well as *inbreng* (i.e. transfer of taxable goods for the purpose of capital deposit in lieu of shares) become non-VATable goods.
In general, VAT collection is based on the accrual principle, whereby VAT must be collected at the time of delivery of taxable goods or services. The term delivery, in this case, is defined as the time when risk and ownership of goods have been transferred or when income from a service delivery can be reliably estimated or measured. In the accrual system, income or receivables are acknowledged when a transaction takes place, regardless of whether the transaction has been paid for or not. The recognition of revenue or receivables is indicated by the issue of a commercial invoice, which is a source document for this recognition and a basis for recording it.
VAT filing is done on a monthly basis, with payment and filing being due no later than the last day of the month following the taxable delivery.
## Luxury-goods sales tax (LST)
In addition to VAT, some goods (e.g. motor vehicles, luxury residences) are subject to LST upon import or delivery by the manufacturer to another party at rates currently ranging from 10% to 95%.
## Import duty
Import duty is payable at rates from 0% to 150% on the customs value of imported goods. Customs value is calculated on the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) level.
| Group | Good | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Automobiles | Passenger and commercial | 5 to 50 |
| Certain vehicles under battery-based electric motorised programme for road transportation | 0 |
| Automobile components | Incompletely knocked down | 0 to 7.5 |
| Part by part | 0 to 10 |
| Vessels | Ships, boats, and floating structures | 0 to 5 |
| Aircraft | Balloons, helicopters, aeroplanes, parachutes, and aircraft launching gear | 0 |

As a commitment to liberalising trade, the Indonesian government is progressively lowering import duty rates on most products. Higher duty rates remain to protect certain industries and goods regarded as sensitive for security or social and cultural reasons.
### Duty relief/exemption/deferral
## Land and buildings tax
The scope of PBB under HKPD Law covers all land and buildings except for the following industries, which are governed by separate regulations:
Under HKPD Law, the PBB rate is maximum 0.5% and the tax due is calculated by applying the tax rate on the sale value of the tax object (*Nilai Jual Objek Pajak* or NJOP) (ranging from 20% to 100%) deducted by non-taxable NJOP. The non-taxable NJOP is set at a minimum of IDR 10 million. Any changes are to be made by issuing a PERDA.
## Tax on land and buildings transfer
## Duty on the acquisition of land and building rights
In a land and building transfer, the acquirer is liable for duty on the acquisition of land and building rights (*Bea Pengalihan Hak atas Tanah dan Bangunan* or BPHTB) at a maximum of 5% of the greater of the transaction value or the government-determined value. Similar to PBB, BPHTB has been made a part of regional taxes.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is nominal and payable as a fixed amount of either IDR 10,000 on certain documents.
## Carbon taxes
Carbon tax is to be imposed on carbon emissions, which have a negative impact on the environment. The subjects of carbon tax are individuals or companies purchasing goods containing carbon or carrying out activities that result in a certain level of carbon emissions within a certain period. The priority for the carbon tax imposition will be the companies. Carbon taxpayers consist of carbon tax collectors and the above carbon tax subjects. These taxpayers may be subject to payment, reporting, and recording obligations following a specific procedure (i.e. carbon tax collectors should do filing on a monthly basis whilst carbon tax subject should be on an annual basis).
The rate of carbon tax shall be at least the carbon price in the domestic carbon market per kg CO2e. However, the rate shall not be less than IDR 30/kg CO2e. The carbon tax is due upon the purchase of goods containing carbon, at the end of each calendar year when the carbon is emitted, or other designated timing.
Taxpayers who participate in emission trading (under the ’cap and trade‘ mechanism) and emissions offset, as well as other mechanisms (in accordance with laws and regulations in the environmental sector), can be granted a carbon tax reduction and/or other benefits for the fulfilment of carbon tax obligations.
The first implementing regulation for carbon tax stipulating the ’cap and trade‘ mechanism for coal-fired power plants (under Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Regulation No. 16/2022) was issued at the end of 2022.
To facilitate the carbon trading (currently for emission offset), the government of Indonesia launched the Indonesian carbon exchange (IDX Carbon) on 26 September 2023.
## Payroll taxes
There are no additional payroll taxes applicable other than those for social security contributions (*see below*) and employee income tax withheld by employer on the salary payment.
## Social security contributions
Employers are responsible for ensuring that their employees are covered by the workers social security program managed by *Badan Penyelenggara Jaminan Sosial* (BPJS), which provides working accidents protection, death insurance, old age savings, health care, unemployment insurance, and pension. The program calls for premium contributions from both the employers and the employees. Employees’ contributions are collected through payroll deductions. The premium contributions borne by employers are calculated as a percentage of regular salaries/wages, ranging from 0.24% to 4%. The scheme applies to all employees, including expatriates who have been working in Indonesia for more than six months.
## Public housing savings
The purpose of public housing savings *(Tabungan Perumahan* *Rakyat*) is to collect and provide long-term sustainable low-cost funds for housing finance in order to meet the needs of decent and affordable housing for participants. Deposits contributions are paid by employees and employers based on a certain percentage of wages (i.e. 0.5% for employer and 2.5% for employee or 3% for independent workers).
The scheme applies to employees and independent workers who work and receive wages or rewards of at least a minimum wage amount and are at least 20 years old or have been married at the time of registering, including both Indonesian citizens and expatriates who hold working visas and have been working for a minimum of six months in Indonesia.
Sanctions apply for non-compliant employers and independent workers who do not follow the government provisions.
## Regional taxes
A corporate taxpayer may be liable for a number of regional taxes and retributions. The rates range from maximum 0.2% to 75% of a wide number of reference values determined by the relevant regional governments. The following are regional taxes, other than PBB and BPHTB, that may apply:

## Overview
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
Indonesia, located between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean along the equator between Asia and Australia, is divided into 38 provinces, with Jakarta as its capital. The official language of Indonesia is Indonesian, and the currency is the rupiah (IDR).
Indonesia, which consists of over 17,000 islands and approximately 280 million people, is the world's fourth-most-populous country. It is also the world's third-largest democracy, and the world's largest archipelagic state.
Indonesia continues its serious efforts to promote foreign investment as well as domestic investment, capital accumulation, and the export of goods other than energy and mineral resources to expedite economic development and to become internationally competitive. A broad range of deregulatory measures have been implemented, and additional measures and tax facilities can be expected to further enhance the investment climate.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
Resident corporations are taxed based on worldwide income. A foreign company carrying out business activities through a permanent establishment (PE) in Indonesia will generally be required to assume the same tax obligations as a resident taxpayer.
Taxable business profits are calculated on the basis of normal accounting principles as modified by certain tax adjustments. Generally, a deduction is allowed for all expenditures incurred to obtain, collect, and maintain taxable business profits. A timing difference may arise if an expenditure recorded as an expense for accounting cannot be immediately claimed as a deduction for tax (*see the [Deductions](indonesia/corporate/deductions.html) section*).
Resident taxpayers and Indonesian PEs of foreign companies have to settle their tax liabilities either by direct payments, third party withholdings, or a combination of both. Foreign companies without a PE in Indonesia have to settle their tax liabilities for their Indonesian-sourced income through withholding of the tax by the Indonesian party paying the income.
## Corporate income tax (CIT) rates
A flat CIT rate of 22% generally applies to net taxable income. However, certain tax objects or industries have special tax regimes.
### Public company discount
Public companies that satisfy a minimum listing requirement of 40% and certain other conditions are entitled to a tax discount of 3% off the standard rate, providing an effective tax rate of 19%.
### Small company discount
Small enterprises (i.e. corporate taxpayers with an annual turnover of not more than 50 billion rupiah [IDR]) are entitled to a 50% tax discount of the standard rate, which is imposed proportionally on taxable income on the part of gross turnover up to IDR 4.8 billion. Certain enterprises with gross turnover of not more than IDR 4.8 billion are subject to final income tax at 0.5% of turnover.
## Special industries and activities
Certain contractually based concessions are available in Indonesia. These include Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs), Contract of Works (CoWs), and Mining Business Licences (*Izin Usaha Pertambangan* or IUP).
Companies engaged in upstream oil and gas typically have to calculate CIT in accordance with their PSCs. The PSCs can be 'conventional' with CIT effectively based on cost recovery principles or 'gross split', which more closely follow the general CIT rules.
Certain companies engaged in metal, mineral, and coal mining are governed by CoWs for the income tax calculation. Different provisions may apply to them, pertaining to CIT rates, deductible expenses, and how to calculate taxable income. Note that such contractual-based concessions are no longer available to new mining projects since the enactment of the Mining Law in 2009. The Mining Law stipulates that general prevailing tax laws/regulations apply to mining projects. Specific tax regulations, however, also exist for mining IUPs.
Certain industries (e.g. shipping, airlines) are subject to deemed profit margins for tax purposes.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
A company is treated as a resident of Indonesia for tax purposes by virtue of having its establishment or its place of management in Indonesia.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Under the Income Tax Law, a non-resident company may be treated as having a taxable presence if it runs a business or conducts activities in Indonesia, which can be in the form of:
Domestic regulation on PE also acknowledges the concept adopted under the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and United Nations (UN) Commentaries that under the operation of a tax treaty a business form that is used by a foreign subject to carry on only ‘preparatory or auxiliary’ activity in Indonesia will not create a PE.
Where the non-resident company is resident in a country that has a tax treaty with Indonesia, the rules on a PE creation may be changed; usually there is a longer ‘time test’ for certain activities performed in Indonesia.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
Note that expenses relating to gross income subject to final income tax are not deductible for CIT purposes.
## Depreciation, amortisation, and depletion
Depreciable/amortisable assets include both tangible and intangible property or costs, including the cost of extending building use rights, rights for business use, rights for use, and goodwill, with a useful life of more than one year, except land that is owned and used in business. Depreciation and amortisation may be calculated under the straight-line method or the declining-balance method on an individual asset basis. Once a method is chosen, it should be applied consistently. In calculating depreciation, depreciable assets are divided into the following classes:
| Class | Depreciation/amortisation rate (%) | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Straight-line method | Declining-balance method |
| Property: |  |  |
| Useful life of 4 years | 25 | 50 |
| Useful life of 8 years | 12.5 | 25 |
| Useful life of 16 years | 6.25 | 12.5 |
| Useful life of 20 years | 5 | 10 |
| Buildings: |  |  |
| Permanent | 5 | - |
| Non-permanent | 10 | - |
The HPP Law stipulates that if a permanent building or an intangible asset has a useful life of more than 20 years, the depreciation or amortisation can be carried out using a 20-year period or the actual useful life based on taxpayer’s bookkeeping.
Special rules apply for assets used in certain business fields and/or certain areas. Tax depreciation need not conform to book depreciation.
The costs incurred for acquiring rights, with a beneficial life of more than one year, for mining, oil, and natural gas concessions; forest concessions; and other rights to exploit natural resources should be amortised by the production-unit method. Except for the right to acquire oil and natural gas concessions, the depletion rate used should not exceed 20% *per annum*.
## Organisational and start-up expenses
The costs of incorporation and expansion of the capital of an enterprise are claimed in full in the year in which the expenditure is incurred or are amortised using either the declining-balance or straight-line method at the above rates.
Costs incurred before the commencement of commercial operations with a useful life of longer than one year are capitalised and amortised according to the above rates.
## Interest expense
Interest incurred in the ordinary course of business is deductible with certain limitation as long as the related loan is used for business purposes. The acceptable methods to limit the interest deduction are those commonly used internationally, such as percentage of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA), debt-to-equity ratio, or other methods.
Interest on loans relating to time deposits (which income is subject to a final tax) is not deductible.
Interest on loans used to buy shares where dividends to be received are not subject to income tax is also not deductible.
## Bad debts
Uncollectible debts are deductible for tax purposes, with the following conditions:
## Charitable contributions
Donations for national disasters, education facilities, sport development, and social infrastructures, with certain conditions, may be deductible in the fiscal year when the donations are provided.
## Benefits in kind
Benefits in kinds are generally deductible for the employers and taxable in the hands of the employee. Exception to the taxability applies to benefits in kind that are required for the execution of a job, the cost of providing benefits in kind in certain areas, food and drink provided to all employees, benefits in kind financed from the government’s budget, and certain types of benefits in kind with a certain threshold.
## Fines and penalties
Fines, penalties, and interest on underpayment of taxes are not deductible.
## Taxes
Land and buildings tax and regional taxes may be deducted from taxable income. With several exceptions, input VAT is also deductible against taxable income as long as it is not claimed as a credit against output VAT.
## Net operating losses
Losses may be carried forward for a maximum period of five years. Carrying back of losses is not permitted. Offsetting losses within a corporate group is not permitted.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
WHT is applied as a final tax on the recipient for payments of royalties, interest, and service fees to foreign non-resident companies. Excessive and non-arm’s-length payments to related parties are disallowed as deductions. The tax law denies deductions for all payments from a branch to its head office for royalties, interest, and services provided by the head office (exceptions apply for loans between bank branches and their head offices).

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
Consolidated returns are not allowed in Indonesia.
## Transfer pricing
Transactions between related parties must be consistent with the arm’s-length principle. If the arm’s-length principle is not followed, the DGT is authorised to recalculate the taxable income or deductible costs arising from such transactions applying the arm’s-length principle.
Under the General Tax Provisions and Procedures (*Ketentuan Umum dan Tata Cara Perpajakan* or KUP) Law, the government requires specific transfer pricing documentation to prove the arm’s-length nature of related-party transactions.
Taxpayers under certain criteria are required to prepare transfer pricing documentation, namely the Master File, Local File, and Country-by-Country (CbC) Report.
Detailed transfer pricing disclosures are required in the CIT return, which include the following:
Transfer pricing disputes may be resolved through the domestic objection and appeal process or, where the dispute involves a transaction with a related party in a country that is one of Indonesia’s tax treaty partners, the parties may request double tax relief under the Mutual Agreement Procedures (MAP) article of the relevant tax treaty. The MAP may be applied concurrently with a domestic dispute resolution process. If the MAP process has not reached agreement until the announcement of the Tax Court or Judicial Review Decision on the MAP-related content, the DGT may use the Decision result as a position in the MAP negotiation or propose a cessation of negotiation.
The tax law authorises the DGT to enter into Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) with taxpayers and/or another country’s tax authority on the future application of the arm’s-length principle to transactions between related parties. An APA’s conclusions may potentially be rolled back to open years, albeit on a limited basis. In all cases, the APA period can be up to maximum of five years.
### Increase in transfer pricing focused investigations
The DGT has issued detailed guidelines that, broadly stated, typically follow OECD principles. Transactions under particularly close scrutiny include payments of royalties and technical or management services fees, inter-company services, royalty and financing transactions, and exports to related parties.
Where a taxpayer has no documentation available to substantiate these transactions, there is a high risk that deductions for the payments will be denied in full. In this regard, the 30-day time limit within which a taxpayer must produce any documentation requested by the Indonesian Tax Office (ITO) during an audit is being strictly enforced. Any documentation provided after the 30-day time limit is being disregarded by the ITO in its decision-making process.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
## Foreign tax credit
Tax paid or payable in foreign countries upon income from abroad received or obtained by a resident taxpayer may be credited against tax payable in Indonesia in the same fiscal year.
The allowable foreign tax credit (FTC) amount is either the actual due/paid amount or the amount calculated based on the FTC rules ('certain amount'), whichever is lower. Under the new tax regulation, there is an additional lower limit based on the applicable tax treaty rate. If the tax treaty stipulates that the taxing right of an income is only in Indonesia, any FTC for such income is not creditable. Therefore, there are now three amounts (i.e. actual FTC amount, certain amount, and tax treaty rate) to be considered when determining the lowest amount to determine the allowable FTC amount.
## Revaluation of fixed assets
Certain taxpayers may apply for fixed asset revaluation for tax purposes with approval from the DGT. The excess of the fair market value over the tax book value of the revalued assets is subject to final income tax at a rate of 10%.
## Income tax concessions
### Tax holiday
The MoF may provide a tax holiday of 100% of the CIT due for 5 to 20 years from the start of commercial production for a capital investment plan starting at IDR 500 billion, depending on the investment amount. After the end of the tax holiday, the companies will receive a 50% CIT reduction for two years.
In addition, the MoF also provide a CIT reduction of 50% of CIT due for five years from the start of commercial production for the capital investment plan amounted to IDR 100 billion up to less than IDR 500 billion. After the period for which the CIT reduction is granted, the taxpayer will be provided with CIT reduction of 25% of CIT payable for the next two years.
This facility is provided to firms in pioneer industries that have a wide range of connections, provide additional value and high externalities, introduce new technologies, and have strategic value for the national economy. Currently, this facility is available for the business sectors with specific Indonesian Standard Classification of Business Field (*Klasifikasi Baku Lapangan Usaha*or KBLI) as listed in the regulation. Business sectors outside this list may also apply by fulfilling the self-assessed quantitative scoring system to justify their nature as a pioneer industry.
Generally, an application must be submitted via the Online Single Submission (OSS) system, which will verify the eligibility of the application and pass it on to the MoF. Under the latest regulation, proposals can be submitted to the MoF until 31 December 2025.
### Tax allowance
The MoF may provide the following tax concessions to PT companies following their investment in certain designated business areas or in certain designated regions:
The applicant must meet one of the following high-level criteria to be eligible for the above tax facilities:
Generally, an application must be submitted via the OSS system and will be approved by the MoF.
## Special Economic Zones (Kawasan Ekonomi Khusus or KEKs)
Taxpayers conducting business in KEKs may enjoy tax facilities. The business should cover the main activities determined for each KEK. The designation of an area as a KEK is set out in a specific government regulation.
CIT reduction may be granted for taxpayers conducting main activities in a KEK.
Taxpayers being rejected for the CIT reduction facility and taxpayers carrying out other activities in a KEK may apply for similar inbound investment incentives under the income tax concessions.
## Integrated Economic Development Zones (Kawasan Pengembangan Ekonomi Terpadu or KAPETs)
Companies conducting business in KAPET may enjoy tax facilities similar to inbound investment incentives under the income tax concessions. The designation of an area as a KAPET is set out in a specific Presidential Decree.
In addition to the above facility, an Entrepreneur in Bonded Zone (*Pengusaha di Kawasan Berikat* or PDKB) in a KAPET may be granted tax facilities in the form of:
## Bonded Stockpiling Area
Bonded Stockpiling Area (*Tempat Penimbunan Berikat*) currently consists of:
We will only highlight three prominent areas in the below sections.
The tax facilities in these areas are as follows:
### Bonded Zones
### Bonded Warehouse
The Bonded Warehouse (*Gudang Berikat*) facility is intended to store imported goods that can be processed with one or more simple activities of certain goods to be released in a certain period.
### Bonded Logistic Centre
The Bonded Logistic Centre (*Pusat Logistik Berikat*) facility is similar to the Bonded Warehouse facility; however, it is intended to store both imported goods from outside the Customs Area and/or goods from other places within the Indonesia Customs Area that can be processed with one or more simple activities within three years since the goods entered the Bonded Logistic Centre.
## Free Trade Zones (FTZs)
Goods entered into and goods delivered amongst companies inside an FTZ (*Kawasan Perdagangan Bebas*) may enjoy tax facility. The designation of an area as an FTZ is set out in a specific Presidential Decree.
Taxpayers in FTZs are entitled to the following tax facilities:
## Industrial Zones (Kawasan Industri or KIs)
The determination and licensing of a KI is as granted by the government. The applicable tax facilities depend on the classification of the Industrial Development Area (IDA) (*Wilayah Pengembangan Industri* or WPI) of the KI, namely:
Below are the available tax facilities for each type of WPI:
| Tax and customs facility | WPIM\* | WPIB | WPIP I | WPIP II |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CIT reduction of 10% to 100% of the CIT due for 5 to 15 years from the start of commercial production | Yes | – | – | Yes |
| Income tax facilities similar to inbound investment incentives under the income tax concessions | Yes | Yes | Yes | – |
| VAT exemption on the imports/purchase of machines and equipment (excluding spare parts) that are directly used to produce VATable goods | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Import duty exemption on the imports of machines or materials that are used to produce goods/services\*\* | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
Notes
\* WPIM may choose to apply income tax facility in the form of CIT reduction or tax allowance.
\*\* The applicable period of import duty exemption varies depending on the KI classification and the business cycle of the respective taxpayer (e.g. construction or developing stage).
## Facilities for business players in IKN
In 2023, the government issued a Government Regulation to provide facilities for projects in the National Capital to be named ’Nusantara‘ (*Ibu Kota Negara bernama Nusantara* *or IKN*). These cover the capital investment facilities under the authority of the Central Government (income tax, VAT/LST, and import) and facilities under the authority of the IKN Authority (special tax and revenue as well as facilitation, land provision, and infrastructure for the implementation of investment activities in the IKN).
Tax facilities given in IKN are as follows:
## Reinvestment of branch profits
Profits after tax of a PE in Indonesia are exempt from BPT if the PE reinvests the profits within the same year or no later than the following year in certain investment options.
## Other incentives
The dividends received by a Venture Capital Company (VCC) from capital participation in a micro, small, or medium-sized enterprises of which the shares are not traded at a stock exchange in Indonesia, with certain requirements, are non-taxable.

## Business combinations and splits
Transfers of assets in business mergers, consolidations, splits, or acquisition must generally be dealt with at market value. Gains resulting from this kind of restructuring are assessable, whilst losses are generally claimable as a deduction from income. However, a tax-neutral merger or consolidation, under which assets are transferred at book value, can be conducted but is subject to the approval of the DGT. To obtain this approval, the merger or consolidation plan in question must pass a business-purpose test. Tax-driven arrangements are prohibited, and tax losses from the combining companies may not be passed to the surviving company.
Subject to a similar, specific DGT approval, the same concession is also available for business splits. Registration for an initial public offering (IPO) or additional foreign capital injection may be required for these types of transactions.
## Tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs)
Indonesia has TIEAs with San Marino (pending the exchange of ratification documents), the Bahamas, Bermuda, Guernsey, Isle of Man, and Jersey.
## Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters
Indonesia signed the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters on 3 November 2011 and ratified it on 17 October 2014. Indonesia also signed a Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on Automatic Exchange of:
## Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)
Indonesia signed and ratified the Multilateral Instrument (MLI) on 7 June 2017 and 13 November 2019, respectively. Indonesia submitted notification to the OECD (as the depositary of the MLI) to confirm the completion of internal procedures on 28 April 2020. This MLI entered into force on 1 August 2020. By 27 November 2023, Indonesia has put 60 tax treaties to be covered by the Convention, whereby the applicability of the MLI is subject to whether or not those jurisdictions also included Indonesia in their notifications.
## Multilateral Convention on the Subject-to-Tax Rule (STTR)
Indonesia signed the MLI on 19 September 2024 to facilitate the Implementation of the Pillar Two STTR. Indonesia's provisional position contains the list of 29 tax treaties that Indonesia wishes to be covered and will be confirmed upon the deposit of its instrument of ratification.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
The government issued regulations regarding a new individual withholding tax (WHT) rate on employment, service, and activity income received by individuals, which is effective starting 1 January 2024 and aims to simplify the monthly WHT calculation in relation to the above types of income.
The monthly calculation for months of January to November is to be performed using the new effective tax rate (ETR) while the annual calculation method remains the same. The ETR is differentiated based on certain conditions, such as type of income recipient, marital status, etc.
Specifically for employees, the ETR is applied on the gross income received by the individual in a particular month without applying any annualisation or deduction on the gross income.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
## Employment income
Employment income includes salaries, overtime, bonuses, and any type of allowance (e.g. housing, leave allowance).
Benefits in kind are generally taxable in the hands of the employee. An exception applies to benefits in kind that are required for the execution of a job, the cost of providing benefits in kind in certain areas, food and drink provided to all employees, benefits in kind financed from the government’s budget, and certain types of benefits in kind with a certain threshold.
## Equity compensation
The value of shares given to a director or employee or obtained under a share option scheme as a reward for services may be taxable as regular individual income.
## Business income
Taxable business profits are calculated on the basis of normal accounting principles as modified by certain tax adjustments. Generally, a deduction is allowed for all expenditure incurred to obtain, collect, and maintain taxable business profits. A timing difference may arise if an expenditure recorded as an expense for accounting cannot be immediately claimed as a deduction for tax.
Individual taxpayers conducting business activities or independent work whose gross annual turnover is less than IDR 4.8 billion may calculate their net income using a deemed profit based on a calculation norm of net income provided that they notify the Director General Tax (DGT) within three months of the fiscal year concerned. The calculation norm is determined by the DGT based on type and location of the business.
Certain individuals with business turnover of not more than IDR 4.8 billion are subject to final tax at 0.5% of turnover. Under the HPP Law, individual taxpayers within a certain gross turnover threshold that is subject to final tax are not subject to income tax for gross turnover of up to IDR 500 million in one fiscal year.
Under the Omnibus Law, income received by an Indonesian taxpayer from a permanent establishment (PE) abroad and other active business income from abroad (not from a PE or foreign subsidiary) is not taxable in Indonesia if being invested in Indonesia within a certain period.
## Capital gains
## Dividend income
Dividends received from an Indonesian limited liability company are subject to final income tax at a rate of 10%. However, it becomes non-taxable if the recipient is a domestic individual taxpayer whose dividends are reinvested in Indonesia within a certain period.
## Interest income
Interest income on time deposits and savings with Indonesian banks or their overseas branches, as well as interest income on time deposits placed through Indonesian branches of foreign banks (in any currency), are currently subject to final income tax at rate of 20%. Interest on bonds is subject to final income tax at 10%, the tax collected through withholding by the payer.
## Other investment income
Other types of investment income are generally assessable at ordinary tax rates.
## Rental income
Income from rentals of land and/or building is subject to 10% final tax. Income from rentals of assets other than land and buildings is subject to 2% WHT, which is considered as prepaid for the tax assessed on the total income of the individual.
## Exempt income
Certain items are exempt from individual income tax, including property acquired by gift, gains from mutual funds, and profit distribution received by a member of partnership (the net income is already taxed at the entity level).
