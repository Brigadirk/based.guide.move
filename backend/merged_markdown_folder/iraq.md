# Iraq
## Overview
Last reviewed - 19 January 2025
Iraq, a country in Western Asia, is bordered by Jordan to the west, Syria to the northwest, Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, and Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to the south. Iraq is divided into 18 governorates, with Baghdad as the capital. The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish, and the currency is the Iraqi dinar (IQD).
Formerly part of the Ottoman Empire, Iraq was occupied by Britain during the course of World War I. In 1920, it was declared a League of Nations mandate under United Kingdom administration. Iraq attained its independence as a kingdom in 1932. A ‘republic’ was proclaimed in 1958. In August 1990, Iraq seized Kuwait but was expelled by United States-led, United Nations coalition forces during the Gulf War of January/February 1991.
In October 2005, Iraqis approved a constitution in a national referendum and, pursuant to this document, elected a 275-member Council of Representatives (CoR) in December 2005. Sustained increases in the standard of living of Iraq still depend on the government passing major policy reforms and developing Iraq's massive oil reserves.
Potential foreign investors now view Iraq with much more interest. Iraq's economy is dominated by the oil sector, which provides over 90% of government revenue and 80% of foreign exchange earnings. Iraq's recent contracts with major oil companies have the potential to greatly expand oil revenues, but Iraq will need to upgrade its refinery and export infrastructure to enable these deals to reach their potential.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 19 January 2025
A corporation has to determine its profit/loss according to its income statement for a tax period as established under the Unified Accounting System (Iraqi Generally Accepted Accounting Principles [GAAP]). However, to reach the taxable income, positive or negative adjustments have to be made to the profit/loss as determined according to GAAP.
## Inventory valuation
There is no tax provision in the Iraqi tax law addressing inventory valuation.
## Capital gains
Capital gains on sales of depreciable assets are taxed at the normal CIT rate. To the best of our knowledge and legal practice, gains derived from the sale of shares and bonds not in the course of a trading activity may be exempted from tax. Capital gains derived from the sale of shares and bonds in the course of a trading activity are taxable at the normal CIT rate.
## Dividend income
Under the tax law, dividends paid out of profits that have been subject to tax are not taxed again in the hands of the shareholder.
## Interest income
Interest income deemed to arise in Iraq is taxed at the normal CIT rate.
## Rent/royalty income
Rent and royalty income deemed to arise in Iraq are taxed at the normal CIT rate.
## Foreign income
There is no tax provision in the Iraqi tax law addressing foreign income. However, as per the Iraqi tax law, tax shall be imposed on the income of an Iraqi resident that arises inside or outside Iraq (i.e. worldwide), regardless of place of receipt.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 19 January 2025
Under the tax law, the amount due from any residing taxpayers to a non-resident, whether the payment is made in cash or credited to the account, is subject to withholding tax (WHT) at the rate of 15% if such amounts are related to interest on debentures, mortgages, loans, deposits and advances, as well as annual allowances, pension salaries, or other yearly payments.
The WHT rate in cases where a resident is making a payment for interest to resident is 1.8% to 10%.
Dividends are not subject to WHT since dividends paid out of profits that have been subject to tax are not taxed again in the hands of the shareholder.
Additionally, industries/activities (non-upstream) contracted with oil and gas companies are subject to WHT on all payments at a rate of 3.3% or 7%.
### WHT in Kurdistan region
The Ministry of Finance in Kurdistan has issued instruction number 7 regarding WHT implementation in Kurdistan region on 11 April 2022 as follows:
WHT rate on executed contracts is 15% from the deemed profit rate specified below:

| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | Machinery and equipment rental contract | 35 |
| 2. | Goodwill, trademark, patent, copyright, logo contract | 75 |
| 4. | Marketing contract | 40 |
| 5. | Advertisement contract | 30 |
| 6. | Contracting and services contract | 20 |
| 7. | The contract of installation, establishment, operating, maintenance, and any contract that includes more than one activity | 25 |

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 19 January 2025
## Tax returns
The system in Iraq is similar to that of a pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) regime, whereby a monthly statement has to be filed at the Direct Deduction Division of the tax authorities.
## Payment of tax
The employer is responsible for deducting the staff income tax from their salaries, and forwarding that amount to the General Commission of Taxes/Direct Deduction Division within a period not exceeding the first 15 days of the next month in which the assessment was incurred.
At the end of the fiscal year, reconciliation takes place as to the annual staff personal income tax with the total monthly amounts paid during subsequent months.

# Iraq
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 19 January 2025
## Taxable period
The taxable year in Iraq is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
The statutory time line for filing tax returns is 31 May of the year of assessment. If the self-assessment of tax is not accepted by the tax authorities, tax is assessed on the income of the taxpayer based on the information available to the tax authorities.
Failure to file a tax return may lead to an estimate of income and assessment of tax by the tax authorities; however, such an assessment does not relieve the taxpayer from responsibility for non-submission of the return within the statutory timeline stipulated by law.
## Payment of taxes
Payment of the tax liability has to occur within three days from the assessment date by the tax authority. There is no requirement of quarterly payments during the taxable year.
## Tax audit process
Tax inspection is mandatory in Iraq, as the tax authority will scrutinise the financial statements of the taxpayer to determine the tax liability and, accordingly, issue a tax clearance.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations is five years. However, the tax authority has the right to go back beyond five years in certain instances.
Obtaining a tax clearance from a tax audit/inspection is becoming increasingly important for importation and government bidding purposes, as well as for other areas that affect the continuation of operations.
## Iraqi GAAP
The Iraqi tax law requires all taxpayers to maintain books and records in accordance with Iraq’s local unified accounting system (Iraqi GAAP).
These books shall constitute tax books/accounts. This accounting treatment will determine when income is accrued and costs are incurred for computing taxable profits.

A basic tax of 10% is assessed on the annual revenue for all real estate and is collected from the real estate owner or the long-term lessee (five years). In cases where the owner or long-term lessee cannot be located, the person occupying the real estate will be assessed. Note that the annual revenue for each real estate is discounted by 10% for expenses and maintenance before assessing the tax on that real estate.
## Transfer taxes
There are no restrictions or taxes on transferring funds into or out of Iraq.
## Stamp duty
Contracts are subject to stamp fees at rates that range between 0.1% and 3% of the contract value.
## Payroll taxes
The payroll tax system in Iraq is similar to a pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system, whereby the employer is obligated to withhold tax from salaries and wages paid to its employees and remit same to the tax authorities. Failure to do so will result in the employer being subject to penalties and late payment interest.
## Social security contributions
With respect to contribution to the social security fund in Iraq, employers are divided into a number of categories, which is the driver for determining the contribution percentage. Employers that are categorised as prime contribute at the upper rate (25% from the employer and 5% from the employee), whereas other categories contribute at the lower rate (12% from the employer and 5% from the employee).
Determining to which category the employer relates is subject to the social security department discretion. The criteria for this determination is not crystallised in the law; however, in practice, the social security authorities make their determination based on the business sector the employer is involved in (e.g. those in the oil and gas related industries are expected to attract the upper rate).

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 19 January 2025
All income derived from Iraq is subject to tax in Iraq, regardless of the residence of the recipient.
The effective corporate income tax (CIT) system presented in Iraq for juristic persons (except partnerships) is based on a statutory CIT rate of 15% at all income levels, with no progressive tax rate scale.
Moreover, the General Commission for Taxes (GCT) adopts the deemed approach by applying a certain rate on the total reported revenue. Note that the GCT applies the highest of the deemed tax on the reported revenue or the 15% (35% for oil and gas industry, *see below*) of the reported profit/taxable profit.
## Foreign oil company income tax
The income realised in Iraq from contracts concluded with foreign oil companies, their branches or offices, and subcontractors working in Iraq in the oil and gas production sector and related industries is taxed at a rate of 35%.
## Local income taxes
To the best of our knowledge, there are no local, state, or provincial taxes on income in Iraq.

# Iraq
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 19 January 2025
One of the key issues in determining when a company becomes taxable in Iraq is whether the foreign company is considered to be doing business ‘in Iraq’ or ‘with Iraq’. In 2009, with Instructions No. 2/2008, and its amendment instruction #1 of 2014, the Iraqi tax administration provided a clearer distinction between business ‘in Iraq’ and business ‘with Iraq’.
Once the determination has been made that the company is trading ‘in Iraq’, the company should register with the GCT. A company that is registered with the GCT will be subject to CIT and will be required to file a CIT return.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
It is important to note that the current Iraq income tax law does not clearly define a PE; consequently, it is important to monitor commercial activity being performed in the country to ensure compliance with the registration requirements and tax law. The company should consult with their internal tax department and external advisers if they have signed a contract to provide any type of services inside Iraq to determine if the company should have a legal registration and begin to file CIT returns.

# Iraq
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 19 January 2025
In general, all expenses incurred by the taxpayer in order to produce income during the year are deducted from income, provided that such expenses are confirmed by acceptable documents, with some exceptions.
## Depreciation
The depreciation method is either a straight-line method or declining-balance method.
## Goodwill
Iraqi tax law does not contain a provision that covers the deductibility of goodwill.
## Start-up expenses
Iraqi tax law does not contain a provision that covers the deductibility of start-up expenses. However, as per Iraqi GAAP, such cost will be capitalised and amortised once the operation is started.
## Interest expenses
Iraqi tax law does not contain a provision that covers the deductibility of interest expenses.
## Bad debt
Bad debt is deductible if it was included in earlier income and there is proof of the unsuccessful steps to collect it.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions to the Government and Socialist Sector departments and to scientific, cultural, educational, charitable, and spiritual organisations, which are legally recognised (provided that the Minister of Finance has issued a list containing the names of these organisations), are deductible.
## Bribes and illegal payments
Bribes and illegal payments are not allowed or deductible.
## Fines and penalties
Broadly speaking, fines and penalties are not deductible items.
## Taxes
Broadly speaking, taxes are not deductible items.
## Net operating losses
Under the tax law, losses of a taxpayer from some sources of income arising in Iraq, substantiated by legally accepted documents, are generally deducted from profits arising from other sources.
Losses that can be settled in this manner shall be carried forward and deducted from the income of the taxpayer over five consecutive years, provided that losses may not offset more than half of the taxable income of each of the five years and the loss is from the same source of income from which it has arisen.
Losses cannot be carried back.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Iraqi tax law does not contain a provision that covers the deductibility of payments to foreign affiliates.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 19 January 2025
Iraqi tax law does not contain any provisions for filing consolidated returns or for relieving losses within a group of companies.
## Transfer pricing
The precise meaning of transfer pricing under the effective Iraqi tax system is rather unclear from a tax and legal perspective.
We note that while having no specific transfer pricing legislation, Iraq does have a ‘third party’ arm’s-length provision contained within its tax legislation; whereby, if a non-resident taxpayer is engaged in business with a resident and it appears to the tax authority that due to the connection existing between the resident and the non-resident, and the substantial control of one over the other, that the business relationship is arranged in a manner that leaves no profits to the resident, or the profits left are much less than what is normally earned, the tax shall be assessed on the actual profits of the non-resident and charged to the resident as if the resident is the business agent for the non-resident.
## Thin capitalisation
Iraqi tax law does not contain a provision that covers thin capitalisation.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Iraqi tax law does not contain any provisions for CFCs.

The tax treatment for a branch is similar to a local Iraqi corporation. In general, CIT is imposed on corporate entities and foreign branches with respect to taxable profit from all sources arising or deemed to arise in Iraq. However, certain limitations apply to head office expenses.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 19 January 2025
In accordance with the Iraqi Investment Law, approved industrial projects are given certain custom duty and tax incentives; however, oil and gas is not one of the sectors that is normally granted investment promotion exemptions incentives.
The tax incentives may include corporate tax, individual tax, and others; however, the tax incentives vary from one project to another.
The Board of Investment Promotion has the authority to add any sector or specific project to the list of sectors or projects that benefit from the investment promotion law incentives.
## Foreign tax credit
Income tax paid to a foreign country on income earned in that country may be credited against tax paid to Iraq. The amount of the credit may not exceed the amount of tax assessed in Iraq.

## Foreign tax relief
Income tax paid to a foreign country on income earned in that country may be credited against tax paid to Iraq. The amount of the credit may not exceed the amount of tax assessed in Iraq on the income earned in the foreign country at the rate in effect in Iraq. If taxes paid to a foreign country exceed the amount of this limitation, then the excess taxes may be carried to credit in five consecutive years subject to the limitation in those years.
