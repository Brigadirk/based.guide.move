## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 27 December 2024
There are no Swedish taxes on interest and service fees paid to non-resident corporations or individuals. Such payments to resident corporations and individuals are taxed as ordinary income.
WHT on dividends, royalties, and certain rentals vary according to domestic law and tax treaties, as shown below.
Pursuant to the amendment of the Parent Subsidiary Directive (EU general anti-avoidance rule [GAAR]), a minor change in the Swedish WHT Act (for outbound dividends) has been made, targeting structures put in place to obtain WHT exemption through the use of decoy arrangements. This anti-avoidance provision has long existed under current Swedish law, but an explicit clarification is made as of 1 January 2016 that the provision can also be applicable in cases covered by the Parent Subsidiary Directive.
Apart from the highlighted treaties, Sweden has concluded agreements on exchange of information in tax matters and partial tax treaties. Since 1 April 2017, when the tax information exchange agreement (TIEA) with the United Arab Emirates entered into force, Sweden has information exchange agreements with all the world’s tax jurisdictions. It could also be noted that amendments to the EU Directive on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation have been implemented in Swedish legislation with effect as of 1 January 2017.
The Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (MLI) was approved by the Swedish Parliament in May 2018. As five jurisdictions have deposit instruments of ratification, the MLI entered into force in July 2018 at an international level. Further, as Sweden has submitted the documents required for ratification, the MLI entered into force at a Swedish level in October 2018. However, the Swedish legislative process requires that the amendments are incorporated into Swedish law in respect of each bill. In general, Sweden has made reservations in regards of MLI's tax allocation articles, implying that existing tax allocation articles continue to apply. In regards of other articles in the MLI, minimum standards have been chosen.
In the light of EU case law (Case C-575/17, Sofina SA and Others), rules allowing deferment of payment of WHT upon application entered into effect as of 1 January 2020. In general, certain loss-making residents in jurisdictions where special treaties apply, or entities within the European Union, may apply for such deferment. The deferment is applied until four months after the end of the tax year that follows the tax year whose deferment scope is the basis for the deferment (e.g. WHT relating to a dividend paid during 2020 may be deferred until April 2022).

Notes
2. The reduced rate shown before a stroke (/) refers to payments to corporations having requisite control. Where appropriate, the particular treaty should be consulted to see whether the reduced rate is applicable.
3. Swedish-source royalties and certain rental fees are treated as a special form of PE, taxable at the corporate tax rate, subject to treaty reduction or waiver. Royalties paid from Sweden to a company within the European Union should not be taxed in Sweden if one of the companies holds at least 25% (capital) of the other or, where there are two companies concerned, at least 25% are held by another company within the European Union. Indirect participation does not benefit from the legislation. Both the payer and the recipient must be legal entities under the EU directive.
4. Payments to resident corporations and individuals are taxed as ordinary income. Only resident banks and similar entities are required to withhold tax on payments of cash dividends to resident individuals.
5. Royalties and certain rentals paid by Swedish licensees are treated as business income taxable in Sweden and do not incur WHT (*see Note 3*).
6. Note also the domestic provision stating a 0% WHT on dividends distributed to qualifying entities based on EU Directive (90/435) and/or where the shares are held for business purposes (*see Note 1*).
7. Dividends: 10% of the gross amount if the company receiving the dividends owns at least 25% of the foreign company’s capital.
Royalties: of the gross amount paid for the use of, or the right to use:
9. Literary, artistic, or scientific royalties: 0%; other royalties: 5%.
10. Royalties for use of industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment: 5%; with respect to patents, secret formulas or processes, or for information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific experience: 3%; other royalties: 10%.
11. Royalties for use of copyright and literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic royalties: 0%. Other royalties: 10% (treaty should be consulted).
12. The treaty has effect on income derived on or after 1 January 2006.
13. The double taxation treaty does not include Hong Kong.
14. The same treaty is applicable to the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.
15. According to the Nordic multilateral tax treaty.
17. Royalties for the use of industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment: 5%; other royalties: 10%.
18. Royalties with respect to patents, secret formulas or processes, or for information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific experience: 5%; other royalties: 12.5%.
19. Royalties for the use of industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment or for information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific experience: 10%; other royalties: 15% (treaty should be consulted).
20. Literary, artistic, or scientific royalties including films: 15%; other royalties: 10% (treaty should be consulted).
21. Royalties with respect to patents, secret formulas or processes, or for information concerning industrial or scientific experience: 5%; other royalties: 15%.

25. Royalties with respect to patents, designs or models, secret formulas or processes, or for information concerning industrial or scientific experience or for the use of industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment involving a transfer of know-how: 5%; other royalties: 15%.
26. Former Yugoslavia refers to the countries of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Slovenia, and the autonomous province of Kosovo. The treaty is applicable to all republics and autonomous provinces of the former Yugoslavia with the exception of Macedonia, with which Sweden has concluded a bilateral treaty.
27. Royalties arising from the use or the right to use trademarks: 25%; other royalties: 15%. A proposal was launched by the Swedish government in November 2019 proposing a decreased WHT rate of 10%/15% (based on protocol dated 29 March 2019). The 15% tax rate is to be applied on royalties arising from the use of or the right to use trademarks, and the 10% rate is applied on other royalties. The proposal is currently awaiting approval by the Swedish Parliament.
28. The first tax treaty between Sweden and Armenia entered into force on 1 June 2017.
29. The first tax treaty between Sweden and Azerbaijan entered into force on 31 December 2016.
30. Dividends are exempt from tax if the beneficial owner is a company that controls at least 10% of the voting power of the paying company. For other cases, dividends are taxable at a maximum rate of 5%. A maximum rate of 15% applies to dividends paid out of income (including gains) from immovable property by an investment vehicle that distributes most of the income annually and whose income from the immovable property is tax exempt.
31. Royalties for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment: 5%; other royalties: 10%.
32. Royalties for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment: 5%; other royalties: 7%.

Other royalties: 10%.
34. Royalties paid for the use of, or the right to use, patent, trademark, design or model, plan, or secret formula or process, or information concerning experience of industrial, commercial, or scientific nature: 5%. Other royalties: 10%.
35. A proposal was launched by the Swedish government in November 2019 proposing a decreased WHT rate of 10%/15% (based on protocol dated 29 March 2019). In general, the 10% tax rate is to be applied if the beneficial owner is a company that directly holds at least 10% of the voting power of the company paying the dividends throughout a 365-day period. The proposal has been approved by the Swedish Parliament.
36. Sweden has decided to terminate its tax treaties with Portugal and Greece. The tax treaties and the benefits described therein were in effect until 31 December 2021. After that, dividends paid to a resident in Portugal and Greece are subject to Swedish WHT under domestic law and the exemptions included therein.
37. Sweden has decided to suspend its tax treaty with Russia in its entirety following Russia's unilateral decision to suspend several provisions of the agreement. To effectively carry out this suspension (which thus is made on an international law basis), Sweden must repeal the law that incorporated the treaty into Swedish domestic law. The repeal is proposed to take effect on a date set by the government, allowing for the swift suspension of the treaty. The aim is that the treaty is to be suspended in February 2025.  Once the tax treaty is suspended, the benefits described therein will no longer apply . Instead, dividends paid to residents in Russia will be subject to WHT under domestic law and the exemptions included therein.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 27 December 2024
## Inventory valuation
Inventories (stock-in-trade) are valued at acquisition cost or market value, whichever is lower. As an alternative, inventories may be valued at 97% of the total acquisition cost, which is determined on a first in first out (FIFO) basis. The last in first out (LIFO) method is not permitted. Generally, inventories should be stated at the same amount for tax and accounting purposes.
## Capital gains
There is a capital gains tax exemption for Swedish corporate entities on gains related to the disposal of shares held for business reasons.
Shares in Swedish corporations can qualify as shares held for business reasons. Unquoted/unlisted shares will always be considered as held for business reasons. Quoted/listed shares are considered held for business reasons if the company has a holding corresponding to at least 10% of the voting rights or the shares are held in the course of the business. An additional condition regarding quoted/listed shares is that the shares must be held for a period of at least one year. Under certain conditions, tax exemption also applies to shares in foreign companies.
Shares in partnerships (tax transparent entities) and indirect holdings via partnerships are also included in the participation exemption regime.
An exception from the capital gains tax exemption applies for the sale of shares in a 'shell company', which is a company or partnership where the market value of cash, shares and other marketable instruments (other than shares held for business reasons), and similar assets exceeds 50% of the consideration paid for the shares. The sale of a shell company results in harsh taxation of the gross consideration. Provided certain formalities are fulfilled, however, it is possible to avoid such taxation.
A consequence of the participation exemption is that capital losses on shares or participations held for business reasons are not deductible.
Capital losses on portfolio holdings of shares, share options, convertible debentures, and similar financial instruments are allowed only as an offset to capital gains on the same group of financial instruments.
Certain special rules apply to computation of capital gains and losses on real estate.
## Dividend income
A participation exemption applies for dividends received on shares held for business reasons (*see above*) and on qualifying holdings via partnerships. A tax deductible dividend paid by a foreign company (i.e. not only EU/European Economic Area [EEA] companies) under a hybrid arrangement is though subject to Swedish corporate tax for the recipient Swedish company.
## Interest income
Interest received by a corporation is included in the corporate tax basis.
## Royalty income
Royalty received by a corporation is included in the corporate tax basis.
## Foreign income
Companies resident in Sweden are taxed on their worldwide income. Non-resident entities are taxed on income that is deemed to have its source within Sweden.
A Swedish corporation is taxed on foreign branch income. Double taxation is normally avoided by means of either a deduction of foreign tax or a foreign tax credit.
Dividends and capital gains from foreign subsidiaries are generally exempt from taxation according to the participation exemption provisions applicable to shares held for business reasons (*see above*).

## Overview
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Sweden is situated on the Scandinavian Peninsula in the north of Europe near the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf Stream. In spite of its position in northernmost Europe (Stockholm, the capital, is on the same latitude as the southern tip of Greenland), the climate is comparatively mild. Sweden is characterised by its long coastlines, large forests, and numerous lakes.
Sweden is one of the oldest kingdoms in Europe, dating from about the year 1000. A military power during the 17th century, Sweden has not participated in any war for almost two centuries (an armed neutrality was preserved in both World Wars). Sweden is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy government and a highly developed economy. Swedish is the official language of Sweden, and Sweden's currency is the krona (SEK).
Sweden's long-successful economic formula of a capitalist system interlarded with substantial welfare elements was challenged in the 1990s by high unemployment and in 2000 through 2002 and again in 2009 by the global economic downturns, but fiscal discipline over the past several years has allowed the country to weather economic vagaries. Sweden joined the European Union (EU) in 1995. In September 2003, Swedish voters turned down entry into the euro system due to concerns about the impact on the economy and sovereignty.
Aided by peace and neutrality for the whole of the 20th century, Sweden has achieved an enviable standard of living under a mixed system of high-tech capitalism and extensive welfare benefits. It has a modern distribution system, excellent internal and external communications, and a skilled labour force. Timber, hydropower, and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy heavily oriented toward foreign trade. Privately owned firms account for about 90% of industrial output, of which the engineering sector accounts for 50% of output and exports. Agriculture accounts for little more than 1% of gross domestic product (GDP) and of employment.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Social security contributions
Employers pay Swedish employer social security contributions on compensation paid to employees who are covered by the Swedish social security system.
Social security contributions are levied at 31.42% of the total taxable remuneration (no cap) in cash and in kind paid by a Swedish employer or a foreign employer with a PE in Sweden. Foreign employers who do not have a PE in Sweden must register for the payment of social security contributions or may enter into an agreement with the employee that the employee pays and reports the contributions on a monthly basis. Different rates apply depending on which solution is used.
A pension fee of 7 % of gross earned income, up to SEK 650,442 (i.e a maximum fee of SEK 45,530), is payable by the employee, but the fee is normally fully tax creditable on the employee’s tax return (i.e. the effective cost for the employee is normally nil).
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The Swedish VAT system is harmonised with the European Union (EU) rules. The general VAT rate of 25% is chargeable on most goods and services. Reduced rates apply to a few goods and services, such as foodstuffs, restaurant meals, and non or low alcoholic drinks (12%), as well as to transport of passengers (6%). Certain financial and insurance services are exempt from VAT.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
The Swedish wealth tax was abolished as of 1 January 2007.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There are no inheritance, estate, or gift taxes in Sweden.
## Property fee
Property fee is paid by the registered owner of the real property as of 1 January each year. The fee rate is a maximum of SEK 9,287 or 0.75% of the taxable value of the real estate for houses and for block of flats. The real estate fee is not payable on real estate situated abroad.
## Special wage tax on pension premiums
Swedish employers and non-Swedish employers with a PE in Sweden pay special wage tax of 24.26% on pension costs relating to tax qualified company pension plans.

Resident legal entities are liable for tax on their worldwide income unless tax treaties or special exemptions apply. Non-resident entities are taxed on income that is deemed to have its source within Sweden.
Taxable income is subject to corporate tax at a flat rate of 20.6% applying from 1 January 2021. Until 31 December 2020, the corporate tax rate was 21.4%.
All income of corporate entities is treated as business income.
## Local income taxes
No municipal or local income taxes apply to Swedish corporations.

## Corporate - Other taxes

## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT returns are filed and tax is paid monthly or quarterly. VAT returns must be filed monthly if the VATable turnover is estimated to exceed 40 million Swedish kronor (SEK) (estimated yearly sales excluding any reverse charge or import acquisitions). Companies with VATable turnover below SEK 40 million report VAT quarterly or may choose to report VAT on a monthly basis. For companies with a turnover of less than SEK 1 million, VAT is reported on a yearly basis in the VAT return, and these companies may also choose to report VAT quarterly or on a monthly basis.
### New e-commerce regulations
On 1 July 2021, new rules for e-commerce were introduced at an EU level. E-commerce means sales to consumers in the European Union that are made at a distance (i.e. not in a physical store) and where the goods cross a national border. The new rules can be divided into three categories:
#### 1. Platform rules
Since July 1 2021, a platform (electronic interface) that mediates the sale of a product between an underlying seller and a consumer is, in some cases, considered to have bought and sold the product for VAT purposes, even though the platform never owned the product.
#### 2. Distance selling within the European Union
#### 3. Import of goods to a consumer
From 1 April 2021, reverse tax liability shall be applied to the sale of certain goods between Swedish companies when the invoice amount for these goods, excluding VAT, exceeds SEK 100,000. The reverse charge is applicable on the sale of:
Reverse charge only applies to sales to companies that are, or should be, VAT registered. If the buyer is not VAT registered, the seller must invoice with VAT. A seller needs to assess whether a sale should be invoiced with reverse charge in three steps:
1. Are the goods sold covered by the rules on reverse charge?
2. If yes, is the buyer VAT registered?
3. If yes, does the invoice amount for the goods covered by the regulations exceed SEK 100,000, excluding VAT?
If the conditions are met, the invoice must be inclusive of Swedish VAT. A buyer needs to check invoices relating to the purchase of such goods to ensure that VAT has been handled correctly. If the seller has incorrectly debited VAT on the invoice, even though reverse tax liability should have been applied, the buyer is not entitled to deduct the debited VAT.
### Raised turnover threshold
Starting from 1 January 2025, the turnover threshold for Value Added Tax (VAT) in Sweden will be increased from SEK 80,000 to SEK 120,000. This change is significant for small businesses and individual entrepreneurs as it affects their VAT obligations. Businesses with an annual turnover of up to SEK 120,000 will be eligible for VAT exemption. Businesses below the SEK 120,000 threshold can still opt to register for VAT voluntarily.
### Reduced VAT rate on repairs
Between 1 July 2022 and 31 March 2023, the VAT rate on some repair services (repairs of bicycles, shoes, leather goods, clothes, and linen) was reduced from 12% to the lowest VAT rate of 6%. As of 1 April 2023, however, the VAT on these repair services increased to 12% again.
## Customs duties
As a member of the European Union, Sweden is also part of the Customs union enforcing the Community Customs code. Most EU Customs duties are calculated as a percentage of the value of the goods being imported. All imported goods must be classified according to the EU Customs tariff (TARIC), and the duty rates applied depend on the economic sensitivity of the goods. The actual duty rate to be applied also depends on other factors, such as the country of origin of the product and any free trade agreements that may be applicable.
## Excise duties
The three main Swedish excise duties are harmonised with EU rules. These are the alcohol tax, the tobacco tax, and the tax on fuels and electricity. There are, however, still differences in local legislation between the member states, and the taxation of fuels is partly EU harmonised, partly national. Fuels are subject to energy tax, carbon dioxide tax, and sulphur tax. Depending on the use of fuels, taxes may be partly or fully reduced. An excise duty also applies on certain electronics and household appliances.
## Real estate tax
The annual real estate tax rate on business premises is 1% of the property tax assessment value. For industrial property, the tax rate is 0.5%. Other rates exist for special property.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty at 4.25% is levied on a direct transfer of real estate. The tax base consists of the highest of the purchase consideration or the tax assessed value of the real estate the year before the transfer. Stamp duty on an intra-group transfer of real estate may be deferred as long as the real estate remains within the group.
## Payroll taxes
There are no payroll taxes other than social fees (*see below*).
## Social fees
Mandatory social security charges payable by employers on remuneration to employees (or by the self-employed) are levied at approximately 31.42%. A reduced rate is applicable for people over the age of 65. Social security charges are deductible for corporate tax purposes. In 2024, the lower social security rates for young people were removed. As of the 1st of January 2024, the mandatory social security charges amount to 31,42% even for those under the age of 18.
Pension benefits beyond the mandatory system are customary amongst most Swedish employers. A special salary tax is levied at approximately 24% on these additional pension premiums/commitments and is deductible for corporate tax purposes.

## Social security contributions
Employers pay Swedish employer social security contributions on compensation paid to employees who are covered by the Swedish social security system.
Social security contributions are levied at 31.42% of the total taxable remuneration (no cap) in cash and in kind paid by a Swedish employer or a foreign employer with a PE in Sweden. Foreign employers who do not have a PE in Sweden must register for the payment of social security contributions or may enter into an agreement with the employee that the employee pays and reports the contributions on a monthly basis. Different rates apply depending on which solution is used.
A pension fee of 7 % of gross earned income, up to SEK 650,442 (i.e a maximum fee of SEK 45,530), is payable by the employee, but the fee is normally fully tax creditable on the employee’s tax return (i.e. the effective cost for the employee is normally nil).
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The Swedish VAT system is harmonised with the European Union (EU) rules. The general VAT rate of 25% is chargeable on most goods and services. Reduced rates apply to a few goods and services, such as foodstuffs, restaurant meals, and non or low alcoholic drinks (12%), as well as to transport of passengers (6%). Certain financial and insurance services are exempt from VAT.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
The Swedish wealth tax was abolished as of 1 January 2007.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There are no inheritance, estate, or gift taxes in Sweden.
## Property fee
Property fee is paid by the registered owner of the real property as of 1 January each year. The fee rate is a maximum of SEK 9,287 or 0.75% of the taxable value of the real estate for houses and for block of flats. The real estate fee is not payable on real estate situated abroad.
## Special wage tax on pension premiums
Swedish employers and non-Swedish employers with a PE in Sweden pay special wage tax of 24.26% on pension costs relating to tax qualified company pension plans.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 27 December 2024
## Taxable period
If the income is derived from business, the basis for tax assessment is the financial year. The year-end for a company may be fixed at any calendar month ending, provided it comprises 12 calendar months and ends on the last day of a month. Swedish subsidiaries of foreign parents may generally be permitted to adopt the same year-end as the parent company.
## Tax returns
Every corporate entity or registered branch must file an annual corporate tax return. The applicable due date for tax return submissions depends on the month in which the financial year ends: tax returns for financial years ending in January through April are due on 1 November in the same year; tax returns for financial years ending in May or June are due on 15 December in the same year; tax returns for financial years ending in July or August are due on 1 March in the following year; and tax returns for financial years ending in September through December are due on 1 July in the following year. The financial year of most Swedish companies follow the calendar year; consequently, most tax returns are subject to the 1 July due date.
The annual assessments are made by the Swedish Tax Agency during the calendar year following the income year and should be completed about a year after the expiry of the financial year.
## Payment of tax
Income taxes are collected during the year in which the income is earned, under a preliminary tax system. A corporate entity’s preliminary tax liability is determined by a preliminary tax assessment based either on the latest available final tax assessment or on a preliminary tax return filed by the company. The preliminary taxes are payable in monthly instalments. Interest surcharges on underpayment of preliminary taxes, however, generally apply after two months from the end of the fiscal year (the end of a fiscal year is one of 30 April, 30 June, 31 August, or 31 December).
Once a tax assessment decision has been made by the Swedish Tax Agency, any balance owed by the taxpayer is payable in 90 days. Any balance owed to the taxpayer is automatically refunded within a year from the end of the fiscal year.
### Tax penalty
A taxpayer that submits incorrect or insufficient information in a tax return is charged a penalty of up to 40% of the tax that, if the incorrect information had been accepted, would have been imposed or credited. The penalty and the rate may vary depending on the type of the shortcoming. Late filing fees also apply.
## Appeals
Taxes are assessed by the Swedish Tax Agency. Depending on the circumstances, reassessments and/or appeals generally can be initiated within two and/or six years after the expiry of the calendar year during which the financial year ended. The extended six-year period can generally be applied by the Swedish Tax Agency to the disadvantage of the taxpayer in cases of erroneous or misleading information having been provided by the taxpayer or the taxpayer's omission of information. Appeals can be made to the Administrative Court, onwards to the Administrative Court of Appeal and, in case granted trial dispensation, onwards to the Supreme Administrative Court.
The Swedish Tax Agency has, for quite some time, focused on challenging interest deductions on inter-company loans made under the view that the interest rate deviates from the arm's-length rule. This particular focus has resulted in a number of court cases. The Swedish Tax Agency is currently also focusing on interest deduction restrictions under current limitation rules.
Another focus of the Swedish Tax Agency has been to challenge individual owners of private equity companies on the taxation of carried interest.

Employment income is taxed at the following rounded taxable income amounts (2025):
| Taxable income (SEK \*) | National income tax (%) | Municipal income tax \*\* (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| From 0 to 625,800 | 0 | 32 |

Non-residents working in Sweden for a non-Swedish employer without a PE in Sweden are tax liable in Sweden if the beneficiary of the employee’s work is an entity in Sweden and the work is performed under the management and control of the Swedish entity. The tax rate is 25%. An exception applies if the employees is working in Sweden for less than 15 days in a row and less than 45 days in total during a calendar year.
## Capital tax

## Taxable period
Individuals file a tax return for the calendar year.
## Tax returns
The filing date is normally 2 May of the year after the calendar year, or the following Monday if 2 May occurs on a Saturday or Sunday. An extension of the filing date may be available upon application.
The tax authorities assess income taxes by applying the appropriate tax rates to the aggregate taxable income from the various sources. Spouses are taxed separately.
The tax assessments are issued during June-December of the same year the tax return is filed.
## Payment of tax
Preliminary taxes must be withheld by a resident employer. In the case of a non-resident employer, tax payment must be submitted to the tax authority by the employees themselves.
Income taxes not covered by the preliminary taxes withheld must be paid by the individual 90 days after the final tax bill is issued.
Interest is payable if the taxes withheld do not cover the final tax liability. In order to avoid interest being levied, the individual may pay the taxes to their tax account by 14 February of the year after the income year.

## Pillar Two implementation
On December 4, 2024 the Swedish Parliament adopted the proposal from the government on supplementary provisions taking into account the Administrative Guidance published by OECD throughout 2023. This means that the Swedish QDMTT meets the conditions for benefiting from another country’s QDMTT safe harbour rules. Among other changes are modifications to the foreign tax credit act that enable offsetting foreign QDMTTs against taxes due under the Swedish controlled foreign company (CFC) rules. The amendments enter into force on 1 January 2025 and the legislative changes applies for the first time for tax years beginning immediately after 31 December 2024. However, the reporting entity may request that all or certain of the provisions be applied already for tax years beginning immediately after 31 December 2023, i.e. at the same time as the provisions already in force.
The Administrative Guidance adopted in June 2024 has not yet been implemented into Swedish law. However, such guidance still applies to the extent it is question of clarifications etc that do not require legislation.

A company is considered to be a tax resident in Sweden if it is incorporated in Sweden.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The term 'permanent establishment' is defined in Sweden as a fixed place of business through which the business is carried on from a specific establishment, such as a place of management, branch, office, factory, or workshop. Places where construction work is carried on are also regarded as PEs, as well as if an agent who is dependent upon the foreign company habitually exercises authority in Sweden.
In the light of the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD) and the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, new hybrid mismatch rules entered into effect on 1 January 2020 and apply from financial years commencing after 31 December 2019. As such, certain expenses related to hybrid situations due to PE are considered non-deductible.
In addition, certain amendments related to PE in the double tax treaties (DTTs) with Bulgaria, Greece, and Cyprus entered into effect as of 1 January 2020. As such, the tax treaties are not applied when business conducted through a Swedish PE is not subject to tax in the mentioned jurisdictions.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 27 December 2024
## Depreciation, amortisation, and depletion
### Depreciation on fixed assets
Land improvements may be depreciated at the rate of 5% per year of the acquisition cost. The maximum allowance is 100% of the tax basis of the improvement.
Buildings may be depreciated at rates between 2% and 5% per year of the taxable basis, depending on type and usage of the building. The maximum allowance is 100% of the tax basis of the building.
For machinery and equipment, the depreciation for tax purposes should correspond to the depreciation charged in the books and accounts, as long as the total net value of the assets is not less than the 70% of net value in previous accounts plus additions less proceeds of sales (i.e. 30% declining-balance depreciation) or cost less 20% per year (i.e. 20% straight-line depreciation on remaining assets). An alternative 25% declining-balance method without correspondence to the books also exists.
### Immediate deduction of certain assets
The cost of assets having an expected life of no more than three years and the cost of assets not exceeding certain limits, depending on size of operations, may be deducted immediately. Certain costs for repairs, maintenance, and modifications of buildings may also be deducted immediately.
### Amortisation of intangibles and goodwill
The amortisation of patents, leaseholds, and acquired goodwill follows the same rules as depreciation for machinery and equipment, provided these assets have been acquired from another party (*see above*). If the intangible assets have been internally generated, the amortisation for tax purposes should follow Swedish generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
### Depletion of mines and quarries
The entire cost of mines and quarries may be depleted over their expected exploitation period. These depletion amounts may be deducted annually but are limited to 100% of the acquisition cost of the mine or quarry.
## Start-up expenses
General start-up expenses for generating and maintaining business income are, as a rule, deductible for Swedish tax purposes.
## Interest expenses
Interest paid to affiliated companies is, as a main rule, deductible if the true creditor is resident within the European Economic Area, in a jurisdiction covered by a full DTT, or is taxed on the interest income at a rate of at least 10%. Regardless, a deduction may be refused if the debt structure has been put in place exclusively or virtually exclusively for the group to achieve a substantial tax benefit. It should be noted that one of the previous interest deduction limitation rules (effective between 2013 and 2018) has been found to be incompatible with the freedom of establishment by the European Court of Justice in the Lexel case.
In addition, in the light of the EU ATAD directive and the BEPS project, a general interest deduction limitation rule entered into effect on 1 January 2019. The general limitation on the right to deduct interest expenses applies to negative net interest related to internal and external loans in the corporate sector and is based on an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rule with a 30% deduction limit. Negative net interest, which is not allowed to be deducted according to this EBITDA rule, may be carried forward during a period of a maximum of six years. However, there is a safe harbour rule where net interest expenses up to SEK 5 million within a group may be deducted for tax purposes.
In addition, as of 1 January 2021, deductions on interest expenses on debts, both internal and external, to a company within a jurisdiction that is placed on the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions are non-deductible.
## Hybrid mismatch rules
Regulations on so-called hybrid mismatches have, in the light of the EU ATAD directive and the BEPS project, entered into force (thus extending previous hybrid mismatch regulations). Thus, an absolute prohibition of interest deductions and other expenditures on so-called hybrid mismatches applies. The hybrid rules shall be applied (as previously) for associated companies, but also on other procedures leading to a tax benefit. Hybrid situations involving PEs, hybrid transactions, imported mismatches, and mismatches due to double resident entities are covered by the new rules. Certain hybrid situations regarding dividends are also covered. In addition, extended hybrid mismatch rules covering certain transparent companies (so-called reverse hybrid mismatches) have recently entered into force.
## Bad debt
Business bad debts are deductible if they are proved wholly or partially worthless.
## Charitable contributions
Purely charitable contributions are generally non-deductible.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are non-deductible for Swedish tax purposes.
## Taxes
Generally, Swedish taxes are not deductible for tax purposes. However, specific taxes, fees, and foreign taxes may be deductible. Recoverable VAT is not treated as an expense or cost.
## Net operating losses
Tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely but may become subject to restrictions and/or forfeiture upon ownership changes, mergers and demergers, dispositions with creditors, and certain other reorganisations. No carryback of losses is possible.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Transactions with affiliates not liable to tax in Sweden must be at arm’s length. Formal transfer pricing documentation requirements apply.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 27 December 2024
Swedish companies are not taxed on a consolidated basis. However, it is possible for qualifying groups (i.e. a holding greater than 90% of the capital, which must have been upheld during the whole fiscal year) to effectively offset operating losses of one Swedish company against operating profits of another Swedish company by way of group contributions, which are tax deductible for the contributor and taxable for the recipient. EEA companies are regarded as Swedish companies for these purposes if the recipient is taxable in Sweden.
A similar Swedish deduction is, under certain circumstances, also available for cross-border group relief at the Swedish parent’s level within the EEA for final foreign subsidiary losses.
## Transfer pricing
The Swedish transfer pricing regime is generally an OECD type of regime. Sweden has formal transfer pricing documentation requirements in place.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
A multinational group with a Swedish parent company, with annual group consolidating revenue exceeding SEK 7 billion shall, within 12 months after the closing of the financial year, submit certain financial data about their business for each tax jurisdiction in which the group operates, on an annual basis. All Swedish entities and foreign PEs within a multinational group shall, before the ending of the financial year, notify the Swedish Tax Agency which entity in the group is submitting to the CbC report.
## Thin capitalisation
There are no thin capitalisation rules for tax purposes in Sweden; however, interest stripping restrictions exist (*see Interest expenses in the [Deductions](deductions.html) section*).
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Sweden’s CFC provisions aim at taxing a Swedish resident shareholder for shareholdings in low-taxed foreign entities. A Swedish resident shareholder with a holding in a CFC entity will annually be taxed for its ownership portion of the CFC's income, according to provisions applicable to a Swedish corporation. For a corporation, the portion will be taxed at the Swedish corporate tax rate. Only holdings, direct or indirect through other foreign entities, corresponding to at least 25% (capital or voting rights) in the foreign entity could lead to CFC taxation. A foreign company is considered low taxed if the income in the company, calculated in accordance with Swedish provisions, is taxed at a rate below 11.8%. However, if the foreign entity is resident in an 'approved country', CFC taxation should not arise. Approved countries appear in an official 'black/white' list. Active EEA entities are, under certain circumstances, not considered low taxed.
In the light of the EU ATAD, certain amendments to the Swedish CFC have been implemented. Notable changes are that companies could be deemed as affiliated due to a holding requirement of 25% (previously the threshold was 50%), implying that additional foreign entities could be covered by the Swedish CFC rules, depending on the ownership structure. Thereto, the ‘white’ list applies in fewer situations (e.g. in essence exempting Malta and Trinidad & Tobago from the list). Further, royalties and other income from intellectual property (IP) rights are covered by the CFC rules.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 27 December 2024
There are no specific tax incentives in Sweden for corporations. However, some generally applicable regimes exist.
For example, Sweden has an accruals reserve regime. The accruals reserve regime allows for a tax-deductible appropriation for corporations of 25% of the taxable profit before appropriation to a reserve. Each year’s appropriation forms a separate reserve that must be reversed to income no later than the sixth year following the appropriation. However, a standardised interest income is imposed on former years’ appropriations multiplied by the interest rate on governmental debt notes (or at least 0.5%).
## Foreign tax credit
A foreign tax credit is generally available, provided certain conditions are fulfilled, and the tax credit allowed is limited to an amount corresponding to the Swedish tax on the foreign income. Unutilised foreign taxes may be carried forward for five years. Tax treaty implications may exist.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Introduction of the concept of 'economic employer'
The Swedish government implemented the concept of ‘economic employer’ into Swedish tax law as of 1 January 2021. Previously, Sweden applied a more formal employer concept.
The new concept particularly applies when interpreting the so-called ‘183-days rule’ in tax treaties where Sweden is a contracting state. The regulations will, however, not impact employees working in Sweden for a maximum of 15 days in a row or 45 days in total during a calendar year.
## New rules on mandatory tax withholding
In addition to the introduction of the economic employer concept, new rules on on tax withholding for work performed in Sweden were introduced from 1 January 2021.
A withholding tax (WHT) obligation now applies for Swedish payers when making payments to a foreign company, or to a non-resident person, for work carried out in Sweden, unless the recipient of the payment is approved for F-tax (an F-tax certificate signifies that you are an entrepreneur who is responsible for paying your own taxes and contributions).

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Employment expenses
In principle, all expenses incurred during the fulfilment of the employment agreement are deductible (e.g. travel expenses, automobile expenses, living allowances on business trips, necessary literature, tools of the trade). The deduction related to cost-of-living allowances is, however, limited.
## Personal deductions
### Interest expenses
Interest costs paid to Swedish or non-Swedish lenders are deductible.
### Management costs
Management costs for the administration of investments are no longer deductible as from 1 January 2016.
### Pension insurance premiums and contributions
Personal pension insurance premiums and contributions to restricted pension savings accounts are deductible within certain limits, but only if the employee is not included in an employer funded company pension plan.
## Personal allowances
From the aggregate taxable income, basic allowance of SEK 16,800 to SEK 44,800 (2024) is granted.
## Losses
Losses from the sale of private real property, securities, etc. are generally only 50% or 70% deductible. A tax credit may be applicable in certain instances (*see the [Other tax credits and incentives](other-tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section*).

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Employment income
All remuneration from employment, whether in cash or in kind, is treated as taxable income. Director’s fees, bonuses, commissions, pensions, annuities, allowances, tax equalisation payments, and incentives (e.g. stock options, share programs) are considered as employment income. A housing benefit, a company car, and free meals are the major taxable benefits in kind. Compensation is normally taxed when paid out (cash principle). Specific rules apply for incentives that are subject to restrictions.
Premiums to employer pension plans, which do not qualify as tax favourable pension plans under Swedish law, may be considered taxable income for the employee.
Loans from an employer to an employee at low or no interest are deemed to generate a taxable benefit. The taxable benefit is deductible as an interest cost. Note that members of management and shareholders may not be allowed to lend money from the employer due to the Swedish financial assistance rules.
## Equity compensation
Employee stock options trigger taxation as employment income when exercised. The value of the benefit should be determined as the difference between the fair market value and the exercise price.
Favourable rules regarding qualified employee stock options are implemented in 2018. The rules apply to a very restricted type of small companies under very specific circumstances.
## Income from closely held companies
## Capital gains and investment income
Individuals resident in Sweden are taxed on capital gains realised during the period of residence. All current income from bank savings, financial instruments, claims of different kinds, dividends, and gains received by a resident person is taxable as investment income. For example, interest income, dividends, gains on the sale of stock and private property, and rental income from letting real estate or apartments are taxable.
Individuals who have been resident in Sweden continue to have a tax liability on capital gains from the disposal of, *inter alia*, Swedish stock and similar assets during a ten-year period after they leave Sweden. This time limit is reduced in several double taxation agreements (DTAs).
Non-resident individuals are taxed on Swedish source gains (e.g. capital gains on Swedish real estate and tenant owner’s apartments).
Investment income and capital gains are normally taxed at a 30% flat rate.
### Sale of real estate and apartments
A tax rate of 22% applies to the sale of private real property and tenant owner’s apartments. Under certain circumstances, it is possible to defer the taxation of gains, up to a certain amount, from selling a private real property when a new private real property (house or apartment) is bought either in Sweden or the EU/European Economic Area (EEA) area.
### Sale of stock
Capital gains on stocks are taxed at 30%. The taxable gain on the sale of stock is the net profit (i.e. the sales price less the average purchase price for all stock of the same kind). Only 70% of the calculated loss may normally be deducted.
For non-quoted shares, the tax rate is 25% since only 5/6 of the gain is taxable. The same applies for losses on non-quoted shares (i.e. only 5/6 of the calculated loss can be deducted at 70%).
### Sale of personal assets
Gains on the sale of personal assets are taxable only if they exceed SEK 50,000 per year. The acquisition cost of personal assets is either the real purchase price or, optionally, 25% of the sales price. Other assets are taxed on the net profit without the mentioned limitations.
Employee stock options generally do not qualify as securities and trigger taxation as employment income when exercised (*see Equity compensation above*). Sale of the underlying share is normally taxed as capital gains.
### Rental income
Worldwide rental income from the letting of private property is normally considered as capital income. Tax is assessed on annual rentals and other income received from the real property after deduction of related expenses. For private property (house), the related expenses are deemed to amount to a standard amount of SEK 40,000 and 20% of the annual rental income. Specific rules apply for letting apartments and if the house/apartment is let to the employer.
### Yield tax
Foreign endowment policies, such as life insurance policies and foreign pension insurances, that are owned by the individual are generally subject to an annual yield tax.
### Exchange of foreign currency
Exchange of foreign currency, as well as payment of debt in foreign currency, is generally taxable as investment income.

## Expert tax relief
Foreign experts and key personnel employed by a Swedish company or a non-Swedish company with a PE in Sweden may apply for  'expert tax relief'. The employment and stay in Sweden must be limited in time, and the employee must be a non-Swedish national and must not have been a Swedish tax resident at any point during the five calendar years prior to the year the employment in Sweden starts.
Under an alternative rule, the expert tax relief will be granted if the recurring income paid on a monthly basis exceeds two times the Swedish price base amount for the year the job in Sweden starts. For 2024, this corresponds to a monthly income exceeding SEK 114,600. However, recently the Swedish government decided that from 1st January 2025, the amount limit should be lowered to 1,5 times the price base amount, this corresponds to a monthly income exceeding SEK 88,200 for employment starting 31st of December 2024 or later.
If the tax relief is granted, it applies to all taxable compensation paid by the Swedish resident employer, including base salary, annual cash bonuses, equity compensation, and benefits in kind.
On 1 January 2024, the rules changed, and the period for which tax relief was granted was extended from five to seven years. Transitional rules apply.
## Credit for losses
If the total of investment income and capital gains/losses is negative, a tax credit of 30% of the net deficit not exceeding SEK 100,000 and 21% of the net deficit exceeding SEK 100,000 is granted against certain other taxes. The tax credit may not be carried forward.

# Sweden
## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
The following criteria can individually trigger taxable residence and taxation on the individual’s worldwide income:
## Five-year rule
Swedish citizens, as well as foreigners who have been resident in Sweden for at least ten years, are deemed resident in Sweden for tax purposes until they can prove that all important ties with Sweden have been broken. Five years after a taxpayer leaves Sweden, the burden of proof is reversed and the tax authorities must prove that ties still exist between the individual and Sweden.
## Six-month and one-year rule
Swedish residents who have been assigned to work abroad or who have taken up employment abroad with a planned duration of at least six months are not liable to Swedish income taxes on income from this employment, provided the income is taxed in the country of employment and the individual does not spend more than six days per month or a maximum of 72 days per 12-month period in Sweden. Part of a day counts as a full day in Sweden when counting the six days per month. Any income that is not taxed in the working country is normally taxed in Sweden. If the income is exempt from taxation in the working country under domestic legislation, the income can be tax exempt in Sweden if the stay abroad lasts for at least one year.
The Supreme Administrative Court has recently made a statement regarding the possible tax exemption for non-residents. They decided on 25 October 2022 not to review dispensation to an appeal regarding a decision made by the Court of Appeal, which leaves the previous rulings fixed.
Previous case law has stated that EU-citizens that are non-residents in Sweden got to apply a tax exemption (six-month rule tax exemption) since the requirement on tax residency was in conflict with article 45 in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the concept of free movement of workers.
The question in the court case was if such rules where discriminatory against non-EU-citizens if they were to be treated differently, in accordance with double taxation agreements following the OECD guidelines. The ruling concluded that it was not on the basis of nationality but on non-tax residency and that such criteria were not directly discriminatory and not against the double taxation agreements. Non-EU-citizens were therefore taxable in Sweden from work earned through work abroad where the income was received after arrival to Sweden, such as with incentive disbursements or bonus payments.
## Permanent residence
The Swedish Tax Agency (Skatteverket) has proposed a new definition of "permanent residence" (stadigvarande vistelse) in the Income Tax Act (1999:1229). This proposal aims to clarify and simplify the application of tax regulations, thereby increasing predictability for individuals and entities involved. Under the current system, determining whether an individual is considered to have a permanent residence in Sweden can be complex. The existing criteria require a continuous stay of at least six months, including temporary absences. However, the lack of a precise definition has led to difficulties in application, especially for individuals who frequently travel between Sweden and other countries.
According to the proposal, a stay in Sweden will be considered permanent if it exceeds:
1. 160 days in a calendar year, or
2. 120 days in a calendar year, provided that the individual also stayed in Sweden for more than 120 days in the preceding calendar year.
Only days that include an overnight stay (dygnsvila) will be counted as residence days. The proposed regulations are scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2025. However, as of today, the Swedish Parliament has not yet made a final decision on the matter. The legislative process is still ongoing, and it remains uncertain when or if the parliament will approve the proposals.
