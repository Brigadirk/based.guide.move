## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 16 April 2024
Individuals, whether New Caledonian or foreign nationals, who have their tax domicile in New Caledonia are generally subject to personal income tax (PIT) on worldwide income (unless provided otherwise by a tax treaty between France and New Caledonia). Individuals who are not domiciled in New Caledonia (non-residents) are generally subject to tax only on their income arising in New Caledonia.
## Personal income tax rates
### Resident individuals
Each category of income is combined and, after deduction of allowances, is taxed at progressive rates. Total income is split according to family status (i.e. 'the more children you have, the less tax you pay’). Under income-splitting rules, total taxable income is divided by the number of shares awarded to the taxpayer: generally one share for a single person, two shares for a married taxpayer without children, one share and a half for a widow with dependent children, half a share for each dependent child, and one full share for handicapped children or children studying abroad.
However, the tax saved from income splitting is generally limited to XPF 300,000.
For residents, progressive income tax rates are then applied as follows:
| Taxable income (XPF) | | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 1,000,000 | 0 |
| 1,000,000 | 1,800,000 | 4 |
| 1,800,000 | 3,000,000 | 12 |
| 3,000,000 | 4,500,000 | 25 |
| 4,500,000 |  | 40 |
Certain corrections must be made afterwards in order to determine the net tax liability. For instance, the tax credits must be applied as well as any foreign tax credits.
### Non-resident individuals
Generally, income derived by non-resident individuals is subject to a flat tax rate (*prélèvement forfaitaire*) of 25%. This tax applies to very broad types of revenues, notably employment and business or professional related income, pensions, investment income (unless subject to tax on financial incomes [IRVM]), royalties, and income from immovable property.
A taxpayer is allowed to claim for the application of the progressive tax rate (as for resident) if one is in position to demonstrate that the progressive PIT would have been less than 25%.
## Tax on financial incomes (IRVM)
The IRVM (*impôt sur le revenue des valeurs mobilières*) applies, at a theoretical rate of 11.5%, to the income distributed (or deemed distributed) by companies or entities subject to CIT in New Caledonia.
IRVM is due on all incomes distributed mentioned in Article Lp. 529 of local tax code (e.g. dividends, interest). Some entities are expressly exempted from IRVM.
## Income tax on debts, deposits, and guarantees (IRCDC)
The IRCDC (*impôt sur le revenue des créances, dépôt et cautionnements*) applies at 8% on interest, arrears, mortgage, privileged and unsecured debts having the characteristic of a money loan, cash guarantees, associates' current accounts, deposits of sums of money, on demand or with fixed maturity, whatever the depositary and whatever the use of the deposit (bonds, capitalisation contracts, etc.) There are exemptions provided by Art. Lp. 555 of the local tax code.
## Caledonian solidarity contribution (CCS)
The CCS is applicable to various kinds of income. It applies on securities products for natural or legal persons subject to the IRVM, on savings products for those subject to the tax on income from debts, deposits, and guarantees (IRCDC), on gaming proceeds for those subject to the tax on gaming proceeds, and on private real estate capital gains for those subject to the tax on private real estate capital gains (PVI).
The CCS rates are as follows:

# New Caledonia
## Overview
Last reviewed - 16 April 2024
New Caledonia is a group of French islands and archipelagos located in the South Pacific Ocean. The capital city of New Caledonia is Nouméa, and the official language is French.
The local currency used in New Caledonia is the Pacific franc, also known as the CFP (*Communauté Française du Pacifique*) franc (XPF).
New Caledonia is governed by a specific constitutional regime (Articles 76 and 77 of the French Constitution) and benefits from a broad autonomy from France. However, independence from France has been rejected notably by a referendum held in December 2021.
The institutions of New Caledonia are Congress, the Government, the Customary Senate, the Economic, Social and Environmental Council, and the Customary Councils.
The State is represented by the High Commissioner of the Republic.
New Caledonia is divided into three provinces: the North Province, the South Province, and the Loyalty Islands Province. The provinces and the communes are territorial authorities. Each province has a deliberative assembly and has representatives in Congress. The law also recognises customary areas.
New Caledonia benefits from a tax autonomy from France, and the Congress is adopting its own tax laws that are gathered in a local tax code (i.e. the New Caledonia Tax Code, NCTC). The local tax administration is entitled to proceed with tax audits and has developed its own tax doctrine.
It is important to note that New Caledonia has entered into only one tax treaty, with France.

# New Caledonia
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 16 April 2024
## Taxable period
Generally, the New Caledonian tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December.
## Tax returns
In order to establish income tax, every person with taxable income subject to this tax is required to file and send a detailed declaration of their income and profits from the previous year and their family expenses to the individual or professional income tax office, according to the category of income declared, each year before 1 April.
This declaration is, if necessary, accompanied by various declarations provided for in terms of categorical income.
However, this deadline is extended to 30 April for taxpayers subject to the actual profit regime (*bénéfice réel*) provided for in articles 76, 78, Lp.82, and 105 of the tax code.
This deadline is extended to 30 June for taxpayers who do not have their tax domicile in New Caledonia.
The income declaration filed electronically must reach the administration by 30 June at the latest, according to a schedule and modalities set by a government decree.
## Payment of tax
Individuals must make two preliminary payments, each amounting to one-third of the total tax paid in the last fiscal year. These payments should be made by 31 March and 15 July of each fiscal year. Typically, any remaining tax owed is paid in October, which is when the tax authorities issue a payment notice.
## Tax audit process
The tax administration may conduct an audit of an individual's overall tax situation with respect to income tax. During this audit, the administration may check the consistency between, on the one hand, the income declared and, on the other hand, the taxpayer's assets, cash position, and lifestyle elements.
The audit of an individual's overall tax situation may not extend over a period longer than one year, counted from the receipt or delivery of the notice of review.
## Statute of limitations
For income tax, corporate tax, the solidarity tax on services, the tax on financial transactions, and the TGC, the tax administration's right of recovery is exercised until the end of the third year following the one for which the tax is due. For the solidarity tax on services, the tax on financial transactions, and the TGC, when the fiscal year does not correspond to the calendar year, the recovery period starts from the beginning of the first period over which the right of recovery applies in terms of income tax or corporate tax and ends on 31 December of the third year following the one in which this period ends.

# New Caledonia
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 16 April 2024
## General consumption tax (TGC)
The TGC (*taxe Générale sur la consummation*) is a value-added tax (VAT)-like tax that is applied to the consumer prices of goods and services since 1 October 2018 in New Caledonia.
TGC is due on goods sold and services rendered in New Caledonia. There are four rates of TGC:
Supplies of goods outside New Caledonia and certain specific services invoiced to foreign clients are, in principle, exempt from TGC.
Business-to-business (B2B) suppliers of services are generally taxable at the location of the customer and not at the location of the supplier. For business-to-consumer (B2C) supplies of services, the place of taxation is generally where the supplier is established / where the services are realised.
Some transactions are TGC exempted, such as:
## Customs duties
Customs duties are levied on the import of goods.
In New Caledonia, these duties, called ‘*ad valorem’*, range from 0% (‘exempt’) to 20% maximum.
Goods originating from certain countries (‘preferential origin’) may also be exempt from customs duties. This is the case, in particular, for goods imported from metropolitan France, the European Union (EU), or the ‘*Pays et territoires d’outre-mer’*, provided that their origin is justified in accordance with the conditions laid down by the regulations.
## Excise taxes
The license fee (*droits de license*) applies to businesses and professions whose purpose is the production or sale, in any capacity, of distilled or fermented alcoholic beverages or of fermented hygienic drinks.
There is a tax on alcohol and tobacco applying to alcoholic beverages from local production and to products of the tobacco monopoly.
The domestic consumption tax on local products and manufacturing (*taxe sur la consummation intérieure* or TCI) applies to alcoholic beverages and products based on alcohol of any origin and source harvested or manufactured in New Caledonia.
## Real estate tax
The real estate tax (*contribution foncière des propriétés bâties et non bâties*) is a tax established on the ownership of land and buildings that varies according to the municipalities, neighborhoods, and type of construction.
The property tax is due for the entire year, without the possibility of splitting, according to the situation existing on 1 January of the tax year, in the name of the owner, the usufructuary, the long-term leaseholder, or the construction leaseholder or similar. Therefore, in the case of a sale during the year, the tax established during the year of sale remains due by the seller.
The tax base depends on the type of land, building, properties and equipment. The applicable rates range between 8.40% for buildings and 0.7875% for unbuilt properties. The tax should be determine based on the reduction applicable and considering the taxation applied by municipalities and provinces.
Please note that:
## Registration duties
Registration fees (*droits d’enregistrement*), either fixed or proportional, are levied on certain legal transactions: sales of real estate, businesses, donations, inheritances, etc.
They allow to date precisely the formality of registration. The duties are calculated on the sum that represents the amount of the transaction. In case of sale, it is the sale price stipulated or the fair market value if it is higher than the price. For successions or donations, it is the fair market value.
### Transfer of goodwill
The transfer of goodwill is subject to a registration duty at a rate of 4% on the part of the transfer price that is higher than XPF 5 million. If the transfer price is under XPF 5 million, a fixed registration fee of XPF 7,000 is applicable.
### Transfers of shares
The transfer of shares is subject to registration duty at a rate of 1%, subject to a cap of XPF 500,000.
### Transfer of interest or quotas in legal entities whose capital is not divided into shares
The transfer of interests or quotas in legal entities whose capital is not divided into shares (e.g. *Société à responsabilité limitée* [SARLs] or *Société en nom collectif* [SNCs], which are a form of private limited liability corporate entity) is subject to a registration duty of 1% with no cap. A tax rebate is applied for each transferred security, equal to (XPF 5 million x the number of acquired securities) / the total number of securities.
### Transfer of shares in non-quoted real estate companies
The transfer of shares in non-quoted companies whose assets consist principally of immovable property (or rights related to such immovable property) is subject to a registration duty of 4% with no cap.
### Transfer of real estate
The sale of land and buildings is subject to registration duty at a rate of 4% on the transfer price. Some reduced rates and specific regimes exist.
### Other formalities
Registration duties are not due on the incorporation of a company, except when capital contributions consist in real estate properties or movable properties.
Capital increases are subject to registration duties (ranging from XPF 25,000 to XPF 50,000 depending on the capital of the company).
## Stamp taxes
The stamp duty tax is levied on all papers intended for civil, administrative, and legal acts, and on documents that may be mentioned in the context of a judgment and provide evidence. It is also levied on all acts that have already borne the stamp and registration duties in France or abroad; it is only collected to the extent that there is a difference in the rate to be collected for the benefit of New Caledonia. Perception occurs cumulatively with the fixed and proportional fees for registration. The stamp duties are up to XPF 15,000.
## Capital gains taxes
The government has implemented a tax on private real estate capital gains (PVI). It is a tax due when an individual or a partnership (e.g. an SCI) sells a real estate property, as long as the property has increased in value between the date of acquisition and the date of sale. This tax is 20% of the amount of the capital gain, to which must be added 4% the CCS, making it a total of 24%. There are a number of exemptions and specific rules for calculating the amount of the tax.
Capital gains and profits made by corporate entities, regardless of their form, established outside of New Caledonia or without a stable establishment or a head office in New Caledonia, are also subject to the PVI.
## Social security contributions
The New Caledonian social security system is composed of various schemes providing a wide range of benefits. This system includes social security basic coverage, unemployment benefits, complementary retirement plans, death/disability coverage, and complementary health coverage. The contributions are based on the remunerations, and monthly thresholds are applicable to determine the rate, which ranges from 0.2% to 11.67%.
Employers have to pay these social contributions notably to the CAFAT (*Caisse de compensation des prestations familiales, des accidents du travail et de prévoyance des travailleurs de Nouvelle-Calédonie*).
## Training contribution
A training contribution (*contribution des employeurs sur les salaires au titre de la formation professionnelle*) is due on wages at a 0.25% rate.
## Business licence duty
Taxation of the business license (*contribution des patentes*) is compulsory for any natural or legal person who undertakes in New Caledonia the exercise of a trade, an industry, or a profession, for their own account and for profit.
It is calculated annually depending on the type and characteristics of the professional activity and is made up of a fixed fee (composed of a fixed tariff and additional tariffs) and a proportional duty (based on customs). If a company carries out its activity through several establishments, it will have to pay as many licences as it has establishments.
## Insurance premiums tax (IPT)
Companies are required, before starting their operations, to provide the professional tax service or the business formalities center with a declaration of existence stating the nature of these operations.
Any agreement with an insurance company or with any other French or foreign insurer insuring a risk in New Caledonia is subject to IPT (*taxe sur les conventions d’assurance*). The tax rate is set at 7%. The tax is applicable on all the amounts paid to the insurer (premiums and its accessories). Some risks are exempted from IPT, such as life insurances or reinsurance contracts.
Please note that additional contributions should apply based on the French Tax Code.
## Financial transaction tax
The tax on financial transactions (*taxe sur les opérations financières*) is due on financial transactions, which applies to interest, arrears, and all other income received by financial institutions and banks carrying out an activity in New Caledonia, in terms of mortgage debts, cash guarantees, current account following credit openings by banks and financial institutions.
Exemptions are applicable under certain conditions in the context, notably, of agricultural credits and real estate loans.
The tax is applicable at a 6% rate.
## Entertainment and gambling tax
The gambling tax (*taxe sur les produits des jeux*) is applicable on incomes arising from gambling houses and games, at a rate ranging from 0.5% to 20%, depending on the gambling activity.
## Solidarity tax on services
The solidarity tax on services (*taxe de solidarité sur les services* or TSS) applies to services provided by companies carrying out an activity in mining fields (only for supply of services with a tax point after 1 October 2018) at a 5% rate.
## *Centimes additionnels*
The municipal councils of the communes of New Caledonia are authorised to collect additional centimes applicable to the business licence, real estate tax, registration duties, and on IRVM.
## *Tax on sweets products*
The tax on sweet products came into effect on September 1, 2024.
The tax is payable by the importer or local supplier of sweet products at the time of importation, or by the producer at the time of the first delivery for products resulting from a local transformation process. The tax rate depends on the sugar content per 100 grams (g) or 100 millilitres (ml).

The contributions are based on the remunerations, and monthly thresholds are applicable to determine the rate, which ranges from 0.2% to 11.67%.

Capital gains derived by individuals are generally not taxable. However, the New Caledonian government has recently implemented a taxation on capital gain deriving from real properties.
The tax on private real estate capital gains (PVI) is a tax due when an individual or a partnership (e.g. an SCI) sells real estate, as long as this property has experienced an increase in value between its date of acquisition and that of its transfer. This tax is 20% of the amount of the capital gain, to which must be added 4% of the CCS, or 24% in total. There are a number of exemptions and special rules for calculating the amount of tax.

TGC is due on goods sold and services rendered in New Caledonia. There are four rates of TGC:
Supplies of goods outside New Caledonia and certain specific services invoiced to foreign clients are, in principle, exempt from TGC.
Some transactions are TGC exempted, such as:
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There is no net wealth tax.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
New Caledonian inheritance or gift tax may be due by beneficiaries of gifts or inheritance. If the deceased or the donor is a tax resident of New Caledonia, tax will be due in New Caldonia on worldwide assets transmitted. If the deceased or donor is not a tax resident of New Caldonia, tax will be due on new Caledonian assets transmitted.
Inheritance tax is levied on assets at their fair market value, with allowances taking into account the relationship between the deceased and the beneficiary. Debts existing at the time of death are generally deductible in full.
No inheritance tax is due for inheritance between spouses (or partner of a *Pacte civil de solidarité* [PACS]) and for inheritance between brothers and sisters living together under specific conditions.

# New Caledonia
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 16 April 2024
The tax authorities in New Caledonia comprise the following:
## Taxable period
The ordinary taxable period is equal to 12 months. Conformity with the calendar year is not requested. In particular cases, the duration of the taxable period can be different from 12 months (e.g. newly established companies are allowed to have taxable periods longer than 12 months).
## Tax returns
Taxpayers must file a tax return within four months after the end of the fiscal year (i.e. by 30 of April). When the annual turnover of the previous fiscal year exceeded XPF 10 million, e-filing requirement applies.
## Payment of tax
CIT is prepaid in two instalments that are payable by the end of the 7th and 11th months of the fiscal year. They are calculated based on 1/3 of CIT paid the previous tax year. The balance of CIT is due four months after the end of the financial year. Note that companies carrying out mining and metallurgical activities are required to make four advance payments.
E-payment requirements are applicable to companies with turnover exceeding XPF 10 million during the previous year.
E-reporting requirements will progressively enter into force, and all companies should be subject to this requirement by 1 January 2026.
### Interest and penalties
Late payment is subject to late interest computed at a rate of 0.4% per month late (4.80% per year).
Late filing is subject to a fixed penalty of XPF 25,000 and to a 10% penalty.
Moreover, a penalty of 40% applies in case of bad faith and is increased to 80% in case of fraud.
## Tax audit process
The New Caledonian tax authorities are responsible for verifying that taxpayers’ obligations are correctly complied with and, if necessary, for making adjustments by issuing tax assessments.
Once an assessment is notified by the tax inspector and if the taxpayer disagrees with such an assessment, the taxpayer has 30 days to answer and to provide comments to the New Caledonian tax authorities.
In cases where the disagreement between the New Caledonian tax authorities and the taxpayer still remains, the taxpayer can file a claim with the local courts.
New Caledonia has implemented criminal rules applicable to tax matters.
Regularisation processes, in some circumstances, are facilitated with application of lower penalties.
## Abuse of law
To restore their true character, the New Caledonian tax authorities are entitled to disregard, as not being enforceable against it, acts that constitute an abuse of law (i) either because these acts are fictitious or (ii) because, by seeking to benefit from a literal application of the laws or decisions against the objectives sought by their authors, these acts could not have been inspired by any other purpose than avoiding or mitigating the tax burden that the party concerned would normally have borne, given its actual situation or activities, had these acts not been executed or committed.
## Statute of limitations
For CIT, solidarity tax on services, tax on financial transactions, and TGC, the right of recovery of the tax administration is exercised until the end of the third year following the year for which the tax is due.
PEs in New Caledonia, income deemed distributed to the head office, deduction for CIT purposes of head office expenses, and TGC are standard elements reviewed during tax audit.
## The ruling system
In case of written request from a taxpayer, tax authorities must issue a response within six months. The lack of response from the tax authorities means their implicit agreement with the interpretation drafted by the taxpayer, provided that the request was submitted before the relevant activity or transaction takes place.

# New Caledonia
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 16 April 2024
A resident company is subject to corporate income tax (so-called ‘corporate income tax on companies and metallurgical or mining activities’; CIT) in New Caledonia on its New Caledonian-source income (deriving from an activity performed in New Caledonia or entities having their head office in New Caledonia). Taxable income in New Caledonia could also results from the application of a double tax treaty (DTT) between New Caledonia and another country.
New Caledonia levies CIT at a 35% rate for metallurgical or mining activities. For other corporates, CIT is levied at a 30% rate (that could be reduced to 15% depending on turnover thresholds). Even though the government has announced its wish to progressively reduce the standard CIT rate, no law has been enacted in this regard.
## Additional contribution on corporate income tax (CAIS)
The CAIS (*contribution additonnelle à l’impôt sur les sociétés*) applies at a 3% rate to the income distributed (or deemed distributed) by corporations or entities subject to the CIT whenever the amount of the income distributed during a fiscal year exceeds XPF 30 million.
## Additional Social Contribution (CSA)
The Additional Social Contribution (*Contribution Sociale Additionnelle*) applies, at a progressive tax rate from 5% to 15% (depending on the profits), to legal entities subject to the CIT and whose taxable income at the standard rate (30%) reaches or exceeds XPF 200 million. This contribution is not deductible from the taxable income for CIT.
## Tax on financial incomes (IRVM)
The IRVM (*impôt sur le revenue des valeurs mobilières*) applies, at a theoretical rate of 11.5%, to the income distributed (or deemed distributed) by companies or entities subject to CIT in New Caledonia.
IRVM is due on all incomes distributed mentioned in Article Lp. 529 of the local tax code (e.g. dividends, interest). Some entities are expressly exempted from IRVM.
## Income tax on debts, deposits, and guarantees  (IRCDC)
The IRCDC (*impôt sur le revenue des créances, dépôt et cautionnements*) applies at 8% on interest, arrears, mortgage, privileged and unsecured debts having the characteristic of a money loan, cash guarantees, associates' current accounts, and deposits of sums of money, on demand or with fixed maturity, whatever the depositary and whatever the use of the deposit (bonds, capitalisation contracts, etc.). There are exemptions provided by Art. Lp. 555 of the local tax code.
## Caledonian solidarity contribution (CCS)
The CCS is levied, at a rate ranging from 2% to 4%, notably on the income from securities for natural or legal persons subject to the IRVM, and on the private real estate capital gains for those subject to the tax on private real estate capital gains (PVI).

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 16 April 2024
## Social security contributions
The New Caledonian social security system is composed of various schemes providing a wide range of benefits. This system includes social security basic coverage, unemployment benefits, complementary retirement plans, death/disability coverage, and complementary health coverage. The contributions are based on the remunerations, and monthly thresholds are applicable to determine the rate, which ranges from 0.2% to 11.67%.
## Capital gains taxes
Capital gains derived by individuals are generally not taxable. However, the New Caledonian government has recently implemented a taxation on capital gain deriving from real properties.
The tax on private real estate capital gains (PVI) is a tax due when an individual or a partnership (e.g. an SCI) sells real estate, as long as this property has experienced an increase in value between its date of acquisition and that of its transfer. This tax is 20% of the amount of the capital gain, to which must be added 4% of the CCS, or 24% in total. There are a number of exemptions and special rules for calculating the amount of tax.
## General consumption tax (TGC)
The TGC (*taxe Générale sur la consummation*) is a value-added tax (VAT)-like tax that is applied to the consumer prices of goods and services since 1 October 2018 in New Caledonia.
TGC is due on goods sold and services rendered in New Caledonia. There are four rates of TGC:
Supplies of goods outside New Caledonia and certain specific services invoiced to foreign clients are, in principle, exempt from TGC.
Some transactions are TGC exempted, such as:
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There is no net wealth tax.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
New Caledonian inheritance or gift tax may be due by beneficiaries of gifts or inheritance. If the deceased or the donor is a tax resident of New Caledonia, tax will be due in New Caldonia on worldwide assets transmitted. If the deceased or donor is not a tax resident of New Caldonia, tax will be due on new Caledonian assets transmitted.
Inheritance tax is levied on assets at their fair market value, with allowances taking into account the relationship between the deceased and the beneficiary. Debts existing at the time of death are generally deductible in full.
No inheritance tax is due for inheritance between spouses (or partner of a *Pacte civil de solidarité* [PACS]) and for inheritance between brothers and sisters living together under specific conditions.
Progressive tax rates (ranging from 5% to 20%) are applicable after a rebate of XPF 100,000 when beneficiaries are direct dependants (spouse or partner of a PACS).
Between non-related parties or non-direct dependants (siblings), the rate is ranging from 30% to 50%.
Life insurance contract are benefiting from a preferential tax regime when premiums has been paid by the deceased before they are 70.
Gift tax is subject to the same standard rules, but some differences could exist.
## Property taxes
The real estate tax is a tax established on the ownership of land and buildings, which varies according to the municipalities, neighborhoods, and type of construction.
Real estate property tax is levied on:
The principal tax is obtained by successively multiplying the surface area of the land or construction (gross surface area) by the rate per area or m2 (to determine the tax base) then, by the rate of 8.40% for buildings and 0.7875% for land.
## Business licence duty
Taxation of the business license (*contribution des patentes*) is compulsory for any natural or legal person who undertakes in New Caledonia the exercise of a trade, an industry, or a profession, for their own account and for profit.
It is calculated annually depending on the type and characteristics of the professional activity and is made up of a fixed fee (composed of a fixed tariff and additional tariffs) and a proportional duty (based on customs). If a company carries out its activity through several establishments, it will have to pay as many licences as it has establishments.

# New Caledonia
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 16 April 2024
## Inventory valuation
Inventories must be valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost must be determined in accordance with the first in first out (FIFO) or the average-cost method. The last in first out (LIFO) method is prohibited.
## Capital gains
Capital gains from the sale of fixed assets are subject to separate regimes depending on whether they are realised in the short or long term.
The short-term capital gains regime is applicable:
The short-term capital losses regime applies:
Capital gains that do not meet short-term capital gains conditions are deemed to be long-term capital gains.
Transfers of securities included in the portfolio are deemed to relate in priority to securities of the same nature acquired or subscribed on the earliest date.
The long-term capital gains regime is applicable to proceeds from the transfer of patents, processes, and techniques, as well as to concessions of exclusive operating licences.
The net amount of long-term capital gains is taxed at a 15% CIT rate, with the exception of capital gains from the sale of building land and similar assets (as well as securities of companies whose assets are mainly constituted by this type of assets), the amount of which is taxed at a 25% CIT rate. Capital gains subject to tax at the rate of 15% or 25%, reduced by the amount of this tax, are placed in a special reserve.
Any excess of long-term capital losses can only be set off against long-term capital gains realised during the following ten financial years.
The net amount of short-term capital gains can be distributed equally over the year of their realisation and over the following two years. Where applicable, the excess of short-term capital losses recorded during a financial year is deducted from the profits of the financial year.
## Dividend income
Dividends received by companies based outside New Caledonia are taxable as ordinary income and subject to CIT at the standard rate. However, if the beneficiary holds at least 10% of the distributing company for four years (two years before and two years after), these dividends are not included in the taxable base, except a lump sum of 10%.
Dividends received from companies based in New-Caledonia are, without any condition, tax exempted.
The withholding tax (WHT) paid in the country of the distributing company is considered as a tax credit.
## Interest income
Interest income generally is taxable as ordinary income and subject to CIT at the standard rate.
## Royalty income
Royalties are, in principle, subject to CIT at the standard rate (plus additional social contribution if relevant).
## Foreign income
Resident corporations are not taxed on foreign-source income derived from activities carried out abroad through foreign branches and foreign PEs. Other foreign income is not taxable until actually repatriated to French-resident corporations. As a result, undistributed income of foreign subsidiaries is not taxable.

# New Caledonia
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 16 April 2024
As a general rule, a resident company is a company that is incorporated under New Caledonian/French commercial laws.
The notion of a business carried on in New Caledonia means the habitual exercise of an activity that can either be carried out within an autonomous establishment or be performed through representatives who are economically or legally dependent or result from the completion of transactions forming a full commercial cycle.
However, for insurance activities, the business is considered as carried on in New Caledonia for the insurance products that are distributed locally.
The profits arising from transactions carried out by Caledonian businesses in establishments that they own outside of New Caledonia are not taken into account for CIT. Therefore, related expenses and losses are not deductible from the profits subject to CIT.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 16 April 2024
## Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation is allowed as a deductible expense from taxable profits when it meets the following conditions:
Depreciation ceases to be tax deductible when it has reached, in total, the amount of the cost price. The cost price to be used generally means the actual acquisition price that the item involved for the company, as it results in principle from the accounting.
In the straight-line system, the annual depreciation to be deducted from the results of each fiscal year is calculated by applying to the cost price the rate corresponding to the normal duration of use of the element.
Equipment goods whose normal useful life is at least three years and industrial or agricultural buildings whose normal useful life does not exceed 15 years can be depreciated using the declining-balance method.
The coefficient applicable to the linear depreciation rate is, for each fixed asset, set at:
## Start-up expenses
The New Caledonian law provides specific rules for certain new companies, particularly when they set up in a free zone or when they can be qualified as young innovative companies (*jeunes entreprises innovantes*).
## Interest expenses
Interest paid to shareholders for the sums they leave or make available to the company, in addition to their share of the capital, whatever the form of the company, is deductible within the higher of the following two rates:
The legal interest rate is the rate determined by Article L. 313-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code.
This deduction is subject to the condition that the capital has been fully paid up.
## Charitable contributions
As a general principle, charitable donations are not tax deductible for CIT purposes. However, they may entitle one to an incentive (*see the [Tax credits and incentives](tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for more information regarding the charitable donations tax reduction*).
## Payments to directors
The fixed allowances that a company grants to its directors or executives of its company for representation and travel expenses are not deductible from tax results when these expenses already include the usual expenses of this nature reimbursed to the interested parties. Moreover, expenses that are excessive and not incurred for business purposes, including direct or indirect remuneration, paid to directors or persons with the highest remuneration in the company are not deductible from the taxable result.
## Fines and penalties
As a general principle, fines and penalties are not tax deductible for CIT purposes.
## Taxes
The TSS and the CAIS are not tax deductible for CIT purposes.
## Other significant items
Overhead costs of any kind are generally tax deductible for CIT purposes. However, companies having their head office or effective management outside New Caledonia may deduct from the amount of their taxable profit the share of general expenses incurred at the place of the head office or management relating to activities carried out in New Caledonia, within the limit of 5% of the amount of external services required by said activities. This deduction is subject to the following cumulative conditions:
When these conditions are not met, the share of the costs deducted is reinstated in taxable income without a rectification proposal.
At the first request from the administration, a justification of the interest of the costs for the business operated in New Caledonia is produced within three months.
Royalties that mining companies pay to shareholders who have, directly or indirectly, a majority stake in the company's capital are not deductible for the purposes of CIT.
## Net operating losses
### Carryforward of tax losses
Tax losses can be offset against long-term capital gain of the fiscal year.
Tax losses carried forward are available to offset the entire taxable profits of the following fiscal years and can be carried forward indefinitely.
### Carryback of tax losses
As a general principle, carryback of tax losses is not allowed, except for metallurgical and mining companies.
## Payments to foreign entities

## Transfer pricing
Profits indirectly transferred outside New Caledonia, either by increasing or decreasing purchase or sale prices or by any other means, are incorporated into the results recorded by the accounts.
When, during a tax audit, the tax services department has gathered elements leading to the presumption that a company has made an indirect transfer of profits, it may request this company information and documents specifying:
## Thin capitalisation
There are no specific thin capitalisation rules in New Caledonia. *Please see Interest expenses in the [Deductions](deductions.html) section*.

# New Caledonia
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 16 April 2024
CIT rates on branch profits are the same as on corporate profits. As a principle, branch profits are deemed to be distributed to the head office.
Deemed distributed income are also subject to IRVM at a 10% rate, CCS at a 5% rate, and to *centimes additionnels* (communal tax), and the CAIS at a 3% rate would also apply, depending on the deemed distributed profits amount.
In a judgment of 29 December 2023, the Council of State stated that the DTT concluded between France and New Caledonia provides that the profits made by a permanent establishment (PE) in New Caledonia cannot, after having borne the CIT, be subject to a tax whose rate exceeds 10%. This judgment directly targets the case of taxpayers submitting income earned through a PE in New Caledonia to both the IRVM and the CAIS.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 16 April 2024
## Specific tax credit applicable to mining or metallurgical activities
Mining companies may benefit from various tax incentives for mining or metallurgical investments projects in New Caledonia.
Companies carrying out these activities are subject to CIT at a rate of 35%. However, they are benefiting from specific incentives, such as:
The R&D tax credit is determined on the basis of the eligible R&D expenses incurred during the calendar year.
The R&D tax credit is determined on the basis of R&D projects qualified as eligible and is equal to 30% of the sum of qualifying R&D expenses (until December 2024). The R&D tax credit is capped at XPF 5 million.
## Tax reduction on charitable donations
For charitable donations, the tax reduction amounts to 60% of the amount of the payments. For the calculation of the reduction, the amount of the payments is taken into account within the limit of 5 per thousand of turnover.
Donations and charitable contributions are not deductible for CIT purposes. The tax reduction on charitable donation can be offset against the CIT liability payable by the taxpayer with respect to the financial year during which the donations were granted.
## Loans for acquisition of principal residence
Credit institutions (as defined by Art.  511-1 of monetary and financial French Code) liable to CIT in New Caledonia may benefit from a tax credit for repayable advances not bearing interest, issued between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2030 and granted to individuals subject to resource conditions, for the acquisition or construction of a main residence located in New Caledonia as a first property purchase and paid during the tax year or financial year.
The amount of the tax credit is equal to the discounted sum of the differences between the monthly payments due for the interest-free repayable advance and the monthly payments of a loan granted under normal rate conditions on the date of issue of the tax credit.
## Foreign tax credit
Under the DTT signed between New Caledonia and France, several methods have been established to avoid double taxation depending on the revenues:  deduction of a tax credit from tax effectively paid, a tax exemption, or the exclusive right to tax.

## France and the United States (US) sign bilateral agreement on the implementation of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
New-Caledonia and the United States signed a bilateral intergovernmental agreement (IGA) intended to implement FATCA. FATCA was enacted by the United States in 2010 to combat offshore tax evasion by US persons.
The New Caledonian government has committed to drafting local laws and regulations to implement FATCA among all financial institutions resident in New Caledonia. Broadly speaking, the banking, life insurance, and asset management industries will be most affected, but certain estate (patrimonial) vehicles, holding companies, as well as hedging, finance, and treasury centres of non-financial groups could also be impacted, depending on the nature of their activities.

## Real estate capital gains
The government has implemented a tax on private real estate capital gains (PVI). It is a tax due when an individual or a partnership (e.g. an SCI) sells a real estate property, as long as the property has increased in value between the date of acquisition and the date of sale. This tax is 20% of the amount of the capital gain, to which must be added 4% for the New Caledonian solidarity contribution (CCS), making it a total of 24%. There are a number of exemptions and specific rules for calculating the amount of the tax.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 16 April 2024
## Employment income
Employment income is widely defined and includes all employment benefits provided by the employer, whether in cash or in kind. Business expense reimbursements are not taxable. Benefits-in-kind are, as a general rule, included in income at market value. Moreover, employment income also includes the indemnities, reimbursements, and lump-sum allowances for expenses paid to members of the management board or managers of companies.
## Business income
Profits or gains derived from trades, professions, or vocations carried out in New Caledonia are subject to tax regardless of whether the individual is resident of New Caledonia. If the individual is resident in New Caledonia, a liability may also arise on profits or gains on activities carried out abroad unless tax treaties provided otherwise.
## Capital gains
## Dividend income
Dividends received from resident companies are not subject to PIT. However, the following withholding taxes (WHTs) amount to 20%: IRVM (11.5%), CCS (4%), and *centimes additionnels* (4.5%).
## Interest income
Interest and related income are subject to the IRCDC (8%) and the CCS (4%).
## Rental income
Rental income is equal to the difference between the gross rent and the costs representing property expenses.
