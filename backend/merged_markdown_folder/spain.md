## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
Temporary reductions in rates can apply for specific reasons (e.g. for sanitary reasons, for economic reasons, etcetera). On the other hand, certain activities are VAT exempt , including, among others, financial and/or insurance activities, medical activities, educational services.. These activities do not grant the right to deduct input VAT..
Having said that, intra-EU supplies of goods and export of goods provided are VAT exempt and grant the right to deduct input VAT if certain requirements are met.
In the Canary Islands, a specific tax is applied instead of VAT, called the Canary Island General Indirect Tax (IGIC). IGIC is pretty similar to VAT although there are some differences, mainly in relation to the applicable rates that are normally lower than VAT. Guidelines given by the Spanish mainland authorities are normally also followed by the authorities in the Canary Islands .
In Ceuta and Melilla, a specific sales tax called IPSI is applied. IPSI has rules which are different from  VAT and, generally  its application is confined to  certain activities/taxable events
## Customs duties
Goods imported into Spain from outside the European Union are subject to customs duties. The rates are established by the EU’s Common Customs Tariff and vary widely.
The amount of  duties payable mainly depends on three elements: (i) the tariff classification of the imported product, (ii) the country of origin of the product, and (iii) the customs value of the goods imported that is based on the price paid or payable for the  imported product (however, specific rules determine such value and positive/negative adjustments with respect to the price paid or payable must be taken into account).
## Excise duties
Excise duties are chargeable on the following products: alcohol, hydrocarbon, coal, tobacco, electricity and certain means of transport.
Excise duties are payable on the aforementioned products or products containing them. Payment of excise duties takes place when the products are produced/obtained in Spain and when they are brought into Spain from outside Spain (either via an intra-EU acquisition or import). Strict requirements are applicable in terms of compliance and formal obligations, e.g..  keeping stock records, transport documents, authorizations to be obtained from the Spanish Excise Duties Authorities, filing of tax returns, filing of communications of specific circumstances, etcetera. Tax rates normally vary depending on the kind of product and its use, and some reduced rates and exemptions may also apply.
## Tax on non-reusable plastic packaging (Plastic Packaging Tax)
On 1 January 2023, the Plastic Packaging Tax entered into force. The taxable event is the manufacture, intra-EU acquisition, and import of non-reusable plastic packaging. The definition seems to be quite broad as it would include any kind of packaging containing plastic, including packaging for containing, protecting, distributing, or handling goods.
The tax rate is EUR 0.45 per kilogram of plastic included in such packaging.
If the packaging is manufactured within Spain, the taxpayer will be the manufacturer, who will have to charge the Plastic Packaging Tax on the first supply of the packaging. In the case of the introduction of non-reusable plastic packaging via intra-EU acquisition or import, the taxpayer will be the entrepreneur or entity performing the intra-EU acquisition or import, who will have to pay the Plastic Packaging Tax via the filing of specific periodical returns (for intra-EU acquisitions of plastic packaging or goods containing plastic packaging) or the import Single Administrative Document (SAD) (for imports of plastic packaging or goods containing plastic packaging).
Different tax benefits can be applied depending on the specific circumstances, including the following, among others:
For the effective application of the tax benefits, certain conditions have to be met and evidence should be provided to the tax authorities when necessary.
## Tax on tax-haven-resident companies owning real estate in Spain
Companies resident in a tax haven for tax purposes that own real estate or hold real property rights in Spain are subject to a special levy accrued on 31 December and declared and paid in January of the following year in the place and manner established by law. The tax is 3% of the assessed value of the real estate.
## Transfer tax
A transfer tax, with general rates of usually  4% t to 13%, depending on the region (in some regions it is a scale), is generally levied on *inter vivos* transfers, including real estate transfers and real estate leases that are exempt from VAT.
Second and subsequent transfers of buildings are exempt from VAT; consequently, they are, in principle, subject to transfer tax.
Residential leases are exempt from VAT and therefore subject to transfer tax.
Transfers of listed or unlisted securities are, in principle, exempt from both transfer tax and VAT. This exemption does not apply for transfers of unlisted securities of a company on a secondary market that tries to evade the tax payable on a direct transfer of real estate that it owns. For this purpose, Spanish law establishes certain cases where it is understood that there is an intention to evade tax.
This exception does not apply to transfers of securities received as a result of the incorporation by banks of asset management companies and to transfers of securities of banks affected by the integration plans regulated by Law 9/2012, which will therefore be exempt from transfer tax. In addition, acquisitions of assets in the Canary Islands may be exempt from transfer tax (and from IGIC) when certain requirements are complied with.
Restructuring transactions are also exempt from transfer tax. For this purpose, mergers, spin-offs, exchanges of shares, and certain in-kind contributions are considered to be restructuring transactions.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is mostly levied on notarial instruments and records documenting transactions that have an economic value and need to be registered in public registries (e.g. company, land, and industrial property registries). Stamp duty is incompatible with transfer tax and capital duty, but compatible with VAT. The general rate is between 0.75% and 1.5%, depending on the region of Spain and with special rates for different taxable events.
Stamp duty is also levied on certain commercial (e.g. bills of exchange, promissory notes), court, and administrative documents.
## Capital duty
A 1% capital duty is levied on capital reductions and company dissolution and is payable by the shareholders.
Capital duty is incompatible with transfer tax and stamp duty in certain cases, but it is compatible with VAT.
## Payroll taxes
Employers are required to withhold a percentage of their employees’ salaries and benefits as a payment on account of their personal income tax (PIT). The rate of withholding is a progressive rate of between 19% and 47%, depending on the employee’s personal circumstances and income.
## Social security contributions
Employers are required to pay social security contributions. The rate of the contributions under the general social security contribution regime is the fixed rate of 30.48% plus a variable rate for occupational accidents (e.g. 1.5% for office work).
Employees are also required to pay social security contributions. Under the general social security contribution regime, the rate of social security contributions is 6.47%. Employers should deduct this amount from the amounts that they pay to employees.
The rates of social security contributions stated above should be applied to the employee’s total monthly gross employment income, whether in cash or in kind, with a minimum monthly contribution base of between EUR 1,323 and EUR 1,847.40and a maximum monthly contribution base of EUR 4,720.50 depending on the employee’s professional category.
Both parts of the social security contributions (employer and employee) should be paid by the employer to the Social Security Treasury.
## Tax on the provision of certain digital services
The provision of certain digital services (online advertising, online intermediary services, and data transmission services) involving users located in Spain is subject to a 3% tax.
For entities belonging to a corporate group, the thresholds are determined at group level.
## Tax on financial transfers
Onerous acquisitions of shares in listed Spanish companies with a capitalisation value at 1 December in the year prior to the acquisition of over EUR 1 billion are subject to the indirect tax on financial transfers.
The tax rate is 0.2% and is levied regardless of the place of residence of the parties or where the transaction takes place. Certain exemptions are established that mainly affect the primary market and the acquisitions necessary for the operation of market infrastructures, those relating to business restructurings, those made between companies of the same group, temporary assignments, and certain acquisitions of own shares.
## Temporary levy on energy
The temporary levy on energy established for financial years 2023 and 2024 was repealed by Law 7/2024, passed on  20 December and establishes three taxes and amends various tax rules was published in the Spanish Official Gazette.
## Tax on the interest and commission margins
The new tax on the interest and commission margin of certain financial institutions replaces the temporary levy on credit institutions and financial credit institutions. This tax will be applicable in the first three consecutive tax periods starting  1 January  2024.
The tax period will coincide with the taxpayer's financial year without exceeding 12 months, accruing on the last day of the calendar month following the end of the tax period.
The taxable income will consist of the positive balance resulting from integrating and offsetting the interest margin and  income and expenses from commissions resulting from the activity carried out in Spain recognised in the taxpayer’s profit and loss account or, where applicable,  income statement  for the tax period.
Taxable income will be the result of reducing  taxable income by the amount of EUR 100 million. In no event can    taxable income no be negative. This reduction will be prorated when the taxpayer's tax period is less than 12 months.
For the purposes of obtaining the full tax liability, the rates indicated in the following scale will be applied to the taxable income as a general rule, with an increase of 15% if structural modification operations have taken place and certain requirements are met
| **Taxable income**  **Up to € million** | **Gross tax liability**  **€ million** | **Excess taxable income**  **Up to € million** | **Taxable rate**  **Percentage** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 750 | 1 |
| 750 | 7,5 | 750 | 3,5 |
| 1500 | 33,75 | 1500 | 4,8 |
| 3000 | 105,75 | 2000 | 6 |
| 5000 | 225,75 | Excess | 7 |
The net tax liability will be the result of reducing the positive gross tax liability by 25 for CIT or the NRIT liability.
When the profitability indicator relative to the taxpayer's total assets is lower than the reference value of 0.7 percent, an extraordinary deduction may be applied.
## Local taxes
In addition to the taxes stated above, the following local taxes may be charged on companies:

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
## Social security contributions
Under the general regime, social security contributions are paid on wages and salaries. In Spain, the minimum monthly base is EUR 1,323 and the maximum is EUR 4,909.50 in 2025.
The general contribution rates are 6.48% for employees, depending on the type of contract, and 30.57% for employers, plus a variable rate for occupational accidents (e.g. 1.50% office work).
Certain persons may be exempt from paying social security contributions, provided that the following requirements are met:
On the other hand, the contribution system for the self-employed is modified, establishing a system whereby the self-employed will have to pay contributions according to the income they obtain. This system is made up of 15 economic brackets, and inclusion will vary depending on the income obtained by the self-employed. Within the bracket in which they are included, they will be able to choose the level of contributions they wish to pay. The minimum contribution for the lower bracket is set at EUR 653.59, while the maximum contribution in the upper bracket is set at EUR 4,909.50. Social security benefits would depend on the contributions paid by the self-employed, the general rate being 31.4%, which is applied on a monthly social security contribution base chosen by the self-employed.
Effective January 1, 2025, the additional solidarity contribution will come into force for employees whose remuneration exceeds the established maximum contribution base. This contribution will apply exclusively to the portion of the monthly salary that surpasses the maximum contribution base, calculated through a progressive tier system that determines the applicable percentage based on the amount of salary earned. The first tier includes the portion between the maximum base and up to 10% above it, subject to a rate of 0.92% in 2025. The second tier covers the portion between 10% and 50% above the maximum base, with a rate of 1% in 2025. The third tier applies to the portion exceeding 50% above the maximum base, with a rate of 1.17% in 2025. These rates will increase by 0.25% annually until 2045. The solidarity contribution will follow the same allocation scheme as contributions for common contingencies, with the majority of the burden assigned to employers: 83.39% borne by the employer and 16.61% by the employee. It will not affect employees whose income remains below the maximum contribution base, nor self-employed workers, regardless of their income.
## Value-added tax (VAT)
·       Standard rate of 21%, for regular supplies of goods and services.
·       Reduced rate of 10%, for basic necessities (e.g. food and agricultural products not included in the ‘super reduced’ 4% rate, dwellings, other qualifying services). Live cultural events and cinema tickets are taxed at the reduced rate of 10% too.
·       Super reduced rate of 4%, for basic necessities other than those classified under the reduced rate (e.g. bread, milk, books, medicine).
Temporary reductions in rates can apply for specific reasons (e.g. for sanitary reasons, for economic reasons, etcetera). On the other hand, certain activities are VAT exempt , including, among others, financial and/or insurance activities, medical activities, educational services. These activities do not grant the right to deduct input VAT. Having said that, some supplies are VAT exempt and grant the right to deduct input VAT, namely, the performance of intra-EU supplies of goods and exports of goods provided that certain conditions are met.
In the Canary Islands, a specific tax is applied instead of VAT, called the Canary Island General Indirect Tax (IGIC). IGIC is pretty similar to VAT although there are some differences, mainly in relation to the applicable rates that are normally lower than VAT. Guidelines given by the Spanish mainland authorities are normally also followed by the authorities in the Canary Islands.
In Ceuta and Melilla, a specific sales tax called IPSI is applied. IPSI has rules different from the VAT and, in general terms, its application is only for some activities/taxable events.
## Wealth tax
Wealth tax is levied on Spanish tax residents' worldwide net assets and on Spanish non-residents' goods and rights that are located, may be exercised, or should be complied with in Spain.
The tax is levied on the assets held by the taxpayer as of 31 December (accrual date).
Law 38/2022, of 27 December 2022, for the establishment of temporary energy taxes and taxes on credit institutions and financial credit establishments, which creates the temporary solidarity tax on large fortunes and modifies certain tax regulations has extended the individuals to which wealth tax applies.
For tax period 2022 onwards, shareholdings when at least 50% of the total assets of the company consists, directly or indirectly, of Spanish real estate assets are subject to wealth tax. For these purposes, the value of the real estate assets would not be the book value reported for accounting purposes by the company, but the value arising from specific wealth tax rules for real estate assets. This value would be the higher of the acquisition value, the cadastral value, and any other value assessed by the tax authorities for tax purposes.
The following tax relief is applicable for this tax:
The tax liability is calculated by applying the progressive rates established by the autonomous communities in Spain to net taxable  income (i.e. after applying tax relief). If the corresponding autonomous community does not establish its own scale of progressive rates, the following scale will apply:
| Taxable income (up to EUR) | Tax liability (EUR) | Rest of taxable income (up to EUR) | Applicable rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.00 | 0.00 | 167,129.45 | 0.2 |
| 167,129.45 | 334.26 | 167,123.43 | 0.3 |
| 334,252.88 | 835.63 | 334,246.87 | 0.5 |
| 668,499.75 | 2,506.86 | 668,499.76 | 0.9 |
| 1,336,999.51 | 8,523.36 | 1,336,999.50 | 1.3 |
| 2,673,999.01 | 25,904.35 | 2,673,999.02 | 1.7 |
| 5,347,998.03 | 71,362.33 | 5,347,998.03 | 2.1 |
| 10,695,996.06 | 183,670.29 | and above | 3.5 |
Autonomous communities may establish their own tax relief for wealth tax or an abatement of the tax. Several autonomous communities have already stated that they intend to establish a full tax abatement for wealth tax.
Taxpayers are required to file wealth tax returns if they have a tax liability or their wealth (exempt or not) exceeds EUR 2 million.
## Solidarity tax on large fortunes
Law 38/2022, of 27 December 2022, for the establishment of temporary energy taxes and taxes on credit institutions and financial credit establishments, creates the temporary solidarity tax on large fortunes.
This was a temporary tax that, in principle, was established only for the tax period 2022 and 2023, but finally it has become permanent, and is applicable to residents whose net asset value on 31 December is equal to or higher than EUR 3 million.
The tax base is determined by the application of the wealth tax regulations. The same occurs with the exemptions except for the EUR 700,000 exemption, which applies to both tax residents and non-tax residents in Spain.
The tax liability is calculated by applying the following progressive rate:
| Taxable income (up to EUR) | Tax liability (EUR) | Rest of  income base (up to EUR) | Applicable rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 3,000,000.00 | 0 |
| 3,000,000.00 | 0 | 2,347,998.03 | 1.7 |
| 5,347,998.03 | 39,915.97 | 5,347,998.03 | 2.1 |
| 10,695,996.06 | 152,223.93 | Onwards | 3.5 |
This tax is complementary to wealth tax, so the wealth tax debt paid in relation to the same tax period should be deducted from the solidarity tax amount.
## Gift and inheritance tax
Spanish gift and inheritance tax is levied on goods and rights acquired by Spanish tax residents by inheritance, legacy or other type of succession, or by donation or other *inter vivos* legal transfers with no charge.
Spanish gift and inheritance tax is also levied on goods and rights acquired by Spanish non-residents in the manners stated above, whatever their nature, which are located, may be exercised or should be complied with in Spain. However, if a DTT has been signed between Spain and the non-resident's country of residence, taxation will depend on the DTT applicable.
The tax is levied on the assets' net acquisition value.
The tax liability will depend on different matters such as the relationship between the taxpayer and the donor/deceased, or the taxpayer's previous wealth.
Spain's autonomous communities have extensive powers that enable them to pass their own laws regulating different aspects of this tax, and many autonomous communities have established significant tax relief.
Spanish gift and inheritance tax regulations have been reformed with effect from 1 January 2015 as a result of a judgement given by the EU Court of Justice on 3 September 2014, which established that these regulations are an obstacle to free movement of persons and capital and breach the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union by allowing discrimination in the tax treatment of gifts and inheritances between resident and non-resident successors and donees and between gifts and similar disposals of property located in and outside Spain. The reform introduces several rules to equate the tax treatment for the discriminating situations listed by the EU Court of Justice.
The general tax rates are as follows (although they can be modified by autonomous communities):
| Taxable income (up to EUR) | Tax liability (EUR) | Rest of taxable income (up to EUR) | Applicable rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 |  | 7,993.46 | 7.65 |
| 7,993.46 | 611.5 | 7,987.45 | 8.50 |
| 15,980.91 | 1,290.43 | 7,987.45 | 9.35 |
| 23,968.36 | 2,037.26 | 7,987.45 | 10.20 |
| 31,955.81 | 2,851.98 | 7,987.45 | 11.05 |
| 39,943.26 | 3,734.59 | 7,987.45 | 11.90 |
| 47,930.72 | 4,685.10 | 7,987.45 | 12.75 |
| 55,918.17 | 5,703.50 | 7,987.45 | 13.60 |
| 63,905.62 | 6,789.79 | 7,987.45 | 14.45 |
| 71,893.07 | 7,943.98 | 7,987.45 | 15.30 |
| 79,880.52 | 9,166.06 | 39,877.15 | 16.15 |
| 119,757.67 | 15,606.22 | 39,877.16 | 18.70 |
| 159,634.83 | 23,063.25 | 79,754.30 | 21.25 |
| 239.389,13 | 40,011.04 | 159,388.41 | 25.50 |
| 398,777.54 | 80,655.08 | 398,777.54 | 29.75 |
| 797,555.08 | 199,291.40 | and above | 34.00 |
## Property tax
Property tax is a local tax levied on the owners of properties located in Spain.
The tax liability is a percentage of the rateable value of the property depending on the type of the property (i.e. rural or urban) and the municipality where it is located.
Rates can be fixed by each municipality, with a minimum and a maximum that can be increased slightly if certain requirements are met:
|  | Urban property (%) | Rural property (%) | Special properties (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Minimum | 0.4 | 0.3 | 0.4 |
| Maximum | 1.1 | 0.9 | 1.3 |
## Tax on the increase of urban land value
When urban properties are transferred, a local tax is levied on the theoretical increase of the property's value (tax on the increase of urban land value). Taxable income for the calculation of the tax takes into account the rateable value of the property and the duration of ownership.
On 11 May 2017, the Spanish Constitutional Court stated that regulations laid down by law that tax where there is no increase in value of the urban property transferred are unconstitutional and, consequently, null and void. Consequently, taxpayers that have paid incorrect amounts of tax, where there was no increase in the value of the property, may claim a refund of the tax paid within the statute-of-limitation period by means of a special procedure that commences with the filing of a request with the tax authorities.
Later, on 9 November 2021, Royal Decree Law 26/2021, of 8 November, was published in the Official State Gazette, introducing a new case of non-taxation for these cases in which there is no increase in value in the difference between the values of said land on the dates of transfer and acquisition.
The tax is paid by the transferor of the property (provided that the transfer is not a donation).
Whereas Law 31/2022, of 23 December 2022, increased the maximum amount of the coefficients to be applied to the value of the land at the time of accrual, based on the period of generation of the value increase, Royal Decree-Law 8/2023, of 27 December 2023, decreased the aforementioned coefficients.
| Period of generation | Coefficient |
| --- | --- |
| Less than 1 year | 0.15 |
| 1 year | 0.15 |
| 2 years | 0.14 |
| 3 years | 0.14 |
| 4 years | 0.16 |
| 5 years | 0.18 |
| 6 years | 0.19 |
| 7 years | 0.20 |
| 8 years | 0.19 |
| 9 years | 0.15 |
| 10 years | 0.12 |
| 11 years | 0.10 |
| 12 years | 0.09 |
| 13 years | 0.09 |
| 14 years | 0.09 |
| 15 years | 0.09 |
| 16 years | 0.10 |
| 17 years | 0.13 |
| 18 years | 0.17 |
| 19 years | 0.23 |
| Equal or more than 20 years | 0.40 |
## Exit tax
### Income not yet allocated
If PIT payers cease to be PIT payers in Spain as they change their place of residence for tax purposes, they should declare any income not yet allocated in their last PIT return or file a supplementary tax return to declare this income (tax return filed without applying penalties, late payment interest, or surcharges).
When the taxpayer's place of residence is changed to another EU member state, the taxpayer may opt to include any income not yet allocated in one's last PIT return or to file a supplementary tax return to declare such income when each item of income to be declared is obtained (tax return filed without applying penalties, late payment interest, or surcharges).
### Latent capital gains on qualifying shares or interests in Collective Investment Institutions (CIIs)
If taxpayers resident in Spain change their tax residence to another country during at least ten of the 15 tax periods prior to the last tax period for which a PIT return should be filed, in general, the taxation of latent capital gains on shares or interests in companies or CIIs classified according to their value (EUR 4 million) or the interest percentage (25% for EUR 1 million and over) is brought forward.
Special rules are established for changes of tax residence to another EU member state or EEA country.
## Special tax on gaming income
A special 20% tax is levied on the following prizes:
The tax-exempt net amount for lotteries and games organised from 2020 onwards is EUR 40,000.
The tax base for this special tax is the amount of the prize that exceeds the tax-exempt amount. The tax rate is 20%, which is applied on the tax base minus any withholdings and advance payments applied.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year for CIT purposes is the company’s accounting year. The tax year cannot exceed 12 months. Incorporation, change of accounting year, or dissolution of a company can give rise to a period of less than one year.
## Tax returns
The tax system in Spain is a self-assessment system, and tax returns may be inspected by the tax authorities.
Annual CIT returns must be filed within 25 calendar days following the six months subsequent to the end of the tax year (i.e. if the tax year coincides with the calendar year, the return must be filed between 1 July and 25 July of the following calendar year).
## Payment of tax
For CIT, three advance payments of the annual tax payment must be made during the first 20 calendar days of April, October, and December. The final CIT payment must be made with the annual CIT return.
For companies whose turnover, in accordance with Spanish VAT law, for the 12 months prior to the beginning of a tax period exceeds EUR 6,010,121.04, the advance payments are calculated by applying 17% to the taxable income (reduced by any applicable tax-loss carryforwards) for each advance-payment period, i.e. at 31 March, 30 September, and 30 November (percentage applicable to companies that are taxed at the general CIT rate). This percentage will be 24% in the case of entities whose turnover, in accordance with Spanish VAT law, for the 12 months prior to the beginning of a tax period is at least EUR 10 million.
Entities whose turnover, in accordance with Spanish VAT law, for the 12 months prior to the beginning of a tax period is at least EUR 10 million will also be subject to a minimum advance payment of 23% of the profits reported in their income statement for each advance payment period.
Small and medium-sized companies can opt to calculate their advance payments in the same way as large companies (applying a percentage of 17%) or to apply a rate (currently 18%) on the tax liability of their last advance CIT return filed on 1 April, 1 October, or 1 December.
Variable capital investment companies, financial investment funds, real estate investment companies, real estate investment funds, mortgage market regulation funds, and pension funds that meet certain requirements and are taxed at a 1%, or even a 0%, tax rate should not make advance payments and are not required to file the corresponding tax return.
## EUR 1,000 limit on cash payments
Payments in cash over EUR 1,000 are not allowed for transactions in which at least one of the parties is a person carrying on a business or professional activity, and fines of up to 25% of the amount of the transaction can be imposed on both the payer and the recipient of these cash payments.
## Tax inspections
The Spanish tax authorities have a tax inspection department that is responsible, amongst other things, for verifying that taxpayers’ obligations are correctly complied with and, if necessary, for making adjustments to their tax affairs by issuing one or more tax assessments.
As part of its responsibilities, the tax inspection department may investigate a taxpayer’s tax affairs to ensure that they are correct and verify the accuracy of filed tax returns.
Taxpayers’ tax returns to be examined by the tax inspection department are chosen on the basis of different criteria, such as: (i) by random sample, (ii) if debt push down restructuring transactions have been carried out that involve Spanish companies with material debt levels, (iii) if companies have recurring tax-loss carryforwards, or (iv) if companies are related to a family group and lack a production or commercial structure and where their personal and business assets are not clear.
If taxpayers disagree with a tax assessment issued by the tax inspection department as a result of a tax inspection, they may file an appeal firstly with the Spanish economic-administrative tribunal for tax appeals and then, if the appeal is not upheld by the tribunal, with the ordinary courts.
If taxpayers have paid incorrect amounts of tax to the tax authorities, they may claim a refund of any excess tax paid from the authorities within the statute of limitation period (four years) by means of a special procedure that commences with the filing of a request with the tax authorities.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations for taxes in Spain is generally (with some exceptions) four years starting from the day following the date of termination of the voluntary tax filing period.
This four-year period may re-start for a tax if the tax authorities carry out any actions or procedures, with the formal acknowledgement of the taxpayer, to acknowledge, adjust, review, inspect, guarantee, or collect all, or any part of, a tax obligation, or due to actions by the taxpayer, such as filing a new or late tax return, that alters or rectifies a previous tax return or filing of an appeal or claim regarding the tax.
The tax authorities' entitlement to verify or investigate tax-loss carryforwards, tax relief availed of for carrying out certain activities, and deductions for the avoidance of double taxation is time barred after ten years.
At the end of the ten-year period, proof of the origin and amount of tax-loss carryforwards must be given by presenting the relevant tax assessment/self-assessment and accounting records and providing evidence that such assessments and records were filed and deposited with the Companies Registry during this period.
Every year, the Spanish tax authorities issue general guidelines on the authorities’ annual tax and customs control plan. These guidelines identify areas where the tax authorities intend to adopt a greater role of verification, inspection, and monitoring during a certain tax year.
## Obligation to disclose assets located overseas
Assets, such as accounts, shares, or real estate, that are located overseas must be disclosed.
A severe penalty regime was established. However, in January 2022, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) concluded after some years of uncertainty in relation to the above penalty system that such a system was against EU law.
Consequently, the Spanish tax system was updated, reviewing and considerably reducing the previous established penalty system.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
The Spanish system for direct taxation of individuals is mainly comprised of two personal income taxes: Spanish personal income tax (PIT), for individuals who are resident in Spain for tax purposes, and Spanish non-residents' income tax (NRIT), for individuals who are not resident in Spain for tax purposes who obtain income in Spain. Therefore, persons who obtain income in Spain are either liable to pay Spanish PIT or Spanish NRIT.
Residents in Spain are generally subject to PIT on their worldwide income, regardless of where it is generated, which is taxed, following statutory reductions, at progressive rates.
Non-residents are subject to NRIT only on their Spanish-source income.
There are two types of taxable income for Spanish PIT purposes: general taxable income and savings taxable income.
Savings taxable income is basically composed of the following:
General taxable income includes:
Regarding NRIT, income not obtained through a permanent establishment (PE) is taxed on each individual total or partial accrual of income subject to tax. This means that losses cannot be offset against gains.
Taxable income for non-residents without a PE is generally the gross income stipulated in Spanish PIT law, and no reductions are applicable. As a special rule, in the case of provisions of services, technical assistance, installation and assembly work resulting from engineering contracts and, in general, economic activities or operations carried out in Spain without a PE, taxable income is the difference between gross income and the expenses generated by staff, or for the procurement of materials incorporated in the works and supplies, in accordance with the requirements established in the regulations implemented under Spanish NRIT law.
When calculating the net income of taxpayers without a PE that are resident in other EU member states, a distinction is made between individuals and companies. In each case, the tax deductible expenses are established in accordance with the PIT and CIT legislation, respectively. In both cases, the taxpayer will need to prove that taxable expenses are directly related to the income obtained in Spain and that they have a direct and indisputable economic link to the activity carried out in Spain.
### Exemption for work performed abroad
PIT is not levied on employment income obtained by persons who are tax resident in Spain for work effectively carried out outside Spain, up to the limit of EUR 60,100, if the following requirements are met:
This tax exemption is incompatible with the tax regime for non-taxable excess amounts, in accordance with which the amounts paid to employees of companies who are assigned abroad above the total compensation that they would have obtained had they stayed in Spain are not subject to Spanish PIT.
In this case, the taxpayer may choose to apply the tax regime for non-taxable excess amounts instead of this tax exemption.
## Personal income tax (PIT) rates
Savings taxable income is taxed at the following rates:
For general taxable income, progressive tax rates are applied (which are the sum of the applicable rate approved by the state and the applicable rate approved by each autonomous community of Spain in their progressive tax rate scales). Tax liability may therefore differ from one autonomous community to another.
The following tables show the tax scale for withholdings approved by the state. This scale can be used as a guideline of the progressive tax rates applicable for general taxable income. For the reasons stated above, the scale applicable in the corresponding autonomous community of Spain should always be consulted to calculate the total progressive tax rate.
Tax scale for withholdings applicable in 2024:
| Taxable income (up to EUR) | Tax liability (EUR) | Excess of income base(up to EUR) | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 12,450 | 19 |
| 12,450 | 2,365.50 | 7,750 | 24 |
| 20,200 | 4,225.50 | 15,000 | 30 |
| 35,200 | 8,725.50 | 24,800 | 37 |
| 60,000 | 17,901.50 | 240,000 | 45 |
| 300,000 | 125,901.50 | Remainder | 47 |
### Non-resident income tax (NRIT) rates
For non-residents, income obtained without a PE is taxed at the following rates:

# Spain
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year is generally the calendar year.
## Tax returns and payment of tax
As a general rule, Spanish tax returns should be filed and paid between 11 April and 30 June following the end of the tax year. The period for declaring and paying PIT is established annually by a ministerial order. It usually ends on 30 June.
In general, a PIT return should be filed by a person resident in Spain whose gross employment income exceeds EUR 22,000 (for joint and separate returns) during the calendar year or EUR 15,876 for taxpayers who obtain employment income from more than one payer if the amounts obtained by the second and subsequent payers exceed EUR 1,500. Persons resident in Spain are also required to file a tax return if they obtain other personal incomes in excess of certain amounts specified by law.
Individual taxation is the basic way of being taxed for PIT, but the members of family units may opt to be taxed jointly in accordance with the following rules:
Non-residents are taxed on an individual basis and cannot opt to be taxed jointly. Income not obtained through a PE is taxed on each individual total or partial accrual of taxable income.
## Withholdings on personal income
For income generated from professional activities, the general rate of withholding is 15%, with certain exceptions.
The same withholding rates will apply to earned income generated from teaching courses, conferences, symposia, seminars, and the like, or from the production of literary, artistic, or scientific work, provided that the right to trade on such works is transferred.
In both cases, the withholding rates will be reduced by 50% if income qualifies for the tax credit for income obtained in Ceuta and Melilla.
Withholdings at the rate of 19% are also levied on the following:
Withholdings are levied on employment income obtained by directors and members of boards of directors or boards or committees representing such directors, and other representative bodies at the rate of 35% (19% for companies whose turnover in the previous tax year was less than EUR 100,000).
The withholding rate on amounts allocated to transfers of image rights by PIT payers who have an employment relationship with a person or company/entity is 19% if the taxpayer has transferred to such person or company/entity the right to trade on or the consent or authorisation to use one's image in acts with persons or companies/entities resident or not resident in Spain. The withholdings for other transfers of image rights is 24%.
Prizes on lotteries and games are subject to a 20% withholding or advance payment of the special tax on gaming income.
Withholdings are credited against the total tax due.
## EUR 1,000 limit on cash payments
Payments in cash over EUR 1,000 are not allowed for transactions in which at least one of the parties is a person carrying on a business or professional activity, and fines of up to 25% of the amount are payable by both the payer and the recipient of these cash payments.
## Obligation to disclose assets located overseas
Law 7/2012 introduced the obligation to disclose assets such as accounts, shares, or real estate located overseas. Severe fines were envisaged (a minimum of EUR 10,000) for breaching this obligation.
In addition, assets regarding which the information disclosure obligation is not met within the established period are treated as unjustified capital gains for PIT payers and allocated to the earliest tax period of those which are not statute barred. Breaches of the obligation to declare this income used to be very serious infringement and fines of 150% of the gross tax liability were imposed.
However, in January 2022, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) concluded, after some years of uncertainty in relation to the above penalty system, that such a system was against EU law.
Consequently, the Spanish tax system was updated, reviewing and considerably reducing the previous established penalty system.
Order HFP/886/2023, of 26 July 2023, that came into effect on 27 July 2023, brought in the obligation to report cryptocurrencies located overseas, through tax form 721. The deadline for reporting cryptocurrencies located overseas owned by the taxpayer in tax year 2024 is 1 January 2025 to 31 March 2025.
## Tax inspections
The Spanish tax authorities have a department for tax inspections that is responsible for, amongst other things, verifying that tax obligations are correctly complied with and, if necessary, for adjusting the taxpayer's tax situation by issuing one or more tax assessments.
As part of its responsibilities, the tax inspection department may investigate taxpayers to see if any facts regarding tax obligations have been ignored by the tax authorities or check the accuracy of filed tax returns.
The tax returns examined by the tax inspection department are chosen on the basis of different criteria (randomly, due to differences of income or capital gains detected by comparing the returns of different taxpayers, significant differences of wealth declared in two consecutive years, or external signs of wealth such as acquisitions of residential properties, luxury cars, financial assets, or leisure vessels for significant sums of money).
If taxpayers disagree with a tax assessment issued by the tax inspection department as a result of a tax inspection, they may file an appeal firstly with the economic-administrative tribunal, and if the appeal is not upheld by the tribunal, with the ordinary courts.
If taxpayers have paid incorrect amounts of tax, they may claim a refund of the tax paid in excess from the tax authorities within the statute of limitation period (four years) by means of a special proceeding that commences with the filing of a request with the tax authorities.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations for taxes is four years in Spain commencing from the day following the termination of the voluntary tax filing period.
This four-year period may re-start for a taxpayer if the tax authorities carry out any actions or proceedings, with the formal acknowledgement of the taxpayer, to acknowledge, adjust, review, inspect, guarantee or collect all, or any part of a tax obligation, or due to actions by the taxpayer such as the filing of a new or late tax return that alters or rectifies a previous tax return or the filing of an appeal or claim regarding the tax.
Every year the Spanish tax authorities issue general guidelines on the authorities’ annual tax and customs control plan. These guidelines identify areas where the tax authorities intend to adopt a greater role of verification, inspection, and monitoring during a certain tax year.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
The general CIT rate in Spain is 25%. Other tax rates may apply, depending on the type of company that is taxed and its type of business.
Resident companies are taxed on their worldwide income.
For permanent establishments (PEs) in Spain of foreign companies, non-resident income tax (NRIT) is chargeable on income that may be allocated to the PE at a 25% tax rate.
## Small and medium size entities (SMEs) and micro-enterprises companies
With effect for tax periods starting on or after 1 January 2025, a reduction in the tax rate applicable to SMEs (*see Special tax regimes in the [Tax credits and incentives](spain/corporate/tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section*) and to micro-enterprises (those with a net turnover in the previous tax period of less than EUR 1 million) is envisaged, although its implementation is expected to be carried out progressively over a period of three years for micro-enterprises and five years for SMEs.
In addition, in the case of micro-enterprises, the tax rate is broken down into two brackets, with a lower rate being levied on the taxable income up to EUR 50,000, when the tax period is one year, or up to the corresponding proportional amount, when the tax period is shorter. Specifically, the tax rates would be as follows:
| New taxable rates applicable to SMEs and micro-enterprises | | Tax periods starting in | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | **2028 and beyond** |
| Micro-enterprises | Taxable income up to EUR 50,000 | 21% | 19% | 17% |  |
| Excess | 22% | 21% | 20% |  |
| SMEs | | 24% | 23% | 22% | 21% |
The above reduced rates will not apply to entities that are considered equity companies.
For corporate groups, the turnover of all group companies must be considered for this purpose. Special rules apply for the first tax period in which an economic activity is carried out or short tax periods.
Tax-protected cooperative entities will be taxed at the tax rates resulting from reducing the previous tax rates by three percentage points, provided that the resulting rate does not exceed 20%, except for non-cooperative results.
## Newly created companies
Newly created companies are taxed at a 15% tax rate for both the first tax period in which they obtain a profit and the following tax period. This tax rate is not applicable to equity companies (i.e. companies that do not carry on business activity) or to newly created companies that are part of a national or international group.
The reduced rate may also be inapplicable if the company's business activity was previously carried on by a related company or individual.
## Start-up companies
Companies that meet the requirements set forth by the law to qualify as start-ups may apply a 15% tax rate in the first tax period in which the company obtains positive taxable income and in the following three periods, contingent upon maintaining the conditions to qualify as a start-up.
For these purposes, a company will be considered a start-up if the following requirements are met:
When the company belongs to a business group, the group or each member company of the group must meet the above requirements.
Companies that meet the requirements to qualify as start-ups are not entitled to the application of the reduced tax rate when:
## Minimum CIT rule
A minimum taxation rule will apply to those CIT payers whose net turnover in the 12 months prior to the date in which the tax period begins has been of at least EUR 20 million and for taxpayers who are taxed under the special tax consolidation regime for CIT purposes, regardless of its net turnover amount.
According to this rule, the above-mentioned taxpayers’ CIT net tax due (defined as tax due after applying tax reliefs and deductions) may not be less than the result of applying 15% to the taxable income reduced or increased due to the additions/decreases related to the reserve for the levelling-off tax losses (eligible by small-size entities) and reduced by the special investment reserve of the special economic and tax regime of the Canary Islands.
This measure will have effects for tax periods starting as of 1 January 2022.
The minimum taxation rule will not be applicable to taxpayers taxed under 10%, 1%, or 0% CIT rates nor to listed companies that make investments in the real estate market (called SOCIMIs in Spain).
The following entities have a special minimum tax rate:
The following rules must be considered while calculating the minimum tax rate:
The minimum CIT rule will also apply to NRIT payers that act through a PE in Spain.
## Global minimum tax
On 21 December 2024, Law 7/2024 of 20 December 2024, was published in the Official State Gazette (BOE), which, among other things, transposes Council Directive (EU) 2022/2523 in Spain. This Directive and, therefore, the Spanish Law aims to ensure an overall minimum level of taxation for multinational groups and large-scale domestic groups, i.e. it implements the so-called Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two.
Generally, for the purposes of calculating the effective tax rate obtained within a given jurisdiction, the following formula needs to be considered:
Effective tax rate = Adjusted covered taxes of the constituent entities in the jurisdiction / net qualifying income of the constituent entities in the jurisdiction
To this end, both the adjusted covered taxes and the qualifying income of the relevant entities need to be calculated following the relevant adjustments provided in Law 7/2024.
### Safe Harbours
The Spanish Law provides for the application of Transitional Safe Harbour, in line with OECD Transitional Country-by-Country Safe Harbour, applicable to fiscal years beginning no later than 31 December 2026.
Further, Spanish law provides for the application of the QDMTT Safe Harbour and other safe harbours to be developed by the OECD.
## Business and professional activities tax
The business and professional activities tax is a local direct tax levied annually on the performance in Spain of business, professional, or artistic activities, whether or not they are carried out on particular premises. The tax payable depends on different factors, such as the type of activity carried on and the location and size of the premises where the activity is carried on. As regards limits, the tax may not exceed 15% of the presumed average profits of the business/professional activity.
CIT payers and non-resident companies carrying on an activity in Spain through a PE are exempt from this tax if their net turnover for the tax year of the last CIT/NRIT return filed prior to the date of accrual of the local tax (1 January) was less than EUR 1 million.

# Spain
## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
## Social security contributions
Under the general regime, social security contributions are paid on wages and salaries. In Spain, the minimum monthly base is EUR 1,323 and the maximum is EUR 4,909.50 in 2025.
The general contribution rates are 6.48% for employees, depending on the type of contract, and 30.57% for employers, plus a variable rate for occupational accidents (e.g. 1.50% office work).
Certain persons may be exempt from paying social security contributions, provided that the following requirements are met:
On the other hand, the contribution system for the self-employed is modified, establishing a system whereby the self-employed will have to pay contributions according to the income they obtain. This system is made up of 15 economic brackets, and inclusion will vary depending on the income obtained by the self-employed. Within the bracket in which they are included, they will be able to choose the level of contributions they wish to pay. The minimum contribution for the lower bracket is set at EUR 653.59, while the maximum contribution in the upper bracket is set at EUR 4,909.50. Social security benefits would depend on the contributions paid by the self-employed, the general rate being 31.4%, which is applied on a monthly social security contribution base chosen by the self-employed.
Effective January 1, 2025, the additional solidarity contribution will come into force for employees whose remuneration exceeds the established maximum contribution base. This contribution will apply exclusively to the portion of the monthly salary that surpasses the maximum contribution base, calculated through a progressive tier system that determines the applicable percentage based on the amount of salary earned. The first tier includes the portion between the maximum base and up to 10% above it, subject to a rate of 0.92% in 2025. The second tier covers the portion between 10% and 50% above the maximum base, with a rate of 1% in 2025. The third tier applies to the portion exceeding 50% above the maximum base, with a rate of 1.17% in 2025. These rates will increase by 0.25% annually until 2045. The solidarity contribution will follow the same allocation scheme as contributions for common contingencies, with the majority of the burden assigned to employers: 83.39% borne by the employer and 16.61% by the employee. It will not affect employees whose income remains below the maximum contribution base, nor self-employed workers, regardless of their income.
## Value-added tax (VAT)
·       Standard rate of 21%, for regular supplies of goods and services.
·       Reduced rate of 10%, for basic necessities (e.g. food and agricultural products not included in the ‘super reduced’ 4% rate, dwellings, other qualifying services). Live cultural events and cinema tickets are taxed at the reduced rate of 10% too.
·       Super reduced rate of 4%, for basic necessities other than those classified under the reduced rate (e.g. bread, milk, books, medicine).
Temporary reductions in rates can apply for specific reasons (e.g. for sanitary reasons, for economic reasons, etcetera). On the other hand, certain activities are VAT exempt , including, among others, financial and/or insurance activities, medical activities, educational services. These activities do not grant the right to deduct input VAT. Having said that, some supplies are VAT exempt and grant the right to deduct input VAT, namely, the performance of intra-EU supplies of goods and exports of goods provided that certain conditions are met.
In the Canary Islands, a specific tax is applied instead of VAT, called the Canary Island General Indirect Tax (IGIC). IGIC is pretty similar to VAT although there are some differences, mainly in relation to the applicable rates that are normally lower than VAT. Guidelines given by the Spanish mainland authorities are normally also followed by the authorities in the Canary Islands.
In Ceuta and Melilla, a specific sales tax called IPSI is applied. IPSI has rules different from the VAT and, in general terms, its application is only for some activities/taxable events.
## Wealth tax
Wealth tax is levied on Spanish tax residents' worldwide net assets and on Spanish non-residents' goods and rights that are located, may be exercised, or should be complied with in Spain.
The tax is levied on the assets held by the taxpayer as of 31 December (accrual date).
Law 38/2022, of 27 December 2022, for the establishment of temporary energy taxes and taxes on credit institutions and financial credit establishments, which creates the temporary solidarity tax on large fortunes and modifies certain tax regulations has extended the individuals to which wealth tax applies.
For tax period 2022 onwards, shareholdings when at least 50% of the total assets of the company consists, directly or indirectly, of Spanish real estate assets are subject to wealth tax. For these purposes, the value of the real estate assets would not be the book value reported for accounting purposes by the company, but the value arising from specific wealth tax rules for real estate assets. This value would be the higher of the acquisition value, the cadastral value, and any other value assessed by the tax authorities for tax purposes.
The following tax relief is applicable for this tax:
The tax liability is calculated by applying the progressive rates established by the autonomous communities in Spain to net taxable  income (i.e. after applying tax relief). If the corresponding autonomous community does not establish its own scale of progressive rates, the following scale will apply:
| Taxable income (up to EUR) | Tax liability (EUR) | Rest of taxable income (up to EUR) | Applicable rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.00 | 0.00 | 167,129.45 | 0.2 |

| 668,499.75 | 2,506.86 | 668,499.76 | 0.9 |

Autonomous communities may establish their own tax relief for wealth tax or an abatement of the tax. Several autonomous communities have already stated that they intend to establish a full tax abatement for wealth tax.
Taxpayers are required to file wealth tax returns if they have a tax liability or their wealth (exempt or not) exceeds EUR 2 million.
## Solidarity tax on large fortunes
Law 38/2022, of 27 December 2022, for the establishment of temporary energy taxes and taxes on credit institutions and financial credit establishments, creates the temporary solidarity tax on large fortunes.
This was a temporary tax that, in principle, was established only for the tax period 2022 and 2023, but finally it has become permanent, and is applicable to residents whose net asset value on 31 December is equal to or higher than EUR 3 million.
The tax base is determined by the application of the wealth tax regulations. The same occurs with the exemptions except for the EUR 700,000 exemption, which applies to both tax residents and non-tax residents in Spain.
The tax liability is calculated by applying the following progressive rate:
| Taxable income (up to EUR) | Tax liability (EUR) | Rest of  income base (up to EUR) | Applicable rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 3,000,000.00 | 0 |
| 3,000,000.00 | 0 | 2,347,998.03 | 1.7 |
| 5,347,998.03 | 39,915.97 | 5,347,998.03 | 2.1 |
| 10,695,996.06 | 152,223.93 | Onwards | 3.5 |
This tax is complementary to wealth tax, so the wealth tax debt paid in relation to the same tax period should be deducted from the solidarity tax amount.
## Gift and inheritance tax
Spanish gift and inheritance tax is levied on goods and rights acquired by Spanish tax residents by inheritance, legacy or other type of succession, or by donation or other *inter vivos* legal transfers with no charge.
Spanish gift and inheritance tax is also levied on goods and rights acquired by Spanish non-residents in the manners stated above, whatever their nature, which are located, may be exercised or should be complied with in Spain. However, if a DTT has been signed between Spain and the non-resident's country of residence, taxation will depend on the DTT applicable.
The tax is levied on the assets' net acquisition value.
The tax liability will depend on different matters such as the relationship between the taxpayer and the donor/deceased, or the taxpayer's previous wealth.
Spain's autonomous communities have extensive powers that enable them to pass their own laws regulating different aspects of this tax, and many autonomous communities have established significant tax relief.
Spanish gift and inheritance tax regulations have been reformed with effect from 1 January 2015 as a result of a judgement given by the EU Court of Justice on 3 September 2014, which established that these regulations are an obstacle to free movement of persons and capital and breach the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union by allowing discrimination in the tax treatment of gifts and inheritances between resident and non-resident successors and donees and between gifts and similar disposals of property located in and outside Spain. The reform introduces several rules to equate the tax treatment for the discriminating situations listed by the EU Court of Justice.
The general tax rates are as follows (although they can be modified by autonomous communities):
| Taxable income (up to EUR) | Tax liability (EUR) | Rest of taxable income (up to EUR) | Applicable rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 |  | 7,993.46 | 7.65 |
| 7,993.46 | 611.5 | 7,987.45 | 8.50 |
| 15,980.91 | 1,290.43 | 7,987.45 | 9.35 |
| 23,968.36 | 2,037.26 | 7,987.45 | 10.20 |
| 31,955.81 | 2,851.98 | 7,987.45 | 11.05 |
| 39,943.26 | 3,734.59 | 7,987.45 | 11.90 |
| 47,930.72 | 4,685.10 | 7,987.45 | 12.75 |

| 159,634.83 | 23,063.25 | 79,754.30 | 21.25 |
| 239.389,13 | 40,011.04 | 159,388.41 | 25.50 |
| 398,777.54 | 80,655.08 | 398,777.54 | 29.75 |
| 797,555.08 | 199,291.40 | and above | 34.00 |
## Property tax
Property tax is a local tax levied on the owners of properties located in Spain.
The tax liability is a percentage of the rateable value of the property depending on the type of the property (i.e. rural or urban) and the municipality where it is located.
Rates can be fixed by each municipality, with a minimum and a maximum that can be increased slightly if certain requirements are met:
|  | Urban property (%) | Rural property (%) | Special properties (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Minimum | 0.4 | 0.3 | 0.4 |
| Maximum | 1.1 | 0.9 | 1.3 |
## Tax on the increase of urban land value
When urban properties are transferred, a local tax is levied on the theoretical increase of the property's value (tax on the increase of urban land value). Taxable income for the calculation of the tax takes into account the rateable value of the property and the duration of ownership.
On 11 May 2017, the Spanish Constitutional Court stated that regulations laid down by law that tax where there is no increase in value of the urban property transferred are unconstitutional and, consequently, null and void. Consequently, taxpayers that have paid incorrect amounts of tax, where there was no increase in the value of the property, may claim a refund of the tax paid within the statute-of-limitation period by means of a special procedure that commences with the filing of a request with the tax authorities.
Later, on 9 November 2021, Royal Decree Law 26/2021, of 8 November, was published in the Official State Gazette, introducing a new case of non-taxation for these cases in which there is no increase in value in the difference between the values of said land on the dates of transfer and acquisition.
The tax is paid by the transferor of the property (provided that the transfer is not a donation).
Whereas Law 31/2022, of 23 December 2022, increased the maximum amount of the coefficients to be applied to the value of the land at the time of accrual, based on the period of generation of the value increase, Royal Decree-Law 8/2023, of 27 December 2023, decreased the aforementioned coefficients.
| Period of generation | Coefficient |
| --- | --- |
| Less than 1 year | 0.15 |
| 1 year | 0.15 |
| 2 years | 0.14 |
| 3 years | 0.14 |
| 4 years | 0.16 |
| 5 years | 0.18 |
| 6 years | 0.19 |
| 7 years | 0.20 |

| Equal or more than 20 years | 0.40 |
## Exit tax
### Income not yet allocated
If PIT payers cease to be PIT payers in Spain as they change their place of residence for tax purposes, they should declare any income not yet allocated in their last PIT return or file a supplementary tax return to declare this income (tax return filed without applying penalties, late payment interest, or surcharges).
When the taxpayer's place of residence is changed to another EU member state, the taxpayer may opt to include any income not yet allocated in one's last PIT return or to file a supplementary tax return to declare such income when each item of income to be declared is obtained (tax return filed without applying penalties, late payment interest, or surcharges).
### Latent capital gains on qualifying shares or interests in Collective Investment Institutions (CIIs)
If taxpayers resident in Spain change their tax residence to another country during at least ten of the 15 tax periods prior to the last tax period for which a PIT return should be filed, in general, the taxation of latent capital gains on shares or interests in companies or CIIs classified according to their value (EUR 4 million) or the interest percentage (25% for EUR 1 million and over) is brought forward.
Special rules are established for changes of tax residence to another EU member state or EEA country.
## Special tax on gaming income
A special 20% tax is levied on the following prizes:
The tax-exempt net amount for lotteries and games organised from 2020 onwards is EUR 40,000.
The tax base for this special tax is the amount of the prize that exceeds the tax-exempt amount. The tax rate is 20%, which is applied on the tax base minus any withholdings and advance payments applied.

## Overview
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
Spain, located in Southwest Europe on the Iberian Peninsula, joined the European Union (EU) in 1986. It is divided into 17 *comunidades autónomas* (autonomous communities) and two autonomous cities, with Madrid as the capital. The official language of Spain is Spanish, together with the co-official languages of certain autonomous communities within their territories. The official currency is the euro (EUR).
Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 2.7% in 2023. A 3.2% GDP increase is estimated for 2024.
Spain's fiscal deficit in 2023 was 3.7%. Initial estimates place the deficit in 2024 at around 3% of GDP.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
Ordinarily, WHT is the mechanism by which the Spanish tax authorities collect the final tax levied on non-residents. In the case of resident beneficiaries, however, it is simply an advance payment of a tax that is then normally self-assessed by the resident taxpayer in the final annual tax return.
The advance payment system of WHT for resident beneficiaries referred to above also applies if non-resident companies/individuals not established in Spain sell their title to Spanish real estate. In this case, the acquirer of the real estate must levy a 19% WHT on the selling price on account of the tax chargeable to the seller on its capital gain. Other capital gains (for instance, from a sale by a non-resident of a substantial interest in a Spanish company where neither a DTT nor internal rules establish a tax exemption) are taxed in the hands of the non-resident transferor, but the mechanics of levying the tax are not those of a WHT. In this case, the non-resident’s tax is paid directly, through its representative or by the depositor or manager of the assets in question, if any.
The following table states the general WHT rates on income obtained by resident/non-resident companies. The main characteristics of the rates for each type of income are stated in footnotes to the table. Always refer to specific treaties to ensure the values are up-to-date and check the potential impact of the MLI which has not been included in the different treaties.

The general rates in the table above are for guidance only and should not be treated as tax advice.
1. The rates above are for income obtained by non-residents that is not related to any PEs that they may have in Spain.
1. If a corporate taxpayer, as a shareholder, is entitled to a tax exemption for the avoidance of double taxation on the dividends received, no WHT is levied. As a general rule, corporate shareholders with at least a 5% interest held for at least one year may apply this tax exemption on the dividends received.
2. For residents of other EU member states or EEA countries with which there is an effective exchange of tax information, the rate is 19%.

# Spain
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
The general rule for determining income for CIT purposes is that accounting rules must be followed unless tax law establishes otherwise. To maintain this consistency, CIT/PE NRIT returns include pages in which the company’s accounting/commercial balance sheet and income statement figures must be entered.
In Spain, the tax authorities are authorised to modify accounting results exclusively for the purpose of determining tax results if they observe that a company’s accounting results have not been calculated in accordance with Spanish Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
## Inventory valuation
Inventory is valued at acquisition price or production cost under the average and first in first out (FIFO) valuation methods (the replacement and base stock valuation methods may only be used in exceptional cases). Again, since there are no specific tax rules for determining taxable income, accounting rules are also applicable for calculating valuation and obsolescence provisions for inventory.
## Capital gains and losses
Capital gains are taxable in the tax year in which they arise. They are treated as normal income and taxed at the standard CIT rate of 25%.
For operations where payment is deferred or paid in instalments, the income is obtained proportionally as the corresponding payments are made, unless the taxpayer opts to be taxed in accordance with the accrual criteria.
As a general rule (there are certain exceptions), capital gains arising on the transfer of companies resident in Spain in which at least a 5% interest has been held for at least one year are 95% exempt from tax (5% is taxed at the corresponding tax rate). The period during which the interest is held by another group company is also considered for this rule.
Capital losses arising from transfers of shares are only tax deductible if they relate to interests of less than 5% and, in the case of interests in the capital or equity of non-resident companies, the investee company has been subject to and is not exempt from a foreign tax identical or analogous in nature to CIT at a nominal rate of at least 10% or is resident in a country with which Spain has signed a DTT containing an exchange-of-information clause.
Negative income generated in the event that the investee company is extinguished is tax deductible unless the company is extinguished as a result of a restructuring operation.
In such cases, the negative income will be reduced by the amount of the dividends received during the ten years prior to the date of extinguishment, unless the dividends have reduced the acquisition value, and provided that they qualified for the application of an exemption or deduction regime for the elimination of double taxation for the same amount.
Tax losses generated on transfers of assets to another company in the same corporate group are not tax deductible at the time of the transfer. Their tax deductibility is deferred to the moment when the assets are written off in the acquirer's balance sheet transferred out of the group or when the transferor or acquirer cease to form part of the group. In the case of depreciable/amortisable assets, however, the amount not deducted should be included in line with their depreciation/amortisation by the acquirer.
## Dividend income
Dividends received from resident in Spain companies in which at least a 5% interest has been held for at least one year, including ownership by other group companies, may benefit from a 95% exemption (meaning, if the general tax rate is applicable, the full amount of the dividends are taxable at a rate of 1.25%). Dividends received from resident in Spain companies in which an interest of less than 5% is held are taxable in their entirety for the recipient.
Special rules apply to, amongst others, the following:
### Stock dividends
CIT is not levied on bonus shares (i.e. shares partially or totally given to shareholders in a capital increase charged against distributable reserves), although they must be taken into account when calculating the average cost of shares held for the levying of tax when the shares are sold.
## Interest income
Interest income is treated as normal income and taxed at the standard CIT rate of 25%.
## Royalty income
Royalty income is included in CIT taxable base with the other kinds of income.
A reduction (up to 60%) may be applied on the net income obtained from licensing some types of intangible assets if certain requirements are met.
Patents, supplementary certificates for the protection of medicines and phytosanitary products, and registered advanced software qualify for the patent box tax incentive. Drawings and models only qualify if they are legally protected.
Commercial or scientific experiences (also known as 'know-how') do not qualify for this tax incentive.
## Other significant items
The following items, amongst others, are excluded or deferred from taxable income:
## Foreign income
### Tax relief on foreign income
Resident companies are taxed on their worldwide income. For foreign-source income, total or partial tax relief in the form of tax credits or exemptions is given if tax is levied on the income in both Spain and the foreign country where the income has been generated.
This tax relief may be available for the following:
The main characteristics of double tax relief are discussed below.
Dividends or profit-sharing income received by a Spanish company from a foreign company may benefit from a 95% exemption (which entails an effective tax rate on this type of income of 1.25% for those entities subject to the general 25% CIT rate), subject to compliance with the following requirements:
Capital gains arising from the sale of shares in foreign companies also qualify for a tax exemption if the requirements stated above are complied with during the holding period.
Both the dividends and capital gains exemptions are not applicable when the investee company is resident in a tax haven, unless it is an EU member state and the company can prove that it has been incorporated and operates for valid business reasons and that it carries on economic/business activities.
The tax exemption is limited in certain cases.
Special rules apply to, amongst others, the following:
As an alternative to this 'tax exemption' regime and applicable to dividend distributions only, a tax credit based on imputation is established. This tax credit allows crediting the foreign tax paid abroad on the income from which the dividends are paid and the foreign WHT paid on the profit distribution, up to the limit of the tax that would have been paid on the 95% gross amount in Spain (only 95% is considered to be consistent with the holding exemption regime).
The only requirement for the application of this 'imputation tax' system is that the Spanish company has at least a 5% interest in the foreign company during the 12 months prior to the date on which the dividend is due and payable. This one-year holding period is deemed to be complied with if it is completed after the dividend is distributed. The tax credit can be carried forward for an unlimited number of years.
Spanish legislation provides for CIT relief on 'juridical' double taxation by applying the 'imputation tax' system. Under this system, gross foreign income (including foreign WHT paid) is included for Spanish tax calculation purposes, and a tax credit for the foreign WHT paid is applicable up to the amount of the CIT that the company would have paid if such gross income had been obtained in Spain. The part of the tax paid abroad with respect to which the taxpayer is not entitled to this tax credit may be considered tax deductible, provided that it corresponds to the foreign company's business activities carried out abroad. The tax credit can be carried forward for an unlimited number of years.
Under Spanish DTT and implemented EU tax directives, several methods have been established to avoid double taxation. The main one is the traditional deduction of a tax credit from tax effectively paid. However, some DTTs establish a tax exemption or the exclusive right to tax. Also, a tax-sparing clause is included in some DTTs, which allows for the deduction of not only the tax actually paid but a higher amount of tax.

# Spain
## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
Over the past year, the following significant amendments have been made to Spanish law on the taxation of companies:
## Royal Decree-Law 10/2024
Royal Decree-Law 10/2024, passed on 23 December 2024, establishing a temporary energy tax in 2025, was published in the Spanish Official Gazette on 24 December 2024.
The Royal Decree-Law was not ratified by Parliament, and its repeal was agreed during its sitting of 22 January 2025.
## Royal Decree-Law 9/2024
Royal Decree-Law 9/2024, adopting urgent measures in economic, tax, transport, and social security matters, and extending certain measures to address situations of social vulnerability, was approved on 23 December 2024 and published in the Spanish Official Gazette on 24 December 2024.
The Royal Decree-Law was not ratified by Parliament, and its repeal was agreed during its sitting of 22 January 2025.
## Law 7/2024
On 21 December 2024, Law 7/2024, passed on 20 December 2024, which establishes three taxes and amends various tax rules, was published in the Spanish Official Gazette.
The main new features contained in this Law that affect corporations are the following:
### Establishment of three new taxes
#### Tax on interest and commission margins
#### Tax on liquids for electronic cigarettes and other tobacco-related products
### Amendments to Corporate Income Tax (CIT) Act
#### Non-deductible expenses
In the same way as those derived from the accounting of CIT, the expenses derived from the accounting of the complementary tax will not be deductible, nor will the income derived from its accounting be subject to the tax. Additionally, the new tax on interest and commission margins of certain credit institutions will not be considered a deductible expense.
#### Capitalisation reserve
With effect for tax periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025, the regulations on the capitalisation reserve are amended to enhance this incentive:
The workforce increase must be maintained for a period of three years from the end of the tax period to which this reduction corresponds.
A limit is established to the reduction in the tax base as a capitalisation reserve which may not exceed 20% of the positive tax base of the tax period prior to: (i) this reduction, (ii) the integration of provisions for impairment of credits or other assets arising from possible insolvencies, and (iii) the offset of carryforward tax losses (25% for taxpayers whose net turnover during the 12 months prior to the date on which the tax period to which this reduction corresponds begins is less than 1 million euros [EUR]).
#### Gradual reduction in the tax rate for small and medium size entities (SMEs) and micro-enterprises
With effect for tax periods starting on or after 1 January 2025, a reduction in the tax rate applicable to SMEs and to micro-enterprises (those with a net turnover in the previous tax period of less than EUR 1 million) is envisaged, although its implementation is expected to be carried out progressively, over a period of three years for micro-enterprises and five years for SMEs. In addition, in the case of micro-enterprises, the tax rate is broken down into two brackets, with a lower rate being levied on the taxable income up to EUR 50,000, when the tax period is one year, or up to the corresponding proportional amount, when the tax period is shorter. Specifically, the tax rates would be as follows:
| New taxable rates applicable to SMEs and micro-enterprises | | Tax periods starting in | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 and following |
| Micro-enterprises | Taxable income up to EUR 50,000 | 21% | 19% | 17% |  |
| Excess | 22% | 21% | 20% |  |
| SMEs | | 24% | 23% | 22% | 21% |
The above reduced rates will not apply to entities qualified as property-holding entities.
Tax-protected cooperative entities will be taxed at the tax rates resulting from reducing the previous tax rates by three percentage points, provided that the resulting rate does not exceed 20%, except for non-cooperative results.
As a result of these amendments in the tax rates, the regulation regarding minimum taxation is also amended to adapt the minimum net tax rate for micro-enterprises and small companies to the reduction in tax rates set out above.
#### Recovery of the limits for large companies declared unconstitutional by the Spanish Constitutional Court
With effect for tax periods starting on or after 1 January 2024 and that have not ended before 22 December 2024 (date of entry into force of Law 7/2024), the limits introduced for large companies by Royal Decree Law 3/2016 declared unconstitutional due to formal reasons by the Spanish Constitutional Court's Judgement issued 24 January 2024 are recovered.
For these purposes, large companies are those whose net turnover during the 12 months prior to the date on which the tax period begins is at least EUR 20 million.
The limits now recovered for large companies are those referring to the following items:
The limits for its compensation will be reduced to:
The joint limit will be 50% of the taxpayer's gross tax liability.
#### Reversal of tax impairment on securities
The Spanish Constitutional Court's Judgement of 24 January 2024 declared unconstitutional the obligation to automatically reverse in fifths and during tax years 2016 to 2020 the impairment losses on securities that were considered deductible in tax periods beginning before 1 January 2013.
In this regard, a new rule is introduced according to which the reversal in the tax base of such impairment losses must be carried out in thirds in the tax years 2024 to 2026.
However, with respect to the income corresponding to this reversal of impairment losses integrated into the tax base by application of the provisions established here, the more restrictive limits for the offsetting of negative tax bases in large companies will not apply.
#### Extension of the limit to the offsetting of carryforward tax losses within the tax consolidation group to tax periods starting in 2024 and 2025
Law 7/2024 extends to tax periods beginning in 2024 (provided they did not end before 22 December 2024) and 2025 the restriction that already existed in 2023 for groups that pay taxes under the tax consolidation regime, by not allowing them to include in the group's consolidated tax base 50% of the individual carryforward tax losses of the entities that make up said group.
All of this, without prejudice to the fact that those amounts that cannot be computed in 2024 and 2025, will be integrated in equal parts in the first ten tax periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025 and 1 January 2026, respectively, in similar terms to those established for 2023 tax-loss carryforwards.
However, considering that this measure significantly harmed foundations that, being subject to the general corporate tax regime, were part of tax groups, it has been provided that this limitation will not apply to them in the tax periods beginning in 2024 and 2025.
### Amendments to Value-added Tax (VAT) Act
- prove that one is an authorised operator or a reliable operator, or
- guarantee the payment of VAT on the subsequent subject and non-exempt delivery by means of a guarantee from a credit institution, financial institution, or insurance company, or by payment on account of the corresponding VAT.
### Measures to Promote the Information Society
Law 56/2007, of 28 December 2007, on Measures to Promote the Information Society is amended to include the development and management by the State Tax Administration Agency of a public electronic invoicing solution, which shall provide electronic invoicing services to those business owners or professionals who so choose and shall serve as a universal and mandatory repository for all electronic invoices issued, sent, or received.
## Royal Decree Law 6/2024 to alleviate the effects of the DANA flood
Royal Decree Law 6/2024, of urgent measures to alleviate the effects of the DANA flood that has affected large areas of the Peninsula and the Balearic Islands between 28 October 2024 and 4 November 2024, was passed on 5 November 2024 and published in the Spanish Official Gazette on 6 November 2024.
The main tax measures included that affect corporate taxation are the following:
Other measures to alleviate the effects of the DANA flood have been incorporated in Royal Decree Laws 7/2024 and 8/2024, although they are more focused on individuals.
## Royal Decree Law 4/2024
Royal Decree Law 4/2024, which extends certain measures to address the economic and social consequences of the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and through which urgent tax, energy, and social measures are adopted, was passed on 26 June 2024 and published in the Spanish Official Gazette on 27 June 2024. The main tax measures included that affect corporate taxation are the following:
## Constitutional Court judgement 11/2024, on Royal Decree-Law 3/2016
Spain’s Constitutional Court judgement 11/2024, of 18 January 2024, published in the Official State Gazette on 20 February 2024, upholds the question of unconstitutionality number 2577-2023, that declares void and unconstitutional certain provisions of Law 27/2014, of 27 November 2014, on corporate tax, incorporated through article 3.1, sections One and Two, of Royal Decree-Law 3/2016, of 2 December 2016 (RDL 3/2016). In particular, the measures that have been declared void and unconstitutional are the following:
However, this judgement does not have full retroactive effects. Therefore, the tax liabilities accrued for CIT purposes that have been definitively determined by a final judgement with *res judicata* effect or a definitive administrative decision, the assessments that have not been contested, and the self-assessments whose rectification has not been requested at the date of the judgement cannot be reviewed. This means that only companies that have appealed the assessments or requested rectification of the self-assessments before the publication of the judgement in the Spanish Official Gazette will be able to benefit from the repeal the Royal Decree-Law.
Although a Royal Decree-Law can be used to establish, modify, or repeal taxes in emergency situations, the Constitutional Court understands that Royal Decree-Law 3/2016 exceeds the material limit provided for Royal Decree-Laws on tax matters, affecting the duty to contribute to the funding of public expenditure. According to the Constitutional Court, the amendments introduced alter essential elements of CIT, such as the tax base and the amount payable, affect the determination of the tax burden, and have a notable impact on a basic part of the tax system, affecting the essence of the CIT payers’ duty to contribute. Furthermore, the Court recalled that the Royal Decree-Law in question is connected to Royal Decree-Law 2/2016, which was already declared unconstitutional for the same reason by the Court’s judgement 78/2020, and which increased payments on account of CIT of large companies.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
A company is resident in Spain and subject to CIT on its worldwide income when:
Under Spanish law, a company’s ‘effective’ head office is in Spain when its business activities are managed and controlled from Spain.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Taxpayers operating in Spain through a PE are subject to NRIT.
Most Spanish tax treaties for the avoidance of double taxation contain a definition of PE in line with OECD criteria.
In the absence of a double tax treaty (DTT), domestic law states that companies or individuals are considered to operate through a PE when, by any legal means, they have continuous or habitual work facilities in Spain or a place to do any kind of work where they perform all or part of their activities, or when they act in Spain through an agent with powers to enter into an agreement in the name and on behalf of the non-resident company/individual, provided that these powers are exercised on a regular basis.
In particular, a PE includes management offices, branches, offices, factories, workshops, warehouses, shops or other establishments; mines, oil or gas wells, quarries, farms, forestry facilities, livestock farms, or any other site where natural resources are collected; and construction, installation, or assembly sites whose duration lasts more than six months.
The main difference between the Spanish rules and the DTT rules is that the Spanish rules do not contain exceptions to the definition of PE where the activities carried out are of a preparatory or auxiliary character.
The Spanish High Court has issued several judgements on the question of PEs where it has adopted a functional approach to the subject of the existence of a PE. In this regard, it has afforded a flexible interpretation of what should be considered a PE, and specifically, of the concepts of dependent agent and fixed place of business.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
## Depreciation, amortisation, and depletion
All assets, except land, are depreciable/amortisable for tax purposes. Guideline tables of tax depreciation/amortisation rates are established that state maximum *per annum* rates and maximum years of useful life for each asset type, classified by business sector.
The table below gives the maximum *per annum* rates and maximum years of useful life established in the guideline tables for some assets that are typically depreciated/amortised:
| Asset | Maximum *per annum* depreciation/amortisation rate (%) | Maximum useful life (years) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Industrial buildings | 3 | 68 |
| Warehouses | 7 | 30 |
| Administrative and commercial buildings | 2 | 100 |
| Internal transport elements | 10 | 20 |
| External transport elements | 16 | 14 |
| Furniture | 10 | 20 |
| Computers | 25 | 8 |
| Software | 33 | 6 |
| Tools | 25 | 8 |
The straight-line depreciation/amortisation method is normally used, calculated over the asset’s useful life and applied on the asset’s cost or written-up value (if such a write-up is acceptable for tax purposes). Off-book adjustments must be included in tax assessments if accounting depreciation/amortisation exceeds tax depreciation/amortisation.
Qualifying assets with a useful life of more than one year can also be depreciated/amortised using declining-balance methods. Buildings, furniture, and fittings cannot be depreciated using the declining-balance methods.
For tax periods starting in 2013 and 2014, the tax deduction of recorded depreciation of tangible fixed assets and investment property was limited to 70% of the maximum depreciation permitted by the regulations implemented under Spanish CIT law. This limitation did not apply to small or medium-sized companies. Recorded depreciation that was not deducted as a result of this limitation could be carried forward and is deductible either on a straight-line basis over ten years or, alternatively, over the asset’s useful life, from the first tax period starting in 2015. For tax periods starting in or after 2015, a tax credit may be applied on gross tax payable of 5% of the amounts included in the tax base resulting from depreciation charges not deducted in tax periods starting in 2013 and 2014. This tax credit compensates the reduction of CIT rates and ensures that the 70% tax depreciation limit only has a financial effect.
Mining assets and assets used for R&D, amongst others, but not including buildings, can be freely depreciated/amortised for tax purposes.
### Free depreciation
Unrestricted depreciation of investments in new tangible fixed assets and investment property was regulated for investments made by taxpayers in tax periods starting in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. This tax relief was also available for tax periods starting in 2009 and 2010, but it could only be availed of if the requirement that the taxpayer’s staff levels were maintained or increased was met.
Due to the tax reform made with Royal Decree Law 12/2012, this tax relief was repealed effective 31 March 2012.
A transitional regime is established for investments made prior to that date. Under this transitional regime, the unrestricted depreciation tax relief may be applied for these investments with certain limits.
### Free depreciation incentive for investments in new vehicles
A free depreciation incentive is introduced in CIT for investments in new vehicles classified as FCV, FCHV, BEV, REEV, or PHEV and new charging infrastructures for normal and high-power charging electric vehicles, provided that they are used for business purposes and come into operation in the tax periods starting in 2024 and 2025.
### Amortisation of intangibles
For tax years starting in or after 2016, goodwill is amortised under Spanish GAAP during its useful life, which is estimated to be ten years unless otherwise proven. However, for tax purposes it can be amortised at a maximum annual rate of 5%, irrespective of whether or not the assets in question have been acquired from a company of the same corporate group. Goodwill acquired from another group company in tax periods starting prior to 1 January 2015 does not qualify for a deduction.
Intangible assets may be amortised for accounting purposes during their useful life. When the useful life cannot be reliably estimated, the assets will be amortised for accounting purposes over ten years, unless otherwise established by law or the regulations implemented under law. This recognised amortisation is tax deductible irrespective of whether or not the assets in question have been acquired from a group company. When the useful life of intangible assets cannot be reliably estimated, the recognised amortisation is tax deductible up to the limit of 5%.
The amortisation of intangible assets acquired from another group company in tax periods starting prior to 1 January 2015 is not tax deductible.
For tax periods starting in or after 2015, taxpayers on whom the 70% limit for tax deductible amortisation applied in 2013 and 2014 are entitled to a deduction against their gross tax payable of the amounts included in their tax base resulting from amortisation not deducted in tax periods starting in 2013 and 2014. The deduction is 5% for tax periods starting in or after 2016. This deduction compensates the reduction of CIT rates and, consequently, ensures that the 70% tax-deductible amortisation limit only has a financial effect.
### Depletion
Depletion is allowed for mining companies and companies involved in exploring/investigating natural oil resources as established in applicable legislation.
## Financial goodwill
To promote the internationalisation of Spanish companies, in 2002 a rule was introduced that financial goodwill arising from the acquisition of an interest in a non-resident company (financial goodwill being, in this case, the excess price paid for the acquisition of the business over its net book value at the date of the acquisition that cannot be allocated to the non-resident company’s assets in Spain) could be amortised up to a maximum of 5% per year.
To apply this tax relief, the following requirements had to be met:
Decisions of the European Commission dated 28 October 2009 (regarding interests in non-resident EU companies) and 12 January 2011 (regarding interests in non-resident non-EU companies) considered that this tax relief was unlawful state aid.
According to the Commission’s decisions, only acquisitions of interests in non-resident companies carried out before 21 December 2007 (or before 21 May 2011 for majority interests in non-resident companies established in countries with explicit obstacles to cross-border business combination transactions outside the European Union) can continue applying this tax relief until the financial goodwill is wholly amortised.
The provisions related to financial goodwill tax relief laid down in the Spanish CIT Act were amended by Law 31/2011, passed on 4 October 2011, and take effect for tax periods ending on or after 21 December 2007. Under the amended provisions, the financial goodwill tax relief is not applicable for acquisitions of interests in non-resident companies carried out on or after 21 December 2007 (or on or after 21 May 2011, when there is evidence that there is an explicit obstacle for cross-border business combination transactions outside the European Union).
In its decision of 17 July 2013, the Commission asked the Spanish tax authorities to suspend their rule that allowed for the tax deduction of financial goodwill arising from second or bottom-tier non-resident companies.
On 7 November 2014, two judgements of the EU General Court annulled the Commission's decisions on the grounds that the Spanish financial goodwill tax relief did not constitute state aid that was incompatible with the internal market because, amongst other reasons, it could not identify a category of undertakings that benefited from the measure or selectivity.
However, in a decision delivered on 21 December 2016, the EU Court of Justice concluded that the fact that the Commission had failed to identify a particular category of undertakings that benefited from the financial goodwill amortisation was not sufficient grounds for the annulment of Commission's decisions. Instead, the EU General Court should have examined whether the Commission had effectively analysed and established that the measure at issue was discriminatory.
Through six judgements dated 6 October 2021, the High Court of Justice of the European Union confirmed that the Spanish tax regime for the amortisation of financial goodwill in relation to direct acquisitions of holdings in entities resident in both the European Union and third countries constitutes state aid incompatible with the internal market.
It thus brought to an end the discussion that had been ongoing for more than a decade, although the debate concerning financial goodwill generated by the acquisition of foreign holding companies (indirect acquisitions) remains open.
## Start-up expenses
According to Spanish GAAP, start-up expenses are considered to be expenses in the financial year in which they are incurred. As no special rule is provided for tax purposes, they are deductible for CIT purposes in the year in which they are incurred.
## Financial expenses
### General limits on the deduction of financial expenses
The amount of net deductible financial expenses in the tax period is generally reduced to 30% of operating profit (similar to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciations, and amortisation [EBITDA], applying certain adjustments) for the year, financial expenses of less than EUR 1 million (or the proportional part for tax periods of less than one year) being deductible regardless of the 30% limit. For this purpose, net financial expenses will be considered to be the excess of financial expenses (excluding the non-deductible expenses mentioned below) with respect to income deriving from the assignment of capital to third parties accrued in the tax period.
Adjusted operating profit would currently include dividends to which the capital exemption rule applies. However, the law has recently been amended and, for tax periods starting as of 1 January 2024, revenues, income, or expenses that have not been included in the CIT base (such as dividends that are exempt according to the application of the participation exemption regime) will no longer be taken into account in the determination of operating profit.
Limits on the deduction of financial expenses will not apply to dissolved companies for the tax period in which they are dissolved, unless the company is dissolved as a result of a restructuring operation.
Finally, limits on the deduction of financial expenses will not apply to insurance companies or credit institutions. Financial expenses that have not been deducted due to the application of this limit can be deducted in subsequent tax periods for an unlimited period of time.
### Specific limit on the deduction of financial expenses on the acquisition of interests in the capital or equity of any type of company
A specific limit is introduced for financial expenses generated from debts incurred to acquire interests in the capital or equity of any type of company. These expenses are deductible, subject to an additional limit of 30% of the acquirer's operating profits, excluding the operating profits of any company that may merge into the acquirer or that may join its tax group during the four years following the acquisition (besides this specific limit, the general limit on tax deductibility will also apply to these financial expenses).
This specific limit is not applicable when the debt associated with the acquisition of the interest reaches a maximum of 70% and is reduced, as of the time of the acquisition, by at least the proportional part corresponding to each of the following years until a level equal to 30% of the acquisition price is reached.
This specific limit does not apply to restructuring operations carried out before 20 June 2014 or to restructuring operations carried out on or after 20 June 2014 between companies that formed part of a tax consolidation group during tax periods starting before that date.
Financial expenses that have not been deducted due to the application of this limit can be deducted in subsequent tax periods for an unlimited period of time.
### Specific limit on the deduction of intra-group financial expenses on acquisitions of interests in other group companies or contributions to capital or equity of other group companies
A specific limit is introduced for financial expenses arising from debts with group companies generated from acquisitions of interests in other group companies or contributions to capital or equity of other group companies. These financial expenses will not be deductible unless there is evidence that there are valid economic reasons for such expenses.
## Participating loans
Interest on participating loans contracted by group companies on or after 20 June 2014 is a return on equity and is not deductible for tax purposes. In the recipient's tax returns (if the recipient is a Spanish CIT payer), it should be treated as dividends and the recipient may be eligible, when appropriate, for a tax exemption for the avoidance of double taxation of dividends.
## Bad debt provisions
Provisions for covering the risk derived from possible bad debts are tax deductible when, at the time the tax accrues, any of the following circumstances exists:
Provisions for the credits listed below are not tax deductible:
Special rules apply to bank entities.
## Time apportionment of certain allocations or welfare system provisions
Positive adjustments arising from certain allocations to bad debt or welfare system provisions that are non-deductible under the Spanish CIT Act should be reversed in the corresponding year in accordance with this Act, up to 70% of the tax base prior to the capitalisation reserve adjustment and to the offset of tax-loss carryforwards.
With effect for tax periods starting on or after 1 January 2024 and that have not ended before  22 December 2024 (date of entry into force of Law 7/2024), the limits introduced for large companies by Royal Decree Law 3/2016 which were declared unconstitutional by the Spanish Constitutional Court's Judgment of  24 January  2024, are reintroduced d.
In this regard and for the above-mentioned periods, the limit will be reduced to:
## Equity investments in companies
Impairment allowances for share capital or equity investments in companies are generally not deductible.
As an exception, if the interest is less than 5% and, in the case of interest in the capital of non-resident companies, if the investee company has been subject to and not exempt from a foreign tax identical or analogous in nature to CIT at a nominal rate of at least 10% or is resident in a country with which Spain has signed a DTT containing an exchange-of-information clause, the impairment will be deductible as a result of the transfer or disposal of the interest, provided that the above requirements are met during the year prior to the transfer or disposal.
Impairment on interest that was deductible in tax periods prior to 2013 is reversed for: (i) unlisted companies, when there is an increase in equity or payment of dividends, and (ii) listed companies, when there is an increase in the book value of the interest.
The Spanish Constitutional Court's Judgment of 24 January 2024 declared unconstitutional the obligation to automatically reverse in fifths  and during the tax years 2016 to 2020 impairment losses on securities that were considered deductible in the tax periods beginning before 1 January 2013.
In this regard, a new rule is introduced according to which the reversal in t tax base of such impairment losses must be carried out in thirds s in the tax years 2024 to 2026.
However, with respect to the income resulting from this reversal of impairment losses included in the tax base through the application of the provisions established therein, the more restrictive limits for the offsetting of negative tax bases in large companies will not apply.
## Severance pay
Severance pay is tax deductible for CIT purposes when it does not exceed, for each recipient, the higher of the following amounts: (i) EUR 1 million or (ii) the amount established as the obligatory amount in the Workers’ Statute Act, the regulations implemented under the Act, or, if the case, the legislation regulating the enforcement of decisions/judgements.
## Charitable donations
Donations are considered to be non-deductible expenses for CIT purposes, but a tax credit may be applied for donations to non-profit organisations that comply with certain requirements. The tax credit in this case is 40% of the donation. However, if in the previous two years a donation has been made to the same entity, the amount of the donation for this year and the previous year being equal to or greater, in each of them, than that of the immediately preceding year, the tax credit percentage would be 50%.
In addition, the tax credit is not limited to 25% of the donating company’s gross tax payable less the deductions for international double taxation and tax relief for income obtained in Ceuta and Melilla, for export activities, and for local public services, which is applicable for other tax credits (*see CIT relief in the* *Tax credits and incentives* *section*).
The tax credit base cannot exceed 15% of the taxable income of the financial year. Any excess may be carried forward for a period of ten years.
For donations to listed priority sponsorship activities, the tax credit may be increased by 5% and the 15% tax credit base limit can be increased to 20%.
## Fines and penalties
Penalties imposed for failing to pay taxes and surcharges for late filing/payment or for other tax infringements are not tax deductible.
## Taxes
Taxes, other than those deriving from  accounting for CIT that are recorded as an expense due to their nature (e.g. business and professional activities tax, but not withholdings) are tax-deductible expenses.
Expenses deriving from  accounting for the complementary tax and the new tax on the interest margin and commissions of certain credit institutions will not be considered a deductible expense. .
In some cases, indirect taxes, such as non-deductible VAT or transfer tax, can be added to the value of assets for depreciation purposes.
## Net operating losses
Tax losses may be carried forward for an unlimited amount of time. Generally, tax losses cannot be carried back. There are no tax loss 'baskets' (operating/capital).
Notwithstanding, companies whose turnover in the previous tax period was under EUR 10 million may reduce their positive tax base by up to 10% of their amount by establishing a non-distributable reserve for the amount of the reduction (reserve for the levelling-off of tax losses). The reduction may not exceed EUR 1 million and should be reversed in line with the tax losses obtained by the company, subject to a five-year time limit.
The tax losses of any type of company may be offset against positive income up to 70% of the tax base prior to the capitalisation reserve and their offset.
With effect for tax periods starting on or after 1  January 2024 and that have not ended before 22 December 2024 (date of entry into force of Law 7/2024), the limits brought in for large companies by Royal Decree Law 3/2016 declared unconstitutional by the Spanish Constitutional Court's Judgment of  24 January  2024 are reintroduced.
In this regard and for the above-mentioned periods, the 70% limit will be reduced to:
The above limits do not apply: (i) in the tax period in which the company is extinguished, unless this is due to a restructuring operation carried out under the tax neutrality regime, and (ii) to any income corresponding to debt relief or deferral resulting from an agreement with creditors.
Complex rules may limit the use of tax-loss carryforwards of a company dissolved because of a restructuring operation and, in certain circumstances, when it has a change of shareholders.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Supplies of goods or services by a company not established in Spain to a Spanish group company must be valued at arm’s length. If recorded expenses for such goods/services exceed the arm’s-length price, the tax deductibility of the excess amounts could be challenged in a tax inspection. The tax deductibility of expense charges received from tax havens is fully disallowed unless proper evidence of an actual service valued at arm’s length can be provided.
As regards the taxation in Spain of the foreign company supplying the services, the WHT rate to be applied on the gross income obtained by the company is 24% (19% for residents in other EU member states or European Economic Area (EEA) countries with which there is an effective exchange of tax information). Dividends, interest, and capital gains generated as a result of a transfer of assets are taxed at a 19% WHT rate. If management services, technical assistance, or the performance of studies are solely used outside Spain and are linked to business carried on abroad, then no WHT is applicable. In addition, under most DTTs signed by Spain, ‘business profits’ obtained in Spain by non-residents are exempt from WHT. However, ‘business profits’ is a miscellaneous residual category. For instance, if the amount obtained qualifies as a royalty payment, WHT is applicable at the reduced DTT rates if the foreign company can obtain a document from the tax authorities of its country of residence certifying its tax residence. If no DTT applies, then the above 24% (19% for residents in other EU member states or EEA countries with which there is an effective exchange of tax information) WHT rate is applicable (*see the* *Withholding taxes* *section for more information*).
### PEs and interests in joint ventures
Losses obtained outside Spain by means of a PE are not tax deductible. Losses generated from interests in joint ventures that carry on a business activity outside Spain are not tax deductible either.
Negative income generated from the transfer of a PE is not tax deductible.
Negative income derived from the discontinuation of a PE’s activity is deductible. However, such negative income will be reduced by the amount of the net positive income previously obtained that has qualified for the exemption or deduction for double taxation.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
## Tax groupings for CIT purposes
Under Spanish tax law, companies can form a group and apply a special tax consolidation regime for CIT purposes. Companies forming a tax group must formally pass a resolution agreeing to do so before the beginning of the first tax year in which the tax consolidation regime will be applied.
To apply the tax consolidation regime, the controlling company of the tax group must hold a 75% or higher interest, either directly or indirectly, and the majority of the voting rights in the companies forming the tax group at the beginning of the first tax year in which the tax consolidation regime is applied, and this interest and the voting rights must be maintained during the year unless the companies are dissolved. The interest requirement is 70% for companies listed on a stock exchange.
A non-resident company can also be the controlling company of a tax consolidation group, provided that it has legal personality, is taxed by a foreign tax identical or analogous in nature to Spanish CIT and is not resident in a tax haven. When the controlling company is a non-resident company, one of the resident companies of the group is required to be appointed as the group's representative of the group and will be responsible for complying with all of the group's obligations and formalities.
Resident companies that meet the minimum holding and voting rights requirements through non-resident companies are included in the tax consolidation group.
These rules allow for the possibility of horizontal consolidation.
The main characteristics of the tax consolidation regime are as follows:
(\*) The restriction that already existed in 2023 for groups that pay taxes under the tax consolidation scheme, by not allowing them to include in the group's consolidated tax base 50% of the individual  tax-loss carryforwards of the entities that make up said group is extended for the tax periods beginning in 2024 (provided they did not end before 22 December 2024, date on which the Law 7/2024 entered into force) and 2025.
The foregoing is , without prejudice to the fact that those amounts that cannot be computed in 2024 and 2025, will be included in equal parts in the first 10 tax periods beginning on or after 1 January  2025, and 1 January  2026, respectively, in similar terms to those established for  2023 tax-loss carryforwards of 2023.
However, considering that this measure had a significant adverse impact on foundations that, being subject to the general corporate tax scheme, were part of tax groups, it has been provided that this limitation will not apply to them in the tax periods beginning in 2024 and 2025.
If the entity that generated the negative taxable income ceases to form part of the tax group, the group will be the one to continue recovering the unused negative taxable income.
If the tax consolidation regime no longer applies or the group ceases to exist, the unused negative taxable income will be fully recovered in the last return filed by the tax group.
## Tax groupings for VAT purposes
Groups of companies may also choose to be taxed under a special tax consolidation regime for VAT purposes. This special regime is optional, but once it has been opted for, it must be applied for a minimum of three years, which is extendible unless it is expressly waived by the companies.
With the application of the VAT consolidation regime, there are two different options for taxation:
## Transfer pricing
### Legal framework
The arm’s-length principle is the standard applicable to transactions between related parties under Spanish transfer pricing regulations. The Spanish tax authorities have powers to review the transfer prices applied in inter-company transactions and make adjustments should the transfer prices determined by the taxpayer not be in line with the arm’s-length principle.
Spanish domestic legislation adopts a very wide approach to the definition of related parties. The following list presents an overview of the entities and individuals that are considered related parties with respect to a Spanish taxpayer:
When the relationship is defined in accordance with the member-company relationship, the interest held must be equal to or greater than 25%. A group should be interpreted as defined in Article 42 of the Spanish Commercial Code.
Spanish transfer pricing regulations generally follow the OECD Guidelines. Both the traditional transactional methods and the transactional profit methods are accepted in Spain. When the previously defined valuation methods are not applicable, the use of other methods or generally accepted valuation techniques satisfying the arm’s-length principle may be applied.
### Documentation requirements
Penalties may be levied if taxpayers fail to provide their transfer pricing documentation study when it is requested by the tax authorities, generally in the context of a tax audit. Transfer pricing documentation that is deemed to be complete and accurate protects Spanish taxpayers from penalties if the tax authorities propose a transfer pricing adjustment.
### Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
The Spanish-resident ultimate parent company or designated entities for groups with a consolidated turnover of more than EUR 750 million are required to file the CbC report within 12 months of the end of every tax period. Furthermore, and consistent with the OECD’s Action 13, this information must be filed for those entities that are tax residents in Spain but are not the 'ultimate parent entity' of a multinational enterprise (MNE) group if certain criteria are met.
### Disclosure form 232
Spanish taxpayers are required to file a form that identifies their inter-company transactions and transactions with tax havens.
The tax return should be filed during the month following the ten-month period after the end of the fiscal year which the information to be provided refers to. In other worlds, for fiscal years ending 31 December, it should be filed between 1 November and 30 November.
## Thin capitalisation
Thin capitalisation rules have been repealed.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Spanish CFC rules seek to avoid the effects arising when Spanish tax resident companies or individuals place their capital in low-taxed foreign companies or PEs to avoid including passive income generated by such capital in their taxable bases. Under this regime, Spanish tax resident companies pay Spanish CIT on the income obtained by a non-resident subsidiary or PE upon meeting certain requirements, including, specifically, that  the CIT payable by the non-resident subsidiary or PE must be under 75% of the tax that would be payable in Spain and, in the case of non-resident subsidiaries, that the Spanish parent company must own, individually or together with other related companies or individuals, over 50% of the non-resident subsidiary's share capital, equity, profits, or voting rights.
CFC rules are not applicable to companies or PEs resident for tax purposes in the European Union or in a state that is part of the European Economic Space Agreement if the taxpayer proves that they carry on a business activity or they are Collective Investment Institutions (CIIs) regulated in EU Directive 2009/65/CE other than those established in Section 54 of the Spanish CIT Act and domiciled in an EU member state. There are two types of CFC:
The types of income indicated above should not be imputed when the sum of these amounts is less than 15% of the total income obtained by the non-resident company or PE abroad, unless the income is generated from derivative financial instruments, which should be imputed in its entirety.
The imputation will be carried out considering the principles and criteria established in the Spanish CIT Law (i.e. the calculation of the tax payable by the foreign subsidiary subject to CFC should be converted so as to reflect Spanish CIT law and principles). In any case, income in excess of the total income of the foreign subsidiary (calculated according to Spanish CIT Law provisions and principles) will not be imputed.
The dividend or profit-sharing income received by a Spanish company corresponding to income already imputed following the CFC rules will not be included in the Spanish tax resident company’s taxable income. The amount of such dividend or profit-sharing income will be reduced by 5% in respect of management expenses.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
Income obtained by a branch in Spain of a non-resident company is taxed at the standard CIT rate of 25%.
Payments made by a branch to its foreign head office or a PE of its head office for royalties, interest, commissions, or technical assistance fees are not tax deductible. Management and general administrative expenses incurred by the head office that can be allocated to the branch are tax deductible if the payments for these expenses are made following criteria of continuity and rationality and provided that certain documentary requirements and other formalities are fulfilled.
Under Spanish law, income obtained by a branch that is repatriated to its head office is taxed at source at the general withholding tax (WHT) rate of 19%. This tax is not chargeable in the case of a PE of a company resident in the European Union (unless the company is resident in a tax haven). Most DTTs signed by Spain do not establish any provisions on this matter, and, in these cases, no tax is chargeable on the income repatriated by branches. Some DTTs, such as those with Canada, Indonesia, and the United States (US), do establish a tax on income repatriated by branches.

## Foreign tax credit
## CIT relief
No specific tax relief is established in Spanish law for foreign investors. Relief may be availed of by Spanish and foreign-owned companies alike. The tax relief available under CIT law in Spain is as follows.
Most of the tax relief that has been established to promote certain investments has been eliminated. However, the largest types of tax relief are maintained (tax exemption/deduction to prevent internal and international double taxation, tax credit for R&D, and tax credit for technological innovation).
### Tax relief for business activity/place of business activity
### R&D and technological innovation credits
A 25% tax credit can be availed of for expenses incurred from R&D activities. If the expenses are higher than the average R&D expenses incurred by the company during the previous two years, the tax credit is 42% for the excess amount.
An additional tax credit of 17% can be availed of for staff expenses incurred for staff exclusively carrying out and qualified to carry out R&D activities.
An 8% tax credit can be availed of for investments made in tangible fixed assets (excluding buildings) and intangible assets that are exclusively assigned to R&D activities.
A 12% tax credit can be availed of for technological innovation activities.
R&D and technological innovation tax credits can be excluded from the limits on tax credits applied on tax liabilities (*see below for Limits on the amount of tax credit applied*), which will have a cost of 20% of the tax credits applied, meaning that, if certain requirements are met, 80% of R&D and technological innovation tax credits may reduce tax liability after double tax deductions and tax allowances to zero, and any excess tax credits (up to 80%) may be refunded by the tax authorities.
The requirements for the exclusion of R&D and technological innovation tax credits from the tax credit limits are as follows:
The following should also be taken into consideration:
If R&D expenses for the year exceed 10% of turnover, an additional amount of EUR 2 million per year of tax credit for R&D can be applied or paid without limitation and with a 20% discount.
### Capitalisation reserve
Taxable income can generally be reduced by 20% (for tax periods starting on or after 1 January 2025) of the increase in equity carried out in the preceding year, provided that  equity is maintained for a period of three years (except when losses are reported). To apply this tax relief, a reserve should be established for the amount of the reduction, which may not be distributed for that three year period.
If the taxpayer’s average headcount compared to the immediately preceding tax period is increased, the reduction will amount to:
The workforce increase must be maintained for a period of 3 years from the end of the tax period to which this reduction relates.
A limit is established to the reduction in  taxable income as a capitalisation reserve which may not exceed 20% of the positive tax base of the tax period prior to: (i) this reduction, (ii) the inclusion of provisions for impairment of receivables or other assets arising from possible insolvencies and (iii), the offset of tax loss carryforwards (25% for taxpayers whose net turnover during the 12 months prior to the date on which the tax period to which this reduction relates begins is less than EUR 1 million).
### Tax credits for film productions and live performing arts and musical shows
Investments in Spanish feature-length film productions and the production of audio-visual fiction, animation, or documentary series, where physical copies can be produced prior to serialised industrial production, entitle the producer or taxpayers who contribute to their financing to a 30% tax credit on the first EUR 1 million of the tax credit base and a 25% tax credit on any excess tax credit base.
This tax credit base is made up of the total production cost, the expenses incurred to obtain copies, and the publicity and promotion expenses borne by the producer with the limit of 40% of the production cost.
At least 50% of the tax credit base should relate to the expenses incurred in Spain.
The tax credit may not exceed EUR 20 million. In the case of audio-visual series, the tax credit will be determined per episode and the limit will be EUR 10 million for each episode produced. The limit of 25% of gross tax payable (*see below for Limits on the amount of tax credit applied*) is increased to 50% when the amount corresponding to expenses and investments made for this item, R&D, or technological innovation in the tax period itself exceeds 10% of the gross tax liability reduced by international economic double taxation tax credit and rebates.
For foreign productions, expenses incurred in Spain qualify for a 30% tax credit on the first EUR 1 million of the tax credit base and a 25% tax credit for any excess tax credit base, provided that certain requirements are met. The tax credit may not exceed EUR 20 million. In the case of audio-visual series, the tax credit will be determined per episode and the limit will be EUR 10 million for each episode produced.
The limit of 25% of gross tax payable (*see below for Limits on the amount of tax credit applied*) does not apply in the case of this tax credit, meaning that gross tax payable may be reduced in its entirety, and if tax payable is insufficient, the taxpayer may request the difference from the tax authorities in its CIT return.
Taxpayers are eligible for a 20% tax credit for expenses incurred for producing and performing live performing arts and musical shows. This tax credit may not exceed EUR 500,000.
### Tax credit for increases in the number of disabled workers
A tax credit can be applied for increases in the number of disabled workers contracted per year on a permanent and full-time basis. The tax credit is EUR 9,000 per contracted worker whose level of disability is 33% or more, but less than 65%, and EUR 12,000 per contracted worker whose level of disability is 65% or more. This increase is calculated by taking the company's average number of staff of each of these categories in the tax year in question that meet the established requirements and comparing it with the company’s average number of staff in the same category in the previous tax year.
### Reserve for levelling-off of tax losses
The possibility of reducing the positive tax base of small companies by up to 10% by establishing a non-distributable reserve for the amount of the reduction is introduced (reserve for the levelling-off of tax losses). The reduction may not exceed EUR 1 million and should be reversed in line with the tax losses obtained by the company, subject to a five-year time limit.
### Limits on the amount of tax credit applied
The combined sum of all investment tax credits may not exceed 25% of the company’s gross tax payable less deductions for international double taxation and tax relief for income obtained in Ceuta and Melilla, export activities, and local public services. When R&D and technological innovation tax credits and tax credits for film productions and live performing arts and musical shows for expenses and investments in the year exceed 10% of the company's gross tax payable, less the tax credits and relief mentioned above, the limit will be 50%.
The application of the double taxation tax credits is limited to 50% of gross tax payable for those entities whose net turnover in the 12 months before the start of the financial year exceeded EUR 20 million, with effect for the tax periods starting on or after 1 January 2024 and that have not ended before  22 December 2024 (date of entry into force of Law 7/2024).
### Time limits for the application of tax reliefs
Tax relief that is not applied in the tax period owing to insufficient tax payable may be applied in tax periods ending in the 15 years immediately thereafter, with the exception of R&D and technological innovation credits, which may be applied in tax periods ending in the 18 years immediately thereafter, and relief for the avoidance of double taxation, which may be applied in the ensuing tax periods with no time limits.
## Special tax regimes
Special tax regimes are applicable in, amongst others, the following cases:
### Spanish and European Economic Interest Groupings (SEIGs and EEIGs) and Temporary Consortia of Entities (TCEs)
If the EEIG is not resident in Spain for tax purposes, Spanish tax-resident members include the corresponding part of the profits/(losses) determined for the grouping, corrected by applying the rules for determining taxable income for CIT or PIT purposes, as applicable. When the activity carried out by the members through the grouping determines the existence of a PE abroad, the rules provided for in Spanish NRIT or in the respective DTT apply.
Dividends distributed to Spanish non-resident EEIG members that have been subject to imputation are not taxed in Spain on the distribution.
### Restructuring operations
The special tax regime for restructuring operations is a tax neutrality regime implemented under EU Directive 2009/133. As a general rule, under this regime, asset transfers carried out through such transactions do not have any tax implications (either from a direct, indirect, or other Spanish tax perspective) for the parties involved (transferor, beneficiary, and shareholder), until a subsequent transfer takes place that is not protected by this regime.
The operations that can be taxed under this regime are mergers, global transfers, spin-offs of business units/majority interests, splits, share-to-share operations, contributions of business units, and contributions of assets (this last operation is not fully tax-protected). Each of them must comply with a series of requirements for the application of the regime.
Transfers of registered offices of an EU company or cooperative society between EU member states will not generate any tax for the company/cooperative society’s shareholders on their income, profits, or capital gains.
The tax credit position of a company dissolved as a result of a tax-protected restructuring operation is ‘acquired’ in full by the beneficiary company in the case of universal succession.
The ‘acquired’ tax credits only include tax credits that are obtained in relation to assets transferred in operations where the transferor is not dissolved or the succession is not a full succession for Spanish commercial purposes.
Tax losses may be transferred not only when the transferring company is dissolved but also when a line of business is transferred (in the latter case, only tax losses related to this line of business will be transferred), subject in both cases to certain restrictions.
Financial goodwill arising in a merger operation in which the acquirer owns an interest of at least 5% in the capital of the transferor is amortised for tax purposes at a maximum annual rate of 5% at the level of the Spanish beneficiary company of the merger, provided that such interest was acquired in a tax period that, for the transferor, commenced before 1 January 2015. Amortisation of financial goodwill does not have to be recorded in the income statement for it to be tax deductible.
When the interest has been acquired in a tax period that, for the transferor, commenced on or after 1 January 2015, this tax incentive, which aims to correct double taxation, will not be applicable, as, initially, the whole transferring company's capital gain will benefit from the tax exemption for the avoidance of double taxation, provided that the transferring company is a Spanish CIT payer.
This tax regime cannot be applied if the operation is carried out for the purpose of tax fraud or evasion (anti-abuse clause). An additional anti-abuse clause in line with the clause laid down by the EU directive is established in Spanish law to ensure that the tax regime cannot be applied if the operation is not carried out for valid economic/business reasons, such as the streamlining of activities or group restructuring to gain efficiency, but to obtain a tax benefit. If the tax authorities decide, as a result of its verification procedures, that the special tax regime is not applicable, either fully or partly, as there are no valid economic/business reasons for the operation, the only implication will be that the effects of the tax benefit obtained will be eliminated.
The special tax neutrality regime is applicable by default to restructuring operations. When these operations are carried out, the tax authorities should be notified of the type of operation and, when the case, whether the taxpayer opts not to apply the special tax regime. Failure to notify the tax authorities of this matter is a serious tax offence and carries a fine of EUR 10,000.
For debts incurred to acquire companies, the interest should be deducted for tax purposes taking into consideration the acquirer's operating profits, excluding the operating profits of any company with which the acquirer may merge during the four years following the acquisition. These financial expenses should also be taken into account for the purpose of the general financial expenses limit applicable.
Expenses that are not tax deductible owing to the application of this special rule can be deducted, subject to the above limits, in subsequent tax periods for an unlimited period of time. The limit is not applicable when the debt associated with the acquisition of the interest in the company reaches a maximum of 70% and is reduced, as from the time of the acquisition, by at least the proportional part corresponding to each of the following years until a level equal to 30% of the acquisition price is reached.
This limit does not apply to restructuring operations carried out before 20 June 2014 or to restructuring operations carried out on or after 20 June 2014 between companies that formed part of the same tax consolidation group in tax periods starting on or after that date.
### Tax transparency
Tax transparency (under international CFC rules) is not applicable for companies resident in the European Union, provided that the taxpayer can prove that the non-resident company has been set up and operates for valid economic/business reasons and carries out a business activity or that it is a CII regulated in EC Directive 2009/65/CE and not established in Section 54 of the Spanish CIT Act that has been set up and is domiciled in an EU member state.
### Venture capital companies and funds
Venture capital companies (VCCs) and funds (VCFs) may benefit from the following tax regime if certain requirements are met:
### Collective Investment Institutions (CIIs)
CIIs are subject to CIT at a reduced rate of 1%, provided that they meet certain requirements. They are not entitled to apply the tax exemption for the avoidance of double taxation on dividends and capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or a deduction for the avoidance of international double taxation. Dividends distributed by these institutions are subject to the general WHT regime. Shareholders are taxed on dividends received from the CII and on capital gains obtained for the transfer of the CII without being entitled to the application of the tax exemption for the avoidance of double taxation on dividends and capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or a deduction for the avoidance of international double taxation.
### Lease transactions
Financial leasing contracts with a purchase option that may be exercised at the end of the lease period may benefit from a special tax regime if they meet certain requirements. With this regime, the lessee may deduct the following expenses from its taxable income:
### Spanish holding companies of foreign companies regime
Spanish resident companies whose corporate purpose includes the holding and management of foreign companies’ shares (called ETVEs in Spain) and that, by law, are not equity companies (i.e. companies that do not carry on a business activity) are granted some tax benefits, subject to compliance with certain requirements.
The tax authorities must be notified of the application of this tax regime.
In addition, the distribution of profits by the holding company to non-resident companies or individual shareholders is not taxable in Spain if such profits come from income generated from non-resident companies and may benefit from the tax exemption for the avoidance of double taxation on dividends and capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or from income obtained abroad through a PE that may benefit from the exemption for the avoidance of international double taxation of income obtained through a PE unless the profits are distributed to a tax haven. Resident company shareholders are entitled to an internal tax credit on dividends under Spanish law.
### Small and medium-sized companies
Small and medium-sized companies are eligible for tax relief, such as accelerated depreciation/amortisation or more favourable bad debt provision treatment. To be eligible for this relief, turnover in the previous tax year must not exceed EUR 10 million and, by law, the company must not be considered an equity company. In the case of a group, the turnover of all group companies must be considered for this purpose. Companies that generate a turnover of EUR 10 million that have met the requirements to be considered small and medium-sized companies in the tax period in which they obtained such turnover and in the two previous tax periods may be eligible for this tax relief during the three tax periods immediately after the tax period in which they obtain this turnover.
### Special tax regime for companies that lease housing
Companies whose main business activity is the lease of housing located in Spain that they have constructed, promoted, or acquired may apply a special tax regime that significantly reduces CIT liability, provided that certain requirements are met.
### Real Estate Investment Trust Regime (SOCIMI)
A special tax regime is established in Spain for listed companies that make investments in the real estate market (called SOCIMIs in Spain) and meet certain requirements. SOCIMIs apply a 0% CIT rate and have strict profit distribution obligations.
## Special economic and tax regime of the Balearic Islands
A new special tax regime is introduced for the Balearic Islands, with effect for tax periods starting between 1 January 2023 and 31 December 2028.
### Reserve for investments in the Balearic Islands
Spanish CIT payers and Spanish NRIT payers with PEs in the Balearic Islands may reduce their taxable income by an amount equivalent to the amount allocated to a special reserve for certain specific investments in the Balearic Islands, up to a limit of 90% of annual undistributed earnings for taxpayers with establishments in the Balearic Islands.
The application of this reduction may never result in negative taxable income. The reduction is incompatible, for the same goods and expenses, with the CIT credits to promote certain activities (R&D and technological innovation tax credits, tax credits for job creation, etc.) or with any other tax incentive or measure that is considered state aid for EU law purposes if the accumulated amount exceeds the applicable thresholds.
The amounts allocated to this special reserve must be invested in qualifying investments within three years (including that in which the reserve is established). Investments will be subject to certain maintenance requirements.
Earnings from establishments in the Balearic Islands are those derived from business activities, including earnings from the transfer of the assets related to such business activities.
In turn, undistributed earnings are understood as those used to fund reserves, excluding legal reserves. However, neither the earnings derived from the transfer of assets whose acquisition would have resulted in the investment of this reserve, nor those derived from securities representing ownership interests in the capital or own funds of other entities, nor transfers of own capital to third parties are considered as such.
PIT payers whose business activities are taxed under the direct estimation regime will also be entitled to a tax credit for the net operating income allocated to the reserve resulting from business activities carried out in establishments in the Balearic Islands. The reserve must be invested in a qualifying investment within three years.
This regime is similar to the Canary Islands investment reserve scheme although the tax incentive is more limited in the case of the Balearic Islands, as the Canary Islands are considered an ultra-peripheral region and the incentive is considered a form of authorised state aid.
The regime must comply with the provisions of EU law as regards the activities carried out and the limits on aid.
### Special regime for industrial, agricultural, livestock, and fishing companies in the Balearic Islands
CIT payers and NRIT payers will be entitled to a tax allowance amounting to 10% of the gross income tax liability from the sale of tangible goods produced in the Balearic Islands resulting from industrial, agricultural, livestock, and fishing activities.
This tax benefit can be applied by companies that are domiciled or have a PE in the Balearic Islands.
The allowance is contingent upon maintaining the workforce. If the workforce increases, the incentive will be increased up to 25%.
This regime will also apply to PIT payers in the same terms as it does to CIT payers whose net income is determined by direct estimation.
The regime must comply with the provisions of EU law as regards the activities carried out and the limits on aid.
## Special economic and tax regime of the Canary Islands
Due to the remoteness and isolation of the Canary Islands, they have traditionally enjoyed a special economic and tax regime with specific economic and tax measures different to those established for the rest of Spain. As a result, they have one of the most advantageous tax regimes in Europe which, in addition, is not currently affected by the minimum effective tax rate established in the rest of Spain (amounting to 15% of profit).
However, the regime will indeed be affected by the regulations resulting  from Pillar Two (a global minimum tax rate of 15%), which will in turn  impact companies with turnover exceeding EUR 750 million , among other requirements.
Without prejudice to the above, , the tax incentives that we describe in the following paragraphs can very easily reduce the effective tax rate to around 4% or even less of profit.
Regarding direct taxes, the Canary Island economic and tax regime establishes the following tax benefits for companies and businesses domiciled in the Canary Islands or with a PE in the Canary Islands:
Besides a lower taxation with the Canary Island general indirect tax (IGIC at the general rate of 7%) compared to VAT and the specific IGIC exemptions applicable, companies domiciled in the Canary Islands that are CIT payers and are newly incorporated, start new activities, or improve their existing activities may benefit from the following relief for indirect taxes:
## Canary Islands Special Zone tax regime
In January 2000, a tax regime for the Canary Islands Special Zone (the zone known as the ZEC) was approved by the European Union. The main regulations of this regime, established by the Spanish government, are as follows:
However, certain companies may apply for exemption from the minimum investment requirement. Specifically, small and medium-sized enterprises with the innovative SME seal, awarded by the Ministry of Science and Innovation, or whose activity is aimed at obtaining the same, as well as R&D companies and those companies whose scope of action includes priority activities in sectors such as audio-visual, video games, IT, and telecommunications, may apply for the exemption.
In addition, the investment exemption is also applicable to companies regardless of the activity they carry out, provided that they initially hire a minimum of between six and ten employees (depending on whether they are located on a non-capital island or on Tenerife or Gran Canaria). In this case, a higher exemption percentage will apply the greater the number of employees hired. Specifically, the EUR 100,000 investment requirement will be reduced to EUR 60,000, 40,000, or 20,000 when companies generate 10, 15, 20 or more jobs, respectively. The investment requirement in the non-capital islands will be reduced from EUR 50,000 to 30,000, 20,000, or 10,000 depending on whether they generate six, eight, ten or more jobs.

## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
## Automatic and standardised exchange of tax information agreements
The US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) was enacted in 2010 to detect and prevent offshore tax evasion. Although, due to its name, it may seem that FATCA is for financial institutions, many global companies outside the financial services industry may be affected by FATCA if companies of their worldwide network fall under the purview of FATCA or have operational areas that make or receive payments subject to FATCA.
Multinational companies that are withholding agents are already required to report, withhold on payments, and record payees, but FATCA requires that changes be made to these activities. FATCA has established that multinational businesses should assess company payees differently, engage in withholding on certain gross proceeds transactions (a change from historic processes), and report other information to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
The withholding provisions of FATCA came into effect on 1 July 2014. Compliance with FATCA may require changes to existing systems and processes across business units and regions, the renewal of policies and day-to-day practices, as well as other new tasks, such as registering with the IRS.
Spain and the United States have signed an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) aimed at improving compliance of international tax laws and enforcing FATCA. Under this agreement, financial institutions in Spain and the United States are required to provide their tax authorities with information on taxpayers from the other signatory country. This information will then be automatically exchanged between those tax authorities through a standardised procedure.
## Multilateral Competent Authority Agreements
### Multilateral agreement on the automatic exchange of information on income received through digital platforms
The multilateral agreement between competent authorities on the automatic exchange of information on income received through digital platforms was published in the Official State Gazette on 19 September 2023.
Before this agreement, Law 13/2023, of 24 May 2023, amended the General Tax Law by including a new Additional Provision that aims to establish a new information reporting and due diligence obligation in relation to the informative declaration of subject platform operators with respect to mutual assistance.
This newly published agreement aims to allow the exchange of information between different administrations regarding income from the provision of accommodation, transportation, and other personal services. In addition, it allows the exchange of information on income obtained from the sale of goods and lease of means of transportation arranged through digital platforms.
### Multilateral agreement on the automatic exchange of information on the mechanisms for circumventing the common reporting and information standard for opaque offshore structures
The multilateral agreement between competent authorities on the automatic exchange of information on the mechanisms for circumventing the common reporting and information standard for opaque offshore structures was published in the Official State Gazette on 18 September 2023.
The obligation to report information on cross-border tax planning mechanisms, which was already included in Law 13/2023, of 24 May 2023, entails an important change in international tax transparency and reinforces the capacity of the states to confront extraterritorial tax evasion.
In particular, the agreement tries to prevent situations where professional advisers and other intermediaries design, market, or assist in the implementation of offshore structures and arrangements that can be used by non-compliant taxpayers to circumvent the correct reporting of relevant information to the tax administration of their jurisdiction of residence, including under the Common Reporting Standards (CRS).
## Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS)
In July 2013, the OECD published a 15-point Action Plan to address BEPS by multinational companies. The Action Plan identifies actions needed to address BEPS, sets deadlines to implement these actions, and identifies resources and methodology needed to implement these actions.
Some jurisdictions and the European Union have already started implementing parts of the actions into national laws. Moreover, the European Union adopted two Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives (ATAD and ATAD 2) that include certain minimum standards to combat tax avoidance. Whilst the ATAD was to primarily be implemented into national laws by 31 December 2018, certain ATAD 2 proposals must be implemented into national laws by 31 December 2019.
Although Spanish legislation was already very similar to ATAD, some amendments to CIT were implemented by Law 11/2021 on the prevention and fight against tax fraud and transposing the ATAD as regards CFC and exit tax rules:
CIT Law established that when residence is changed to another member state of the European Union, that exit tax could be deferred, at the taxpayer’s request, until the date of transfer to third parties of the assets concerned.
In this regard, and in accordance with the ATAD, the regime was modified with effect from the tax periods starting on 1 January 2021, replacing this deferral with the possibility of splitting payment of the exit tax over five years, when the change of residence is made to another member state or a third country that is a party to the European Economic Area Agreement, certain additional rules being established in the event that such a split is requested.
In parallel, when the transfer of assets has been subject to an exit tax in a member state of the European Union, the value determined by that member state will be accepted as a tax value in Spain, unless it does not reflect the market value.
On 9 March 2021, the Spanish government approved RDL 4/2021 amending the CIT Law and the NRIT Law as regards hybrid mismatches. The stated purpose of these amendments is to write into Spanish domestic law the anti-hybrid rules included in EU Directive 2016/1164, dated 12 July 2016 (ATAD), as amended by EU Directive 2017/952, dated 29 May 2017 (ATAD 2).
The RDL was published in the Spanish State Gazette on 10 March 2021 and entered into force the following day. The new rules effectively apply to the tax years not ended when the new rules entered into force (i.e. 11 March 2021).
While Spain already had some limited-scope anti-hybrid rules, the provisions now transposed into Spanish domestic legislation through RDL 4/2021 aim to cover the whole spectrum of hybrid mismatches arising between Spain and other jurisdictions. These rules will generally only come into play if the parties (located in different territories) to the arrangement are related, or when there is a structured arrangement (i.e. an arrangement involving a hybrid mismatch where the mismatch outcome is priced into the terms of the arrangement or an arrangement that has been designed to produce a hybrid mismatch outcome).
In particular, the new rules address the following situations:
Spain has implemented the secondary rule and will tax the income, to the extent not offset by DII in the payer’s jurisdiction, when the investor/payee is in Spain and the payer’s jurisdiction has considered the expense deductible. This taxation may be reversed if, during the following three years, the expense is offset in the payer’s jurisdiction against DII.
Spain has made use of the option allowed by ATAD 2 and has not enacted the secondary rule provided for these situations.
RDL 4/2021 also adopts the ATAD 2 rules concerning dual resident entities and hybrid transfers.
Finally, the enacted legislation clarifies that the anti-hybrid rules will not apply when the mismatch arises as a result of:
On 22 December 2021, the Instrument of ratification of the Multilateral Convention (MLI) to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS), made in Paris on 24 November 2016, was published in the Official State Gazette. Spain has formally made the relevant notifications with respect to 54 of its 88 tax treaties covered by the MLI. The measures resulting from the modifications introduced as a result of the MLI came into effect in Spain on 1 January 2023 in respect of 49 tax treaties covered by the MLI and will come into effect on 1 January 2024 in respect of 5 tax treaties.
On 25 May 2023, Spain published Law 13/2023 in the Official State Gazette, which introduced new interest deduction limitation rules in line with the ATAD. Because Spain's current interest deduction limitation rules were considered equally effective as those in the ATAD, Spain was authorised to defer the transposition of the ATAD interest deduction limitation until 2024. The new rules, which apply from 1 January 2024, provide that the deduction of net interest expense is limited to 30% of EBITDA (operating profit) for the year, with the explicit exclusion of income, expenses, or rent that have not been included in the tax base. The main items impacted by this measure will be qualifying dividends from Spanish subsidiaries outside the tax group and from foreign subsidiaries, as well as net income obtained through PEs located outside Spain, that have so far been included in EBITDA for purposes of the interest deduction limitation and have benefitted from the 95% (or 100% in case of PEs) tax exemption provided in the Spanish participation exemption.
## Reporting obligations for digital platforms operators (DAC 7)
Law 13/2023, of 24 May 2023, transposes the DAC7 rules into the Spanish legislation and introduces obligations on certain platform operators to register, collect and verify certain information regarding their users (i.e., sellers on the platform) and to report that information to the Spanish tax authorities.
In scope platform operators must register before the Spanish tax authorities, comply with certain due diligence procedures and report the DAC7 information on an annual basis.
The activities in scope include the provision of personal services, supply of goods, rental of immovable property and rental of any mode of transport.
Specific penalties are provided for reporting platform operators that do not comply with the registration, reporting or due diligence obligations.
DAC7 rules also set forth the mechanism for an automatic exchange of DAC7 information between the tax authorities of EU Member States.
## Disclosure statements on virtual currencies
Taxpayers who operate with cryptocurrencies will be subject to certain information reporting obligations that will be applicable with respect to fiscal year 2023 and following years. These obligations will affect:
## Mandatory disclosure of cross-border arrangements that can potentially be considered as aggressive tax planning (DAC 6)
DAC 6 provides for mandatory disclosure to the tax authorities of cross-border arrangements among EU countries or between EU countries and countries outside the European Union that can potentially be considered aggressive tax planning.
Responsibility for compliance with reporting requirements first all of falls on the intermediary. However, if the transactions are carried out without an intermediary, if this intermediary is outside the European Union or if it is entitled to legal privilege, it may fall to the taxpayer to comply with the reporting requirements.
The characteristics or features of a reportable cross-border arrangement are listed in the EU DAC 6 Directive and referred to as ‘hallmarks’. Spanish legislation closely follows the Directive, but there are some divergences that need to be considered, such as the requirement to report, under hallmark C1, not only direct but also indirect transactions.
## Special tax regime applicable in the Basque Country
The three provinces that make up the region of the Basque Country (Álava, Guipúzcoa, and Vizcaya) have an 'economic agreement' with Spain's central government (laid down in and regulated by Law 12 of 23 May 2002) in accordance with which these provinces are entitled to establish their own tax regimes.
There are certain provisions in Law 12 of 23 May 2002 regarding CIT that make this region of Spain more attractive for companies, and three CIT Acts have come into effect for each of the three provinces for tax periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
Additionally, it is important to remark that the Provincial Regions of the Basque Country have recently made changes to the CIT regulations. The tax reform was approved in March 2018 for Álava and Vizcaya and in May 2018 for Guipúzcoa, although the modifications are effective for tax periods starting from 1 January 2018.
As of 1 January 2019, the general tax rate is 24%.
### Lower tax rates and other tax benefits
#### Small companies
As of 1 January 2019, the general tax rate for small companies is 20%.
A small company is considered to be a company that meets the following requirements in the year prior to the application of the special tax regime:
Other benefits are as follows:
#### Micro companies
As of 1 January 2019, the general tax rate for micro companies is 20%.
A micro company is considered to be a company that meets the following requirements in the year prior to the application of the special tax regime:
Other benefits are as follows:
#### Holding companies
For holding companies, including, amongst others, real estate companies, the tax rates are as follows:
| Taxable income (EUR) | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| 0.00 to 2,500.00 | 20 |
| 2,500.01 to 10,000.00 | 21 |
| 10,000.01 to 15,000.00 | 22 |
| 15,000.01 to 30,000.00 | 23 |
| 30,000.01 and over | 25 |
The requirements to be taxed under these rates are as follows:
This tax regime establishes the following rules for these types of companies:
### Tax-loss carryforwards
The tax-loss carryforwards to be offset in each tax period cannot exceed 50% of the positive tax base (prior to offsetting). The limit is 70% for micro and small companies.
Additionally, the time limit to offset the tax-loss carryforwards is 30 years.
### Tax deductibility of amortisation of goodwill and intangible assets
Intangible assets should be considered to have a definite useful life.
Amortisation recorded for intangible assets is considered tax deductible over the assets’ useful lives. However, if the useful life cannot be determined, amortisation is tax deductible up to a maximum annual limit of 10% if the following requirements are met:
Furthermore, due to the above-mentioned amendment of the Audit Law, goodwill is amortisable over a useful life of ten years, although this accounting amortisation would not be tax deductible and the corresponding book-to-tax adjustment should be made.
From a tax perspective, goodwill amortisation is tax deductible up to a maximum annual limit of 12.5% if the following requirements are met:
An unavailable reserve for this purpose does not have to be recognised for this purpose.
However, if an impairment loss is recognised or if the goodwill is transferred, the tax amortisation should be reversed.
### Financial goodwill
Financial goodwill is tax deductible up to a maximum annual limit of 12.5% when at least a 5% interest is acquired in a company and the shares are not listed on a stock exchange or at least a 3% interest if the shares are listed on a stock exchange.
If the company from which the shares have been acquired has an interest in another company, the equity, assets, and rights recorded in the group's consolidated annual accounts must be taken into consideration when calculating the financial goodwill. The part of the financial goodwill for income obtained by previous owners that have availed of a double tax exemption for income obtained from transfers of shares is not tax deductible. Amounts deducted for this concept increase taxable income if there are impairment losses (*see Impairment losses below*).
The requirements for the shares are as follows:
If the shares are not acquired on a stock market, the company that acquires the shares must not be in any of the situations provided for in Section 42 of the Spanish Commercial Code in relation to the transferring company.
### Depreciation/amortisation periods
Depreciation/amortisation periods for assets are shorter than those established by state CIT law.
### Reinvestment of extraordinary income
Income obtained from the sale of tangible fixed assets or intangible assets can be deducted from taxable income if the following requirements are met:
From FY 2018 onwards, the possibility of carrying out the reinvestment through the acquisition of interest in companies has been eliminated.
### Income generated from intellectual or industrial property
From 1 July 2016, companies may deduct 70% of income (income less amortisation and expenses) obtained from transfers of intellectual or industrial property rights from taxable income upon complying with certain requirements only if the company has created the intellectual or industrial property itself.
If the intellectual or industrial property has been partially acquired or developed by related companies, this 70% reduction can only be applied if the ratio of expenses incurred with related parties does not exceed 30% of the expenses incurred in the development carried out by third parties or by the company on its own. However, if this ratio exceeds 30%, the reduction will be reduced proportionally.
The following features have also been introduced regarding this reduction:
In addition, in Álava and Vizcaya, companies may reduce taxable income by 5% of the acquisition price or production cost of intellectual or industry property assets used to carry on their own business activities if they fully own such assets. This reduction cannot exceed 0.5% of income obtained from the business activities in which these assets are used for.
This additional reduction is not applicable in Guipúzcoa.
The new tax regulations in force since 1 January 2018 have introduced some changes to the patent box regime. This incentive is limited to income generated from the transfer of the right to use or trading of patents, utility models, medications protection and plant protection products supplementary certificates, or advanced registered software obtained as a result of R&D projects. Therefore, the exclusion area of this regime is extended to, amongst others, the rights on information related to industrial, commercial, or scientific experiences (‘know-how’).
### Limitation on the tax deductibility of financial expenses
The tax deductibility of financial expenses is limited to 30% of the operating profit of the tax period (in accordance with EU Directive 2016/1164), according to the following rules:
In addition, the application of the thin capitalisation rule to taxpayers that apply the interest-capping rule is not compatible. The thin capitalisation rule only applies if the limitation of tax deductibility of financial expenses stated above does not apply.
The general thin capitalisation tax regime is established (with a 3:1 debt-to-equity ratio) to restrict the tax deductibility of financial expenses.
This limit applies to borrowings with any related companies, whether they are resident in Spain, the European Union, or any other countries. The limit does not apply when a company's net borrowing with related companies does not exceed EUR 10 million at any time during the tax period.
Companies may ask the tax authorities to propose a different ratio that they can apply.
Finally, those expenses derived from transactions carried out with related parties (persons or entities) that, because of a different tax qualification at their level, do not generate an income or are exempt or subject to a nominal tax rate lower than 10% are not tax deductible.
### Limit for tax relief for expenses incurred for representation, gifts, and certain transportation
Expenses incurred for representation, gifts, and certain transportation are tax deductible, with certain limits.
In addition to these limits, the allocation rule is maintained for 50% of vehicles used for both business activities and private purposes. In addition, for passenger and other similar cars, the maximum amount of what is understood to be a reasonable acquisition price (EUR 25,000) is maintained, and only expenses for vehicles that do not exceed this acquisition price will be tax deductible.
### Specific limit on the deduction of financial expenses on the acquisition of interests in the capital or equity of any type of company
A specific limit is introduced for financial expenses generated from debts incurred to acquire interests in the capital or equity of any type of company. These expenses are deductible, subject to an additional limit of 30% of the acquirer's operating profits, excluding the operating profits of any company that may merge into the acquirer or that may join its tax group during the four years following the acquisition (besides this specific limit, the general limit on tax deductibility will also apply to these financial expenses).
This specific limit is not applicable when the debt associated with the acquisition of the interest reaches a maximum of 70% and is reduced, as of the time of the acquisition, by at least the proportional part corresponding to each of the following years until a level equal to 30% of the acquisition price is reached.
### Charitable donations
However, a tax credit may be available for donations to non-profit organisations that comply with certain requirements, and which will amount to 30% of the donation. On the other hand, for donations made to listed priority sponsorship activities, the tax credit will amount to 45% of the donation. The general time and quantitative limits for tax credits apply to 'charitable donation' tax credits.
In Gipuzkoa, charitable donations are still considered deductible expenses for CIT purposes.
### Impairment losses
Losses for impairment of shares in companies are tax deductible in accordance with the following regulations:
Shareholder's equity shall be the shareholder's equity recorded in the consolidated annual accounts (*see Financial goodwill above*).
### Elimination of double taxation for dividends and income obtained from transfers of shares in resident and non-resident companies in Spain (exemption mechanism)
#### Dividends or shares in profits
In the Basque Country, a full participation exemption is established for dividends and income obtained from transfers of shares in resident and non-resident companies in Spain.
To apply the tax exemption for interests in companies resident in Spain, the following requirements established for interests in non-resident companies should be met:
Notwithstanding, for dividends generated from resident subsidiaries that do not comply with these requirements, 50% of the amount of the dividends may be deducted from taxable income. This rule therefore applies to:
Under the CIT regulations, to comply with the ‘subject to tax’ test, the company that distributes the dividend must be subject to a tax that is identical or analogous in nature to Basque CIT (i.e. Vizcaya) at a tax rate not lower than a nominal 10% rate. Therefore, the tax exemption for double taxation does not apply to companies taxed at a tax rate lower than 10%, even if they are resident in a country which has signed a DTT with Spain.
#### Income obtained from transfers of shares
Capital gains obtained from disposals of interests in resident and non-resident companies are not included in taxable income. The requirements to be met to not include them are the same as the requirements for the application of the dividend exemption ( which should be met for all financial years when the interest is held) except for the requirement regarding the percentage of the interest (5%, or 3% in the case of listed companies), which should be met on the day when the transfer is made.
Under the CIT regulations, to comply with the ‘subject to tax’ test, the company distributing the dividend should be subject to a tax that is identical or analogous in nature to the Basque CIT (i.e. Vizcaya) at a tax rate no lower than a nominal 10% rate. Therefore, the tax exemption for double taxation does not apply to companies taxed at a tax rate lower than 10%, even if they are resident in a country that has signed a DTT with Spain.
If any of the requirements are not met, the part of the income corresponding to a net increase of undistributed profits will not be included in taxable income in proportion to the profits generated in financial years when the requirements are met, and the part that does not correspond to such net increase will be presumed to be generated linearly during the time when the interest is held. In the case of resident subsidiaries that do not comply with the requirements of being subject to CIT or a similar tax and of carrying on business activities, an amount equal to the net increase of undistributed profits that may be allocated to the interest in the subsidiary generated during the time when the interest is held (excluding the part that would not have been included in taxable income with the offsetting of tax-loss carryforwards) will not be included in taxable income (up to the limit of calculated income).
### Income obtained by PEs
The exemption will not be applied when the PE’s income is tax exempt in the state in which it is located or is taxed by an identical or similar tax to the CIT at a nominal tax rate lower than 10%.
### Participating loans to carry out new business activities or projects
Income generated from variable interest on participating loans is not included in taxable income if it is related to the borrower's profits. The exemption does not apply to remuneration generated from fixed interest.
The following requirements should be met in this case:
WHT levied on interest not included in taxable income is not deductible (general 19% tax rate).
### Measures to foster companies' capitalisation
Some measures have been introduced to improve the tax treatment of structures based on an increase in shareholders' equity and a reduction of the need to resort to borrowing. These measures are:
#### Reserve to foster business capitalisation
Companies may reduce taxable income by an amount equal to 15% of the amount by which shareholder's equity is increased for tax purposes compared to the shareholder's equity of the previous year, and this amount should be allocated to a non-distributable reserve for at least five years. During this five-year period, the company's shareholders' equity should remain the same or be increased unless it is decreased due to accounting losses.
The application of this deduction may not give rise to a negative taxable income or an increase in negative taxable income although amounts not deducted due to insufficient taxable income may be deducted in the following tax periods.
#### Special reserve for levelling-off of profits
Companies may reduce taxable income by the amount of accounting results allocated to the special reserve for 'levelling-off of profits' up to a maximum amount of 10% of the part of these results that may be freely distributed under company law and up to the limit of 15% of taxable income for the financial year. In addition, the balance of the special reserve may not exceed 25% of shareholder's equity for tax purposes at all times.
This reserve is allocated to offset tax-loss carryforwards, in which case the tax-loss carryforwards cannot be offset in future years; consequently, this is a way to offset tax-loss carryforwards earlier. If, within a period of ten years, the company does not generate tax-loss carryforwards, the reserve will be treated as taxable income. In this case, the effect will be a temporary deferral of tax.
#### Special reserve to boost entrepreneurship and production activities
In Álava and Vizcaya, companies may reduce taxable income by 65% of annual accounting profits. In Guipúzcoa, the reduction is 60%. These profits should be allocated to the special reserve to boost entrepreneurship and production activities, up to a maximum amount of 45% of taxable income. In addition, the balance of this reserve may not exceed 50% of shareholders' equity for tax purposes at all times.
This reserve is not freely distributable and should be used within a period of three years for, amongst others, new non-current assets, assets that give rise to a tax credit for environmental investments, or for investments in companies under development.
### Investments in new tangible fixed assets
A 10% tax credit can be applied for investments in new tangible fixed assets upon complying with certain requirements. The minimum depreciation period for the assets, excluding computer equipment, is five years. The tax credit is 5% for investments in non-current assets that are considered to be improvements or investments in leased assets carried out by lessees.
The investment should exceed 10% of the carrying amount (less depreciation/amortisation) of the company's tangible fixed assets, buildings, and software recorded for the previous year.
This incentive is improved by facilitating the application of this tax credit when the annual amount of the investment in new tangible fixed assets exceeds EUR 5 million, even though this investment does not exceed the 10% limit stated above.
A 30% tax credit can be availed of for expenses incurred from R&D activities. If the expenses are higher than the average expenses incurred by the company during the previous two years, the tax credit is 50% on the excess amount.
An additional tax credit of 20% can be availed of for the following expenses:
A 10% tax credit can be availed of for investments made in tangible fixed assets (excluding buildings) and intangible assets that are exclusively assigned to R&D activities.
### Participation in R&D and technological innovation projects
Under Basque legislation, a deduction is applicable for taxpayers participating in the financing of projects made by third parties.
The funder of the project can apply the R&D deductions with the limit of 1.2 multiplied by the amount paid for the project. The excess can be applied by the taxpayer that carries out the project.
### Expenses incurred for technological innovation
A 20% or 15% tax credit can be availed of for certain expenses incurred for technological innovation.
### Expenses incurred for environmental conservation and improvement and for conservation of energy
Companies are eligible for a 30% tax credit for investments made in the equipment listed in the Basque List of Environmental Technologies upon complying with certain requirements.
Companies may also qualify for a 15% tax credit for investments made and expenses incurred in respect of tangible fixed assets upon complying with certain requirements.
### Job creation
To benefit from the tax credit for job creation, the average increase in the workforce must be for employees with an indefinite contract and whose salaries are higher than the minimum inter-professional salary, increased by 70%.
In Vizcaya, the tax credit is 25% of the employee's gross salary up to a limit of 50% of the inter-professional minimum wage. In Álava and Gipuzkoa, the tax credit is EUR 7,000 for each employee and financial year.
To apply the tax credit, the company’s average number of staff with an indefinite contract must be increased by at least the same number of contracts that generated the tax credit, and this increase must be maintained by the company for three years.
### Investment in micro, small, or medium-sized companies of new or recent creation, innovative, or linked to the silver economy
25% of the amounts paid for the subscription or acquisition of shares or shareholdings in companies considered as micro, small, or medium-sized companies will be deductible from the tax amount in Vizcaya and Álava.
The tax credit will be 35% of the amounts paid for the subscription or acquisition of shares or shareholdings in innovative companies or those whose corporate purpose is directly linked to the silver economy.
### Professional training expenses in relation to the silver economy and the caring economy
A tax credit is applicable in Vizcaya for the performance of vocational training activities in relation to the silver economy and the caring economy.
The tax credit will amount to 10% of the expenses incurred in each FY or, in certain circumstances, to 15%.
### Tax incentives for the promotion of culture in Vizcaya
With effect from 1 January 2023, relevant improvements have been introduced in Vizcaya regarding tax incentives for the promotion of culture.
#### Investments and expenses in audio-visual works productions
Vizcaya’s taxpayers may generate a tax deduction whose calculation base is the production cost and the costs of obtaining copies and advertising costs. The deduction percentages are as follows:
The quantitative limit of 50% is applicable to this deduction once the deductions of 70% and 35% have been applied.
#### Investments in book publishing
The deduction is 10% of the tax liability in Vizcaya.
#### Deduction for live performances of performing arts and musicals
In Vizcaya, the basis for calculating this deduction will be the direct costs of an artistic, technical, and promotional nature. The amount of the deduction will be 30% of the expenses incurred (40% if the show is in Basque).
The deduction generated in each tax period may not exceed EUR 1 million for each taxpayer, and the amount of the deduction together with any subsidies may not exceed 80% of expenses.
The quantitative limit of 50% is applicable to this deduction once the deductions of 70% and 35% have been applied.
#### Participation in the financing of audio-visual works and live shows of the scenic and musical arts.
Likewise, in Vizcaya, the possibility is introduced that it is the financiers of the aforementioned projects that generate the above deductions. However, the deduction of the financiers will be totally or partially incompatible with the deductions to which the contributor who makes the audio-visual work or the live show is entitled. In any event, the following requirements must be taken into account:
The quantitative limit of 50% is applicable to this deduction in Vizcaya
### Tax incentives for the promotion of culture in Alava and Guipuzcoa
With effect from 1 January 2024, relevant improvements have been introduced in Alava and Guipuzcoa regarding tax incentives for the promotion of culture.
#### Investments and expenses in audio-visual works productions
Vizcaya’s taxpayers may generate a tax deduction whose calculation base is the production cost and the costs of obtaining copies and advertising costs. The deduction percentages are as follows:
If the work is shot entirely in Basque, the deduction percentage will increase by 10 percentage points.
The quantitative limit of 50% is applicable to this deduction once the deductions of 70% and 35% have been applied.
#### Investments in book publishing
The deduction is 5% of the tax liability in Guipuzcoa and 10% in Álava
#### Deduction for live performances of performing arts and musicals
In Alava and Guipuzcoa, the basis for calculating this deduction will be the direct costs of an artistic, technical, and promotional nature. The amount of the deduction will be 30% of the expenses incurred (40% if the show is in Basque).
The deduction generated in each tax period may not exceed EUR 1 million for each taxpayer, and the amount of the deduction together with any subsidies may not exceed 80% of expenses.
The quantitative limit of 50% is applicable to this deduction once the deductions of 70% and 35% have been applied.
#### Participation in the financing of audio-visual works and live shows of the scenic and musical arts.
Likewise, in Alava and Guipuzcoa, the possibility is introduced that it is the financiers of the aforementioned projects that generate the above deductions. However, the financier’s deduction will be totally or partially incompatible with the deductions to which the contributor who makes the audio-visual work or the live show is entitled. In any event, the following requirements must be taken into account:
The quantitative limit of 35% is applicable to this deduction.
### Time limits for the application of tax credits
The temporary limit for the application of the tax credits is increased to 30 years.
### Limits on the amount of tax credit applied
In line with the above, the following quantitative limits have been established:
#### Effective tax rate and minimum tax
The Basque CIT regulations establish a minimum taxation of 17% to determine a company's effective CIT liability. Tax credits applied in the tax period cannot reduce effective CIT liability below this minimum although this limit does not apply to R&D and technological innovation and environmental conservation tax credits and, in Vizcaya, audiovisual works and live performances and, in Vizcaya, tax credits for participating in the financing of audio-visual works and live performances connected with the scenic and musical arts
However, if an entity maintains or increases the average of its employees with indefinite contracts with regard to the preceding financial year, the percentage of minimum taxation will be reduced by two points.
Thus, the application of tax credits to determine the effective tax liability of a company that obtains positive taxable income (except for R&D and technological innovation tax credits, environmental conservation tax credits and, in Vizcaya, audiovisual works and live performances) cannot give rise to an effective CIT liability that is lower than the following rates:
|  | General tax rate (%) | Minimum tax rate (%) | Minimum reduced tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| General companies | 24 | 17 | 15 |
| Small and micro companies | 20 | 15 | 13 |
The minimum reduced tax rate applies to companies that maintain or increase their average number of staff of the previous year indefinitely.
### Advance CIT payments
The new CIT regulations have also introduced an annual advance payment, which must be self-assessed during the first 25 calendar days of October each year. The prepayment is 5% of the tax base of the last tax period whose filing deadline has expired on 1 October and it is deductible from the effective tax liability.
### Tax groups
However, the non-resident controlling company may appoint any other company of the Basque tax group of companies as the group’s representative as long as the appointed company is subject to the tax regulations applicable to the company of the tax group with the highest turnover in the previous tax year.
### Tax regime applicable to the «UEFA» finals
On the occasion of the celebration of the final of the "UEFA Women's Champions League 2024" on Saturday, 25 May 2024 and the "UEFA Europa League 2025" in May 2025 at San Mames stadium in Bilbao, Bizkaia has introduced a special tax scheme applicable to these international sports competitions.
The following income linked to the holding of the competitions will be exempt:
The holding of the competitions will be considered a priority activity during 2024 and 2025.
These tax measures will be in force until 31 December , 2025 for individuals and 1 January  2026 for other entities.
### Exit tax regime
In accordance with the provisions of the EU Directive (EU) of the Council, of 12 July 2016, the exit tax regime for cases where there is a change of residence and cessations of PEs is modified from FY 2018 onwards, replacing the deferral regime by a fractionation system (fractioning over tax periods concluded in the five immediate years following the exit).
### Obligation to disclose assets located overseas
The obligation to disclose assets located overseas, such as accounts, shares, real estate, or vehicles, is also established in the three Basque territories. Taxpayers in these territories should file a tax return (Form 720) annually between 1 January and 31 March to declare these assets. Fines are imposed if CIT payers fail to comply with this obligation.

The most important measures contained in this legislation that affect individual taxation are:
## Organic Law 1/2025
Organic Law 1/2025, of 2 January, introduces measures to the Justice System for efficiency purposes. Since it establishes  mandatory mediation (or an alternative method to resolve disputes) before the filing of a lawsuit, within civil, commercial and social processes, the Law adapts the tax exemption on compensation received as a result of civil liability for personal damages, regulated in the Personal Income Tax Law, which was applicable only when it was established by a judgement.
As a consequence of this measure, the law provides that it will also be applicable when the compensation is agreed through alternative dispute resolution methods and  payment is made by the insurance company.
## Royal Decree-Law 4/2024
Royal Decree-Law 4/2024, which extends certain measures to address the economic and social consequences of the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and by which urgent tax, energy, and social measures are adopted, was passed on 26 June 2024 and published in the Spanish Official Gazette on 27 June 2024. The main tax measures included that affect individuals’ taxation are the following:
The corporate income tax (CIT) free depreciation incentive provided for investments in new vehicles and new charging infrastructures for electric vehicles used for business purposes that come into operation in the tax periods starting in 2024 will also be applicable to PIT payers that carry out the economic activities in which the vehicles and charging infrastructures are used. When such vehicles or charging infrastructures are transferred, the tax depreciation that exceeds that which would have been applicable had the free depreciation incentive not been applied will not reduce the acquisition value for the purposes of calculating the capital gain or loss arising from such transfer. This excess will be considered business income obtained in the tax period in which the assets are transferred.
## Royal Decree 142/2024
Royal Decree 142/2024, dated 6 February 2024, amends the Regulation of Personal Income Tax, approved by Royal Decree 439/2007, dated 30 March 2007, regarding withholdings and payments on account.
To prevent workers receiving the minimum interprofessional wage from being subject to withholdings or payments on account, paragraph 1 of Article 81 of the Personal Income Tax Regulation is amended, indicating the new amounts of employment income to which withholdings and payments on account are applied, based on the number of children and other dependants and the taxpayer's situation.
The Royal Decree raises the minimum amount to apply withholdings from EUR 15,000 to EUR 15,876, which will allow those who earn the minimum wage in 2024 to not have PIT withholdings applied to their payroll.
This modification aims to exempt the minimum interprofessional wage from withholdings; in addition, salaries close to the minimum interprofessional wage will also see a reduction in the applicable withholding.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
## Employment expenses
The following, amongst others, can be deducted from gross employment income for PIT purposes:
Employment income (with certain exceptions) with a vesting period of more than two years that is not obtained on a regular or recurring basis and employment income that is obtained on a notably irregular basis in accordance with the regulations implemented under Spanish PIT Law is reduced by 30% if, in both cases, the income is recorded in a single tax period (except in the case of income resulting from the termination of an ordinary or special employer/employee relationship). The amount regarding which the 30% reduction can be applied should not exceed EUR 300,000.
The reduction will not apply when it has been applied on income generated over more than two years obtained in the previous five tax periods, unless the income is generated from the termination of an ordinary or special employer/employee relationship.
When employment income is between EUR 700,000.01 and EUR 1 million and is generated from the termination of an employment or commercial relationship, the 30% reduction is applied on the amount resulting from the following calculation: EUR 300,000 - (severance pay - EUR 700,000). When the income generated is EUR 1 million or more, the income on which the 30% reduction can be applied is zero.
As for 2025, a new 30% reduction has been approved on the business income from economic activities derived from the creation of literary, artistic or scientific works, and on the income from work obtained by artists and their technicians or assistants, which exceeds 130% of the average amount of income obtained in the three previous tax periods. The maximum base on which the reduction can apply is EUR 150.000.
Taxpayers whose net employment income is under EUR 19,747.50 and who have no other non-exempt income over EUR 6,500 can reduce their net employment income by the following amounts:
This general reduction for employment income and its application is limited to income under EUR 19,747.50. Higher reductions are established for employees over 65 years of age, unemployed persons who accept a job that requires a change of their place of permanent residence, or persons with a recognised disability.
The amount resulting from the application of the aforementioned reductions may not be negative.
Effective as of 17 July 2023, the tax exemption for travel expenses to be compensated by the company to its employees has been increased from EUR 0.19 to EUR 0.26 per kilometre covered if the reality of the displacement is justified. The amount of toll charges and parking expenses are also exempt from taxation.
## Business expenses
Net business income is calculated by deducting from gross business income the expenses incurred to obtain it.
PIT payers who determine their business income using the direct evaluation method apply CIT regulations with some exceptions. Therefore, to calculate net business income, expenses are those which are not non-deductible for CIT purposes.
Net business income is calculated in accordance with Spanish CIT laws with the application of some specific regulations.
Tax amortisation of goodwill is deductible up to an annual rate of 5%, provided that certain requirements are met.
Tax amortisation of other intangible assets whose useful life may not be reliably estimated is deductible up to an annual rate of 5% if certain requirements are met.
Maintenance expenses incurred to carry on the business activity are also tax deductible, when the activity is carried on in catering and hospitality establishments and the expenses are paid using any electronic means of payment. The limits of the deductible amount are the same as those for employed persons.
Health insurance premiums paid by the self-employed person are deductible in the part corresponding to their own coverage and that of their spouse and children under 25 who live with them. The maximum deduction limit will be EUR 500 for each of the persons indicated above or EUR 1,500 for each of them with a disability.
Gross business income generated over a period of more than two years or that is evidently irregular income in accordance with the regulations implemented under Spanish PIT law, when recorded in a single tax period, qualifies for a 30% reduction with certain limits and requirements. The amount on which the 30% reduction can be applied should not exceed EUR 300,000.
Net business income is reduced by EUR 2,000.
In addition, net business income is reduced by:
Higher reductions are provided for persons with a recognised disability.
These reductions can only be applied if the following requirements are met:
A reduction of up to EUR 1,620 is established for taxpayers who do not meet these requirements and whose non-exempt income, including business income, in the tax period is under EUR 8,000. When such business income amounts to between EUR 8,000 and EUR 12,000, a reduction of EUR 1,620 - (0.405 x [business income - EUR 8,000]) will be applicable instead.
## Deductions from real estate income
The following expenses are deducted from gross income generated from real estate owned by PIT payers (generally lease income):
Positive income declared for leases of real estate used for residential purposes is reduced by 60%.
Real estate income generated over a period of more than two years or that is evidently irregular in accordance with the regulations implemented under Spanish PIT law and recorded in a single tax period qualifies for a 30% reduction. The amount on which the 30% reduction can be applied should not exceed EUR 300,000.
## Deductions from moveable capital income
In determining net income from dividends, interest, or other types of income from capital established by Spanish PIT law as income from capital different to real estate, only the following expenses may be deducted from the gross income:
## Reductions to net taxable income
### Contributions to pension plans
A taxpayer's annual contributions to qualifying pension plans is deductible up to a maximum of EUR 1,500 per year. The limit will be increased by EUR 8,500 when it comes from business contributions or employee contributions to the same social security instrument for an amount equal to or less than the amounts resulting from the following table, depending on the amount of the business contribution:
| Annual contribution amount | Maximum employee contribution |
| --- | --- |
| EUR 500 or less | The result of multiplying the business contribution by 2.5 |
| Between EUR 500.01 and EUR 1,500 | EUR 1,250, plus the result of multiplying by 0.25 the difference between the business contribution and EUR 500 |
| More than EUR 1,500 | The result of multiplying the business contribution by 1 |
However, in any case, the multiplier 1 will be applied when the employee obtains in the fiscal year employment income of more than EUR 60,000 from the company making the contribution.
The amount may not exceed 30% of total individual net income from employment and business activities.
In addition, taxpayers whose spouses do not obtain income from employment or business activities over EUR 8,000 can deduct the contributions made to qualifying pension plans from their own taxable income on behalf of the spouse, up to a maximum of EUR 1,000 per year.
## Personal and family allowances
In 2025, the following allowances apply:
When two or more taxpayers are entitled to apply these allowances, they are equally divided between the taxpayers. However, when taxpayers have different degrees of kinship, the allowance is applied by the taxpayer with the nearest kinship unless their annual income, excluding exempt income, does not exceed EUR 8,000, in which case the allowance is applied by the taxpayer with the next degree of kinship.
The allowance cannot be applied when the income of the relatives in ascending or descending order with respect to which this allowance may be applied is over EUR 1,800 and these persons file their own tax returns.
The minimum thresholds stated above will apply to the personal and family circumstances existing on the date on which the tax becomes due and payable (generally, 31 December).
In the cases of legal marital separation, the allowance for relatives in a descending line is applied by the parent who is assigned the guardianship and custody of the child/children at the date of accrual (generally, 31 December) as this is the person who the child/children live with.
When guardianship and custody is shared, the allowance is pro-rated between the parents, regardless of which parent the child/children lives with at the date of accrual.
## Losses
Capital losses arising from transfers of assets are included in savings income and can only be offset against capital gains included in savings income of the tax period. If the result of offsetting capital losses is negative, they may only be offset against certain positive moveable capital income, with the limit of 25% of such positive moveable capital income. If the result of this last offsetting is still negative, they may only be offset against capital gains (or 25% of positive moveable capital income) included in savings income generated in the following four years.
Capital losses that do not arise from transfers of assets are included in general income and can only be offset against capital gains included in general income of the tax period. If the balance is negative, the amount should be offset against the positive balance resulting from compensating the tax period’s income and allocated income included in the general tax base up to the limit of 25% of that positive balance. If, following this compensation, there is still a negative balance, the amount of the balance should be offset over the following four years.

## Individual - Other issues
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
## Trusts
The legal concept of trusts does not exist in Spanish law and so it is not recognised by the Spanish tax authorities or the Spanish courts. Therefore, the tax treatment of trusts may vary on a case-by-case basis and the Spanish tax authorities usually consider that the economic reality of the trust should be analysed rather than its legal nature. A trust should always take the form of a legal entity recognised by Spanish law.
As Spanish tax law does not specifically regulate the taxation of trusts, the tax treatment of the legal relationships involved in trusts should be determined abstractly based on the general guiding principles of the Spanish tax system. This task is further complicated by the fact that scientific and administrative doctrine on the subject is scarce and not based on any clearly defined criteria. In practice, this means that the economic relationships between the members of a trust should be regarded as held directly between them and the tax implications of this should be analysed accordingly.
## Treatment of flow-through business entities
Under Spanish law, there are several types of partnerships, and it is important to distinguish between business entities, which are CIT payers, and partnerships, which are flow-through business entities. As a general rule, business entities with separate legal personality are treated as CIT payers and business entities without separate legal personality are treated as flow-through business entities. Spanish law establishes a specific tax regime called the ‘income allocation regime’ for income generated by business entities without separate legal personality. As from 2003, under Spanish law, business entities set up outside Spain that have the same or a similar legal nature to that of a Spanish business entity taxed under the income allocation regime also fall within the scope of this regime.
On 6 February 2020, the Spanish General Directorate for Taxes issued a binding resolution, setting out the following basic requirements that a foreign entity must meet for it to be considered to have the same or a similar legal nature to that of a Spanish business entity taxed under the income allocation regime:
Mainly, there are two types of situations where non-residents may be liable to tax in Spain in connection with partnerships: (i) non-residents who are members of a Spanish partnership; or (ii) foreign business entities which, on complying with certain conditions, may be considered to be a partnership for Spanish tax purposes and either the foreign partnership or their members may be subject to tax in Spain if they have any kind of interests in Spain.
Under Spanish NRIT law, the legal features of a foreign partnership are the main factor to determine whether it is a flow-through business entity for Spanish tax purposes. Nevertheless, rulings of the Spanish tax authorities are taking the simpler view that a foreign partnership is a flow-through business entity when it is not liable to tax in its country of residence.
In addition, as previously stated, Spanish NRIT law distinguishes between non-resident flow-through business entities with a presence in Spain and non-resident flow-through business entities without that presence.
If the Spanish/non-resident entity carries on a business activity in Spain, its non-resident members operate in Spain through a PE. That means that the income generated by the entity is directly taxable at the level of the entity. The mechanisms used to tax these entities are similar to those used to tax non-resident taxpayers with a PE in Spain, although other regulations also apply.
If the Spanish/non-resident entity does not carry on a business activity, its non-resident members are taxed under Spanish NRIT law and therefore there is no taxation at the level of the entity. Instead, in accordance with Spanish tax law the income is allocated to the entity’s members as if the entity had not existed. Whilst Spanish resident members would include their share of the income in their return for direct taxes (PIT or CIT), non-resident members would be taxed by NRIT.
## Work and residence permits for Spain
International assignees from EU countries do not need to obtain a work and residence permit. If the assignee plans to stay in Spain for more than three months, they should register in the Central Registry of Foreigners (*Registro Central de Extranjeros*) to obtain a foreigner’s ID number in Spain.
Please note that after Brexit, United Kingdom (UK) citizens are no longer considered EU citizens. Only those UK citizens registered as living in Spain before 2021 are beneficiaries of the withdrawal agreement and can maintain their status.
On the other hand, international assignees from outside the European Union wishing to engage in technical or professional profit-making activities in Spain, either as employees or as self-employed persons, should obtain a work and residence permit before they commence their employment activity.
As a general rule, if the assignee is an employee and, due to the characteristics of one's job, the assignee must comply with the provisions of the National Employment Situation (*Situación Nacional de Empleo*), applications for work and residence permits in Spain are made in three stages:
It should be noted that there are situations where the first step related to the National Employment Situation is not necessary. These situations are as follows:
Work and residence permits are issued for a maximum period of one year and an application can be made for their renewal within the two months prior to their expiry date and, in some cases, within the three months after their expiry, notwithstanding the penalties that may arise from the application in the three months following.
## Work and residence permits in Spain for highly qualified workers, entrepreneurs, and investors
With effect from 29 September 2013, immigration procedures for certain individuals have been streamlined for reasons of economic interest in the following cases:
Under this law, as a general rule, work and residence permits may be issued for a maximum period of three years and can be renewed for an additional two years.
(\*) In May 2014, a Directive on Intra-Corporate Transferees was adopted by the European Union, which introduced a common set of rules to make it easier for companies outside the European Union to send key staff to their branches in the European Union.
Under the new Directive, once foreign nationals are granted an intra-corporate transfer (ICT) permit to work in an EU member state, they can be transferred within the European Union almost freely, provided that they work for the same company or group of companies. Under the Directive, they will have the same protection as EU-posted workers and are required to receive the same remuneration as local hires.
The main benefits for intra-corporate transferees and highly qualified professionals are that the position does not need to be published on the national employment system and that the issuance of the letter approving the work and residence permit will take between one and three months.
Distinguishing between two types of authorisations: (i) residence authorisation for highly qualified professionals holding an EU Blue Card and (ii) national residence authorisation for highly qualified professionals.
The first applies to cases where foreign workers are going to perform a job that requires qualifications derived from higher education training of a minimum duration of three years, equivalent at least to Level 2 of the Spanish Qualifications Framework for Higher Education, or who have a minimum of five years of knowledge, skills, and competencies backed by professional experience that can be considered equivalent to this qualification and relevant to the profession or sector specified in the employment contract or firm job offer.
The second option is for cases where foreign workers are going to perform a job or professional activity that requires a qualification equivalent at least to Level 1 of the Spanish Qualifications Framework for Higher Education, or knowledge, skills, and competencies backed by at least three years of professional experience that can be considered equivalent to this qualification.
(\*\*\*) In the case of international remote workers, in the event of exercising a professional activity, the holder of the authorisation for international remote work will be allowed to work for a company located in Spain, provided that the percentage of such work does not exceed 20% of their total professional activity. The visa for international remote work will have a maximum validity of one year unless the work period is shorter, in which case the visa will have the same validity as this period, and the remote worker must request (if they wish to remain in Spain) its transformation into a residence permit for international remote workers, which has a maximum validity of three years.
## Exchange control regulations
Spanish residents opening bank accounts abroad or transferring funds into or out of a non-resident’s bank account are required to make some notifications to the Statistics Department of the Bank of Spain, as indicated below.
A Spanish resident who carries out bank transactions with non-residents or has financial assets and liabilities abroad amounting to more than EUR 1 million should notify the Statistics Department of the Bank of Spain of the details of the bank account where the transaction is made and its holder, amongst other matters. This notification is not required for transactions under EUR 1 million unless the Bank of Spain asks for this information, which should be made available within two months of the date of the request.
These notifications are regulated in the Bank of Spain Circular 4/2012, which establishes the notifications that should be made at different time intervals (monthly, quarterly, or annually) when the total amount of the bank transactions carried out or financial assets and liabilities existing abroad in a year is over EUR 1 million and depending on their total amount in the year. In addition, the Spanish General Tax Act 58/2003, of 17 December 2003, establishes an obligation to disclose accounts located overseas for resident individuals and companies, PEs in Spain of non-resident companies, and the entities indicated in Section 35.4 of the Spanish General Tax Act (estate of deceased persons, community estate, and other entities without legal personality that constitute a taxable economic unit or assets).
Similarly, under EU and Spanish law, any persons entering or leaving Spain with payment means amounting to EUR 10,000 or more (or the equivalent value in foreign currency) should declare them at the border (Customs services).
Finally, regarding transactions carried out in the European Union, as of 1 February 2014, the current regulations on euro credit transfers and direct debits are the SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) rules. There is a new case of retail payments as a result of the SEPA instruments, which are currently the same for all the countries in SEPA.
## Special expatriate tax regime
Prior to the implementation of the recently approved Law to promote the Spanish ecosystem for emerging companies (‘Start-up Law‘; Law 28/2022), only the taxpayers acquiring tax residence in Spain as a result of an employment contract (with the exception of the special employment relationship of professional sportspeople) or as a result of acquiring the condition of director in a company (with certain requirements) may opt to be taxed under Spanish NRIT law instead of Spanish PIT law in the year when the option is exercised and in the following five years.
With effect from 1 January 2023, the abovementioned Start-up Law has introduced new scenarios, apart from the three explained above, to opt to be taxed under Spanish NRIT law instead of Spanish PIT law for taxpayers acquiring tax residence in Spain, as follows:
In addition, the Start-up Law has eliminated for the taxpayers coming to Spain as a result of acquiring company director status the previous requirement that such a taxpayer and the company cannot be related parties but only keeping such a requirement when the company consists of assets not linked to the company’s activity of more than 50%.
Furthermore, the Start-up Law has extended the application of this Special Tax Regime to the taxpayer’s spouse and children under the age of 25 (or those of any age if they are legally considered disabled) when certain requirements are met, as follows:
For family members moving to Spain together with the main taxpayer, the regime will apply until the last year of application for the main taxpayer. Family members must apply for this regime within six months of their arrival in Spain or after the date of registration of the main taxpayer with the social security authorities.
Finally, the last amendment that the Start-up Law has introduced in this Special Tax Regime refers to benefit-in-kind income obtained by these taxpayers, extending the tax exemptions provided in article 42.3 of the Spanish PIT Law (applicable to regular tax resident taxpayers) under the Special Tax Regime. These tax exemptions on certain benefit-in-kind income are related to the supply of products at discounted prices in canteens to employees, to contributions to insurance companies for sickness cover for the employees, beyond others.
In such cases, taxpayers are taxed on their Spanish-source income and capital gains. As an exception, taxpayers will be taxed on their employment income obtained worldwide. The applicable tax rate is 24% for the first EUR 600,000 of taxable income and 47% on any excess, except for income from non-resident accounts, at a 19% tax rate up to the first EUR 6,000 of income, a 21% tax rate for the following EUR 6,000 to EUR 50,000 of income, a 23% tax rate for the following EUR 50,000 to EUR 200,000, a 27% tax rate for the following EUR 200,000 to EUR 300,000, and a 28% tax rate on any remaining income over EUR 300,000.
To opt for this special tax regime, taxpayers cannot have been tax resident in Spain for a period of five years prior to the tax year in which they move to Spain.
The taxpayer should not obtain income through a PE in Spain, unless the special tax regime has been granted due to an economic activity.
If any of the requirements stated above are not met, taxpayers forfeit their entitlement to avail themselves of this special tax regime.
By virtue of Royal Decree 1008/2023, it has been established that if there is an economic activity, only professionals applying this special tax regime will be subject to WHT. Also, it is stated that invoices issued while the regime is applicable will include the corresponding WHT. The Royal Decree also provides that taxpayers obtaining income due to their economic activities must fulfil certain formal obligations, such as keeping books of income and expenses and records of invoices issued.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
## Employment income
For the purposes of PIT, all remunerations, regardless of their name or nature, whether they are in cash or in kind, generated directly or indirectly from personal work or from an employment or statutory relationship, and which are not business earnings, are employment income.
Amongst others, the following income is regarded as gross employment income:
PIT is levied on severance pays awarded for dismissals over the limit established in Spanish employment law. The part of the awarded severance pay under the limit that exceeds EUR 180,000 is also subject to and not exempt from PIT.
Employment income is included in the PIT general base and taxed at progressive tax rates, which vary depending on the autonomous community where the taxpayer is situated (*see the Taxes on personal income section for further information*).
Withholdings and advance tax payments are payable on salaries and wages and on benefits.
Non-residents obtaining employment income in Spain are taxed at the general NRIT rate of 24%. For residents of other EU member states or EEA countries with which there is an effective exchange of tax information, the rate is 19%. Pensions are taxed at special rates.
## Equity compensation
Shares granted to employees are generally regarded as employment income and, at granting, are considered to be remuneration in kind at their market value.
In addition, with effect from 1 January 2023, the recently approved Law to promote the Spanish ecosystem for emerging companies (’Start-up Law’; Law 28/2022) has introduced a favourable tax treatment for the award of shares or stock options to start-up employees (according to the definitions established in the Law 28/2022). The referred preferential tax treatment consists of the following:
## Carried interest
With effect from 1 January 2023, the Spanish law on the promotion of the emerging company ecosystem (‘Start-up Law‘; Law 28/2022) introduced into Spanish PIT for the first time the figure of carried interest, providing for its taxation according to the Spanish PIT Law.
The aim of this new regulation is to predict the taxation in Spain of the income obtained from the successful management of private equity (alternative investment funds defined in the EU Directive 2011/61/EU included in any of the following categories: (i) private equity defined in article 3 from the Law 22/2014, (ii) European private equity funds, (iii) European social entrepreneurship long- term funds, and (iv) any equivalent investment vehicle.
The tax treatment of such carried interest income consists of the following:
## Business income
For the purpose of PIT, business income is income generated by a person from a combination of personal work and capital, or only one of these factors, for the production or distribution of goods or services as a result of the person’s own organisation of the means of production and/or human resources of the business.
Specifically, income generated from extraction, manufacturing, trade or service activities, including income obtained from handicraft activities, agriculture, forestry, livestock farming, fishing, building, mining and the practice of liberal, artistic, or sporting professions is considered business income.
Leases of properties are only considered a business activity when at least one person is employed on a full-time basis to organise the lease activity.
Net business income is calculated in accordance with Spanish CIT laws with the application of some specific regulations.
Business income is included in PIT general income and is taxed at the progressive tax rates applicable for each autonomous community (*see the Taxes on personal income section for further information*).
Self-employed persons who are tax resident in Spain and who carry on an economic or business activity are required to make advance payments of PIT during the year (in April, July, October, and January). The tax base and percentage of these advance payments will depend on the evaluation method applicable.
Business income obtained in Spain by Spanish non-tax residents acting without a PE is taxed at the general NRIT rate of 24%. For residents of other EU member states or EEA countries with which there is an effective exchange of tax information, the rate is 19% .
## Capital gains
Capital gains and losses are variations in the value of a person’s wealth due to an alteration in its composition that are not considered to be income under Spanish PIT law.
It is important to note that capital gains can arise on all *inter vivos* transfers, but not on *mortis causa* transfers.
When the capital gain or loss is generated from the transfer of an asset, it is calculated by deducting the previous acquisition value from its transfer value; otherwise, the capital gain or loss is the market value of the asset.
Capital gains arising from transfers of assets are included in savings income and are taxed at the corresponding progressive tax rates of between 19% and 30%.
A transitory tax regime may be applied for transfers of assets or rights that are not used to carry on a business activity and were initially acquired before 31 December 1994. In accordance with this regime, reduction coefficients (14.28%, 25%, or 11.11% per year, depending on the type of assets, for each year that the assets or rights have been held between the acquisition date and 31 December 1996) may be applied on the proportional part of the capital gain generated from the date of acquisition up to 19 January 2006. Therefore, if the transitory regime is applicable, the total capital gain should be divided into two parts:
With effect from 1 January 2015, this transitory tax regime is applied when the value of the transfer does not reach EUR 400,000 per taxpayer. For this purpose, the transfer values of all assets transferred from 1 January 2015 on which this transitory regime may be applied should be added together, and if the total amount exceeds the threshold, the transitory regime is applied proportionally to the part of the transfer value that does not exceed the threshold.
Capital gains not generated from transfers of assets (such as some lottery prizes) are included in the general tax base and are taxed at progressive tax rates, which are different for each autonomous community (*see the Taxes on personal income section for further information*).
Capital gains obtained in Spain by non-residents without a PE are taxed at a rate of 19% when they are generated from transfers of assets otherwise they are taxed at the general NRIT rate of 24% (for residents of other EU member states or EEA countries with which there is an effective exchange of tax information, the rate is 19%).
The transitory tax regime for transfers of assets and rights not used to carry on an economic/business activity and initially acquired before 31 December 1994 is also applicable for capital gains obtained in Spain by non-residents without a PE.
Capital gains arising from transfers of assets by PIT payers over the age of 65 are tax exempt if the total amount of income obtained from the transfer is used within six months to establish an assured life annuity for the taxpayer. A maximum of EUR 240,000 may be used to establish an assured life annuity. For partial reinvestments, only the part of the capital gain obtained that corresponds to the reinvested amount will be tax exempt.
For transfers of properties located in Spain by non-residents without a PE (individuals), the purchaser is required to deduct 3% of the price of the transfer and deposit it with the local tax authorities. This withholding is treated as an advance payment of capital gains tax for the seller. The non-resident seller must be formally represented in the transaction by a lawyer or legal representative.
## Dividend income
Dividends and other income generated from holding interests in companies are included in PIT savings income and taxed at a 19% tax rate up to the first EUR 6,000 of income, a 21% tax rate for the following EUR 6,000 to EUR 50,000 of income, a 23% tax rate for the following EUR 50,000 to EUR 200,000, a 27% tax rate for the following EUR 200,000 to EUR 300,000, and a 30% tax rate on any remaining income.
Dividend income obtained by Spanish non-resident persons without a PE is taxed by Spanish withholding tax (WHT) at the flat rate of 19% (DTTs normally establish lower rates).
## Interest income
Interest and other income generated from transferring a person’s own capital to third parties are included in PIT savings income and taxed at a 19% tax rate up to the first EUR 6,000 of income, a 21% tax rate for the following EUR 6,000 to EUR 50,000 of income, a 23% tax rate for the following EUR 50,000 to EUR 200,000, a 27% tax rate for the following EUR 200,000 to EUR 300,000, and a 30% tax rate on any remaining income.
As an exception, when capital transferred to a related company exceeds three times the latter company’s equity, the interest corresponding to the excess will be included in general taxable income and taxed at the progressive tax rates, which are different for each autonomous community (*see the Taxes on personal income section for further information).*
Interest income received by non-residents without a PE is taxed by Spanish WHT at a flat rate of 19%. An exemption is applicable for EU residents. DTTs normally establish lower rates.
## Lease income
Income generated from leases of properties by taxpayers is included in PIT general taxable income and taxed at progressive tax rates which are different for each autonomous community (*see the Taxes on personal income section for further information*).
PIT is levied on any residential properties owned by taxpayers (excluding the taxpayer’s habitual residential property) that have not been leased out. An income allocation of 1.1% or 2% of the property’s rateable value is included in PIT general taxable income and taxed at progressive tax rates. A 24% tax on 1.1% or 2% of the property’s rateable value is also levied on non-resident taxpayers (individuals) without a PE with properties in Spain that are not leased out. For residents of other EU member states or EEA countries with which there is an effective exchange of tax information, the rate is 19%.
WHT is levied on rent payments received by non-residents from leases and sub-leases of properties in Spain at the flat rate of 24%. For residents of other EU member states or EEA countries with which there is an effective exchange of tax information, the WHT is 19%.
EU citizens may deduct all costs incurred for the maintenance of property from taxable income. Non-EU residents cannot deduct any costs.
## Exempt income
The following incomes are specifically exempt from PIT (usually subject to certain limits on the amounts involved):

## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
## Habitual residence tax credit
The tax credit for investments in habitual dwellings is eliminated as of 2013. This tax credit was approximately 15% (depending on the autonomous community) of the amounts paid during the corresponding tax year for the acquisition or restoration of properties that were or would be the taxpayer’s habitual residence. A transitory regime was established in accordance with which the following taxpayers continued to qualify for the tax credit:
The taxpayer could apply this tax credit for amounts paid in a tax period to acquire or construct property and accrued before 1 January 2013, unless Section 68.1.2. of the Spanish PIT Act in force on 31 December 2012 is applicable. This regulation refers to cases where a habitual dwelling has been acquired and the tax credit has previously been applied for the acquisition of other habitual dwellings.
For taxpayers qualifying for the transitory regime, the habitual residence tax credit is applied in accordance with the law in force on 31 December 2012.
## Tax credits applicable to PIT payers who carry on business activities

When taxpayers dispose of shares of newly or recently created companies and opt to apply the tax exemption for reinvestments referred to above, only the part of the reinvestment that exceeds the total amount obtained from the disposal will be the tax relief base for the new shares.
## Tax credit for dues and contributions to political parties
A tax credit is established for dues and contributions to political parties. The tax credit is 20% of the dues or contributions paid, up to EUR 600 in the tax credit base.
## Tax credit for large families and dependent relatives in an ascending or descending line
The tax credit can be increased by up to EUR 600 for each child in a large family that exceeds the minimum number to be a large family.
## Temporary tax credits for energy efficiency improvement works in dwellings
Temporary tax credits for works to improve the energy efficiency of dwellings are available for PIT payers for amounts invested in refurbishment works that contribute to achieving certain improvements in the energy efficiency of the usual dwelling or dwelling rented for use as a dwelling in accordance with the legislation on urban leases, so that their primary purpose is to meet the tenant's permanent housing needs, and in residential buildings, accredited by means of an energy efficiency certificate.
## Charitable donations
Tax credits may be applied for donations to non-profit organisations that comply with certain requirements. These tax credits range from 40% of the donation to the following scale, depending, mainly, on the organisation receiving the donation:

| Other situations. | 40 |
The base for this tax relief may not exceed 10% of the taxpayer’s net PIT taxable income, except for donations to listed priority sponsorship activities where the limit is 15% of the taxpayer’s net PIT taxable income.
When donations are made to legally recognised foundations that report to a board of trustees (*protectorado*) and associations declared of public interest not included in the scheme provided in Law 49/2002, the deduction may amount to 10%.
## Tax credit for lease of main residence
The tax credit for lease of main residence has been eliminated with effect from 2015.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
Individuals are resident in Spain for tax purposes if they meet at least one of the following criteria:
Persons who do not meet any of the foregoing criteria are not resident in Spain for tax purposes. In such cases, Spanish-source income and capital gains in Spain are subject to NRIT.
Under Spanish law, the concept of part-year resident does not exist. An individual is either resident or non-resident and is taxed as such for the entire tax year.
In such situations, the relevant DTT should be consulted to determine the country where the person is resident (*see Double tax treaties [DTTs] in the [Treaties](foreign-tax-relief-and-tax-treaties.html)* *section for furthe**r information*).
Most DTTs signed by Spain consider the following to be relevant when determining place of residence:
