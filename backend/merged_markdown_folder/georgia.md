# Georgia
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
Under the new CIT system, the income is recognised as per International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
Under the old CIT system, taxable income is determined as the difference between the gross income of a taxpayer and the relevant deductions granted under the Georgian tax code.
## Inventory valuation
A taxpayer is required to record the value of goods produced or acquired as the outlays (except for depreciation charges) or the purchase price in tax accounting. Furthermore, the taxpayer shall include the storage and transportation expenses in the value of such goods.
A taxpayer is entitled to record the cost of inventory using the individual accounting method, the average weighted cost method, or first in first out (FIFO).
## Capital gains
The Georgian tax code does not define any separate tax for capital gains. Capital gains are taxable as normal business income at the general CIT rate.
## Dividend income
Dividends received by local legal entities (except for sole enterprises and entrepreneur partnerships) are not subject to taxation at source and shall not be included in gross income.
## Interest income
Resident legal entities and PEs of non-residents that received interest income that was taxed at source in Georgia are entitled to a credit on tax paid to the state budget.
Interest income received from a licensed financial institution is not subject to WHT at source, and it should not be included in the gross income of a recipient unless the recipient is another licensed financial institution.
## Rent/royalty income
Rent and royalty income received by resident companies and/or PEs of non-resident enterprises should be subject to CIT upon its distribution in the form of dividends if the taxpayer is under the new CIT system. Under the old CIT system, such income should be included in the taxable gross income of the enterprises.
A non-resident enterprise deriving income from renting property to a person having no liability to act as a tax agent and withhold taxes is subject to CIT on the difference between the Georgian source income earned during a calendar year and deductions related to the receipt of such income.
## Foreign income
Resident legal entities are subject to CIT on their worldwide income. Under the new CIT system, foreign income is subject to CIT at 15% upon its distribution in the form of dividends. Taxes withheld abroad can be offset against CIT charged on distribution of foreign income.

## Overview
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
Georgia is located between Asia and Europe and occupies a land area of 69,700 square kilometres, bordered by the Black Sea to the west, Turkey to the southwest, Azerbaijan to the east, Russia to the north, and Armenia to the south.
Georgia declared independence on 9 April 1991, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Georgia is divided into nine regions and two autonomous republics. The population of Georgia is estimated to be 3.7 million, 1.3 million of whom live in the capital city, Tbilisi. Georgia's currency is the Georgian lari (GEL).
Georgia is a democratic, semi-presidential republic with a President as its Head of State. In 2013, the second Presidential term for Mikheil Saakashvili expired, and a new President, Giorgi Margvelashvili, was sworn in on 17 November 2013. The latter was replaced by the first female president in Georgia's history on 28 November 2018.
Following the Rose Revolution of 2003, Georgia has undertaken a series of progressive reforms, including anti-corruption efforts, reforms of labour and tax codes, and improvements to the essential infrastructure of the country. The reforms to the Georgian economy have resulted in a great flow of foreign direct investment and positive gross domestic product (GDP) growth.
Georgia's main economic activities include agricultural cultivation of citrus fruits, tea, grapes, and hazelnuts. Georgia also has a manganese and copper mining industry. Industries present in Georgia include aircraft manufacturing, bottled water and wine production, chemicals, electric motors, electric welding equipment, fuel re-export, foundry equipment (automobiles, trucks, tractors), machine tools, machinery for food packing, tower cranes, wood products, steel, shoes, and textiles.
Georgia imports nearly all its natural gas and oil products. The largest energy producing source is hydropower. Currently, Georgia is privatising the energy sector. It is believed that long-term growth will stem from Georgia's role as a transit state for oil and gas pipelines. Three pipelines currently exist, the Baku-Supsa pipeline (GPC-Georgian Pipeline Company), the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline, and the South Caucasus Pipeline (SCP) System.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
Resident enterprises are subject to corporate income tax (CIT) on worldwide income.
Non-resident enterprises carrying out economic activities in Georgia through a permanent establishment (PE) are subject to CIT with respect to its Georgian-source income.
The CIT rate is a flat 15%.
A 20% CIT rate applies to commercial banks, credit unions, microfinance organisations, and loan providers from 1 January 2023.
## New CIT system
From 1 January 2017, Georgia has switched to a new CIT system. The new system represents the adoption of the Estonian model of CIT to the Georgian tax system. As such, retained profits are no longer taxable until they are distributed. The new regime is not aimed to exempt the profits from taxation but is designed to defer the taxation moment. Consequently, taxpayers no longer need to determine taxable gross income and allowable deductions in order to arrive at the taxable profits, but rather a standard CIT rate of 15% is applicable to the grossed-up value of the following transactions:
### Distributed profit
Distributed profit encompasses distribution of profits by an enterprise to its partner as a dividend in a monetary or non-monetary form.
Distribution of dividends between Georgian legal entities and distribution of dividends received from a foreign enterprise (except for a person registered in a country with preferential tax treatment) are not subject to CIT.
Distributed profit of a PE of a non-resident enterprise shall be a deemed distribution of profits attributable to the PE for its activities. A PE shall be allotted a profit it might have gained as an independent enterprise conducting the same or similar activity and being in the same or similar conditions.
### Costs incurred not related to economic activity
Costs not related to economic activity shall be:
Certain transactions are deemed as non-business expenses, which, *inter alia*, include:
Certain transaction with persons registered in the countries with preferential tax regimes are also subject to immediate taxation of CIT. Among them are:
The main purpose of the listed taxable objects is to mitigate hidden distribution of profit without taxation. That said, the tax law requires taxation of such cash outflow, which may be embodied with profit distribution, though in turn it allows one to claim back the paid CIT when the cash is returned. Specifically, the Georgian tax code sets that companies have the right to credit the CIT paid previously in the following cases:
### Free of charge delivery of goods/services and/or transfer of funds
Free of charge delivery of goods/services and transfer of funds will be subject to CIT. Additionally, shortage of inventory and/or fixed assets will be considered as free of charge supply at the moment of its revealing and will be taxed accordingly by CIT.
### Representative expenses
Representative expenses exceeding the specific limit will be subject to CIT. The limit determined for these purposes is 1% of the company’s total revenues derived or expenses incurred in the previous calendar year, whichever is greater.
## Local income taxes
There are no regional or local income taxes imposed on the profit of legal entities.

Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
The tax departments under the MoF are responsible for tax administrative matters in Georgia.
## Taxable period
The tax year is the calendar year in Georgia.
## Tax returns
The new CIT regime shifts from annual reporting to a monthly reporting practice.
CIT returns should be submitted on monthly basis before the 15th day following the month when the taxable transaction took place. As a result, the quarterly advance payment rule is abolished for companies subject to the new CIT system.
A CIT return should be submitted before 1 April of the year following the reporting period for companies under the old CIT system.
## Payment of tax
CIT is due on a monthly basis before the 15th day following the month when the taxable transaction took place for companies working under the new CIT regime.
In case a transaction was taxed with CIT and then the amount (part of the amount) remitted on this transaction was returned back to the taxpayer, the latter may set off and recover a sum of the previously paid CIT in proportion of the returned amount. This, *inter alia*, relates to:
Under the old CIT system, CIT is paid in advance in four equal instalments, before 15 May, 15 July, 15 September, and 15 December. The advance instalments are estimated according to the previous year’s annual tax. A taxpayer with no prior-year CIT obligation is not required to make advance payments.
Final payment is due by 1 April of the year following the reporting period. Excess CIT payments may be offset against other tax liabilities.
## Tax audit process
There are two types of tax audits: desk tax audit and field audit. The tax audit may be conducted based on the order of the Revenue Service of Georgia. The Revenue Service sends a notice to the taxpayer no less than ten working days before the commencement of the audit. The audit should commence no later than 30 days after receiving such notice by the taxpayer. Normally, the tax audit may last for three months, and may be extended to another two months with the approval of the head of the Revenue Service. The findings should be presented to the taxpayer in the form of a tax act.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations is three years in Georgia from 2017. For those taxpayers who decide to increase the loss carryforward to ten years, the statute of limitations is 11 years. The statute of limitations period was six years prior to 2015, five years in 2015, and four years in 2016.
In recent periods, the tax authorities have become largely focused on transfer pricing issues during tax audits.

Additionally, special place of supply rules apply for services related to immovable and movable property, transportation services, catering, leisure activities, etc.
A person established in Georgia must register as a VAT payer when its taxable turnover exceeds 100,000 Georgian lari (GEL) in any continuous 12-month period. Georgian fixed establishment of a foreign taxable person is liable for VAT registration from the beginning of taxable operations.
Generally, VAT is chargeable at the moment of supply of goods and services. VAT is also applied on the advances received on goods and services to be supplied.
The taxable amount is determined based on the received/receivable consideration.
VAT-exempt supplies include financial services, goods and services required for oil and gas operations, certain medical and education services, etc.

For immovable property acquired before 2005, the average residual value must be multiplied by a coefficient of between 1.5 and 3, depending on the acquisition date.
## Land tax
The annual land tax rate for agricultural land varies according to the administrative unit and the land quality.
The base tax rate per 1 hectare of agricultural land varies from GEL 5 to GEL 100. The tax is further adjusted by a territorial coefficient of up to 150%, depending on the location.
The base tax rate payable on non-agricultural land is GEL 0.24 per square metre, which is further adjusted by a territorial coefficient not exceeding 150%.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
A resident enterprise is any legal entity that is established under the laws of Georgia or has its place of effective management in Georgia.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The domestic definition for a PE essentially adopts the definition for PE found in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Tax Convention.
Local legislation provides the definition for economic activity to be any activity undertaken with the intent to gain profit, income, or compensation, regardless of the results of such activity, unless otherwise provided by the tax code.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
The concept of deduction is no longer applicable for the companies and PEs operating under the new CIT system, since they follow IFRS.
Under the old CIT system, expenses connected with the receipt of income generally are deductible from income, provided sufficient primary documentation is available.
## Depreciation
A taxpayer is entitled to fully deduct costs of fixed assets (excluding those contributed to capital) in the year when the fixed assets are put into operation (a form of capital allowance). In case the taxpayer employs the right of full deduction in this manner, this method may not be changed for five years.
## Amortisation of intangible assets
Intangible assets (e.g. goodwill) are amortisable in proportion with the period of beneficial use. However, intangible assets of value less than GEL 1,000 are fully deductible from gross income.
If the period of beneficial use of an intangible asset cannot be defined, it is amortisable at the rate of 15%.
## Start-up expenses
Expenses incurred before registration of an entity as a taxpayer (e.g. public registry fee) are not deductible under Georgian tax legislation.
## Interest expenses
Interest paid on loans is deductible within the limits established by the Finance Minister, unless it is paid on loans received from domestic licensed banks and microfinance organisations. The annual deductible interest rate limitation established by the Minister of Finance of Georgia for the year 2020 is 24%. No limits are established on loans received from domestic licensed banks and microfinance organisations.
## Bad debt
A taxpayer is entitled to deduct bad debt only if all of the following conditions are met:
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions are deductible, up to 10% of taxable profit.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties paid to the state budget are not deductible.
## Taxes
CIT is disallowed for deduction.
## Other significant items
The following other expenses are not deductible:
The deduction of certain expenses is subject to limitations, including:
## Net operating losses
Losses may be carried forward for five years but may not be carried back.
A taxpayer may elect to extend the carryforward period to 10 years. However, this also results in the statute of limitations period being extended from 6 to 11 years.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
There is no special tax regime in Georgia for payments made to foreign affiliates; as such, general rules will apply. Payments may be classified as equity, financing, or service fee. Any such transaction will need to be at arm’s length in accordance with the Georgian transfer pricing rules.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
Georgian law does not provide for taxation of groups.
## Transfer pricing
The transfer pricing rules introduced in the tax code are broadly based on the OECD arm’s-length principle adopted in tax treaties and by most countries when they implement domestic transfer pricing rules.
The law recognises the five OECD transfer pricing methods for evaluating whether prices are at arm’s length:
The tax code stipulates that in accordance with the Ministry of Finance (MoF) instructions, the tax authority may recalculate the taxes if they can prove that the prices applied by related parties to transactions differ from the market prices.
According to the instructions issued by the MoF, the methods for assessing the transfer pricing assessment rules have been explained, and the following procedures have been established:
Under the new CIT system, transfer pricing adjustment is subject to immediate taxation.
The following general penalties, determined by tax legislation, apply for non-compliance with the arm’s-length principle or failing to prepare or submit transfer pricing documentation:
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
From July 2020, a new rule was introduced for multinational enterprises (MNEs) that are residents of Georgia. Namely, parent entities are required to submit a CbC report to the tax authorities by 31 December following the reporting year.
This requirement applies to MNE groups with total consolidated group revenue of the previous fiscal year higher than EUR 750 million.
Apart from this, the ultimate parent company or surrogate parent entity, which is part of the MNE group and simultaneously the resident of Georgia, is required to notify the tax authorities regarding its obligation of CbC reporting by the end of the reporting year.
## Thin capitalisation
No thin capitalisation rules are applicable in Georgia.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Georgia tax legislation does not provide CFC rules.

## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
## International agreements
Georgia is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO’s) Partnership for Peace Program and is actively working to join NATO and the European Union (EU). Georgia is also a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the United Nations (UN), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and the Union of Georgia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, and Moldova (GUUAM), and an observer in the Council of Europe.
Georgia was formerly a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Because of the August 2008 conflict with Russia, Georgia formally notified the CIS on 18 August 2008 of its intention to withdraw from the organisation, and that withdrawal came into effect on 18 August 2009. However, Georgia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said it will uphold all trade and treaty agreements made between Georgia and fellow CIS countries.
Georgia has a free-trade regime with members of the CIS, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Ukraine, and Turkey. This results in duty-free trade of goods and services.
On 18 December 2002, the GUUAM free-trade agreement was ratified by the Georgian Parliament, the goal of which is to create favourable trade conditions and to strengthen economic links among the member countries. The agreement to form a free-trade zone was reached at the GUUAM Presidents’ Summit in July 2003 in Yalta. Uzbekistan has since left the free-trade zone.
In June 2014, the European Union and Georgia signed an unprecedented Association Agreement. This Agreement aims to deepen political and economic relations between Georgia and the European Union and to gradually integrate Georgia into the European Union.
In July 2015, an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) was signed by and between Georgia and the United States about tax reporting and withholding procedures associated with the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). As a result, Georgia joined a list of countries that provide financial information to its partner country, the United States, for the deterrence of facts of tax evasion by its citizens.
In September 2022, Georgia joined the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) on the automatic exchange of financial account information under the common reporting standards (CRS). Relevant legislative changes entered into effect from 1 January 2023.

## Capital gains
The profit received from sale of a vehicle and an apartment (house) with attached land plot is subject to tax at a 5% rate.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
An individual is recognised as a tax resident of Georgia if one was actually located in Georgia for 183 days or more in any continuous 12-month period ending in the current tax year.
The status of resident or non-resident is established for each tax period. In addition, the days according to which the person was considered a resident during the previous tax period are not considered when establishing residency for the following tax period.
