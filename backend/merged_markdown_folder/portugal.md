## Tax returns
PIT returns should be filed by 30 June of the year following the one the income relates to.  An extended deadline may apply if certain conditions are met.
Married couples may opt to file a joint tax return disclosing the total income earned by both.
In case of taxpayers who do not opt for filing a joint tax return, the respective dependants should be reported in both parents’ annual income tax returns.
Foreign bank accounts are required to be disclosed on annual income tax returns.
With the 2024 State Budget, the annual PIT return shall mandatorily include information on all sources of income earned in the previous year, including income subject to final WHT rates not aggregated with other income or not subject to PIT exceeding EUR 500, as well as assets held in jurisdictions subject to a clearly more favourable tax regime.
## Payment of tax
Portugal uses a pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system, adjusted by annual tax return filing. Additional payments or refunds are made based on the tax returns filed.
For Portuguese income tax returns electronically submitted by the legal deadline (i.e. by 30 June of the year following the one the income relates to), the Portuguese tax authorities should issue the tax assessment by 31 July of that year and the respective tax due, if applicable, should be paid by 31 August. If the Portuguese tax authorities do not issue the tax assessment by 31 July, the tax liability should be paid within one month from the issue of the referred tax assessment.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 20 February 2025
Residents in Portugal for tax purposes are taxed on their worldwide income at progressive rates varying from 13% to 48% for 2025.
Non-residents are liable to income tax only on Portuguese-source income, which includes not only that portion of remuneration that can be allocated to the activity carried out in Portugal but also remuneration that is paid/borne by a Portuguese company or permanent establishment (PE).
Non-residents are taxed at a flat rate of 25% on their taxable remuneration (e.g. employment, self-employment, and pension income) in 2025.
## Resident income tax rates for 2025
| Taxable income (EUR) | | Tax rate (%) | Deductible amount (EUR) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 8,059 | 13.00 | 0 |
| 8,059 | 12,160 | 16.50 | 282.07 |
| 12,160 | 17,233 | 22.00 | 950.91 |
| 17,233 | 22,306 | 25.00 | 1,467.91 |
| 22,306 | 28,400 | 32.00 | 3,029.38 |
| 28,400 | 41,629 | 35.50 | 4,023.14 |
| 41,629 | 44,987 | 43.50 | 7,353.76 |
| 44,987 | 83,696 | 45.00 | 8,028.38 |
| 83,696 |  | 48.00 | 10,539.00 |
For the purpose of applying the tax rate, the taxable income is divided by two if the taxpayers are married and not judicially separated, as well as in the case of *de facto*marriages, whatever the circumstances, should they opt for joint taxation.
Special rates apply to capital gains and investment income.
## Additional solidarity rate
In 2025, an additional solidarity rate, which varies between 2.5% and 5%, applies to taxpayers with a taxable income exceeding EUR 80,000 and EUR 250,000, respectively.
## Subsistence level
Portuguese tax legislation includes a specific rule that ensures individuals who primarily receive employment income, business and professional income, and/or pension income are guaranteed a minimum level of net income (subsistence level).

## Social security contributions
### Employees
Social security contributions are shared by the employee and the employer. In general terms, the contributions are due on the employee’s gross remuneration at rates of 11% and 23.75% by the employee and the employer, respectively. These contributions cover family, pension, and unemployment benefits.
In addition to social security contributions at a general rate of 23.75%, employers must buy an insurance premium to cover occupational accidents. The premium varies according to work and risk classification.
### Members of the board
Regarding members of the board, the social security rates correspond to 9.3% with respect to the individual contributions and 20.3% for employer contributions. However, the contribution rate applicable to members of statutory boards who are considered as managers or administrators is set at rates of 23.75% and 11% to employers and members of statutory boards, respectively. The contributions of members of statutory boards are based on their effective remuneration but subject to a monthly minimum income level of EUR 522.50.
Members of statutory boards who are considered as managers or administrators, and some types of self-employees, become entitled to protection in the event of unemployment.
### Self-employees
The contributions rate applicable to self-employees corresponds to 21.4%. For self-employees under the simplified tax regime, the monthly contribution basis corresponds to 1/3 of the relevant remuneration determined in each reporting period and produces effects in that month and in the following two months. For the determination of the relevant remuneration of the self-employee, it is considered the income received in the three months previously to the reporting month. The relevant remuneration corresponds to 70% of the income from services rendered and to 20% of the income related to the production and sales of products.
The basis of contributions considered in each month has a limit of 12 times the IAS.
A 10% contribution rate is due by employers if 80% or more of the fees earned by the self-employee come from services for the same company, for the same person with a business activity, or to the same group. A 7% contribution rate is due by employers when the economic dependence of the self-employee varies between 50% and 80%. The contribution is payable upon the issue of a tax assessment by the social security authorities.
In 2025, the Portuguese monthly minimum wage is EUR 870.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Portugal.
## Inheritance and gift taxes
Free acquisition of goods by individuals (inheritance and gifts) is taxed under the stamp tax at 10%.
Donation of property is subject to an additional rate of 0.8%.
## Property taxes

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year is, as a general rule, the calendar year. A different tax year is allowed in the case of companies obligated to accounting consolidation and of PEs of non-resident entities, which can adopt the tax period of the non-resident company. The different tax year should, however, coincide with the period to which the financial statements concern. If the option of a tax year different from the calendar year is taken, the new tax period must be maintained for a minimum of five years. The five-year minimum period is not applicable if the taxpayer is transferred to a group of companies that are subject to consolidation of financial statements and the holding company has a fiscal year different from the one that was being adopted by the taxpayer.
## Tax returns
The annual CIT return must be submitted by electronic data transmission by the last day of May of the year following the year of income. Whenever the tax year ends on a date other than 31 December, the annual CIT return shall be submitted by electronic data transmission by the last day of the fifth month following the year-end. The system is one of self-assessment.
## Payment of tax
Tax is paid in instalments. Three payments on account are due in July, September, and up to 15 December of the year in which taxable income arises corresponding to 95% of the previous year's corporate tax assessment (for taxpayers with a turnover above € 500,000; 80% if below this amount). Payments on account are not required if the previous year's corporate tax assessment is less than € 200. The third payment may be suspended upon declaring that no further tax is due in respect of the current year. However, interest is assessed at a rate of 4% if this results in postponing more than 20% of the tax that would otherwise have been paid.
A last instalment is paid (or received) through self-assessment upon filing the annual tax return in May of the following year.
If the tax year ends on a date other than 31 December, interim payments take place in the seventh, ninth, and up to the 15th of the 12th month of the tax year.
Filing of the annual tax return together with the final payment is in the fifth month following the close of the tax year.
Three additional payments on account of *Derrama Estadual* (or *Derrama Regional*, in the case of the Autonomous Regions of Madeira and of the Azores) are due on the same dates as the interim payments mentioned above. The additional payments on account correspond to 2.5% of the taxable profit above € 1.5 million and up to € 7.5 million, 4.5% of the taxable profit above € 7.5 million and up to € 35 million, and 8.5% of the taxable profit above € 35 million, assessed in the previous year.
### Interest and penalties
Late assessment interest is due in case of delay on the assessment of taxes due. Late assessment interest is computed on a daily basis. The current rate of late assessment interest is 4% (year).
Late penalty interest is due in case of delay in the payment of the tax assessed. The current rate is 5.997%. Late penalty interest is computed on a daily basis. Tax penalties for companies are capped at € 165,000 in the case of intention and € 45,000 in the case of negligence. In general, in case of failure or late payment of CIT, companies are liable to a penalty varying between 30% and 100% of the tax due, capped at € 45,000 (in case of negligence).
Specific tax penalties apply regarding transfer pricing documentation (including CbC reporting) and the CFC regime (between € 1,000 and € 10,000 for companies) and regarding omissions or inaccuracies regarding ruling requests (between € 750 and € 22,500 for companies in the case of urgent rulings or 25% of the previous amounts in the case of non-urgent rulings).
There is the possibility of applying for penalty reduction, provided certain requirements are met (e.g. regularisation of the tax situation/payment of the tax due; situation where there was no damage to the Revenue).
## Tax file
Taxpayers followed by the Unit of Large Taxpayers are required to send the tax file to the PTA, including the transfer-pricing file, by 15 July following the end of the tax period (15th day of the seventh month for entities with a tax year different from calendar year).
## Tax audit process
Taxpayers are audited by the PTA based on several criteria, as detailed in a specific document prepared by the PTA.
The PTA must notify the taxpayers of the preliminary conclusions reached in cases where these may lead to tax assessment acts unfavourable to the taxpayers, further to which taxpayers may present their argumentation.
The PTA must then prepare a final report of the tax audit performed, identifying the facts detected.
Tax audits may be initiated within the statute of limitations (*see below*).
Tax audits must be concluded within six months. A prorogation of the deadline to one year may apply under certain conditions (e.g. complexity of the facts involved, necessity to make use of mechanisms of mutual assistance on tax matters, additional/new information being provided by the taxpayer).
The PTA releases, on a periodical basis, a list of taxpayers that, due to the nature of their activities, their turnover, or other criteria, are subject to regular monitorisation. There is also a specific department for large taxpayers.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations period is four years. Regarding facts involving black-listed jurisdictions, the statute of limitations for the right to assess taxes is extended to 12 years while the time period allowed to collect taxes is extended to 15 years. The statute of limitations period is also increased from four to 12 years in case of facts related to deposit and securities accounts in financial institutions outside the European Union.
When a tax inspection is legally suspended, the statute of limitations period is also suspended.
The criteria for the selection of taxpayers for tax audits is foreseen in the Tax and Customs Audit Procedure legal framework (*Regime Complementar do Procedimento de Inspecção Tributária e Aduaneira* or RCPITA) and in the annual national activity plan for tax and customs audits (*Plano Nacional de Atividades da Inspeção Tributária e Aduaneira* or PNAITA). These criteria consider EU and international guidelines, whistleblowers complaints, as well as significant deviations from standard economic patterns in the taxpayers’ behaviour in view of the activity developed or the assets it owns, or any acts or omissions that may indicate a tax infraction. There is a special focus on tax planning, including the general and the specific anti abuse-rules, transfer pricing, corporate restructuring, derivatives, and non-residents without a PE.
In addition, general criteria are made available in the annual report on the fight against tax and customs fraud and evasion. The 2022 annual report, published June 2023, stated the following criteria: tax fraud, aggressive tax planning, cross-border transfers of funds, sale of real estate, board members with low income reported, use of credit and debit cards, VAT recurrent credit position without refunds being requested, control of taxpayers that request VAT refund without being audited, control of VAT deductions and margins, excessive allowances (such as travels and meal expenses), control of initial and final inventories, R&D tax incentives, income tax discrepancies, impairment losses, goodwill amortisation, and variations in worth.
Finally, the Tax Authority 2023 public activity plan (*Plano de Atividades 2023*) , released November 2023, states the intention of strengthening and empowering the resources of the Tax Authority to deal with aggressive tax planning mechanisms, leveraging on the existing legal reporting framework for domestic as well as cross-border arrangements (e.g. to ensure the compliance with Council Directive (EU) 2018/822, of 25 May 2018, amending Directive 2011/16/EU, of 15 February, hereafter ’DAC 6‘, as regards the mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation). There is also the intention to continue applying international cooperation instruments, such as exchange information agreements, tax treaties, protocols, and administrative cooperation.
## Anti-avoidance
A general anti-avoidance provision is in force, pursuant to which contracts and other acts are ineffective whenever it is demonstrated that they were put in place for the main purpose or one of the main purposes of reducing the taxation that would be due under contracts bearing a similar economic effect, in which case taxation would be based on the latter. This general anti-avoidance provision was revised to be in line with the provisions of the EU Directive 2016/1164 (ATAD I).
The anti-avoidance procedure is initiated within the general term foreseen (statute of limitations) and is flexible in terms of proof by the PTA.
Anti-avoidance rules are not applicable in cases where a request for obtaining binding information is not answered by the PTA within 150 days.
## Binding rulings
Binding rulings can be:
## Fight against tax fraud and evasion
It is mandatory that payments above € 1,000 are made by a means that allows the identification of the recipient of the income (e.g. bank transfer, nominative cheque, direct debit).
Council Directive 2011/16/EU, on the matter of administrative cooperation in the field of taxation, has been transposed to the Portuguese legislation, reviewing the exchange information mechanisms between tax authorities and aiming at a more effective action against tax evasion and fraud at an international level.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
### VAT rates
There are three VAT rates: the standard rate of 23% (22% in the Autonomous Region of Madeira; 16% in the Autonomous Region of the Azores), the reduced rate of 13% (12% in Madeira; 9% in the Azores), and the super-reduced rate of 6% (4% in Madeira from 1 October 2024 onward, 4% in the Azores).
The reduced rate is applicable to the supply of several products and services, including meals at restaurants and take away, musical instruments, and agricultural tools.
The super-reduced rate is applicable, among others, to the supply of some essential food products, periodic publications, books, pharmaceutical products, hotel accommodation, agricultural products, passenger transport, acquisition and supply and installation of devices, machines and other equipment intended exclusively or mainly for the capture and use of solar, wind, and geothermal energy, and other alternative forms of energy. It is also applicable to the supply of electricity for consumption for a contracted power that does not exceed 6.90kva.
Exports and intra-EU supplies of goods are zero-rated.
As of 4 January 2024, the basic food basket no longer benefits from a zero VAT rate.
### Supplies of goods
Supplies of goods are subject to VAT in Portugal if the goods are located in Portugal at the moment their transport or dispatch to the customer begins. If the goods are located in Portugal and there is no transport or dispatch, then supplies of the goods are subject to VAT at the moment they are put at the disposal of the customer.
### Supplies of services
Supplies of services are, in general, subject to VAT in Portugal whenever: (i) acquired by taxable persons that have their business, a fixed establishment, domicile, or residence in Portugal to which the services are provided (B2B rule) or (ii) supplied to non-taxable persons if the provider has established its business, a fixed establishment, domicile, or residence in Portugal from where these services are provided (B2C rule).
Regardless of the place where the service provider and the acquirer are established, and of the acquirer being a taxable person, the supply of the following services is subject to VAT in Portugal if physically carried out in Portugal:
The supply of the following services is subject to VAT in Portugal if physically carried out in Portugal and if the acquirer is a non-taxable person:
Telecommunications, broadcasting, television, and electronic services supplied to non-taxable persons are taxed in Portugal if:
However, such services shall not be taxed in Portugal if the service provider has its head office, PE, or domicile in another member state and provided that:
## Customs duties
Customs duties are regulated by the Community Customs Code. Therefore, the rules foreseen for the import and export of goods in Portugal are similar to the rules applicable in other EU member states.
The customs duties' rates applied in Portugal vary according to the origin of the goods. There are several origin agreements that exempt from customs duties the importation of goods from certain countries or that determine reduced rates.
## Excise duties
There are different types of excise duties, such as petroleum and energy products tax, alcohol and alcoholic beverages tax, tobacco tax, and vehicle tax.
The tax applicable to petroleum and energetic products depends on the goods supplied, for example:
The tax applicable to alcohol and alcoholic beverages also depends on the type of good supplied, varying between € 9.64 and € 33.85 per hectolitre for beer and € 1,602.51 per hectolitre for spirits.
Non-alcoholic beverages with added sugar are also liable to excise duties, depending on the added sugar amounts.
The tax applicable to tobacco (*ad valorem*) also varies in accordance with the type of product supplied (e.g. cigarettes, heated tobacco and fine-cut tobacco for rolling, cigarillos, tobacco used in a water pipe, and liquids for electronic cigarettes).
The tax applicable to vehicles varies in accordance with the type of vehicle, the fuel used, CO2 emissions, and the cylinder of the vehicle.
The environment component CO2 emissions is measured based on the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP).
An excise duty on consumption of electricity is due by producers, traders, self-producers, and consumers that buy electricity in organised markets.
Please note that the rates for petroleum and energy products, tobacco, and alcoholic beverages may differ depending on whether the tax is due on the mainland, in the Autonomous Region of Azores, or in the Autonomous Region of Madeira.
## Property tax (*Imposto Municipal sobre Imóveis* or IMI)
IMI is levied at the following rates, in addition to corporate or individual tax assessed on actual income generated by real estate:
| Real estate type | IMI (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Urban real estate | 0.3 to 0.45 |
| Rural real estate | 0.8 |
| Real estate owned by residents in a black-listed jurisdiction (except individuals) and by entities in a direct or indirect domain or control relation with entities domiciled in tax havens | 7.5 |
Annual IMI rates are increased three times when urban real estate is in ruins or vacant for a period of over one year. In the case of real estate which conservation status results from natural disaster or calamity, this aggravated IMI rate does not apply. The same is valid for the additional increase of the IMI rate by 30% in the case of degraded buildings.
Municipalities are allowed to increase the IMI rate applicable to buildings or part of buildings located in urban pressure areas as follows: (i) up to 100% in the case of buildings for local lodging (*alojamento local*) and (ii) up to 25% in the case of residential buildings that are not rented or allocated to the taxpayer’s permanent abode. The increase can go up to 50% if the taxpayer is a collective person or other equivalent entity for tax purposes.
Municipalities can increase the IMI rate applicable to urban real estate properties that have been vacant for more than one year, to buildings in ruins, and to land for construction intended for residential purposes when located in designated areas of urban pressure. In this situation, the IMI rate can be increased ten times, with a possible additional increase of 20% in each of the following years, capped at 20 times the applicable IMI rate. However, the aggravated rate (20 times the IMI rate for urban building) can be increased upon decision of the municipality as follows: (i) by 50% in the case of residential building or unit that is not rented or used for permanent abode in the respective year and (ii) by 100% if the taxpayer is a collective person or other equivalent entity for tax purposes.
### IMI exemptions and reductions
#### Urban real estate subject to urban rehabilitation
There is an IMI exemption available to urban real estate subject to urban rehabilitation for a three-year period, renewable for an additional five-year period in case of buildings intended for leasing for permanent abode or main permanent abode.
This exemption is only available to buildings located in urban rehabilitation areas or buildings that have been built more than 30 years ago.
#### Historical stores
Historical stores, recognised by municipalities as establishments of historical, cultural, or social interest and that integrate the national inventory, will be IMI exempt for the year in which these situations occur.
#### Other benefits of environmental status attributed to real estate
By resolution of the municipal assembly, municipalities may determine a reduction of up to 25% of the IMI rate, applicable to urban real estate with energy efficiency.
#### Tax incentives for forestry activity
An IMI exemption is applicable to rural real estate within forest areas covered by a forest intervention zone and to rural real estate intended for forestry exploitation under a forest management plan.
#### Tax regime for investment promotion (RFAI)
Companies with investments that qualify for the RFAI can benefit from an IMI reduction or exemption for a period of up to ten years in relation to any real estate acquired and regarded as an eligible investment.
#### Properties intended for residential purposes
An IMI exemption is applicable to land for housing construction when there has not yet been a final decision regarding the prior control procedure for construction works and properties regarding which the final decision for residential purposes has not yet been issued.
An IMI exemption is applicable to urban buildings or autonomous units acquired, rehabilitated, or constructed to be allocated to the PAA.
#### Rental contracts concluded before the Urban Lease Regime
Buildings subject to a rental contract for housing, concluded before the Urban Lease Regime, in case of tenants with a corrected annual gross income (RABC) of less than five annual national minimum wages (RMNA) or aged 65 years or more over or disabled with a degree of disability equal to or higher greater than 60% are exempt from IMI.
### Additional to the IMI (AIMI)
AIMI is owed by individuals and corporations, as well as by structures or collective bodies without autonomous legal personality and undivided inheritances, that are owners, usufructuaries, or have the surface right of urban properties located in Portugal.
Urban properties classified as for ‘trade, industry, or services’ and ‘others’ are excluded from AIMI.
In the case of real estate financial leases, lessors are not allowed to charge AIMI on lease payments if the tax registration value of the property does not exceed € 600,000.
The taxable basis corresponds to the sum of the TRV of all the urban properties held by each taxpayer, reported as of 1 January of each year.
Properties that benefited from an IMI exemption in the previous year are excluded from the taxable basis.
The applicable rates are 0.4% for corporations, 0.7% for individuals and undivided inheritances, and 7.5% for urban properties owned by entities in tax havens.
AIMI is assessed by the Portuguese Tax Authority (PTA) in June of each year, with the respective payment being made in September.
Construction and housing cooperatives are no longer AIMI exempt when they own, have the right of surface of, or the usufruct of, exclusively, properties intended for social housing or for rent-controlled apartments.
On the other hand, the exclusion of taxation of properties that are exclusively intended for the construction of social housing or controlled-costs owned by construction and housing cooperatives or residents' associations is established.
The properties owned by construction and housing cooperatives, as well as residents' associations, will be excluded from taxation.
#### CIT credit
Taxpayers have the option to deduct the AIMI paid, limited to the fraction of the tax corresponding to the income generated by properties subject to AIMI, in the scope of lease or accommodation activities. This deduction option (deduction to the CIT fraction) jeopardises the deduction of AIMI in the determination of income subject to CIT.
## Property transfer tax (*Imposto Municipal sobre as Transmissões Onerosas de Imóveis* or IMT)
| Real estate type | IMT (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Rural real estate | 5.0 |
| Urban real estate (for residential purposes) | up to 7.5 |
| Other urban real estate and other acquisitions for consideration | 6.5 |
| The acquirer is a tax resident in a black-listed jurisdiction (except individuals) or is in a direct or indirect domain or control relation with an entity domiciled in a tax haven | 10.0 |
### IMT exemptions
## Stamp tax
Stamp tax is payable on a wide variety of transactions and documents, at rates that may be set in specific amounts or on a percentage basis. Important examples include the following:
| Item | Stamp tax (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Loans (on the principal) (1): |  |
| With determined term, over one year | 0.5 to 0.6 |
| Current account/overdraft/credit with undetermined term or determined term under one year | 0.04 per month or fraction |
| Guarantees: |  |
| Undetermined/five or more years | 0.6 |
| Over one year | 0.5 |
| Under one year | 0.04 per month or fraction |
| Operations of financial institutions: |  |
| Interest and commissions charged | 4 |
| Commission on banking guarantees | 3 |
| Commission for insurance brokers | 2 |
| Commissions and other payments charged by or with the intermediation of crypto assets service providers (2) | 4 |
| Insurance premiums | 3 to 9 |
| Real estate transfer for consideration or donation | 0.8 |
| Letting or sub-letting (applied on the amount of a month of rent) | 10 |
| Donations and inheritances, including free transfers of crypto assets (3) | 10 |
| Sale of business as a going concern | 5 |
| State’s social gambling, included in the bet price | 4.5 |
| State’s social gambling exceeding € 5,000 | 20 |
| Collective Investment Vehicles (CIVs) investing in money market instruments and deposits (quarterly, on net asset value) | 0.0025 |
| Other CIVs (quarterly, on net asset value) | 0.0125 |
| Bills of exchange and promissory notes (with a minimum value of € 1) | 0.5 |
Notes
1. In case of loans to consumers, tax rates are multiplied by approximately 2.5.
2. If the provider or the client are domiciled in Portugal, in which case the tax is borne by the client. In the case of a service provider outside Portugal, tax is assessed by the intermediary in Portugal, or by the representative appointed by the service provider in the cases where there is no intermediary.
3. In case of crypto assets deposited in institutions located in Portugal. It will also apply if the crypto assets are not deposited therein but the author has its domicile in Portugal, in the case of inheritance, or if the beneficiary has its domicile in Portugal, in the case of other free transfers.
### Stamp tax exemptions
Some acts are exempt from stamp tax, such as the ones mentioned below (the exemption may depend on certain requirements):
## Payroll taxes
There are no payroll taxes other than social security contributions (*see below*).
## Social security contributions
As a rule, employers are required to make monthly social security contributions at the standard rate of 23.75% on the monthly gross remuneration of their employees.
Social security contributions are deductible for CIT purposes.
## Bank levy and solidarity surcharge on the banking sector
Portuguese headquartered credit institutions, Portuguese subsidiaries of foreign credit institutions, as well as branches in Portugal of foreign credit institutions, including those resident in the European Union, are subject to a bank levy, applicable on a two-pronged tax base, as follows:
The bank levy rate is set at a maximum of 0.11% on Base I and of 0.00030% on Base II.
In addition to the bank levy, the aforementioned credit institutions are also subject to a solidarity surcharge, levied upon the same taxable base as the bank levy. The solidarity surcharge rate is 0.02% on Base I and 0.00005% on Base II.
Both the bank levy and the solidarity surcharge have been widely challenged in court.
## Carbon tax on air and sea travels
A carbon tax due by the user in the amount of € 2 applies on air, sea, and river travels.
This carbon tax is levied on the issuance of transport tickets in respect of:
## Levy on single-use packages and plastic bags
The levy is set at € 0.10 per package in Portugal mainland and can be passed along the economic chain. The final charge levy to the final consumer cannot be less than € 0.20 per package.
Regarding the plastic bags, it is foreseen a levy of € 0.08 for plastic bags and of € 0.04 for lightweight plastic bags.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
Resident companies in Portugal are taxed on their worldwide income.
There is an optional regime to exclude from taxation the profits and losses allocated to a foreign permanent establishment (PE) of a company resident, for tax purposes, in Portugal. The regime applies provided that (i) the profit allocated to that PE is subject to and not exempt from a tax foreseen in Article 2 of the EU Parent/Subsidiary Directive (Council Directive 2011/96/EU) or a tax similar to the Portuguese CIT where the legal rate is not lower than 60% of the standard CIT rate (meaning 12.6%), (ii) the PE is not located in a black-listed jurisdiction, and (iii) the effective tax on income is not lower than 50% of the tax that would be due under the CIT Code (except when certain requirements are met). The regime is not applicable to the profit allocated to the foreign PE up to the amount of the losses attributable to that PE that have been taken into account by the Portuguese taxpayer when computing the respective taxable income of the previous 12 tax years. This is an optional regime that must cover, at least, all the PEs located in the same jurisdiction, and is mandatory for a minimum three-year period.
A flat CIT rate of 20% applies on the global amount of taxable income realised by companies resident for tax purposes in mainland Portugal (also applicable to Portuguese PEs of foreign entities). The standard CIT rate is 14.7% in the Autonomous Region of Madeira and in the Autonomous Region of the Azores, including PEs of foreign entities registered therein.
A reduced CIT rate of 16% (11.9% in the Autonomous Region of Madeira and in the Autonomous Region of the Azores) applies to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and small-medium capitalisation (Small Mid Caps) companies (resident entities and PEs in Portugal of non-resident entities) on the first € 50,000 of taxable income (the standard CIT rate shall apply on the excess). Additionally, SMEs and Small Mid Cap companies carrying out their activity and having their effective management in inland territories of Portugal mainland can benefit from a rate of 12.5% (8.75% in the case of the Autonomous Region of the Azores and in the case of beneficiary territories of the Autonomous Region of Madeira) on the first € 50,000 of the taxable amount, also being subject to the standard CIT rate on the excess. In both cases, reference is made to the concept of micro, small, and medium-sized companies as foreseen in the EU Commission Recommendation 2003/361, and to the concept of Small Mid Cap as aligned with the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund concerning the definition of micro, small, and medium capitalisation enterprises.
Entities qualified as startups are subject to a 12.5% CIT rate (8.75% in the Autonomous Region of Madeira) on the first € 50,000 of taxable income (the standard CIT rate shall apply on the excess).
Entities that do not carry out a commercial, industrial, or agricultural activity as their main activity are subject to a 20% CIT rate on the global amount of their taxable income (14.7% in the Autonomous Region of Madeira and 14% in the Autonomous Region of the Azores).
## Surtaxes
The following surtaxes may also apply:
The state surtax is levied on resident taxpayers carrying on commercial, industrial, or agricultural activity and by non-residents with a PE in Portugal. The state surtax is paid in three instalments.
A regional surtax (Derrama Regional) applies as follows:
## Autonomous taxation
Autonomous taxation applies at different rates on certain expenses incurred by entities subject to CIT. It is self-assessed in addition to CIT (even if no CIT is due) at the following rates:
| Cost of acquisition (EUR) | Type of vehicle (%) | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Plug-in hybrid\* | Vehicle natural gas (VNG) | Other | Fully electric |
| Lower than 37,500 | 2.5 | 2.5 | 8.0 | - |
| Between 37,500 and 45,000 | 7.5 | 7.5 | 25.0 | - |
| Equal to or higher than 45,000 | 15.0 | 15.0 | 32.0 |  |
| Exceeding 62,500 | - | - | - | 10.0 |
\* Which battery can be charged using a connection to the power grid, having a minimum electric autonomy of 50 km and official emissions of less than 50gCO2/km.
All of the above-mentioned rates of autonomous taxation cease the  increase of 10%, if the taxpayer has tax losses in the tax year in which the expenses are incurred, when:
Additionally, shows offered to customers, suppliers or any other person or entity are no longer subject to autonomous taxation.

## Overview
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
Portugal, a democratic republic located on the Iberian Peninsula in Southwestern Europe, is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west and south and Spain to the east and north. It is divided into 18 districts, with Lisbon as the capital. The official language of Portugal is Portuguese, and the currency is the euro (€).
A global maritime power during the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal lost much of its wealth and status with the destruction of Lisbon in a 1755 earthquake, occupation during the Napoleonic Wars, and the independence of Brazil, its wealthiest colony, in 1822.
Portugal is a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and entered the European Union (EU) in 1986. Portugal has become a diversified and increasingly service-based economy since joining the European Community in 1986. Over the past two decades, successive governments have privatised many state-controlled firms and liberalised key areas of the economy, including the financial and telecommunications sectors. Part of the European Monetary Union (EMU) since 1998, Portugal began circulating the euro on 1 January 2002.
For 2024, the projected gross domestic product (GDP) was 1.6%; 2.1% projected for 2025.

## Social security contributions
### Employees
Social security contributions are shared by the employee and the employer. In general terms, the contributions are due on the employee’s gross remuneration at rates of 11% and 23.75% by the employee and the employer, respectively. These contributions cover family, pension, and unemployment benefits.
In addition to social security contributions at a general rate of 23.75%, employers must buy an insurance premium to cover occupational accidents. The premium varies according to work and risk classification.
### Members of the board
Regarding members of the board, the social security rates correspond to 9.3% with respect to the individual contributions and 20.3% for employer contributions. However, the contribution rate applicable to members of statutory boards who are considered as managers or administrators is set at rates of 23.75% and 11% to employers and members of statutory boards, respectively. The contributions of members of statutory boards are based on their effective remuneration but subject to a monthly minimum income level of EUR 522.50.
Members of statutory boards who are considered as managers or administrators, and some types of self-employees, become entitled to protection in the event of unemployment.
### Self-employees
The contributions rate applicable to self-employees corresponds to 21.4%. For self-employees under the simplified tax regime, the monthly contribution basis corresponds to 1/3 of the relevant remuneration determined in each reporting period and produces effects in that month and in the following two months. For the determination of the relevant remuneration of the self-employee, it is considered the income received in the three months previously to the reporting month. The relevant remuneration corresponds to 70% of the income from services rendered and to 20% of the income related to the production and sales of products.
The basis of contributions considered in each month has a limit of 12 times the IAS.
A 10% contribution rate is due by employers if 80% or more of the fees earned by the self-employee come from services for the same company, for the same person with a business activity, or to the same group. A 7% contribution rate is due by employers when the economic dependence of the self-employee varies between 50% and 80%. The contribution is payable upon the issue of a tax assessment by the social security authorities.
In 2025, the Portuguese monthly minimum wage is EUR 870.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Portugal.
## Inheritance and gift taxes
Free acquisition of goods by individuals (inheritance and gifts) is taxed under the stamp tax at 10%.
Donation of property is subject to an additional rate of 0.8%.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
Taxable profit is based on accounting income adjusted according to specific provisions of the tax legislation, when applicable.
## Inventory valuation
Inventories are valued at the lower of the following values: cost or net realisable value. The first in first out (FIFO) and average-cost methods of valuation are accepted. The last in first out (LIFO) method is not allowed.
Inventory adjustments are deductible for tax purposes on the amount accounted for in the tax year, capped at the difference between the acquisition or production value and, if lower, the net realisable value (duly documented) with reference to the balance sheet.
For inventories of 2024, to be reported by January 31, 2025, companies required to maintain a permanent inventory system must include the valuation of goods in stock. This means that, in addition to reporting the quantities of products, it is also necessary to indicate their financial value.
Exceptions to the requirement to report the valuation of goods include companies operating under the simplified taxation regime or those not required to maintain a permanent inventory system.
## Capital gains
Under the participation exemption regime, capital gains and capital losses realised on the transfer of shares can be exempt from taxation. This rule applies to all types of Portuguese companies (holdings and operational companies) and includes capital gains on the transfer of shares derived from a non-tax-neutral merger, division, transfer of assets, or exchange of shares, and also in case of a transfer of supplementary capital entries. The regime applies provided that, at the date of the transaction, the following requirements are met:
This regime also applies to capital gains and capital losses realised by a Portuguese PE of:
Where the participation exemption regime on the transfer of shares does not apply, the positive net difference between capital gains and capital losses arising from the transfer of shares is taxed as part of normal income. The same applies on the disposal of tangible fixed assets, intangibles, biological assets, and investment properties. In certain circumstances, only 50% of the net gains on disposal of tangible fixed assets, intangibles, and biological assets (investment properties are not covered) is taxed as part of normal income, provided the sales proceeds are reinvested.
The regime also applies to capital gains and capital losses realised and related with shares held by a company with head office or place of effective management in Portugal that transfers its tax residence to another EU member state or to an EEA member state.
Capital gains and capital losses are determined by the difference between the sales proceeds, net of related costs, and the acquisition value, net of impairment losses and tax deductible depreciation or amortisation, adjusted by the inflation index (in the case of at least two years of ownership).
## Dividend income
Under the participation exemption regime, profits distributed to a Portuguese parent company are exempt from taxation, provided that the following requirements are met:
This regime also applies to profits distributed to a Portuguese PE of:
The participation exemption regime on profits is denied in case of an arrangement or series of arrangements whose main purpose or purposes is to obtain a tax advantage that defeats the object and purpose of eliminating double taxation on profits, in case such arrangement or series of arrangements is not regarded as genuine, all facts and circumstances considered. For completeness, an arrangement or series of arrangements is not regarded as genuine if it is not based on valid economic reasons and has no economic reality.
## Bonds and other subordinated securities income
At the level of the holder, the total or partial reduction of the principal debt in bonds or other subordinated securities obtained by Portuguese taxpayers are considered as income taxed at the standard CIT rate.
This rule applies provided that they do not attribute to the holder the right to receive dividends or voting rights at the General Meeting of Shareholders and are not convertible into shares.
## Interest income
Interest income obtained by Portuguese taxpayers is taxed as part of normal income and taxed at the standard CIT rate. Any WHT incurred in interest income received is treated as a payment on account of the final CIT liability, refundable even if no CIT is due, in case of domestic interest income.
## Royalty income
Royalty income obtained by Portuguese taxpayers is taxed as part of normal income and taxed at the standard CIT rate. Any WHT incurred in royalty income received is treated as a payment on account of the final CIT liability, refundable even if no CIT is due, in case of domestic royalty income.
Certain royalty income may benefit from the patent box regime (*see the [Tax credits and incentives](portugal/corporate/tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section*).
## Foreign income
Taxes paid abroad can be offset against corresponding Portuguese tax (*see Foreign tax credit in the [Tax credits and incentives](portugal/corporate/tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for more information*).
There are no provisions concerning tax deferral of income earned abroad.

# Portugal
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
A resident company is one whose head office or effective management is located in Portugal.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Under Portuguese tax law, any fixed place of business in Portugal through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on is deemed to constitute a PE in Portugal.
A fixed place of business comprises, among others, a place of management, a branch, an office, a factory, a workshop, a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry, or any other place of extraction of natural resources, and also a building site or a construction or installation project if it lasts more than six months (time period may differ considering the applicable tax treaty).
The concept of PE is now aligned with BEPS Action 7 on Permanent Establishment Status, the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital (OECD MC) as it read on 21 November 2017, and respective Commentaries, as well as with the Portuguese position on the Multilateral Convention. Accordingly, the following situations constitute a PE in Portugal:
- in the name of the enterprise
- for the transfer of the ownership of, or for the granting of the right to use, property owned by that enterprise or that the enterprise has the right to use, or
- for the provision of services by that enterprise
Additionally, the term PE shall be deemed not to include the following actions:
The above does not apply in case of:
For the purpose of assessing the recognition of a PE, domestic law has adopted the definition of a 'person or enterprise closely related to an enterprise' in line BEPS Action 7 and the OECD MC.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
## Depreciation and amortisation
The qualifying cost of an asset for tax purposes is the acquisition or production cost.
Depreciation must be computed by using the straight-line method or the declining-balance method. The latter cannot be applied to buildings, passenger vehicles, furniture, social welfare equipment, or second-hand assets.
Straight-line rates of depreciation are normally consistent with rates privately used by business and industry and are increased, for the purposes of applying the declining-balance method, by coefficients of:
Different depreciation methods may be applied without previous approval from the PTA (annual depreciation cannot, however, exceed the depreciation resulting from using either the straight-line or declining-balance methods).
Some examples relating to the maximum straight-line depreciation rate are as follows:
| Type of asset | Depreciation rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Office building | 2.00 |
| Industrial building | 5.00 |
| Electronic equipment | 20.00 |
| Computers | 33.33 |
| Ordinary tool and paintings | 25.00 |
| Engines and machine tools | 12.50 |
| Office equipment | 20.00 |
| Furniture | 12.50 |
| Software | 33.33 |
| Passenger vehicles | 25.00 |
Rates can be reduced by 50% in any one year at the taxpayer's option. If the reduction is more than 50%, the difference is not allowed for tax purposes at a future date. A total of 60% of additional depreciation on revaluation of fixed assets, as permitted by law from time to time, is allowed for tax purposes.
Depreciation rates of tangible assets may be increased by 25% in the case of companies with a schedule of two shifts (for three shifts, 50%), given the faster deterioration of those assets.
Assets with an acquisition value lower than € 1,000 can be depreciated in the acquisition year, unless the assets are part of a set of elements that should be depreciated as a whole.
Depreciation of yachts and airplanes that are not essential for business activities is not allowed as a cost for tax purposes.
Depreciation of passenger cars and certain other vehicles on the part of their cost of acquisition that exceeds certain amounts (as defined by law), with reference to their acquisition value, is also disallowed as a cost for tax purposes. The following caps apply (i.e. disallowed cost above the values below):
Development expenses, patents, trademarks, licences, and similar rights may be amortised for tax purposes if acquired for a limited period of time.
The cost of acquisition of certain intangibles with unlimited life (i.e. trademarks, permits, production processes, models, and other industrial property rights) can be amortised for tax purposes over a period of 20 years.
Depreciation of non-consumable biological assets is tax deductible.
Expenses relating to assets generated internally are deductible for tax purposes in the tax year in which the cost is incurred.
## Goodwill
Goodwill acquired as a result of a taxable corporate restructure or business combination can be amortised for tax purposes over a 15-year period (20-year for operations realised in the years 2014 to 2023), except if related with shareholdings or related to the acquisition of intangible assets from associated enterprises.
## Start-up expenses
## Limitation on the deductibility of financing expenses
Companies may only deduct net financing expenses up to the higher of the following limits:
In the cases where the taxable year is less than a calendar year, the € 1 million limit is reduced proportionally to the duration of the taxable year.
Besides Portuguese tax resident entities, PEs of non-resident entities are also covered by the scope of this rule. Entities subject to the supervision of the Portuguese Central Bank (*Banco de Portugal*) and the Portuguese Insurance and Pension Fund Supervisory Authority (*Autoridade de Supervisão de Seguros e Fundos de Pensões*), as well as Portuguese branches of financial entities or insurance companies resident for tax purposes in the European Union, are excluded from this rule.
No distinction is made between bank and intra-group financing, domestic or foreign financing (EU or non-EU).
Financing expenses considered as excessive (not deductible) in a certain fiscal year may be deductible in the following five fiscal years, provided that, together with the net financing expenses of that year, the above-mentioned limits are not exceeded.
Additionally, where financing expenses do not exceed 30% of the earnings before depreciation, net financing expenses, and taxes, the unused difference is added to the maximum deductible amount in the following five tax years, until its total deduction.
For the purposes of the regime, net financing expenses consist of, among others, any amounts due in connection to the remuneration of financing, including interest on overdraft facilities, short-term loans, bonds, financial expenses related to financial leases, or exchange losses, deducted from the profits or gains of the same nature.
Where the special regime of group taxation applies, there is the option to make the calculation considering the net financial expenses of the whole group and the sum of all the tax EBITDA (this option should be maintained for a minimum three-year period).
## Interest on shareholder loans
If the rate applicable to interest and other compensation regarding loans provided by the shareholders to the company is higher than the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) 12-month rate rounded up with a spread of 2% (at the date the loan was granted), the amount paid in excess is not tax deductible. This rule does not apply when the shareholder is a resident of a tax treaty country or when the interest rate is at arm's length under the transfer pricing provisions.
In the case of SMEs, shareholders' loans with an interest rate of the EURIBOR 12-month rate plus a spread up to 6% are tax deductible.
## Bad debt
Impairment losses on doubtful debts are deductible for tax purposes when an insolvency or recovery has been requested or the credits have been claimed in court.
The annual amount of accumulated impairment losses on doubtful debts due for more than six months, with evidence that measures towards its recovery were taken, is capped at the following percentages of the debts:
Amounts guaranteed by insurance or mortgage, or due or secured by the state, autonomous regions, or municipalities, or due by related parties (e.g. 10% shareholding), or credits between companies held directly or indirectly in more than 10% of the capital by a natural person are not considered as doubtful debts, and the respective impairment loss is disallowed for tax purposes. The last two situations may still be considered as doubtful debts, provided the recovery of those credits is challenged in court.
The ageing of bills of exchange is calculated from the date when the respective payment is due.
## Negative equity variations: Bonds and other subordinated securities
Negative equity variations related with the distribution of income from bonds or other subordinated securities are tax deductible, provided that they do not attribute to the holder the right to receive dividends or voting rights at the General Meeting of Shareholders and are not convertible into shares.
## Charitable contributions
Donations to authorised charitable institutions are allowable at up to 0.8% of turnover, with the possibility of the cost being raised up to 150%. Donations to authorised educational, sport, and environmental institutions are allowable at up to 0.6% of turnover, with the possibility of the cost being raised up to 140%.
Donations to the state, municipalities, and foundations where the state or municipalities participate in the initial capital are fully deductible, with the possibility of the cost being raised up to 140%. Special application may be made by certain entities in order to be included under the referred regime.
Donations of computers, software equipment, training, and consultancy in the area of computers granted to the state, municipalities, foundations, and museums, as well as to authorised charitable and cultural institutions, are allowable at up to 0.8% of turnover, with the possibility of the cost being raised up to 140%.
## Vacation accrual
Vacation allowance is tax deductible in the year in which the benefit accrues, regardless of the year in which payment is made.
## Pension expenses
Contributions to pension, invalidity, and health schemes are tax deductible up to a rate of 15% of annual staff expenses, provided that, among other conditions, they are available to all employees and the management and disposition of the benefits are outside the control of the taxpayer, such as under an insured scheme with vested benefits.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties for infractions that do not have a contractual nature, including late assessment interest, are disallowed for CIT purposes.
## Taxes
All taxes other than CIT, autonomous taxation, state/regional surtax (*Derrama Estadual/Regional*), and local surtax (*Derrama*) constitute a normal business expense.
## Other significant items
The costs borne from the acquisition of social passes are regarded as tax-deductible costs, increased by 50%, to the extent the employer attributes them on a general basis.
Uninsured losses, including indemnities to third parties, are disallowed unless the risk could not be insured.
Non-documented expenses are not tax deductible and are subject to a 50% autonomous taxation for fully taxable entities.
Non-duly-documented expenses are not tax deductible.
## Net operating losses
Tax losses assessed in tax years starting on or after 1 January 2023 can be deducted against taxable profit generated in future taxable years for an unlimited time period. The new rule also applies to tax losses assessed in tax years prior to 1 January 2023, which carryforward period is still running as of that date. The deduction of carried forward tax losses is capped at 65% of the taxable income.
Carryback of losses is not allowed.
The tax losses carried forward are lost in case of a change in direct ownership of the company of at least 50% shareholding or voting rights (not applicable in case of changes within the same group of companies, under certain conditions). This does not apply if it is concluded that the operation does not have tax evasion as its main or one of its main purposes. Namely this happens if the operation was carried out under valid economic reasons.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
### Payments to entities resident in a black-listed jurisdiction
Payments made or due, indirectly, to entities resident in a black-listed jurisdiction, when the taxable person has or should have had knowledge of the final purpose given to such payments, will be non-deductible for tax purposes, except if the taxpayer demonstrates that such charges relate to genuine transactions and are not of an abnormal or exaggerated amount. Such knowledge is presumed whenever there are special relations between the taxpayer and the entities in a black-listed jurisdiction or between the taxpayer and the legal representative, fiduciary, or intermediary.

# Portugal
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
## Special regime for group taxation
Taxation under the special tax regime for groups of companies is available, upon the filing of a special form with the PTA, to companies with head office and effective management in Portugal.
The group taxation regime may apply, provided one of the companies directly or indirectly holds at least 75% of the statutory capital of the others and more than 50% of the voting rights.
Tax grouping generally enables the group companies to offset losses incurred by one company against profits of another company.
Tax losses obtained prior to the beginning of the tax grouping can be carried forward and offset only up to the particular company's taxable income (*for the carryforward of tax losses regime, see Net operating losses in the [Deductions](deductions.html) section*).
To be taxed under this regime, the group companies must meet the following conditions:
Additionally, the parent company:
When the regime comes to an end or when one company ceases to qualify for this regime, the tax losses obtained during the regime cannot be carried forward and deducted against future individual taxable income of the companies. The parent company is responsible for demonstrating that the requirements for the application of the group taxation regime are met.
It is possible to apply the group taxation regime if the dominant company has its registered head office or place of effective management in an EU or EEA country (in the latter case, provided there is administrative cooperation on tax matters similar to the one in place with the European Union). In addition, among others, the following requirements must be met:
## Transfer pricing
The PTA is entitled to adjust taxable income if the taxpayer and another individual or entity, due to their special relationship, have established particular conditions that diverge from the conditions normally agreed upon between independent entities and distort the results that would arise if those relations were at arm's length. The Portuguese transfer pricing legislation broadly follows the OECD guidelines.
Taxpayers with total annual revenues above € 10 million with reference to the fiscal year to which the obligation concerns are required to prepare and organise the transfer pricing documentation by the 15th day of the 7th month after the taxpayer’s fiscal year-end.
However, taxpayers with total annual revenues exceeding € 10 million are not required to prepare transfer pricing documentation if related-party transactions do not exceed € 100,000 per entity and € 500,000 in total, considering the respective market value.
The above-mentioned exemptions are not applicable if transactions are carried out with taxpayers subject to a more favourable tax regime, as provided in paragraphs 1 or 5 of Article 63-D of the General Tax Law.
The structure of transfer pricing documentation is required to be prepared under a double structure: Master File (*Dossier Principal*) and Local File (*Dossier Específico*).
Small and medium-sized companies (as per Decree-Law 372/2007, of 6 November 2007) can prepare a simplified file (*Dossier Simplificado*).
Transfer pricing documentation shall be prepared in Portuguese language. Nonetheless, the PTA may dispense taxpayers to translate the transfer pricing documentation in case that the original language of such documents is comprehensible by the PTA.
Penalties arise from non-compliance with this obligation.
Taxpayers that are monitored by the Large Taxpayers Unit are required to submit the transfer pricing documentation to the PTA by the 15th day of the 7th month following the end of the tax year to which the transactions relate.
For other taxpayers, the submission of the transfer pricing documentation is only mandatory upon notification of the PTA.
Penalties arise from non-compliance with this obligation.
### Advance Pricing Agreement (APA)
An APA mechanism allows taxpayers and the PTA to establish agreements on a taxpayer’s future transfer pricing policy. This aims to guarantee compliance with the arm's-length principle. This regime applies to transactions carried out with related parties and between a PE and the respective head office.
The conclusion of an APA implies the payment of a charge calculated with reference to the taxpayer’s turnover, capped at € 35,000. This charge is reduced by 50% in the case of a renewal or revision of an existing APA. The duration of these agreements is established in the agreement itself; however, they cannot exceed four years, but can be revised or renewed.
The assessment of an APA procedure takes at least 180 days for unilateral APAs, and 360 days for bilateral or multilateral APAs. This period is reduced to 100 business days for APAs concluded in connection with a relevant investment project in Portugal, as foreseen in the Tax Investment Code (*Código Fiscal do Investimento*).
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
Taxpayers belonging to an economic group with annual consolidated revenue in the preceding fiscal year of at least € 750 million are required to submit the CbC report in accordance with the official form. The report should be filed by the end of the 12th month following the end of the tax year to which it relates and must be preferentially fulfilled in the official tax authorities’ website by sending an XML file.
Additionally, taxpayers are required to communicate to the PTA, by the last day of the fifth month following the end of the Portuguese entity’s fiscal year, which of the group entities is responsible for filing the CbC report for that year, as well as its fiscal jurisdiction and its tax ID.
Portugal has recently approved a law implementing the EU public CbC Reporting Directive into domestic legislation. The new reporting obligations will apply to financial years starting on or after 22 June 2024. For taxpayers with a calendar financial year, the reporting obligation will apply for the first time to financial year 2025 and the report must be published until the end of the calendar year 2026.
The information must be published in report format, on the companies' website, and this must be made available within a maximum period of 12 months after the balance sheet date for the period.
Failure to prepare, publish, or make available on the website the report and declaration (when applicable) is punishable by a fine of between € 1,500 and € 30,000.
## Company Simplified Information (IES) / Annual Statement
Taxpayers are required to report transfer pricing information in Annex H of the Company Simplified Information/Annual Statement, as follows:
## Thin capitalisation
Thin capitalisation rules have been revoked following the adoption of rules for the limitation on the deductibility of financing expenses. *See Limitation on the deductibility of financing expenses in the [Deductions](deductions.html) section for more information.*
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
The Portuguese CFC regime is aligned with the Anti-Tax Avoidance EU Directive.
Profits or income derived by an entity resident in a black-listed jurisdiction, or in a jurisdiction where it is subject to an effective taxation below 50% of the taxation that would have been applied if such entity was resident for tax purposes in Portugal, are imputed to the Portuguese taxpayer, provided it holds, directly or indirectly, at least 25% of the share capital, voting rights, or rights on income or assets of that entity. Upon distribution of the profits, a deduction is available for previously imputed income.
CFC rules also apply if the controlled entity (*as defined above*) is held by a Portuguese entity through a legal representative, fiduciary, or intermediary.
CFC rules do not apply if the CFC is resident in another EU country or in an EEA member state (bound to administrative cooperation on tax matters), provided that there are valid economic reasons underlying the incorporation and running of such company and it carries out agricultural, commercial, industrial, or services activities.
Upon a dividend distribution by the CFC, the tax credit of the tax paid abroad, which is not used, cannot be carried forward to subsequent tax years.

# Portugal
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
## Foreign tax credit
### International juridical double taxation
Taxes paid abroad can be offset against corresponding Portuguese tax, capped at the lower of (i) the tax liability corresponding to the foreign income, net of costs directly or indirectly incurred, or (ii) the foreign tax paid. In both cases, it is limited to the foreign tax as foreseen in the applicable DTT. This foreign tax credit can be carried forward for five years. The computation of the amount of the tax credit is determined per jurisdiction, considering the total amount of the respective income, except in relation to income obtained by foreign PEs (the deduction in this case is assessed individually).
### International economic double taxation
Taxpayers may opt to apply a tax credit (underlying tax credit) for international economic double taxation regarding profits or reserves received, to which the participation exemption regime on profits does not apply, and provided that the taxpayer holds (or becomes the holder of) at least 10% of the share capital of the subsidiary for a period of one year.
When choosing the above-mentioned option, the taxpayer shall add to the taxable income the amount of the income tax related to the distributed profits or reserves that has been effectively paid abroad by the subsidiary.
## General tax benefits and incentives
### Incentive to the Capitalisation of Companies (*Incentivo à Capitalização das Empresas* or ICE)
An amount corresponding to the application of the average 12 month Euribor (increased by a spread of  2 percentage points, regardless of the size of the company,  of the net increase in eligible equity can be deducted against the taxable profit. There is an additional deduction of 50%, 50%, and 20%, respectively, in the 2024, 2025, and 2026 tax years.
Such deduction shall not exceed, in each tax year, the higher of: (i) € 4 million or (ii) 30% of the tax EBITDA, pursuant to Article 67 of the CIT Code.
The part that exceeds the cap provided for in (ii) can be carried forward for a period of five years.
The amount of net increases in eligible equity corresponds to the sum of the amounts assessed in the tax year concerned and in each of the six previous tax periods. In case the net increase in eligible equity is negative, the result is zero.
The following are eligible equity increases:
The net increases in eligible equity correspond to the increases in eligible equity after deducting outflows, in cash or in kind, in benefit of the holders of equity, by way of remuneration or reduction of equity or equity sharing, as well as distributions of reserves or retained earnings.
The computation of the amount of net increases in eligible equity only considers the net increases occurring in the tax years starting on or after 1 January 2023.
### Tax incentive to wage increase
CIT payers with organised accounting are allowed an additional deduction of 100% of all employment expenses (including fixed remunerations and social contributions) related to salary increases of employees with non-term labour agreements.
Only expenses that meet the following criteria are eligible:
The maximum amount of eligible expenses, by employee, is capped at five  times the NMMW. Therefore, the maximum deduction from taxable profit per employee is set at € 4.350.
Taxpayers that have an increase of their wage scale compared to the previous year are excluded from this tax incentive.
### Contractual tax incentives
Relevant investment projects developed up to 31 December 2027 (minimum investment of € 3 million) that qualify for strategic economic interest and promote the creation of jobs are eligible for tax incentives, as foreseen in the Tax Benefits Code and the Investment Tax Code. These tax incentives are granted on a case-by-case basis under a government contract for a period not exceeding ten years and include a tax credit of 10% to 25% of the investment in addition to exemptions or reductions from property transfer tax, property tax, and stamp tax.
Expenses that, due to insufficient tax due, cannot be deducted in the tax year they were incurred can be carried forward for eight years. From 1 January 2024 onward, the carryforward period is extended to 12 years.
Eligible expenses related to allowances paid to personnel directly involved with R&D tasks are capped at 55% of the operational expenses incurred.
Expenses incurred in connection with projects that include, exclusively, third parties, including contracts and R&D services, are not considered.
Expenses relating to staff with a minimum academic qualification of level 4 of the National Qualifications Framework are considered at 120% of their amount.
Expenses related to the making of eco-design products will be increased by 20%. This increase will depend on the submission and approval of the project to the Portuguese Environment Agency.
Expenses related to demonstrations are eligible for the SIFIDE II regime, provided they are notified up front.
Expenses incurred with the acquisition, registration, and maintenance of patents, essential for the performance of R&D activities and audits, are accepted only for micro, small, or medium-sized companies.
Also eligible are the expenses incurred in equity investments in R&D institutions or contributions to private or public investment funds. Conditions apply as follows:
The deduction of R&D expenses requires that the entity develops agricultural, industrial, or commercial activities or services as its main business activity.
The applications should be submitted by the last day of the fifth month of the year following the year in which the investment was made, and applications referring to years previous to that fiscal year will not be accepted.
The regime applies until 2025.
### Incentives for the acquisition of companies in a difficult economic situation
The regime of incentives applicable to the acquisition of companies in a difficult economic situation may also apply to cases approved by IAPMEI within the scope of the Incentive System for the Revitalization and Modernization of Companies (SIRME). Under this regime, the acquiring company may deduct tax losses assessed but not yet used by the acquired company for a period of five years in proportion of its participation in the share capital of the acquired company, capped at 60% of the taxable income.
### Tax regime for investment promotion (Regime Fiscal de Apoio Ao Investimento or RFAI)
RFAI applies until 31 December 2027 and establishes several tax incentives to investment realised within specific business sectors.
Among other incentives, companies that invest in certain regions can benefit from a deduction against CIT otherwise payable (capped at 50% of the CIT due) of 30% (for qualified investments lower than € 15 million) or 10% (for the part of qualified investments exceeding that limit) of the qualified investment. Companies are also able to carry forward any unused credit for ten years and may benefit from exemptions or reductions from IMT, IMI, and stamp tax on the acquisition of real estate for investment purposes. IMT exemptions are subject to the approval of the municipality where the real estate is located and where the investment is made.
### Patent box regime
#### Use or exploitation of copyright and industrial property rights and computer programs
The patent box regime applicable to certain copyright and industrial property rights is in line with BEPS Action 5 (Authorised Nexus Approach). The regime foresees an 85% tax exemption on income derived from the use or exploitation of copyright from computer programs as well as registered patents, designs, and industrial models. There is a limitation provided by the ratio between the eligible expenses and the total expenses incurred in developing or using the intellectual property (IP)-protected assets. The regime also foresees a 30% mark-up of the eligible expenses incurred with the development of the assets with IP protection, capped at the amount of the total expenses incurred with the development of those assets. The regime applies to income derived from industrial property rights derived from R&D developed internally. Transactions with associated enterprises, including entities resident in black-listed jurisdictions, are excluded.
Costs/expenses not directly connected with the activities of R&D are excluded from the computation, such as interest or real estate depreciation.
The applicability of this regime requires a clear distinction in the accounting records in respect of profits, as well as expenses, associated with the IP in order to be able to distinguish them from other source profits and expenses.
This regime applies to patents and other industrial models or drawings registered on or after 1 July 2016.
### Collective Investment Vehicles (CIVs)
#### CIT
The taxable profit of a CIV is  the net income of the period, computed in accordance with the applicable accounting standards, while disregarding the following:
Tax losses generated by the CIV follow the regime foreseen in the CIT Code, with the necessary amendments.
The taxable profit assessed by a CIV is subject to the standard CIT rate. CIVs are exempt from municipal and state surtax; however, they are subject to autonomous taxation rates as foreseen in the CIT Code.
CIT owed by a CIV is assessed in the periodical CIT return. Respective payments should be made until the last day of the time limit established for the submission of the form.
#### Stamp tax
Stamp tax is also levied on the net asset value of the CIV, as follows:
The tax is assessed quarterly, in March, June, September, and December of each year, and should be paid by the CIV by the 20th day of the month following the end of the quarter.
#### Taxation of CIV’s investors
The taxation ‘at exit’ rule is applicable to the taxation of the income obtained by holders of participation units/shareholdings in the CIV.
Income obtained by resident investors is subject to taxation at PIT level for individuals (generally, at the rate of 28%) and CIT level for entities (being considered in the taxable profit of the investors and taxed at the rate of 20%, plus municipal and state surtax, if applicable).
Income obtained by non-resident investors without a PE benefit from a favourable tax regime as follows:
This regime does not apply (being instead applicable the PIT and CIT rate of 35%) whenever the investors are tax residents in ’offshores‘ jurisdictions, and 28% or 25% rates apply (individual or entities, respectively) if the entities to which income is paid/ distributed are held more than 25% by tax residents in Portugal.
### Foreign investment funds
Similar to other non-resident entities, foreign investment funds are taxed only on income obtained in Portugal.
WHT is applicable at a rate of:
Under EU law, a discriminatory treatment may be argued between resident and non-resident CIVs, considering that the core income (e.g. investment income, rental income, and capital gains) obtained by the resident CIVs is not subject to taxation in Portugal while the same income if obtained by non-resident CIVs is.
Administrative claims challenging this discriminatory treatment may be filed by the non-resident CIV within two years as from the year following the one when the tax was withheld.
#### Exemptions
##### Retirement and educational saving funds
Retirement and education saving funds are exempt from CIT when established and operating under national legislation.
##### Venture capital funds
Venture capital funds are CIT exempt when established and operating under national legislation.
##### Pension funds
Pension funds are CIT and IMT exempt when established and operating under national legislation.
The CIT exemption is applicable to pension funds incorporated under the Portuguese law as well as to pension funds established in another EU country or in an EEA member state (bound to administrative cooperation on tax matters) that cumulatively fulfil the following requirements:
##### CIVs in forest resources
CIVs in forest resources are CIT exempt when established and operating under national legislation if:
In case the above conditions are not met, the exemption will not be applicable, and the taxation regime for CIVs will apply.
##### Capital gains
There is an exclusion from taxation of up to 30% of capital gains resulting from the sale of shares and other securities admitted to trading, as well as parts of open CIVs, when these are held for a period of more than two years.
##### CIVs that promote affordable rental
There is an exclusion from PIT and CIT of up to 10% of income earned by participants or shareholders from CIVs that invest in housing allocated for affordable rental under the Affordable Housing Programme, subject to certain conditions being met.
CIVs investing in housing allocated to the Affordable Rental Programme whose portfolio is composed of at least 25% of assets allocated to affordable housing are entitled to a 25% reduction over the 0.0125% stamp tax rate (applicable over its net asset value).
### Incentives to urban rehabilitation
#### Property transfer tax
The available tax benefits will cover only buildings located in urban rehabilitation areas or buildings built more than 30 years ago, as follows:
#### Property tax
There is a three-year IMI exemption available for urban properties subject to rehabilitation works, which is renewable for an additional five-year period in case of buildings intended for leasing for permanent abode or main permanent abode. Again, the granting of this exemption depends on an assenting decision of the municipality of the area of the real estate property.
### Real Estate Investment Trusts (SIGIs)
SIGIs, with tax residence and place of effective management in Portugal, are joint-stock companies (*Sociedades anónimas*) with a minimum share capital of € 5 million.
It is possible, upon decision of the general meeting, to convert already existing companies into SIGIs.
Additionally, SIGI shares must be listed within one year following its incorporation date either in a regulated market in Portugal, in another EU member state, or in an EEA member state (which is committed to administrative cooperation in tax matters similar to those in the European Union).
SIGIs have a free float requirement of 20% from the end of the 3rd year after their admission. From the 5th year onwards, this requirement increases to 25%.
SIGIs must have as their main activity:
A SIGI’s portfolio must be comprised of real estate and investments in real estate entities representing at least 80% of the total assets and of real estate let or allocated to other atypical contractual forms related to the granting of the use of space in properties, which may include the provision of services, representing at least 75% of the total assets.
Both the above-mentioned real estate assets and shareholdings must be held for at least three years following the date of acquisition. Additionally, a SIGI’s indebtedness cannot exceed, at any time, 60% of their total assets.
SIGIs must distribute 75% of their annual profits and 90% of their annual profits that derive from dividends and other income from shares held in real estate entities.
Regarding the applicable tax regime, SIGIs are subject to the same tax regime as the one applicable to regulated real estate investment vehicles (i.e. CIVs), as follows:
### Contractors for North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) infrastructures
Contractors for NATO infrastructures are exempt from CIT.
### Loan interest and lease rentals on imported equipment
When paid by the state, regional authorities, and public services, loan interest and lease rentals on imported equipment can qualify for partial or full exemption from tax upon an appropriate application.
### Madeira International Business Centre (MIBC)
Entities licensed to operate in the MIBC until 31 December 2024 may benefit from a special tax regime, which is applicable until 31 December 2028.
The MIBC special tax regime provides a reduced CIT rate of 5% on qualifying foreign-source income, based on thresholds of taxable income and job creation requirements. MIBC-licensed entities also benefit from an 80% exemption from stamp tax, property taxes, and municipal and regional surtaxes.
Non-resident shareholders (except if domiciled in black-listed jurisdictions) of MIBC-licensed entities benefit from an exemption from WHT on dividend distributions, regardless of the percentage of ownership or holding period, and shareholders’ loans.
Other non-resident entities, regardless of their tax residence, that carry out business with MIBC-licensed entities benefit from an exemption from WHT on interest, royalties, technical assistance, and service income received, regardless of their tax domicile, provided that the income received is related with the activity of the MIBC-licensed entity.
MIBC-licensed companies generally benefit from Portugal's network of DTTs. EU laws and regulations apply to Madeira.
The MIBC special tax regime is not available to entities pursuing intra-group services (head office activities and business and management consulting), financing, and insurance activities. Certain productive activities are also excluded.
### Tax benefits and incentives to investment in the Autonomous Region of Madeira
The Investment Tax Code applicable to the Autonomous Region of Madeira adapts the tax benefits and incentives foreseen for the mainland to the Autonomous Region of Madeira.
The main adjustments are made in the following tax benefits and incentives:
Investment projects developed in ‘Brava Valley’ will benefit from an additional deduction of 10% in all the tax benefits and incentives available. The above incentives are subject to the *de minimis* rule within the context of European Union Commission's (EC) Regulation 651/2014 of 16 June.
The licensing period for operating in the Madeira Free Zone Trade has been extended until December 31, 2026.
## Tax benefits and incentives for non-resident corporate entities
### Capital gains
Capital gains on the sale of shares and quotas held in a Portuguese company by a non-resident company may be tax exempt. However, there are some important exceptions, such as:
### Government and corporate bonds
Interest and capital gains on government and corporate bonds are tax exempt (where held by entities not located in black-listed jurisdictions) under certain conditions.
### Interest paid by resident credit institutions
Interest paid by resident credit institutions to non-resident financial companies deriving from loans as well as gains arising from swap transactions are tax exempt.
### Tax regime applicable to external loans
Interest derived from *Schuldscheindarlehen* loan agreements signed by the Public Treasury Institute (IGCP), on behalf of the Portuguese Republic, is tax exempt, provided the creditor is not resident in Portugal and has no PE herein to which the loan can be allocated to.
### Special tax regime applicable to debt securities issued by non-resident entities
Income from debt securities representing public and non-public debt issued by non-resident entities is tax exempt, provided that the income is considered to be obtained in Portugal, under Portuguese tax rules, and paid by the Portuguese state as a guarantor of the obligations undertaken by the entities in which it owns a participation, together with other EU member states.
### Repo operations
Gains obtained by non-resident financial institutions on securities’ repo operations undertaken with resident credit institutions are exempt from CIT, provided that such gains are not attributable to Portuguese PEs of non-resident financial institutions.
Securities repos or similar rights exchanged in stock markets, as well as the repo and fiduciary sales in guarantee, performed by financial institutions intermediated by central counterparties, are also exempt from stamp tax.

# Portugal
## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
## Portuguese base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) inspired measures
The Portuguese tax legislation includes the following provisions that are in line with BEPS:
Portugal was one of the signatory countries of the Multilateral Instrument (MLI) in June 2017, which is effective from 1 June 2020 onwards, following the deposit of the instrument of ratification in February 2020.
## Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
Since 2014, Portugal has embraced and implemented the FATCA and the global CRS for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information (the AEOI standard).
The implementation of the FATCA was made on an intergovernmental basis, through a Model 1 FATCA Intergovernmental Agreement. In 2014, the FATCA obligations were introduced in the Portuguese legal system, through the approval of the Financial Information Reporting Regime (FIRR). Two years later (2016), additional FATCA Complementary Regulations were approved, laying down rules on due diligence procedures and deadlines.
Also, Portugal is one of the CRS’s early adopters. On 29 October 2014, it signed the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) for the CRS, formally reaffirming its commitment to start exchanging financial information automatically under the AEOI standard from 2017.
In October 2016, Portugal introduced into its domestic legal system a mechanism for reciprocal automatic exchange of information, with respect to residents in other EU member states and any other CRS participating jurisdictions, through the enactment of the Decree-Law No.64/2016, of 11 October. This law also transposed the Council Directive 2014/107/EU, of 9 December 2014 (also known as DAC2), amending the Council Directive 2011/16/EU as regards mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation.
With the adoption and implementation of these mechanisms, Portugal became part of the first set of jurisdictions that are exchanging financial account information with other jurisdictions committed to the CRS, on an automatic basis and at a global and multilateral level.
The State Budget Law for 2023 has changed the deadline for fulfilling the reporting obligation of the CRS regime. Therefore, for the purposes of the CRS regime, reporting financial institutions must report information regarding each account subject to communication by 31 May of each year (previously, 31 July).
Additionally, the communication and reporting deadline for the FATCA regime has not undergone any changes, so the deadline for fulfilling the reporting obligation of the FATCA regime remains 31 July of each year, with reference to 31 December of the previous year.
## Transfers to countries, territories, and regions with a more favourable tax regime
Following Law 14/2017, of 3 May, that amended the General Tax Law, the Portuguese tax authorities are required to publish on their website, on an annual basis, all transfers, including respective amount and reason, as well as statistics about those transfers, whose beneficiaries are in countries, territories, and regions with a more favourable tax regime (*see list below*).
List of countries, territories, and regions that provide a more favourable tax regime:
| American Samoa | Dominica (1) | Liechtenstein | Saint Pierre and Miquelon |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Anguilla (1) | Falkland Islands or Malvinas | Marianas | Saint Vincent and the Grenadines |
| Antigua and Barbuda (1) | Fiji Islands | Marshall Islands | San Marino |
| Aruba | French Polynesia | Mauritius | Seychelles |
| Ascension Island | Gambia | Monaco | Solomon Islands |
| Bahamas | Gibraltar (1) | Montserrat | Sultanate of Oman |
| Bahrain | Grenada | Nauru | Svalbard |
| Barbados | Guam | Netherlands Antilles | Swaziland |
| Belize (1) | Guyana | Niue Island | The Maldives |
| Bermuda (1) | Honduras | Norfolk Island | Tokelau |
| Bolivia | Hong Kong | Pacific Islands | Trinidad and Tobago |
| British Virgin Islands (1) | Isle of Man (1) | Palau Islands | Tristan da Cunha |
| Brunei | Jamaica | Panama | Turks and Caicos (1) |
| Cayman Islands (1) | Jordan | Pitcairn Island | Tuvalu |
| Channel Islands (1, 2) | Kingdom of Tonga | Puerto Rico | United Arab Emirates |

| Djibouti | Liberia (1) | Saint Lucia (1) | Yemen Arab Republic |
Notes
1. The Portuguese authorities have signed tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs) with these jurisdictions (in the case of the Channel Islands, only with Guernsey and Jersey). The following TIEAs are in force: Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, Isle of Man, Jersey, and Saint Lucia.
2. Alderney, Brechou, Great Sark, Guernsey, Herm, Jersey, Jethou, Lihou, and Little Sark.
## Automatic access of the Portuguese Tax Authority (PTA) to financial information of residents
Reporting financial institutions must report to the PTA, by 31 July of each year, regarding the IFR regime, the following information regarding each account subject to communication, with reference to 31 December of the previous calendar year:
## The new digital platform reporting rules - DAC 7
The Directive (EU) 2021/514 of 22 March 2021, hereafter referred to as DAC 7, represents a new amendment, specifically the seventh, to Directive 2011/16/EU on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation. On 26 July 2023, Law No. 36/2023 was published, transposing DAC 7, in Portugal.
Reporting platform operators are required to report to the PTA specific information with respect to the operator itself and also with respect to the reportable sellers by 31 January of the year following the calendar year in which the seller is identified as a reportable seller. Tax administrations have until the end of February to exchange information between Member States.
The first reporting year was 2023, so the first declaration should have been submitted by the reporting platform operator by 31 January 2024 (covering the 2023 calendar year), and the tax administrations exchanged information between Member States by the end of February 2024.
The reporting deadlines are the same for subsequent years, both for reporting platform operators (31 January, referring to the previous calendar year) and for tax administrations (by the end of February of the calendar year following the one being reported).
In the event of non-compliance, by the reporting platform operator, to comply with DAC 7 reporting obligations, the PTA is expected to impose penalties.

## Youth Personal Income Tax ("*IRS* *Jovem*")
With the 2025 State Budget, the Youth Personal Income Tax (PIT) tax regime is extended, making it applicable to income from employment and self-employed work earned by taxpayers (not dependents) who are up to 35 years old, while also eliminating the condition related to the completion of a cycle of studies.
In summary and in accordance with the current regime, income from Category A (employment income) and Category B (self-employment/business income) earned by taxpayers who are up to 35 years old who are not dependents is partially exempt from PIT in the first ten years earning employment or self-employment income.
A transitional regime has been created which establishes that, for purposes of exemption, taxpayers are included in the percentage corresponding to the year following the number of years of income generation from categories A and B already elapsed, not considering, for this purpose, the years in which they were considered dependents.
The exemption does not apply in the years in which income from categories A and B is not earned, resuming its application for the remaining years income is obtained by the taxpayer, until a total of ten years of exemption or the age limit of 35 years is reached.
## Former tax residents regime
In the 2019 State Budget, a new tax regime was introduced to encourage the return of emigrants to Portugal. The regime consists of a 50% relief from taxation of employment or self-employment income received after their return to Portugal.
With the 2024 State Budget, this tax relief is extended to taxpayers who become tax residents in the years 2024, 2025, and 2026, provided that they:
This tax relief (capped at EUR 250,000 for those returning in 2024, 2025, and 2026) is applicable to income earned in the first year of residency after the return to Portugal and in the following four years, expiring after this period.
While the regime applies, entities required to withhold tax on the income covered by this regime shall apply the withholding tax (WHT) rates determined based on half of the income paid or made available (keeping in mind the EUR 250,000 cap).
The regime applies to individuals who (i) become Portuguese tax residents, under Portuguese domestic law, in a specific year, (ii) have not qualified as tax residents in Portugal in any of the previous five years, (iii) do not benefit or have benefited from the NHR regime or the former resident regime, and (iv) carry out activities provided for in the applicable legislation.
Different procedures should be enacted in order to apply for the regime, depending on the activity performed / on the criteria of eligibility.
In general terms, the regime shall provide for:
## Gains from share plans
In May 2023, Portugal introduced a special tax regime applicable to income/gains arising from share plans granted for the benefit of employees or board members (in the last case with some limitations for 2023). This regime establishes a deferral from taxation to one of the first moments foreseen in the legislation (e.g. sale of the shares/rights) and also states that gains derived from said share plans shall be taxable only on 50% of the respective amount at a flat rate of 28%, provided certain requirements and conditions are met (both by the employer and the employee).
The application of this special tax regime depends on the maintenance of the rights underlying the assets generating the gains or of the equivalent rights, for a minimum period of one year.
Finally, this special tax regime does not apply to individuals who directly or indirectly hold a stake equal to or higher than 20% of the share capital or voting rights of the entity granting the plan.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 20 February 2025
## Employment expenses
## Deductions against rental income
The concept of deductible expenses encompasses all the expenses effectively incurred and paid by taxpayers in order to obtain or assure rental income, excluding the financial costs, depreciation, furniture, household appliances, decorations, and comfort accessories. Regarding properties in a horizontal proprietorship, other mandatory expenses incurred by the owner of each fraction will be also deductible.
The expenses incurred in the 24 months prior to the beginning of the lease/rent, concerning repair and maintenance expenses of the property, can also be deducted, provided that during such period the property has not been used for another purpose than the lease.
## Personal allowances
In Portugal, personal allowances take the form of tax credits (*see the [Other tax credits and incentives](other-tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for more information*).

## Treatment of trusts
Regarding the taxation of income from trusts, the Portuguese legislation provides rules to tax the following realities:
The amounts received as a result of liquidation, revocation, or extinction of ‘fiduciary structures’ are:
Regarding the distributions paid by fiduciary structures, the amounts either paid or made available to a taxpayer from ‘fiduciary structures’, other than those arising from a liquidation, revocation, or extinction, are taxable as investment income (Category E) and subject to taxation at a flat rate of 28% or of 35% (if the trust is considered to be domiciled on a 'blacklisted' jurisdiction), regardless of whether the recipients are settlors or not.
The transfer for consideration of rights on trusts, including the transfer for consideration of the beneficiary position, qualifies as a capital gain subject to taxation.
The rate is 35% in case of trusts domiciled in countries, territories, or regions subject to more favourable tax regimes.
## Tax treatment of crypto assets income
Based on the legislation in force (since 2023), the definition of crypto assets includes all digital representations of values or rights that can be transferred or stored electronically using distributed ledger technology or similar. Unique and non-fungible crypto assets are excluded from this definition (e.g. NFTs).
In general terms, as a rule, the new regime establishes that:
Both the termination of the (self-employment) activity and the cease of Portuguese residency are equivalent to transfers for consideration (exit tax).

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 20 February 2025
## Employment income
Employment income/remuneration is specifically defined in the Personal Income Tax (PIT) Code and covers all payments made by the employer, such as salary, bonuses, commissions, tax reimbursements, redundancy payments, pensions, allowances (e.g. cost-of-living and housing allowances), and benefits in kind (e.g. company cars), regardless of where the payment originates.
Domestic and foreign travel allowances, as well as mileage and lunch allowances in excess of those permitted to employees of state departments, are also taxable as employment income.
### Benefits in kind
In general, benefits in kind provided by an employer are subject to income tax at the employee level. There are specific provisions on taxation of employer-provided housing or housing allowances, use and acquisition of company cars, and share plans.
For PIT purposes, the taxable benefit from the use of a company car is taxable at the employee level if there is a written agreement between the employer and the employee regarding the allocation of a specific car to the last. In these circumstances, the benefit corresponds to 0.75% of the market value of the car, multiplied by the number of months of use of the car. If the company car is then acquired by the employee, a further benefit in kind will correspond to the positive difference between the market price of the car and the total amount already taxed as a benefit in kind to the employee as a result of using the car plus the acquisition price. The market price corresponds to the difference between the acquisition price and the balance derived from that value considering a depreciation factor published by the relevant authorities.
The exemption shall not apply to taxpayers that hold, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the share capital or of the voting rights of the employer.
### Termination of employment
Redundancy payments are taxable on the portion that exceeds the average remuneration paid during the last 12 months of employment, multiplied by the number of years of employment, unless a new employment contract or service contract is concluded with the employer or a related person within 24 months from the date of termination of the employment contract.
However, in case of a manager or administrator, the redundancy payments are fully liable to taxation. This measure is also applicable for public sector managers and PE representatives.
### Pensions
EUR 4,462.15 of pension income is tax exempt.
## Business and professional income
Income from a commercial, industrial, or agricultural activity and income from a sole trader (including scientific, artistic, or technical services) or from intellectual rights (when earned by the original owner) may be taxed either in accordance with a simplified regime or based on the taxpayer’s accounts. The simplified regime will apply only to taxpayers who, not having opted for organised accounts, have a turnover or a gross business and professional income lower than EUR 200,000 (for 2025) in the previous year. Under this simplified regime, the above income is taxed on 0.15% of sales of products or 0.75% of income arising from business and professional services listed in the table referred to in Article 151 of the PIT Code.
A coefficient of 0.35 is applicable to services not expressly foreseen in the table referred to in Article 151 of the PIT Code.
The income 'deduction' arising from the application of the coefficients of 0.75 and 0.35 (i.e. the generality of the service-rendering activities) is partially conditioned by the verification of expenses and charges effectively incurred and related to the activity. Therefore, to the taxable income determined by applying the coefficients will be added the positive difference between 15% of the gross income and the sum of the following amounts:
In addition to the amount of the above deduction, the amount of mandatory social security contributions paid, exceeding 10% of gross income and related to such professional activities, may also be deducted to the self-employment income if not deducted for other purposes.
## Capital gains
As a general rule, capital gains will be subject to tax at a flat rate of 28%. Only 50% of capital gains arising on the sale of shares held on micro and small companies not listed in the stock exchange will be subject to taxation.
As of 1 January 2023, the positive balance between capital gains and capital losses arising from the transfer for consideration of shares and other securities is mandatorily aggregated if the following conditions are met:
According to recent changes that have been introduced to the PIT Code in 2024, in general terms, gains/losses resulting from the disposal of securities admitted to trading or participation units in investment funds/open collective investment undertakings may benefit from an exclusion from taxation of:​
Since 2023, similarly to the regime applicable to tax residents, in the case of non-residents, only 50% of capital gains arising from the sale of real estate is taxed. This income is taxed at the marginal rates varying between 13% and 48% (plus the solidarity rate, if applicable) for 2025. In the case of non-tax residents, in order to determine the tax rate applicable to those capital gains, it is considered the worldwide income received (even if not taxed in Portugal).
In the case of tax residents, there are some circumstances under which the gain may be wholly or partially exempt (provided certain requirements are met), such as in case the property being sold was the taxpayer's primary residence in the last 12 months and the sale proceeds, reduced by the value of any outstanding loans relating to the purchase of the property being sold, are reinvested in the acquisition, improvement, or construction of another primary residence in Portugal or within the European Union (EU) within 36 months from the sale or in the period of 24 months previous to the sale. Other exemptions may also apply on the capital gains arising from the sale of real estate.
## Dividend and interest income
Dividends and interest are liable to taxation at a flat rate of 28%. However, the taxpayer may opt to be liable to tax on dividends and interest received at the marginal rates varying between 13% and 48%, plus the solidarity tax rate, if applicable (in 2025).
A credit against the Portuguese tax liability is available for the lower of the tax paid in the foreign country on those dividends and interest or the amount of tax payable in Portugal on that income. For dividends and interest paid by countries with which Portugal has signed a double taxation treaty (DTT), the tax credit should not exceed the percentage established in the treaty.
If the taxpayer opts to tax dividends at the marginal tax rates in force, only 50% will be liable to taxation if the paying company is tax resident in an EU country and complies with the requirements set out in the Directive on the common system of taxation applicable in the case of parent companies and subsidiaries of different Member States.
Interest income arising from current or saving accounts on Portuguese banks is taxed at 28% for residents. Interest paid by non-resident entities to tax resident individuals is also taxed at a rate of 28%.
## Rental income
As a rule, rental income earned by tax residents and non-tax residents is liable to a special tax rate of 28%. Rental income from residential rentals is taxed at 25% for contracts signed/renewed from October 2023 onwards (some exceptions may apply, determining the date as from which this rate starts to be applicable). The taxpayers have the option for the inclusion of such income in the total aggregated income in some situations. Special reductions or exemptions may apply, provided certain conditions are met.
The rental income that results from a consistent practise of the lease of properties, by option of the taxpayer, may be taxable as income from business and professional activities (self-employment [Category B]). However, in order to determine the income subject to taxation, the same rules used for determination of the rental income in ‘Category F’ should be taken into account.

## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 20 February 2025
The following tax credits are available for 2025 against the amount of tax due by tax residents:
Regarding the dependants who are included in more than one annual tax return, the amount of tax credit corresponds to 50% of that amount.
## Limit to the sum of credits to tax liability
| Taxable income by bracket | Limit to the sum of credits (1) |
| --- | --- |
| Taxable income included in the 1st bracket | Unlimited |
| Taxable income included in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th bracket | EUR 1,000 + [(2,500 - 1,000) \* [(80,000 - taxable income) / (80,000 - 8,059)]] |
| Taxable income over EUR 80,000 | EUR 1,000 |
Note
1. For households with three or more dependants, this limit is increased by 5% for each dependant not subject to PIT.
## Non-habitual residents (NHR) regime
The NHR regime was revoked with effect from 1 January 2024 onward. However, the regime is still applicable to those who (i) are already registered as NHR on 1 January 2024 or (ii) by 31 December 2023 meet the conditions for registration as NHR.
The regime is also applicable to individuals who became tax residents until 31 December 2024, provided certain conditions were met.
### Conditions, taxation, and other specificities
A taxpayer who became tax resident in Portugal for a certain year and has not been taxed as resident in Portugal for any of the previous five years are eligible for the special tax regime for non-habitual tax residents (additional conditions imposed by law apply for those who became tax residents in 2024 in order for them to be entitled to the special regime).
An application for the non-habitual residents tax regime has to be submitted electronically by 31 March, inclusive, of the year following the year in which the taxpayer became tax resident in Portugal (those who became tax residents in 2024 and are eligible for the regime under the special conditions imposed by law have until 31 March 2025 to submit the application).
In general terms, non-habitual residents are taxed at a flat rate of 20% in respect of employment income (Category A) and self-employment income (Category B) arising from high-value activities of a scientific, artistic, or technical nature.
A tax exemption (with progression, depending on the category of income) applies on foreign-source income (e.g. property income, interest, and dividends), provided certain conditions are met. In most cases, capital gains on the sale of securities are taxable at a flat rate of 28%. In addition, a flat tax rate of 10% is applicable on pensions from a foreign source, as well as to other payments from pension funds and similar retirement schemes.
A non-habitual resident acquires the right to be taxed as such during a ten-year period.
The regime applies to individuals who (i) become Portuguese tax residents, under Portuguese domestic law, in a specific year, (ii) have not qualified as tax residents in Portugal in any of the previous five years, (iii) do not benefit or have benefited from the NHR regime or the former resident regime, and (iv) who carry out activities provided for in the applicable legislation.
Different procedures should be enacted in order to apply for the regime, depending on the activity performed / on the criteria of eligibility.
In general terms, the regime shall provide for:
## Youth Personal Income Tax ("*IRS* *Jovem*")
With the 2025 State Budget, the Youth Personal Income Tax (PIT) tax regime is extended, making it applicable to income from employment and self-employed work earned by taxpayers (not dependents) who are up to 35 years old, while also eliminating the condition related to the completion of a cycle of studies.
In summary and in accordance with the current regime, income from Category A (employment income) and Category B (self-employment/business income) earned by taxpayers who are up to 35 years old who are not dependents is partially exempt from PIT in the first ten years earning employment or self-employment income.
A transitional regime has been created which establishes that, for purposes of exemption, taxpayers are included in the percentage corresponding to the year following the number of years of income generation from categories A and B already elapsed, not considering, for this purpose, the years in which they were considered dependents.
The exemption does not apply in the years in which income from categories A and B is not earned, resuming its application for the remaining years income is obtained by the taxpayer, until a total of ten years of exemption or the age limit of 35 years is reached.
