# Zambia
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
Zambia's CIT framework mandates separate taxation for distinct income sources, prohibiting loss offset across different income streams.
## Business income
Taxable business profits from Zambian operations are aligned with the charge year, which typically spans from 1 January to 31 December. Companies may request an alternative accounting period from the ZRA.
## Inventory valuation
For CIT calculations, IFRS guide inventory valuation.
## Capital gains
Zambia does not operate a specific capital gains tax; however, PTT applies to the realised value of transferred property.
## Dividend income
Dividends from foreign entities to Zambian companies attract CIT and are taxed separately. Tax treaties may offer relief, and unilateral measures can prevent double taxation. Dividends received from Zambian entities are considered final after WHT. For onward distributions, a tax credit equivalent to the WHT may be available to prevent double taxation.
## Interest income
All interest income, regardless of origin, is subject to CIT. For Zambian-sourced interest, the recipient company's taxable amount includes WHT, which is creditable against the company's CIT liability. Notably, green bonds listed on the Lusaka Stock Exchange enjoy a 0% tax rate from 1 January 2023, provided they mature after at least three years.
## Rental income
Effective from 1 January 2022, rental income is subject to a turnover tax with varying rates based on the gross rental income brackets.
## Royalty income
CIT applies to Zambian-source royalty income, which encompasses a broad range of property usage rights. The recipient company's taxable amount includes WHT, creditable against its CIT liability. From 1 January 2023, software rental is considered a royalty for tax purposes.
## Partnership income
Partnership income is taxed at the individual partner level, reflecting the transparent nature of partnerships under Zambian tax law.
## Unrealised foreign exchange gains/losses
Unrealised gains/losses are not taxable/deductible for tax purposes. Taxable foreign exchange gains and deductible losses of a revenue are contingent on realisation, with certain capital nature exceptions.
## Other income sources
Income from hedging and investment activities is also taxed under separate source taxation rules.
## Foreign income
Zambian residents are taxed on foreign-sourced dividend and interest income, as well as income from international transportation services.

| --- | --- | --- |
| Dividends | 15 (1) | 20 (1) |
| Interest | 15 (2, 3) | 20 |
| Interest from a Lusaka Securities Exchange listed Property Loan Stock Company | 0 | 15 |
| Interest from green bonds listed on the Lusaka Securities Exchange with maturity greater than three years | 0 | 0 |

| Royalties | 15 | 20 |
| Commodity royalty | 15 | N/A |
| Reinsurance | 0 | 20 |
| Commissions | 15 | 20 |
| Non-resident construction and haulage contractors | N/A | 20 |
| Public entertainment fees to entertainers/sports persons | N/A | 20 |
Notes
1. 0% if paid by a mining company.
2. Interest payable to local banks and financial institutions licensed under the Banking and Financial Services Act, 2017 is exempt from WHT. In addition, interest paid by a bank or an institution registered under the Banking and Financial Services Act, 2017 in respect of interest earning accounts held by individuals is exempt from WHT.
3. 0% if paid by a company listed on the Lusaka Securities Exchange to individual shareholders.
Zambia's WHT obligations are triggered by the earliest of the payment date, the accrual date, or when income becomes due or is held for a person's order. In the context of rental income, the Commissioner-General may designate tenants as WHT agents, requiring them to withhold tax on rental payments for leased properties.
WHT payments must be remitted within 14 days after the month in which the payment or accrual occurred. Additionally, Zambia has DTTs with various territories, offering reduced WHT rates on dividends, interest, and royalties to non-residents.
Zambia has DTTs in force with the following territories:
| Recipient | WHT (%) | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dividends | Interest | Royalties |
| Non-treaty | 20 | 20 | 20 |
| Treaty: |  |  |  |
| Botswana | 5 (1)/7 | 10 | 10 |
| Canada | 15 | 15 | 15 |
| China | 5 | 10 | 5 |
| Denmark | 15 | 10 | 15 |
| Finland | 5 (1)/15 | 15 | 5 (1)/15 |
| France (3) | 20 | 20 | 0 |
| Germany | 5 (1)/15 | 10 | 10 |

| Tanzania | 20 | 20 | 20 |
| Uganda | 20 | 20 | 20 |
| United Arab Emirates | 5 | 5 | 5 |
| United Kingdom | 5 (6)/15 | 10 | 5 |
Notes
1. The non-resident recipient must own at least 25% of the share capital of the capital of the Zambian company.
2. The rate of 5% shall apply where the beneficial owner is a company that directly holds at least 10% of the capital of the company paying the dividends, or if the beneficial owner is a pension fund.
3. The 1950 France - Zambia DTT is accepted to apply.
4. The 1953 Rhodesia & Nyasaland - South Africa DTT is expected to apply. These old treaties do not follow the OECD model, and, accordingly, their application to particular circumstances must be confirmed.
5. The rate of 8% shall apply in the case of payment of royalties in respect of any copyright of scientific work, patent, trademark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific experience.
6. This rate applies where the dividends are paid out of income (including gains) derived directly or indirectly from immovable property within the meaning of Article 6 of the treaty.
7. The rate of 5% shall apply where the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) that directly holds at least 10% of the capital of the company paying the dividends or if the beneficial owner is a pension fund.
In all cases, advance clearance must be obtained to obtain the treaty benefit and take advantage of any reduced rate of WHT or tax exemption.
It may be possible to obtain confirmation that management and consultancy fees can be paid without deduction of WHT by reference to the provisions of the relevant treaty. For treaties following the OECD model, the article concerning ‘Business Profits’ is generally taken to be relevant.

# Zambia
## Overview
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
Zambia, a landlocked country situated in the heart of Southern Africa, operates as a representative multiparty democracy. The nation's governance is spearheaded by a president, and its administrative framework is organised into ten provinces, further subdivided into over 116 districts. Lusaka, the capital, serves as the political and economic hub of the country. English is the official language, facilitating both domestic and international communication, while the Zambian kwacha (ZMW) is the legal tender, underpinning the nation's monetary system.
The cornerstone of Zambia's economy is its robust mining sector, with copper mining and processing being the most significant contributors. However, the economy is not one-dimensional; agriculture and tourism also play pivotal roles in the nation's economic structure, contributing to both employment and gross domestic product (GDP).
Looking ahead, Zambia's economic trajectory appears promising, with an anticipated annual GDP growth rate of 4.5% from 2023 to 2025. This optimistic forecast is attributed to the burgeoning demand for copper, particularly from China, and the commencement of operations at a new domestic fertiliser production facility, which is expected to diversify the economic base. Despite a slight deceleration in growth to 5.0% in Q2 2023, down from 5.9% in the corresponding quarter of the previous year, the outlook remains positive.
The period from 2024 to 2026 is marked by expectations of expansion, predominantly driven by a resurgence in the mining and agricultural sectors. An improved macroeconomic environment is anticipated to further bolster this growth. Additionally, sectors such as information and communication, financial and insurance services, accommodation and food services, transport and storage, and manufacturing are projected to maintain a trajectory of sustained progress. Fiscal prudence is expected to result in a narrowing of the overall cash fiscal deficit, with projections indicating a decrease to 4.8% of GDP in 2024, 2.8% in 2025, and a further reduction to 2.2% in 2026.
Zambia's engagement on the international stage is multifaceted, with active participation in several international organisations. These include the United Nations (UN), the African Union, the South African Development Community (SADC), the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), and the Commonwealth of Nations. Such involvement underscores Zambia's commitment to collaborative efforts in addressing regional and global challenges.

## Property transfer tax (PTT)
PTT applies on the transfer of land situated in Zambia; intellectual property (IP) right; a mining right or an interest in the mining right; mineral processing licences and other mining-related licences; and the transfer of shares issued by a company incorporated in Zambia, including on the indirect transfer by a non-resident company that indirectly holds at least 10% of the shareholding of a company incorporated in Zambia.
Effective from 1 January 2023, the following PTT rates apply:
| Description | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Land (including buildings) | 5 |

| Interest in a mineral processing licence | 5 |
| Mining licence/right | 10 |
| Mineral processing licence | 10 |
| Mining right for an exploration licence | 5 |
| IP | 5 |
The PTT liability is generally payable by the vendor. However, where the vendor/transferor is not available, a person, other than the transferor of the property, shall file a provisional tax return on behalf of the transferor where that person has been allowed to do so by a court order or has been appointed as a proxy for the registrar of court who has been authorised to render the provisional return. This will only apply under the following conditions:
## Luxury and excise taxes
Certain products, such as alcoholic drinks and cigarettes, are subject to excise duty.
## Turnover taxes
Turnover tax applies to certain businesses where the turnover is more than ZMW 12,000 but not more than ZMW 800,000 *per annum*. A flat rate of 4% on business turnover will be applied where turnover is between ZMW 12,000 and ZMW 800,000 *per annum*. Income that is subject to turnover tax will not be subject to income tax or VAT.
The definition of 'turnover' for turnover tax purposes excludes interest, dividends, and royalties.
## Local non-income taxes

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
Zambia's tax system is predominantly source-based, with income generated from Zambian sources being liable for income tax. For Zambian tax residents, the tax scope extends to global interest and dividend income, aligning with a worldwide taxation principle.
The standard CIT rate is 30% on taxable corporate income. However, as of 1 January 2023, the telecommunications sector's dual tax rate system has been streamlined to a uniform rate of 35%, replacing the previous structure of 30% on income up to ZMW 250,000 and 40% on income exceeding this threshold.
For small businesses unable to maintain detailed records for tax assessment, a base tax of ZMW 365 per annum is levied, which is common among market traders. Specific income sources may be taxed at varying CIT rates.
The following sources of income are subject to different CIT rates:
| Source of income | CIT rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Electronic communications networks or service licences | 35 |
| Farming | 10 |
| Profits from public private partnership projects by special purpose vehicles (SPVs) for the first five years | 15 |
| Agro-processing | 10 |
| Income earned by a producer of cotton seed or from ginning of cotton | 0 (2024 to 2028) |
| Income earned from spinning of cotton and weaving of thread | 0 (2024 to 2034) |
| Agro-processing of corn starch in Multi Facility Economic Zone or Industrial Park | 0 (2023 to 2032)  5 (2033 to 2035)  2.5 (2036 to 2037)  10 (2037 onwards) |
| Export of non-traditional products from farming and agro-processing | 10 |
| Export of non-traditional products other than those relating to farming and agro-processing (1) | 15 |
| Value addition to gemstones through lapidary and jewellery facilities. | 25 |
| Hotels, lodges, accommodation, and food services | 30 (previously 15) |
The rates applicable for mining operations (for both base metals and industrial minerals) are as follows:
| Tax on mining operations (2) (for both base metals and industrial minerals [3]) | Rate |
| --- | --- |
| CIT | 30% |
| Additional variable profits | N/A |
Income earned solely from mineral processing is subject to CIT at a rate of 30% (4).
Notes
1. Non-traditional products refer to anything produced or manufactured in the Republic, excluding minerals, electricity, services, or cotton lint exported without an export permit from the Minister of Commerce.
2. Mining operations means an operation carried out under a mining right, excluding an operation carried out under a mineral processing licence only, or an exploration licence.
3. Industrial minerals include rocks or minerals other than gemstones, base metals, energy minerals, or precious metals used in their natural state or after physical or chemical transformation, including barytes, dolomite, feldspar, fluorspar, graphite, gypsum, ironstone when used as a fluxing agent, kyanite, limestone, phyllite, magnesite, mica, nitrate, phosphate, pyrophyllite, salt, sand, clay, talc, laterite, gravel, potash, potassium minerals, granite, marble, clay, silica, diatomite, kaolin, bentonite, or quartz.
4. Mineral processing means the practice of beneficiating or liberating valuable minerals from their ores, which may combine a number of unit operations, such as crushing, grinding, sizing, screening, classification, washing, froth floatation, gravity concentration, electrostatic separation, magnetic separation, leaching, smelting, refining, calcining, and gasification or any other processes incidental thereto.
Reduced CIT rates apply in some other cases, including for certain companies listed on the Lusaka Securities Exchange.
## Mineral royalty tax
The mineral royalty tax regime in Zambia has undergone a number of changes since 2015. However, with effect from 1 January 2023, the following mineral royalty tax rates apply:
| Description | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| For a holder of a mining licence: |  |
| On the norm value of the base metals produced or recoverable under the licence, except when the base metal is copper. | 5.0 |
| On the norm value of the base metals produced or recoverable under the licence, when the base metal is cobalt. | 8.0 |
| On the norm value of the base metals produced or recoverable under the licence, when the base is a precious metal. | 6.0 |
| On the gross value of the energy and industrial minerals produced or recoverable under the licence. | 5.0 |
| On the gross value of the gemstones produced or recoverable under the licence. | 6.0 |
| On the norm value of the precious metals produced or recoverable under the licence. | 6.0 |
| Where the base metal produced or recoverable under the licence is copper: |  |
| On the norm value when the norm price of copper is less than USD 4,000 per tonne. | 4.0 |
| On the norm value, when the norm price of copper is USD 4,000 per tonne or greater, but less than USD 5,000 per tonne. | 6.5 |
| On the norm value, when the norm price of copper is USD 5.000 per tonne or greater, but less than USD 7,000 per tonne. | 8.5 |
| On the norm value, when the norm price of copper is USD 7,000 per tonne or greater | 10.0 |
From 1 January 2022, the mineral royalty tax is deductible in determining the taxable income of a mining company.
## Local income taxes
There are no income taxes imposed by the provincial or local authorities on businesses.

Income tax is determined by reference to a charge year, being the period of 12 months ending on 31 December.
## Tax returns and payment of tax
Individual taxpayers who earn income that exceeds ZMW 57,600 *per annum* other than that from employment and subject to PAYE are required to submit a provisional tax return and make advance payments during the charge year on account of their estimated tax liability.
The quarterly returns for the 2024 tax charge year are due as follows:
The personal income tax return needs to be submitted by 21 June following the end of the tax year. For example, the personal income tax return for the 2023 tax charge year must be submitted by 21 June 2024.
The same deadline applies for paying the balance of income tax that remains outstanding.
Effective 1 January 2023, the due date for the payment of a provisional return submitted by a person who registers after 31 March of any charge year shall be within 90 days from the date of registration.
## Tax audit process
The Commissioner-General of the ZRA has wide powers to require any person to attend to be questioned at the time of place specified by notice, where it is determined that person is able to impart information necessary for the purposes of the Income Tax Act.
Furthermore, following the release of the 2014 Budget, the Income Tax Act has been amended to empower the Commissioner-General of the ZRA to access any type of information required for tax purposes held by legal practitioners, accountants, and financial institutions.
## Statute of limitations
Save for fraud or wilful default, no assessment can be made for any charge year after six years from the end of the charge year.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
Under the Income Tax Act, Zambia has a source-based system for the taxation of income. Income deemed to be from a Zambian source is generally subject to Zambian income tax. Zambian residents are also subject to income tax on interest and dividends from a source outside Zambia.
## Personal income tax rates
The rates of income tax applicable to an individual for the 2024 charge year are as follows:
| Annual taxable income (ZMW) | Rate of income tax (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Up to 61,200 | 0 |
| 61,201 to 85,200 | 20 |
| 85,201 to 110,400 | 30 |
| Over 110,400 | 37 |
In principle, the same rates apply to both Zambian and non-Zambian residents. In practice, the only mechanism for income of non-Zambian residents to be subject to income tax at these rates would be on Zambian-source emoluments from an employment or office under Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE). Other Zambian-source income of non-Zambian residents could be subject to withholding tax (WHT).

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
## Social security contributions
Both employers and employees are required to make contributions to the NAPSA.
## National Health Insurance contributions
Both employers and employees are required to make contributions to the National Health Insurance Scheme.
## Consumption taxes
Value-added tax (VAT) applies to standard rated supplies of goods and services at 16%.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
Zambia does not have a net wealth/net worth tax.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Zambia does not have an inheritance, estate, or gift tax.
## Property taxes
Zambia does not have any other property tax other than Property Transfer Tax (PTT) (*see below*).
## Property transfer tax (PTT)
PTT applies on the transfer of land situated in Zambia; intellectual property (IP) right; a mining right or an interest in the mining right; mineral processing licences and other mining-related licences; and the transfer of shares issued by a company incorporated in Zambia, including on the indirect transfer by a non-resident company that indirectly holds at least 10% of the shareholding of a company incorporated in Zambia.
Effective from 1 January 2023, the following PTT rates apply:
| Description | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Land (including buildings) | 5 |
| Shares (including an interest in a mining right)\* | 5 |
| Interest in a mineral processing licence | 5 |
| Mining licence/right | 10 |
| Mineral processing licence | 10 |
| Mining right for an exploration licence | 5 |
| IP | 5 |
The PTT liability is generally payable by the vendor. However, where the vendor/transferor is not available, a person, other than the transferor of the property, shall file a provisional tax return on behalf of the transferor where that person has been allowed to do so by a court order or has been appointed as a proxy for the registrar of court who has been authorised to render the provisional return. This will only apply under the following conditions:
## Luxury and excise taxes
Certain products, such as alcoholic drinks and cigarettes, are subject to excise duty.
## Turnover taxes
Turnover tax applies to certain businesses where the turnover is more than ZMW 12,000 but not more than ZMW 800,000 *per annum*. A flat rate of 4% on business turnover will be applied where turnover is between ZMW 12,000 and ZMW 800,000 *per annum*. Income that is subject to turnover tax will not be subject to income tax or VAT.
The definition of 'turnover' for turnover tax purposes excludes interest, dividends, and royalties.
## Local non-income taxes

Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
## Taxable period
CIT is determined by reference to a charge year, being the period of 12 months ending on 31 December.
## Tax returns and payment of tax
The CIT rules require taxpayers to submit provisional tax returns in the first quarter of each charge year. Where there is a change in forecast, a revised return may be submitted at the end of either the second, third, or fourth quarters of the charge year. Provisional tax payments are required to be made quarterly. The provisional tax liabilities must be based on the estimated taxable income for the current charge year.
The quarterly returns for the 2024 tax charge year are due as follows:
By concession, the ZRA allows a 10-day grace period for the payment of taxes. Accordingly, each quarterly payment can be made on the 10th day of the month following the end of each quarter.
The final tax return needs to be submitted by 21 June following the end of the tax year. This must be accompanied by any balance of tax that remains unpaid. For example, the final tax return for the 2023 tax charge year is due for submission by 21 June 2024.
In the case of a manually filed tax return, the tax return needs to be submitted by 5 June following the end of the tax year. For example, the final tax return for the 2023 tax charge year, if submitted manually, is due for submission by 5 June 2024.
## Tax audit process
The Commissioner-General of the ZRA has wide powers to require any person to attend to be examined at a time and place specified by notice, where it is determined that person is able to impart information necessary for the purposes of the Income Tax Act.
Furthermore, the Income Tax Act empowers the Commissioner General of the ZRA to access any type of information required for tax purposes held by legal practitioners, accountants, and financial institutions.
## Statute of limitations
The Income Tax Act provides that an assessment shall not be made for a charge year after six years from the end of that charge year. In cases of fraud or wilful default, the assessment period may be extended to periods exceeding six years. With respect to transfer pricing, the assessment period covers up to ten years.
The ZRA is devoting a significant amount of time to transfer pricing audits, and there is expected to be an increasing scrutiny.
## General Anti-Avoidance Rules (GAAR)
GAAR applies to transactions that understate taxable income or overstate non-deductible expenses in Zambia.

# Zambia
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
Zambia's VAT system operates at a standard rate of 16% on most goods and services. Notably, goods and services exported from Zambia are typically zero-rated, with the exception of services physically performed in Zambia, which are taxed at the standard rate regardless of the customer's residency.
Imported standard-rated goods are also subject to the 16% VAT upon entry into Zambia. For services supplied to Zambian customers by non-resident providers, where the services have not been taxed in the originating country, Zambian VAT applies. In such cases, the Zambian customer must account for the output VAT through a reverse-charge mechanism but is initially unable to reclaim the input VAT.
To facilitate input VAT recovery for Zambian customers receiving services from abroad, the foreign supplier may appoint a local tax agent. This agent is responsible for managing output VAT and issuing Zambian tax invoices, enabling the customer to claim input VAT credits.
## Customs duties
In Zambia, imported goods attract customs duties, which are levied to regulate the flow of goods into the country. The customs duty rates vary depending on the classification of the goods under the Harmonized System codes.
## Excise taxes
The Zambian tax regime imposes excise taxes on specific goods and services. These include, but are not limited to, alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, and mobile communication services. The excise duty rates are predetermined and applied to these goods and services to discourage excessive consumption and generate revenue for the government.
It is important for businesses and individuals engaging in the importation of goods or dealing in excisable products and services to be aware of these tax obligations to ensure compliance with Zambian tax laws. Exercisable goods and services are subject to excise duty at the following rates:
| Item | 2024 rate | 2023 rate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Non-alcoholic drinks | ZMW 0.60 per litre | ZMW 0.30 per litre |
| Alcoholic drinks: |
| Less than 80% by volume | 60% | 60% |
| 80% or higher by volume | 60% + 20% surtax | 60% + 20% surtax |
| Ethyl alcohol and other spirits, denatures of alcoholic strength of less than 80% | 60% | 125% |
| Unmanufactured tobacco | 145% or ZMW 400 per kg | 145% or ZMW 361 per kg |
| Cigarettes | ZMW 400 per mille | ZMW 361 per mille |
| Electronic cigarettes and similar personal electric vaporising devices | 145% | - |
| Telephone airtime\* | 17.5% | 17.5% |
| Portland cement | ZMW 40 per tonne | ZMW 40 per tonne |
| Plastic carrier bags | 30% | 30% |
| Plastic articles (including floor covering of plastics, tiles, walls, or ceilings) | 15% | - |
\* Airtime includes minutes of voice calls, short message services (sms), multi-media services (mms), Internet bandwidth, and other similar services that a subscriber consumes on a mobile cellular telephone or other electronic communication device.
## Property Transfer Tax (PTT)
Zambia imposes PTT on certain property transactions. The PTT is levied on the following:
Notably, PTT also applies to indirect share transfers. This occurs when a non-resident company, holding a minimum of 10% in a Zambian company, undergoes a share transfer.
### PTT rates
Effective from 1 January 2023, the following PTT rates apply:
| Description | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Land (including buildings) | 5 |
| Shares (including an interest in a mining right)\* | 5 |
| Mining right for a mining licence | 10 |
| Mineral processing licence | 10 |
| Mining right for an exploration licence | 5 |
| IP | 5 |
Typically, the seller is responsible for PTT payment. However, in cases where the seller is unavailable, a provisional tax return may be filed by another individual under specific circumstances, such as:
This substitute filing is permissible only with a court order or if the individual has been designated as a proxy by the court's registrar authorised to submit the provisional return.
## Stamp taxes
There is no stamp tax in Zambia. However, effective 1 January 2023, the Patents and Companies Registration Agency (PACRA) has reduced the fees levied on the increase in authorised share capital of a company incorporated in Zambia to 1.5% (previously 2.5%) of the nominal value of the share capital.
The minimum prescribed fees at initial registration of a company will vary according to the specific type of company being incorporated. The following are the minimum prescribed fees:
| Company type | Prescribed registration fees (nominal capital) (ZMW) |
| --- | --- |
| Private company | 20,000 |
| Public company | 2,000,000 |
| Bureau de change | 100,000 |
| Financial institution | 1,000,000 |
| Local bank | 138,666,667 |
| Foreign bank | 693,333,200 |
| Insurance broker | 133,334 |
| Insurance company | 2,000,000 |
| Reinsurance company | 10,000,000 |
| Company limited by guarantee | 1,267 |
However, the total fee shall not exceed ZMW 3,333,333. For a company limited by guarantee, the guaranteed amount shall not be less than ZMW 20,000.
## Turnover taxes
Entities with annual turnovers not exceeding ZMW 800,000 are subject to a 4% turnover tax. This tax is exclusive of income tax. Turnover, for this purpose, does not include interest, dividends, royalties, consultancy services income, or income from standard mining operations. However, as of 1 January 2023, artisanal or small-scale mining activities under the threshold are taxed at the same rate.
### Gig economy and rental income
Individuals in the gig economy earning up to ZMW 12,000 annually are exempt from turnover tax. Those with incomes between ZMW 12,000 and ZMW 800,000 are taxed at 4%.
Similarly, rental income earners below ZMW 12,000 annually are exempt, while those with rental incomes within the ZMW 12,000 to ZMW 800,000 range are taxed at a 4% rate. Rental incomes above ZMW 800,000 are subject to a 12.5% tax rate.
Rental income earners must file monthly rental income tax returns by the 14th day of the following month. All taxpayers receiving rental income must register for rental income tax and comply with the same monthly payment deadline for submitted returns.
## Payroll taxes
Employers in Zambia must deduct income tax from employee emoluments under the Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) system, which applies progressive personal income tax (PIT) rates.
### Skills Development Levy (SDL)
A mandatory monthly levy of 0.5% is imposed on employers, calculated on the gross emoluments of their employees.
## Social security contributions
Both employers and employees contribute to the National Pension Scheme Authority (NAPSA). The combined contribution rate is 10% of an employee's earnings, capped at ZMW 2,981.60 monthly (ZMW 1,490.80 each).
## National Health Insurance contributions
The National Health Insurance Scheme mandates a 1% contribution from both employers and employees, based on the employee's basic salary, totalling a 2% contribution.
## Provincial/local taxes other than income taxes
Employers may be subject to additional levies by local councils, such as the Lusaka City Council.

# Zambia
## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
Following the 2024 Budget announcements, below are some of the amendments to the tax legislations in Zambia with effect from 1 January 2024:
## Corporate income tax (CIT)
Certain legislative amendments are designed to stimulate economic growth, foster rural development, and streamline tax compliance mechanisms. The key changes and their implications for stakeholders are as follows:
## Withholding tax (WHT)
### Introduction of WHT on deemed interest from government securities
The recent legislative amendment has introduced the imposition of a WHT at a rate of 15% on the income derived from discount on government securities, with the exception of treasury bills. This tax pertains to the deemed interest that accrues from such financial instruments. The deemed interest is essentially the difference between the purchase price and the face value of the security, which is realised by the holder at maturity.
The introduction of a 15% WHT on deemed interest from government securities, other than treasury bills, marks a significant shift in the taxation of income from these instruments. Investors and stakeholders must take cognisance of this change and its implications on investment yields and tax obligations. Proactive measures, including a review of investment strategies and compliance frameworks, are essential to navigate this change in the fiscal environment effectively.
## Value-added tax (VAT)
### Introduction of electronic invoicing system (EIS)
The modernisation of VAT administration is set to advance with the introduction of an EIS. This initiative is poised to streamline the process of issuing and managing invoices, thereby improving compliance and efficiency. The system is designed to facilitate real-time tracking of transactions and ensure the accuracy of tax records.
There is an amendment to remove the mention of ‘electronic fiscal devices’ from both the VAT and Insurance Premium Levy Acts. This change reflects the transition towards more sophisticated digital solutions and the phasing out of outdated technologies.
To align with technological advancements, Section 2 of the VAT Act has been amended to incorporate definitions that will underpin the taxation framework for both local and international electronic services. The inclusion of these definitions is critical to establishing a clear legal basis for the taxation of digital transactions and the operation of the EIS.
### Special provisions for mining companies
There is an amendment to Section 42 of the VAT Act, which permits mining companies to maintain their financial records in United States dollars (USD). This provision, however, is contingent upon the stipulation that a minimum of 75% of the company's mining revenue is generated from external markets in the form of foreign exchange. This amendment acknowledges the global nature of the mining industry and the need for a fiscal framework that accommodates international transactions.
### Invoicing system compliance for input tax claims
The VAT Act is amended to include a reference to an approved invoicing system as a prerequisite for claiming input tax. This measure is intended to ensure that only those taxpayers who comply with the mandated EIS can benefit from input tax deductions. It serves as an incentive for taxpayers to adopt the new system and reinforces the government's commitment to modernising tax administration.
These amendments represent a significant step towards enhancing the VAT framework to better suit the evolving digital economy and international business practices. The adoption of an EIS, coupled with the necessary legislative updates, will position the tax system to be more effective, transparent, and adaptable to future innovations.
## Customs and excise duties
The government has implemented a series of strategic amendments to customs and excise duties aimed at fostering sustainable development. These amendments are as follows:
### Electric vehicles and accessories
A suspension of customs duty is now in effect for electric motor vehicles intended for the transportation of individuals, including electric buses and trucks. Additionally, this suspension extends to accessories pertinent to electric vehicles, such as charging systems, reflecting a commitment to environmental sustainability and the promotion of clean energy solutions.
### Excise duty rate reductions
In a move to recalibrate the taxation of alcohol products, the excise duty rate on ethyl alcohol and other spirits, which have an alcoholic strength of less than 80%, has been reduced from 125% to 60%. This reduction is anticipated to have various economic implications, including potential shifts in consumer behaviour and market dynamics.
### Introduction of new levies and duty increases
A new levy has been introduced on person-to-person mobile money transfers. This measure is part of a broader strategy to modernise the fiscal framework and capture value from the burgeoning digital economy.
There has been an increase in customs duty on all imported electrical panels, including distribution boxes, from 15% to 25%. This adjustment specifically targets boards, panels, and other bases utilised for electric control or the distribution of electricity.
The excise duty rates on a range of processed and unprocessed tobacco products have been increased from 361 to 400 Zambian kwacha (ZMW) per mille. This increment aligns with public health objectives and reflects the government's approach to discouraging the consumption of tobacco products through fiscal policy.
### Legislative updates
Amendments to the provisions of the Customs and Excise Duty Act now incorporate a chargeable offence for the unauthorised use of the customs seal. This update underscores the importance of compliance with customs regulations and the protection of revenue through the enforcement of proper seal usage.
These fiscal policy changes are designed to balance economic growth with social responsibility, reflecting a nuanced approach to taxation and regulatory adjustments. Stakeholders are advised to review these changes comprehensively to understand their implications and ensure compliance with the updated legal framework.
## Transfer pricing
A requirement is introduced for taxpayers to obtain authorisation from the Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) prior to employing transfer pricing methods not explicitly prescribed by the Commissioner-General. This measure ensures adherence to standardised practices and enhances compliance oversight.
The definitions of key terms, including ‘surrogate parent entity’, ‘reporting entity’, and ‘reporting fiscal year’, have been refined. These changes are designed to harmonise domestic regulations with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Transfer Pricing Guidelines, thereby promoting international consistency and reducing the risk of tax disputes.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
In Zambia, a corporate entity is considered a resident for tax purposes if it meets any of the following criteria:
Entities meeting these conditions are subject to Zambian tax regulations for the relevant charge year.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
In Zambia, the concept of PE is pivotal for non-resident entities to understand their tax obligations. A non-resident may be deemed to have a Zambian PE if it operates through a fixed place of business within the country or engages a dependent agent authorised to conclude contracts on its behalf.
The domestic definition aligns closely with the OECD Model Tax Convention, detailing both inclusive and exclusive activities for a fixed place of business. Notably, the provision of services, including consultancy, by a non-resident enterprise via employees or personnel for more than 90 days within a 12-month period triggers PE status.
It is crucial to consider applicable double tax treaties (DTTs), as they may change the PE definition and take precedence over domestic law.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
Deductible expenses must be non-capital in nature and incurred wholly and exclusively for business purposes. Specific provisions, such as for bad debts, are deductible subject to the Commissioner - General's approval.
## Depreciation and amortisation
While accounting depreciation and amortisation are not deductible, a 'capital allowance' is available for qualifying capital assets used in business operations.
Zambia has a system of capital allowances that provides for wear and tear deductions in ascertaining business income. These are calculated at annual rates on qualifying capital expenditure, which currently apply as follows:
| Category of qualifying expenditure | Rate of allowance (calculated on a straight-line basis) |
| --- | --- |
| Industrial buildings | Investment allowance of 10% \* |
| Initial allowance of 10% \* |
| Annual wear and tear allowance of 5% \* |
| Other commercial buildings | Annual wear and tear allowance of 2% |
| Implements, machinery, and plant - farming and agro-processing | Annual wear and tear allowance of 100% |
| Implements, machinery, and plant - for persons operating in priority sector and a developer in a special economic zone | Annual wear and tear allowance of 100% |
| Implements, machinery, and plant - manufacturing, tourism, generation of electricity, and leasing | Annual wear and tear allowance of 50% |
| Implements, machinery and plant - other | Annual wear and tear allowance of 25% |
| Commercial vehicles | Annual wear and tear allowance of 25% |
| Non-commercial vehicles | Annual wear and tear allowance of 20% |
| Patents, designs, trademarks, and copyrights | Premium allowance on straight-line basis over the life of period for which the right is granted |
| Mining expenditure (only available for assets brought into use) | Mining deductions of 20% |
| Farm improvements | Farm improvement allowance of 100% |
\* For industrial buildings, the investment allowance and the initial allowance can both be claimed in the year in which the building is put into use, together with the wear and tear allowance for that year.
Goodwill is non-deductible due to its capital nature.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses are deductible if incurred within 18 months prior to business commencement and would have been deductible post-commencement.
## Interest expenses
## Bad debt
## Charitable contributions
Deductible payments to approved public benefit organisations are capped at 15% of assessable income.
## Pension expenses
## Payments to directors
Payments to directors are deductible if incurred wholly for business purposes, barring domestic or personal expenses.
## Bribes, kickbacks, and illegal payments
Bribes, kickbacks, and illegal payments are non-deductible.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties, including those under the Income Tax Act, are non-deductible unless incurred wholly for business purposes.
## Taxes
## Other significant items
### Allowable deductions
### Non-allowable deductions
## Net operating losses
## Payments to foreign affiliates

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
There are no consolidated CIT returns for groups.
Losses in one group company cannot offset profits in another.
## Transfer pricing
Transactions must be at arm's-length. Non-compliance can lead to income adjustments and avoidance penalties.
Companies must maintain transfer pricing documentation for ten years.
Non-compliance penalties can reach ZMW 24 million.
## International compliance
From 2021, multinationals with revenues over ZMW 4,795 million must submit Country-by-Country (CbC) Reports within 12 months post-financial year.
Zambia joined the OECD Global Forum to combat tax evasion and enhance financial transparency, committing to EOIR and AEOI standards.
## Thin capitalisation
Interest deductibility is limited to 30% of tax EBITDA, excluding turnover tax system businesses and those under the Banking and Financial Services Act.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Zambia does not have a CFC regime.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
Zambia's tax system determines branch profits based on the branch's functions, assets, and risks within the country. To ascertain the profits attributable to a branch, a transfer pricing benchmarking study is often necessary. This study compares the branch's profit margins with those of independent entities to establish a benchmark for CIT purposes.
## Financial reporting and taxable income calculation
Both Zambian resident companies and branches must adhere to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) when preparing their financial statements. Taxable profits are calculated by adjusting the accounting profit according to the rules that govern the determination of taxable income for resident companies.
## CIT rates
## WHT on branch profits
Branches of foreign companies face a 20% WHT on repatriated profits. It is important to note that branches may not benefit from double taxation relief under tax treaties when repatriating profits.

## Advance income tax
Advance income tax may apply at 15% on the value of commercial imports where the importer is non-compliant with its tax obligations. This can be credited against the importer’s CIT liability on submission of the annual tax return.
## Exchange controls
The exchange monitoring regulations and foreign currency regulations in Zambia were repealed in March 2014.
However, the government, through the Bank of Zambia (BoZ), recently developed an Electronic Export Proceeds Tracking Framework. This is intended to facilitate real-time monitoring and reporting between the regulatory authorities.
The BoZ further issued the (Export Proceeds Tracking Framework) Directives in 2023 as subsidiary legislation to govern the implementation of the framework. The Directives became effective on 1 January 2024.
The framework highlights that all exporters are required to complete and submit the customs export declaration Form CE 20 to the ZRA with a unique identification number called the Unique Consignment Reference (UCR).
In addition to the above, all exporters will be required to open and maintain accounts with commercial banks or financial institutions domiciled in Zambia. This entails that all the earnings derived from the export of goods and/or services would be required to be reflected in the said bank account within 90 days of the export.
Commercial banks and financial institutions that receive the export proceeds are required to notify the BoZ by way of submitting returns of all money and remittances received to the BoZ. The returns submitted should provide the Taxpayer Identification Numbers, details of receipts and utilisation of funds, and correct use of UCRs.
Once the above procedures have been completed, the BoZ will be responsible for the following:
## Choice of business entity
A non-Zambian resident company can establish a business in Zambia, either as a branch of a foreign company or a subsidiary (i.e. a Zambian registered limited liability company).
## Adoption of IFRS
Zambia has adopted a three-tier financial reporting framework as guided by the governing accounting body, the Zambia Institute of Chartered Accountants (ZiCA). The reporting and auditing requirements for the three tiers under the framework are as follows:

## Foreign tax relief
Foreign tax suffered on income of an individual may be eligible for foreign tax relief either under a double tax treaty (DTT) with Zambia or as unilateral relief available under domestic law. The credit is restricted to the lower of the amount of foreign tax actually suffered and the Zambian income tax that would have applied on the foreign income as a percentage of total income.

| Denmark | Kenya | Tanzania |
| Finland | Morocco | Uganda |
| France (4) | Netherlands (7) | United Arab Emirates |
| Germany | Norway (3) | United Kingdom (5) |
| India | Seychelles |  |
Notes
1. The 1953 Rhodesia & Nyasaland - South Africa DTT is generally accepted to apply.
2. The 1954 Switzerland - United Kingdom DTT is generally accepted to apply.
3. The new treaty with Norway was signed on 17 December 2015 but has not yet come into force.
4. The 1950 France - United Kingdom DTT is generally accepted to apply.
5. The new Zambia - United Kingdom treaty signed on 14 February 2014 came into force effective 1 January 2016.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
## Employment expenses
An expense is deductible against taxable emoluments if it is incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of that source of income and is not capital in nature. This test is difficult to satisfy in practice where an expense is incurred by an employee. Capital allowances may be available in limited circumstances.
## Personal deductions
### Alimony
Alimony payments are not deductible.
### Charitable contributions
A payment to a public benefit organisation that is approved by the Zambian government or owned by the Zambian government is deductible. The maximum amount deductible is 15% of taxable income.
### Mortgage interest expenses
Mortgage interest is not deductible.
### Taxes paid
## Standard deductions
There is no standard deduction.
## Personal allowances
There are no personal allowances. However, as set out in the rate table, the first ZMW 61,200 of taxable income (excluding taxable lump sum payments from approved pension funds, gratuities, and compensation for loss of office) is subject to income tax at 0%.
## Business deductions
Business expenses are generally deductible, provided that they are not capital and they are incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the business.
## Losses
Trading losses can be carried forward for set-off against profits of the same source. Normally, losses are available to carry forward for a period of five years after the charge year in which the loss was incurred. In the case of a person carrying on a mining operation or hydro, solar, wind, and thermal power generation, the loss carryforward period is ten years.
There is no ability to carry back losses.
Losses from one source cannot be set against income from another source.

## Individual - Other issues
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
## Treatment of flow-through business entities
Where a business is carried on in partnership, the income to which each partner is entitled in a period is ascertained under the Zambian income tax rules, and each partner is assessed and charged accordingly. A partnership is therefore broadly transparent for Zambian income tax purposes.
## Exchange controls
Regulations requiring the monitoring of cross border and foreign currency transactions were abolished in March 2014.
Regulations that required local transactions to be negotiated and based in the local currency, kwacha, were also abolished.
However, the government, through the Bank of Zambia (BoZ), recently developed an Electronic Export Proceeds Tracking Framework. This is intended to facilitate real-time monitoring and reporting between the regulatory authorities.
The BoZ further issued the (Export Proceeds Tracking Framework) Directives in 2023 as subsidiary legislation to govern the implementation of the framework. The Directives became effective on 1 January 2024.
The framework highlights that all exporters are required to complete and submit the customs export declaration Form CE 20 to the ZRA with a unique identification number called the Unique Consignment Reference (UCR).
In addition to the above, all exporters will be required to open and maintain accounts with commercial banks or financial institutions domiciled in Zambia. This entails that all the earnings derived from the export of goods and/or services would be required to be reflected in the said bank account within 90 days of the export.
Commercial banks and financial institutions that receive the export proceeds are required to notify the BoZ by way of submitting returns of all money and remittances received to the BoZ. The returns submitted should provide the Taxpayer Identification Numbers, details of receipts and utilisation of funds, and correct use of UCRs.
Once the above procedures have been completed, the BoZ will be responsible for the following:

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
## Employment income
Income derived from employment within Zambia is subject to taxation. This encompasses all forms of remuneration linked to services performed or roles held in the country, regardless of the payment's location or the payer's residence. Employers must withhold and remit taxes on these emoluments through the Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) system.
### Scope of emoluments
The term 'emoluments' is broadly defined to include, but is not limited to, salaries, wages, overtime pay, commissions, bonuses, and pensions. It also covers any benefits or allowances that can be converted into cash or its equivalent.
### Taxation of employee benefits
Benefits that can be monetised are considered part of the employee's taxable income and fall under the PAYE framework. Conversely, non-cash benefits, such as the provision of vehicles or housing by the employer, are taxed at the employer's level.
### Skills Development Levy (SDL)
Employers are also obligated to contribute to the national skills development by paying a levy amounting to 0.5% of the total emoluments paid to employees each month.
## Equity compensation
The allotment or acquisition of shares under a share option scheme that is approved by the Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) is exempt from income tax.
Specific rules for other share option schemes apply from 1 January 2014.
## Business income
Business income is generally determined in line with applicable accounting standards (excluding receipts of a capital nature). Expenses wholly and exclusively incurred for the purposes of the business are generally deductible, provided they are of a revenue nature rather than capital in nature.
Capital expenditure is disallowed, but capital allowances are available on qualifying capital items.
## Capital gains
Zambia does not have a capital gains tax, and, except where provided otherwise in the Income Tax Act, capital gains are not subject to tax.
## Dividend income
Zambian resident individuals are taxed on dividend income from both Zambian and non-Zambian sources.
In the case of dividend income received from a Zambian resident company, the WHT deducted on the payment of the dividend should represent the ‘final tax’, and the Zambian resident individual receiving the dividend should not be subject to additional income tax.
## Interest income
Zambian resident individuals are generally taxed on interest income from both Zambian and non-Zambian sources.
From 1 January 2022, interest earned by individuals on interest earning accounts held at banks and institutions registered under the Banking and Financial Services Act, 2017 is exempt from tax.
From 1 January 2023, interest earned by individuals on interest earning on green bonds listed on the Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE) with maturity of at least three years is exempt.
In the case of other Zambian-source interest income, the WHT deducted on the payment of interest should represent the ‘final tax’, and the Zambian resident individual receiving the interest is not subject to additional income tax.
## Rental income
From 1 January 2022, rental income is taxed by way of turnover tax at the rate of 0% for gross rental income below ZMW 12,000, 4% for gross rental income between ZMW 12,000 and ZMW 800,000, and 12.5% for gross rental income above ZMW 800,000 *per annum*. The tax is payable by the landlord.
## Exempt income
As noted above, capital gains and non-Zambian source income (with the exception of dividends and interest) are outside the scope of income tax.
Exempt categories of income include:
