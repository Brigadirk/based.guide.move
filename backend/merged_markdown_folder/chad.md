## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The VAT rate applicable in Chad is:
An operation performed in Chad that constitutes an economic activity and for which payment is made, unless included in the list of exemptions in the law governing VAT, is liable for VAT, even if the residence of the natural person or the registered office of the legal entity is located outside Chad.
The VAT law provides a list of transactions exempted from VAT that includes, among many others, the following:
Before fiscal year 2018, the refund of VAT credit applied only to some categories of taxpayers.
From fiscal year 2018, any taxpayer (resident) subject to VAT may apply for the refund of VAT credit, except taxpayers who benefit from any exemption via establishment agreements.
The deadline for the application of the refund of VAT credit is 24 months from the birth of this credit.
The refund of VAT credit is guaranteed by an escrow account domiciled in Bank of the States of Central Africa. This account is fuelled by 15% of various VAT revenues.
Any VAT credit officially recognised by the tax administration shall be refunded.
The consequences of the application for VAT credit are as follows:
Refund of VAT credit is disallowed in the following cases:
The consequences of the rejection of the application for VAT credit:
The practise modalities of the refund of the VAT credit are not yet precised by the tax administration.
## Customs duties
The tax basis of customs duties corresponds with the customs valuation, namely the selling price of the goods plus cost of delivery to Chad (costs of insurance, transportation, etc.).
The rates of customs duties depend on the nature of the goods and range from 5% to 30%. These rates can be summarised as follows:
## Excise duty
Excise duty applies to goods of great consumption: cigarettes, drinks (water, beer, and wine), cosmetics, and luxury products, and transactions of mobile companies, which are the legal taxpayers. Excise duty rates depend on the nature of the goods and range from 5% to 25% of the value of the good.
Some of the rates are as follows:
This value differs depending on the origin of the good. If the good has been manufactured in the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC) zone, the value corresponds with the selling price charged by the manufacturer. If the good is imported into the CEMAC zone, the value is the sum of the freight value plus insurance costs and customs duties.
This value constitutes the basis of the calculations of the excise duty.
## Real property tax
The annual real property tax differs according to whether it is a built or an unbuilt property and whether it is located in N’Djamena or elsewhere. The tax is imposed in the municipality where the property is situated.
The tax rate on built property is 10% in N’Djamena and 8% elsewhere.
The tax rate on unbuilt property is 21% in N’Djamena and 20% elsewhere.
The calculation basis is the potential revenue of that property. The potential revenues correspond to four-fifths of the rental value, the rental value being 10% of the market value. For rural unbuilt property, the market value is fixed to XAF 50,000 per hectare.
Some temporary exemptions are granted to new buildings or additions to constructed buildings after 1 January 1968 from this tax in some conditions. In case of construction or reconstruction, owners can benefit from temporary exemptions as follows:
## Accommodation tax
The person occupying a building (owner or tenant) has to pay the following amount as accommodation tax annually:
| Type of construction | N’Djamena (XAF) | Elsewhere (XAF) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| For constructions in local material | 10,000 | 5,000 |
| For hard or semi-hard constructions | 25,000 | 15,000 |
| For R+ hard constructions | 40,000 and a supplement of 20,000 per level | 20,000 and a supplement of 10,000 per level |
## Transfer tax
Fixed or proportional transfer duties must be paid on the transfer of ownership of estates, personal property, and real property. Transfer duties are also due on contributions to companies and divisions of property. The proportional fees for the following transfers are:
These transfers are generally registered within three months of their entry into possession.
## Stamp duties
Stamp duties must be paid on each civil or judicial document intended to be used as evidence. Stamp duty is generally XAF 1,000 per page.
All claims for reimbursement submitted to the Board are subject to a stamp duty of XAF 2,000.
Requests to the administration for professional competitions are subject to a stamp duty of XAF 1,000.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
## Taxable period
Companies must, in principle, close off their yearly financial accounts on 31 December each year. Where a company begins operations later in the year (say June 2018), it has the option of operating for a minimum of 12 months or a maximum of 18 months to close off its accounts.
## Tax returns
Corporate tax returns are due on 30 April, at the latest, with the possibility to apply for an exceptional extension to 15 May.
Before fiscal year 2018, taxpayers could subscribe to a rectifying Statistical and Tax Statement at any time before any tax audit.
From fiscal year 2018, any taxpayer who has made errors or omissions in one’s spontaneous tax returns (monthly tax return, annual tax return, annual statement of salaries and wages) can subscribe to a rectificative tax return within two months from the date of filing of the initial tax return.
An amending declaration is binding to the tax administration if filed within two months.
## Payment of tax
Certain taxes are considered instalment payments of corporate tax. Once the amount of corporate tax is known, these payments are deductible from the amount and only the balance has to be paid on 15 May. These taxes include the minimum corporate tax, the quarterly instalment payments, and the 4% discharge for retail goods, if applicable.
### Minimum corporate tax (monthly and quarterly)
The minimum corporate tax shall be filed and paid, at the latest, on the 15th day of the month following the month of achievement of the turnover for companies subject to the normal tax regime and quarterly for companies subject to the simplified tax regime.
However, for the payment of the floor rate, payment may be made in four instalments of XAF 250,000 each, 15 days after the end of the quarter.
If this instalment payment exceeds the annual corporate tax, the remainder is lost.
### One-third instalment payments (paid three times quarterly)
Corporations that fulfil the following conditions are subject to quarterly instalment payments:
The quarterly instalment payments are equal to one-third of the difference between the corporate tax due during the prior fiscal year and the minimum income tax paid during the same period.
The payment must take place before the 15th day of May, August, and November.
Since August 2017, taxpayers are authorised to pay taxes, penalties, and fines by electronic money. The tax administration has not yet precised the modalities of payment.
## Tax audit process
In brief, the tax audit exercised by the *Direction Générale des Impôts* (Directorate General of Taxes) in Chad consists of three different types of control:
In all the audits, there are contradictory and contentious proceedings. The contradictory proceeding is engaged when the tax administration finds deficiency, inaccuracy, or omission in the information on the tax returns and notifies the taxpayer thereof. The contentious proceeding, on the other hand, is engaged when the taxpayer, in turn, disagrees with the observations of the tax administration and challenges its position directly with the tax administration and/or with the courts.
### Contentious claim
Taxpayers who dispute the justification or the amount of tax levied on them may, if they had formally filed the claim under certain conditions, obtain stay of payment of the disputed portion of the said taxes, on condition that they:
## Statute of limitations
The total or partial omissions found in the tax base, the inadequacies and inaccuracies, or the taxation errors, can be repaired by the tax administration until the end of the third year following that in which the tax or fee is payable.
Furthermore, any omission or insufficiency of tax revealed by a proceeding before the criminal courts or by a contentious claim may, without prejudice to the general period of repetitions established above, be repaired until the end of the third year following the revelation of the facts.
## Validation of the taxpayer’s accounts: Competence of Chartered Accountants CEMAC
Before 2018, the certification of the taxpayer’s accounts made by an accountant or chartered accountant, accredited to the Court of Appeal of N'Djamena or approved CEMAC, is binding to the tax administration.
From fiscal year 2018, only CEMAC chartered accountant are authorised to validate the taxpayer’s accounts.
### Applicable sanctions
Fine applicable to the taxpayer: Fine of XAF 300,000 if the taxpayer’s account is validated by an accountant or chartered accountant of the Court of Appeal of N'Djamena.
Fines of XAF 5 million are applicable to any accountant who validates an accounting that is inconclusive or tainted by irregularities.
Furthermore, a suspension of approval for two years and criminal prosecution are applicable.
## Prohibition of chartered accountants to provide tax advice
From 2018, any accountant who provides tax advice in contradiction to the texts that govern its profession is liable to a fine of XAF 5 million, the suspension of its authorisation for two years, and criminal prosecution.
There is an incompatibility of the practice of the profession of chartered accountant with the profession of tax advisory as defined by the Statute of Tax Council.

# Chad
## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
An individual with residence in Chad is subject to personal income tax (PIT) on worldwide income. A non-resident individual in Chad is subject to PIT on the income stemming from activities in Chad.
The taxable income is made up of work incomes and capital incomes.
The work incomes (salaries, wages, benefits, emoluments and life annuities, industrial and commercial incomes, agricultural incomes, non-commercial incomes and remuneration of main managers of limited liability companies and limited partnerships and other similar income) are taxed according to the following progressive rates, after deduction of non-taxable allowances (transport, representative fees, social security contributions at rate of 3.5%, etc.):
| Work incomes (XAF\*) | Rates (%) |
| --- | --- |
| 0 to 800,000 | 0 |
| 800,001 to 6,000,000 | 10.5 |
| 6,000,001 to 7,500,00 | 15 |
| 7,5000,001 to 9,000,000 | 20 |
| 9,000,001 to 12,000,000 | 25 |
| Above 12,000,000 | 30 |
\* *Franc de la Coopération fina**ncière en Afrique* (Central African CFA) (XAF).
Kindly note that the above basis is an annual one.
The capital incomes are taxed at proportional rates as follows:
| Capital income | Rates (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Capital gains | 20 |
| Receivables, deposits and suretyship incomes | 5/25 |
| Rental incomes (for residents) | 15 |
| Rental incomes (for non-residents) | 20 |
| Dividends, incomes from shares | 5/10/20 |
Taxation is calculated by using a progressive or a proportional rate in consideration of the revenues of the taxpayer.
There is an annual calculation for the total income of the taxpayer. However, some categories of incomes may lead to withholding taxes (WHTs) during the year.

# Chad
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year in Chad is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Married taxpayers are generally required to file a joint income tax return stating their worldwide income.
Prior to 1 January of each year, each employee must deposit, by using forms provided by the tax authorities, an individual declaration of all income received during the past year.
In addition to one's salaries, the employee (and family members, if applicable) must declare all income from property, movable assets, services rendered, etc.
## Payment of taxes
Employers withhold payroll taxes from employees' salaries each month and pay the corresponding amount of tax to the Treasury.
The taxpayer must pay additional taxes if the instalment payments (WHTs on employment income or other income) are insufficient to cover the amount of tax due.
## Tax audit process
The tax audit exercise of the *Direction Générale des Impôts* (Directorate General of Taxes), Chad is completed in the following manner:
Tax officials having at least the rank of an inspector and with their professional card and a copy of the audit notice perform spot checks on the accounting documents that taxpayers are required to submit.
Accounts are audited at the head office of the enterprise or at the place of its main establishment. Where this is not possible in either of these two places, the taxpayer must expressly request that it be conducted either in the accountant’s office or in the offices of the tax authority.
The operations include confronting the accounts presented with certain facts or material to control the accuracy of returns filed and to proceed, where necessary, to the establishment of the taxes and the taxes evaded.
Any taxpayer under the PIT can be audited on the overall personal tax situation. On the occasion of this control, the administration may check the consistency between, firstly, on the reported income and, secondly, on the patrimonial situation, cash position and/or elements of the lifestyle of members of the tax household.
At least eight days before the date of the first intervention, the tax administration shall send to the taxpayer a verification notice by personally delivered registered mail with acknowledgement of receipt or discharge slip to inform the taxpayer of the date of the first intervention and the possibility of getting a tax consultant of the taxpayer's choice to assist the taxpayer. It must, under pain of rejection, be mentioned in the verification notice.
In case of postponement of the original date of the first intervention, on the initiative of the tax administration, the tax authorities must imperatively send the taxpayer a notice of correction.
The taxpayer may also request a postponement of control by writing, giving reasons for his request within 48 hours of receipt of the notice. This report must be expressly accepted by the administration.
The tax administration may conduct unannounced inspections; it then sends an audit notice personally to the taxpayer, who acknowledges receipt, at the first intervention.
Where the notice bears no indication as to the taxes, duties, or years or periods of assessment, the items to be audited shall be all the taxes owed by the taxpayer for the period still due for payment. In such case, the audit is called a 'general audit'.
However, where it is specified in the audit notice, the tax administration may limit the scope of the audit to one or more taxes due on all or part of the period still due for payment or on a group of operations over a period less than one fiscal year, in which case a spot check is done.
The verification can, nevertheless, go up to one or more years beyond the prescribed period when these exercises are in deficit, as long as the deficits made under a year are carried forward and are deducted from the profits of the non-specified first year that constitute charges.
The verification can also go up to one or more years beyond the prescribed period when these exercises show a tax credit of a VAT carried over the first statement of the non-barred period.
Where the tax service intends to extend the audit to a period or a tax that is not indicated on the initial audit notice, it shall forward another notice following the same manner and deadline laid down in Article L. 21 and seq. of the General Tax Code (GTC), indicating the new period or new tax to be audited.
Where the accounts auditing or adjustment procedure require special technical knowledge, the tax authority may hire the consultants appearing on a list drawn up by Order of the Minister of Economic and Finance. Such consultants shall be professionally liable in case of damage resulting from their work.
When the accounts are kept using computerised systems, the tax administration is empowered to require, in accordance with Article L 18 of the GTC, the technical advice from experts for carrying out tests on the hardware that hosts the operation and to check:
## Statute of limitations
According to Article L. 82 of the GTC of Chad:
"The total or partial omissions found in the tax base, the inadequacies and inaccuracies, or the taxation errors, can be repaired by the tax administration until the end of the third year following that in which the tax or fee is payable.
Furthermore, any omission or insufficiency of tax revealed by a proceeding before the criminal courts or by a contentious claim may, without prejudice to the general period of repetitions established above, be repaired until the end of the third year following the revelation of the facts".

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
The profits subject to the corporate tax are determined with sole regard to profits earned by businesses carried out or transactions conducted in Chad.
Net taxable profits are established after deduction of all charges directly entailed by the exercise of activities subject to assessment in Chad. As income from other countries is not liable to tax, foreign charges and losses are not deductible either.
The corporate tax rate is 35%.
## Tax regimes
The tax regimes applicable to companies are the normal tax regime, the simplified tax regime, and the flat tax rate regime.
The criteria used by the tax administration is the turnover. Thus, companies with a turnover that comprises between XAF 50 million and XAF 500 million are subject to the simplified tax regime and those with a turnover exceeding XAF 500 million are subject to the normal tax regime.
Taxpayers who realise an annual turnover not exceeding XAF 50 million are subject to the flat tax rate regime.
All companies subject to the normal tax regime or the simplified tax regime shall file and pay taxes monthly.
## Minimum tax
There is a minimum tax of 1.5% based on turnover.
The minimum tax shall be filed and paid monthly for companies subject to the normal tax regime or the simplified tax regime (*see above for tax regimes*).
## Local income taxes
There are no regional or local income taxes in Chad.

# Chad
## Overview
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
Chad is a landlocked country in Central Africa. It is bordered by Libya to the north, North Sudan and South Sudan to the east, the Central African Republic to the south, Cameroon and Nigeria to the southwest, and Niger to the west. Chad obtained its independence from France on 11 August 1960. It is currently divided into 23 regions, with N'Djamena as the capital. It has a presidential republic form of government. The official currency in Chad is the *Franc de la Coopération financière en Afrique* (Central African CFA) (XAF), and the official languages are French and Arabic.
More than 80% of the work force in Chad is involved in agriculture, small-scale subsistence farming, herding, and fishing.
The agriculture sector’s poor performance is likely to worsen the unfavourable economic situation. This important sector of the economy suffered from lack of rainfall in 2015, resulting in a sharp decline in cereal production of around 12% according to the government estimates. The Chadian state’s capacity to implement the public investment programmes in its economic policy is being severely challenged. The significant expenditure in 2015 on meeting the threats and violence of the terrorist sect Boko Haram and jihadist movements also affected the country’s economy till 2018.
Furthermore, since 2003, the Chadian economy has depended on the oil industry. However, in 2016, the oil industry experienced a serious slowdown due to the collapse in oil prices on the international markets that resulted in a significant reduction in the level of public investment in the extractive sector and led to a fall in domestic demand.
Inflation fell from 3.5% in 2020 to 1.0% in 2021, below the CEMAC convergence criteria.
Chad is highly dependent on foreign assistance. Its principal donors include the European Union (EU), France, and the multilateral lending agencies. Petroleum, cotton, cattle, and Arabic gum are Chad's major exports.
The fiscal balance (including grants) is expected to stand at 1.2% of GDP in 2022, before increasing further in 2023/24.
Chad is a principal and active member of the African Union (AU) and the United Nations (UN), as well as of numerous principal regional organisations, including the Community of Sahel-Saharan States (CEN-SAD), the Economic Community of Central African States (CEEAC), and the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC). In addition to these organisations, Chad also belongs to a host of other organisations, including the Organisation *Internationale Francophonie* (OIF), World Health Organization (WHO), World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), and World Trade Organization (WTO), and had been declared compliant to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in 2014.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024

Regarding incomes from securities (dividends, interest on deposits, interest on bonds, etc.), they will be taxed only in the country of distribution (i.e. no WHT in the country of payment of incomes).

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
Expenses are deductible under the following conditions:
## Depreciation
According to accountancy principles, depreciation is calculated based on the probable length of use of the asset. The straight-line system of depreciation is applicable, and rates vary according to the nature of the business activity concerned and the normal useful life of the assets involved.
From an accountancy point of view, it is possible to depreciate whatever amount corresponds to the above-mentioned principles. However, from a tax point of view, depreciation (i.e. enabling a deduction of the depreciated amount from the taxable income) is only possible under the condition that the depreciation has been entered into the statement of accounts. Therefore, only a legal entity in Chad owning the assets is able to depreciate its assets. In addition, if depreciation in the statement of accounts is higher than the depreciation authorised, the difference is not deductible and has to be reinstated in the taxable income.
The starting point for depreciation is the day of first use. If this date is not the first day of the financial year, the first year’s depreciation is reduced pro-rata.
It should be noted that, despite the above, goods that are leased are depreciated at the rate that they are paid for.
Depreciation of goods that are made available for free to managers and supervisors of the business are deductible if the corresponding benefit in kind is declared.
The sum of depreciation applied to the acquisition or creation of an asset cannot, at the end of each financial year, be less than the amount of depreciation calculated on the linear system and spread out over the normal usage period.
Depreciation in loss-making years may be carried forward to the first profitable financial year, and to subsequent years if necessary.
## Major repairs
The major repairs carried out by a company on the assets listed in the balance sheet are only deductible by way of depreciation.
## Goodwill
There are no provisions for goodwill as regards deduction of expenses.
## Start-up expenses
There are no provisions for start-up expenses.
## Interest expenses
Interest paid for the depositing of funds by a shareholder is deductible within the base rate of the central bank plus two points, calculated on the basis of the share capital.
However, interest paid to a foreign related entity is deductible up to 10% of the tax intermediary result of the Chadian debtor.
In the event that the beneficiary of these interests is located in a tax haven, the deduction is limited to 50% of the gross amount without prejudice of the application of the limitation of 10% mentioned above.
## Bad debt
Provisions for credit customers are deductible if judicial actions have been taken for the recovery of the said debt.
## Charitable contributions
Donations and liberalities are deductible within a 0.5% limit of the annual turnover, net of tax, when they are duly justified. However, a decision from the Minister of Finances is required.
## Fines and penalties
Tax and customs penalties are not deductible.
## Taxes
Income taxes are not deductible.
### Structural VAT credits
Structural VAT credits are deductible if the following conditions are met:
## Other significant items
The following expenses are not deductible:
The following expenses are not fully deductible:
## Net operating losses
Losses arising from normal business activities of the company are deductible and may be carried forward for up to three years. Carryback of losses is not permitted.
## Payments to foreign affiliates (foreign technical assistance and administrative fees)
There is a specific regulation relating to foreign general administrative and technical assistance costs, which are subject to a 10% limitation of deductibility. The scope of the 10% limitation covers study expenses, technical assistance, and other expenses, including commercial and industrial royalties and interests, paid to the head office of an enterprise established outside Chad and outside the CEMAC zone.
These costs are only deductible within 10% of the intermediary fiscal profit (accounting profits plus non-allowable charges/costs) prior to their deduction if the following conditions are met:
However, from fiscal year 2018, foreign technical assistance fees or administrative fees paid to beneficiaries located in a tax haven are deductible up to 50% of their gross amount without prejudice to the limit of 10%.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
There is a specific taxation of groups within the CEMAC area.
Where a joint stock company and a private limited company own either registered stock in a joint stock company or shares in a private limited company, the net proceeds of the share in the second company paid to the first during the financial year shall be deducted from the total net profit of the latter, less a percentage for costs and charges. This percentage is fixed at 10% of the total amount of the proceeds. This system shall apply when all of the following conditions are met:
## Transfer pricing
The Tax Code acknowledges that dependent or controlled companies may transfer benefits indirectly to their company abroad it is dependent on or to the company abroad it is controlled by.
In order to calculate the real benefit, the indirectly transferred benefits (by means of increase of purchase price or decrease of sales price to the controlling company or by any other means) are incorporated into the result established by the accounts.
If the tax administration does not have enough precise elements to determine the benefit, it will establish the taxable benefit by way of comparison to companies normally operated in Chad.
The Tax Code provides further, in accordance with CEMAC regulation, that interest paid to shareholders on sums that they lend over and above their share capital is deductible at the rate for loans allowed by the central bank increased by two percentage points. This deduction is only possible if the amounts lent do not exceed 50% of the share capital.
### Transfer pricing documentation requirements
From January 2023, Article 1000 XIV of the General Tax Code requires a category of taxpayers who are resident in Chad to submit spontaneously and annually to the tax authorities, during the filing of the fiscal and statistic declaration, a light transfer pricing documentation (LTPD) together with the full transfer pricing documentation (FTPD). The LTPD is to be filled in a form by the concerned taxpayers, while the FTPD is a documentation containing all the required information.
For 2023, both the LTPD and the FTPD must be filed by 1 May 2023 (30 April being a Sunday). However, a deadline submission extension can be granted by the tax administration without exceeding two months.
Companies concerned by the LTPD and the FTPD are enterprises registered in Chad:
By reference to the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for multinational enterprises and tax administrations, and the Circular ref 02 /MFBCP/SE/SG/DGI/ 2023, an FTPD should includen especially:
Branches and PEs are within the scope of the said requirement.
Late filing of the transfer pricing documentation is subject to fines as follows:
Lack of filing the transfer pricing documentation entails the non-deductibility of expenses relating to intra-group transactions (i.e. foreign technical assistance, management fees, royalties, interest) and the payment of fines amounting to 5% of the amount of intra-group transactions with a minimum of XAF 50 million.
Moreover, the lack of filing, late filing, and insufficiency of information required for transfer pricing documentation leads to the payment of a fine of XAF 100,000 per each piece of information not provided, each piece of missing information, and each piece of inaccurate information.
## Thin capitalisation
The thin capitalisation rules apply to companies subject to corporate tax and to advance of funds or receivables granted by shareholders.
The deductibility of interest paid to shareholders is limited by two rules:
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no provisions relating to CFCs in Chad.

Subject to international conventions, the profits realised by companies that do not have their tax residence in Chad (i.e. branches) are deemed distributed in respect of each fiscal year to the persons who do not have their tax residence in Chad and, to this effect, are subject to WHT at the rate of 20%.

## Work permits
A request to the National Office for Employment Promotion (ONAPE) for a work permit must be filed by the employer before concluding a labour contract with a foreigner.
In order to be in compliance with both the labour and immigration authorities, all expatriates working in Chad must possess the following legal documents:
The delivery of these legal documents is interconnected; therefore, their duration will not exceed a one-year period (renewal possible).
There is no need to register for tax and social security purposes since this is handled by the employer. However, it is necessary to register with the immigration services within three days after arrival in Chad.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
## Employment income
Employment income is composed of salaries, allowances, premiums, and benefits in kind received by an employee.
When an employee is a tax resident in Chad, employment income is taxable in Chad, notwithstanding instances where the employee's remunerative activities are performed outside Chad or the employer is not established in Chad.
When an employee is not a tax resident in Chad, employment income is taxable in Chad if the employee's remunerative activities are performed in Chad and the employer is established in Chad.
Benefits in kind are taxable according to their actual value. However, the benefits in kind listed below are assessed at the base or least of the corresponding rates (as a percentage of salary) or their actual value:
Pensions, in general, are exempted from PIT.
## Equity compensation
Equity compensation is not specifically addressed in Chad's General Tax Code.
## Business income
Industrial, agricultural, and other commercial income is combined with the other categories of income in order to determine the annual amount of PIT.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are taxable in Chad. Their taxation depends on the duration of the possession of the goods, and the rate depends on the nature of the goods.
### Capital gains realised during the transfer of corporate rights
The capital gains arising from the transfer of all or part of the social rights, by a partner, shareholder, dormant partner, or unit holder beneficiaries, to another person during the term of the company are subject to PIT at 20% of their sum, provided:
### Capital gain of private wealth
The following are subject to taxation of capital gains realised on private wealth:
### Method of taxation of capital gains
The taxable gain is made by the difference between the sale price and the market value of such property and the purchase price by the seller.
The sale price is less the amount paid by the seller at the time of this sale.
The purchase price is increased costs relating to the acquisition.
