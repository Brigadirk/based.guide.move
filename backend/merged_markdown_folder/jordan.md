# Jordan
## Overview
Last reviewed - 11 February 2025
Jordan is a constitutional monarchy in Western Asia, having gained independence in 1946. It is divided into 12 governorates, with Amman as its capital. Despite limited natural resources, Jordan’s economy has shown steady growth since 2003, with a projected GDP growth rate of 2.8% in 2023. The economy is primarily driven by the manufacturing and services sectors, with key exports including chemical products, clothing, and apparel. Tourism and foreign investment also play significant roles in economic growth. The Jordanian dinar is pegged to the USD, with the Central Bank of Jordan committed to maintaining monetary stability.
In line with its Economic Modernisation Vision, Jordan has introduced several reforms to attract foreign investment and promote sustainable development. A key initiative is the Investment Environment Law of 2022, which provides incentives and tax breaks for companies operating in free zones, development zones, and less developed areas. Additionally, the government has established a network of special economic, development, and free zones to position Jordan as a competitive regional hub for trade and exports. Leveraging its strategic location in the Middle East, Jordan offers investors access to key regional and international markets, making it an attractive destination for business expansion.

The tax balance is due before the end of the fourth month following the end of the tax period.
A taxpayer who is carrying out business activities and has gross income in the previous tax period exceeding JOD 1 million from these activities is required to remit two advance payments on the accrued income tax from these activities using the rates determined for each tax period mentioned in the following schedule. The advance payments are calculated according to the income tax in the financial statements presented to the income tax department for the concerned period. In the absence of the financial statements for this period, the income tax included in the immediate preceding tax declaration will be used to calculate the advance payments.
| Tax period | Rate on accrued income tax (%) |
| --- | --- |
| 2015 and following years | 40 |
The first advance payment is due within a period not exceeding 30 days from the last day of the first half of that income tax period.
The second advance payment is due within a period not exceeding 30 days from the last day of the second half of that income tax period.
### Fines and penalties
Failure to pay tax on the assigned dates according to the provisions of the tax law will result in a delay fine at a rate of 0.4% of the value of the tax due or any deductible amounts for each full or partial week of delay.
## Tax audit process
The tax audit is likely to take place within one year from the date of filing the return.
## Statute of limitations
The tax auditor may not audit a tax return after four years from the date of filing the return.
Tax authorities tend to focus on WHTs, imported goods or services, and related-party transactions.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 11 February 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year in Jordan is the calendar year. However, a taxpayer who closes one's accounts on a date other than the end of the calendar year may calculate one's tax according to the fiscal year, provided that prior approval is obtained from the Director General of the Income and Sales Tax Department.
## Tax returns
Taxpayers are obligated to file tax returns before the end of the fourth month following the end of the tax period.
Married taxpayers can file a joint tax declaration.
## Payment of tax
Taxpayers are obligated to pay income taxes before the end of the fourth month following the end of the tax period.
A taxpayer who is carrying out business activities and whose gross income in the previous tax period exceeded JOD 1 million from these activities is required to remit two advance payments on the accrued income tax from these activities using the rates determined for each tax period mentioned in the following schedule. The advance payments are calculated according to the income tax in the financial statements presented to the Income and Sales Tax Department for the concerned period. In the absence of the financial statements for this period, the income tax included in the immediately preceding tax declaration will be used to calculate the advance payments.
The first advance payment is due within a period not exceeding 30 days from the last day of the first half of that income tax period.
The second advance payment is due within a period not exceeding 30 days from the last day of the second half of that income tax period.
For the tax year 2015 and following periods, the advance payment is 40%.
## Audit cycle
The Income and Sales Tax Department is the tax authority in Jordan.
The tax authority chooses declarations to be audited according to standards and measures that the tax authority deems fit. If, after review of the tax declaration, the auditors find discrepancies, they can totally or partially reject the tax declaration and issue an audit notice asking the taxpayer to attend a session to discuss the tax declaration. An auditor must issue an audit decision within two years from the date of issuing the audit notice.
## Statute of limitations
An auditor may not audit a tax declaration after four years following the date of submitting that declaration.
One of the main focuses of the tax authority is the exemptions. Individuals are currently being asked to provide proper documentation to prove their entitlement to the exemptions.

Bad debts are deductible provided certain conditions are met.
## Charitable contributions
A person may deduct any amount paid during the tax period as a donation to any of the governmental departments, public or official institutions, or municipalities from the gross income in the period in which the payment occurred.
Any person may deduct subscriptions and donations paid in Jordan without any personal benefit for religious, charitable, humanitarian, scientific, environmental, cultural, sport, and professional purposes if the Council of Ministers approves its character. The deductible amount according to the provisions of this paragraph shall not exceed 25% of the taxable income after deducting what is provided for in the first paragraph above and before making this deduction.

The carryback of losses is not permitted.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
A resident generally may claim a deduction for royalties, management service fees, and interest charges paid to foreign affiliates, taking into account the transfer pricing regime and the applicable WHT, NC and general sales tax on imported services.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 11 February 2025
Group taxation is not permitted in Jordan.
## Transfer pricing
## Thin capitalisation
A 3:1 debt-to-equity ratio would apply in respect of related party debt (e.g. shareholder debt). No restriction should apply on unrelated party financing.
Interest (including capitalised interest) on the related party debt exceeding the 3:1 debt-to-equity ratio would not be deductible for CIT purposes.
For the purposes of the debt-to-equity ratio, equity is the higher of: (i) paid in share capital or (ii) average equity.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
In the Jordanian tax laws, there is no definition of a CFC; however, foreign-sourced income is taxed in Jordan.

## Employment income
Salaries, wages, allowances, and bonuses (in cash or in kind) received from any employment, including the estimated annual value of housing, lodging, boarding, or any other allowance, are taxable in Jordan.
The first JOD 2,500 of monthly pension salary paid by a resident person shall be exempt from income tax.
Moreover, there is an annual exemption of JOD 2,000 for people with full or partial disabilities.
## Equity compensation
Generally, income from stock options and restricted stock are subject to tax within the individual's taxable income.
## Business income
Income from professional services or activities, and any other income from business activity or investment, unless specifically exempted according to Jordan's Income Tax Law, is combined with the other categories of income in order to determine PIT through the filing of an individual income tax return.
Note that the first JOD 1 million of annual income generated from agricultural activity inside Jordan is not taxable for a natural person.
## Capital gains
Capital gains generated within the Kingdom are **exempt from tax**, except for gains realized from the sale of **depreciable assets**. Additionally, **capital gains from the first sale of shares** in certain IT companies and establishments are **exempt** for a period of up to **15 years** from the date of their registration or from **1 January 2019**, whichever is earlier.
Generally, **capital gains realized by individuals** from the sale of both **listed and non-listed shares** are subject to the **same tax treatment** as gains realized by companies on the sale of these shares.
## Dividend income
Receipt of dividends from limited liability companies, general partnerships, limited partnerships, and private and public shareholding companies that are resident in Jordan is exempt.
Dividends received by a resident person from a non-resident person are taxable in Jordan provided that they originate from money or deposits from inside Jordan.
## Interest income
Interest income is taxable and should be included in taxable income of the individual.
## Rental income
Income from leasing property—whether **movable, immovable, or intangible**—in Jordan is **taxable** and must be included in the calculation of **taxable income** of the individual.
## Exempt income
