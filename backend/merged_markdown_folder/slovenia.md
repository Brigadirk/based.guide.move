## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
## Social security contributions
In addition to PIT, individuals must pay compulsory social security contributions. Both employer and employee must contribute. Contributions are withheld by the employer at the time of payment of income. Self-employed persons must pay income tax and social security contributions themselves. The basis is the gross amount of income. The types of contributions are generally as follows:
| Type of contribution | Employee (%) | Employer (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pension and disability insurance | 15.50 | 8.85 |
| Health insurance | 6.36 | 6.56 |
| Unemployment insurance | 0.14 | 0.06 |
| Injury at work | 0.00 | 0.53 |
| Parental insurance | 0.10 | 0.10 |
| **Total** | 22.10 | 16.10 |
Payers of tax are obligated to pay social security contributions on the day of payment of wages or salaries.
In addition to the social security contributions stated above, individuals also pay compulsory health contribution of EUR 35 per month (effective from January 2024).
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
A basic VAT rate of 22% applies to all taxable supplies. A lower VAT rate of 9.5% applies to certain supplies.
## Special tax for work contracts
The payer is obligated to pay a special tax at a rate of 25% of the gross amount payable to individuals who are working for the payer (legal entity or natural person) on the basis of single work or service contract. The tax payment should be made within thirty days of the income payment to the individuals.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
Taxable profits are assessed in accordance with Slovenian Accounting Standards 2016 or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and modified for certain revenues and certain expenses, which are partly or wholly tax non-deductible.
## Inventory valuation
Slovenian law allows the application of all the most commonly used inventory valuation methods, including the first in first out (FIFO), weighted average cost, and floating average prices methods.
## Capital gains
Under certain circumstances, the gains made by a Slovenian taxpayer on the disposal of an equity shareholding are effectively 47.5% exempt from taxation. Similarly, 50% of a loss arising on the disposal of such a shareholding would not be deductible for CIT. This treatment applies to the disposal of shareholdings of at least 8% that have been held for at least six months and where the taxpayer disposing of the holding employed at least one person during the six-month holding period.
The above treatment is not available for the disposal of a shareholding of a company that is resident in a country that:
## Dividend income
Dividends and similar income received by a Slovenian taxpayer are generally 95% exempt from taxation as long as the distributor was subject to Slovenian CIT or to a comparable profits tax. The exceptions to this are where dividends represent untaxed reserves of the distributor or where the distributor is tax resident in a country that:
## Interest income
Interest and similar income received by a Slovenian taxpayer is included in the taxable base and can, in principle, reduce tax liability in the amount of withholding tax (WHT) paid abroad. Interest between related parties needs to be calculated in accordance with the arm’s-length principle.
## Royalty income
Royalties and similar income received by a Slovenian taxpayer are included in the taxable base and can, in principle, reduce tax liability in the amount of WHT paid abroad.
## Foreign income
Foreign income, except dividends, received by a Slovenian entity from foreign sources is included in taxable income for CIT purposes in the same tax year as it arises unless the applicable DTT provides for an exemption.

## Overview
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
Slovenia, a country in Central Europe with a small coastline along the Adriatic Sea, is bordered by Italy to the west, Croatia to the south, Hungary to the east, and Austria to the north. It is subdivided into 212 municipalities, with Ljubljana as the capital. The official language of Slovenia is Slovene, and the currency is the euro (EUR).
Slovenia was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until its dissolution at the end of World War I. In 1918, the Slovenes joined the Serbs and Croats in forming the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, which was then named the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. After World War II, Slovenia became a republic of the renewed Yugoslavia, which broke away from the Soviet Union in 1948 and subsequently operated under a milder form of socialism. The Slovenes succeeded in establishing their independence in 1991 after a short ten-day war.
Historical ties to Western Europe, a strong economy, and a stable democracy have assisted in Slovenia's transformation to a modern state. Slovenia acceded to both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU) in the spring of 2004. In July 2010, Slovenia signed the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) convention and became a member of the OECD.
Slovenia became the first 2004 EU entrant to adopt the euro as its currency (on 1 January 2007) and has become a model of economic success and stability for the region. Slovenia has excellent infrastructure, a well-educated work force, and a strategic location between the Balkans and Western Europe.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
In Slovenia, tax must be calculated and withheld on the payments made by residents and non-residents on Slovenian-sourced income to recipients outside Slovenia.
Payments to which the WHT rules apply include payments for dividends, interest, copyrights, patents, licences, leases on real estate situated in Slovenia, services of performing artists, and services charged from low-tax jurisdictions.
The WHT rate is 15%.
If a DTT exists, the WHT rate may be reduced in line with the provisions of the treaty. Similarly for payments of interest, royalties, and dividends within Europe, the Interest and Royalties Directive and the Parent Subsidiary Directive, respectively, may also reduce this WHT rate to zero.
Furthermore, WHT is not deducted on dividends paid to a parent company in another EU member state if those dividends are subject to an exemption from tax in the hands of the recipient, provided certain conditions are met.
Subject to certain conditions, tax is not required to be withheld on interest on non-exchangeable debt securities issued outside Slovenia by a Slovenian tax resident corporation through a public placement on an international clearing system (i.e. Euroclear).
WHT is applicable only for explicitly determined types of services (i.e. consulting, marketing, staffing, administration, information, and legal services), provided they were made to countries with an average CIT rate not exceeding 12.5%, where such a country was also stated on a separate list published by the Ministry of Finance.

Notes
1. Under certain treaties, the WHT rate depends on whether, and to what extent, the recipient participates in the capital of the distributor. Generally, if the recipient holds a participation of more than 25% in the distributing company, the dividends are subject to a lower 5% WHT rate. The higher WHT rate is, however, normally due when the participation is less than 25%.
2. Some DTTs include specific provisions whereby interest payments are subject to a 0% WHT rate if certain conditions are met.
3. Ratified international treaties that are not yet in force and are not used in Slovenia.
4. 5% rate if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) that directly holds at least 10% of the capital of the company paying the dividend; 10% rate if the beneficial owner is a company that directly holds at least 10% of the capital of the company paying the dividends and the dividends are paid out of profits which by virtue of the law of the state in which the payer is a resident are exempt from company tax or subject to company tax at a rate that is lower than the normal rate in that state; 15% rate applicable in all other cases.
5. 5% rate applicable to the gross amount of: (i) royalties paid for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic, or scientific work (but not including cinematograph films) and (ii) royalties paid for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment, 10% rate applicable in all other cases.
6. 5% rate applicable to royalties for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic, or scientific work, including cinematograph films or films or tapes used for radio or television broadcasting; 10% rate applicable to royalties for the use of, or the right to use, any patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment, or for information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific experience.
7. 10% rate applicable to royalties for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary or artistic work including motion pictures, live broadcasting, film, tape, or other means of the use or reproduction in connection with radio and television broadcasting, and for the use of, or the right to use industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment; 15% rate applicable to royalties in all other cases.
8. 5% rate applicable to copyright, as defined by the Copyright and Related Rights Act; 10% rate applicable to other property rights.
9. 10% rate applicable to the gross amount of interest if received by a financial institution (including an insurance company); 15% rate applicable to the gross amount of interest in all other situations.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
A resident is obligated to pay PIT from all income, sourced both in and outside of Slovenia (principle of worldwide taxation).
A non-resident is obligated to pay PIT from all income sourced in Slovenia.
## Personal income tax rates
PIT is calculated considering five tax brackets. The tax brackets are determined for one year in advance. In 2025, the following tax brackets and tax rates are applicable in line with the recent amendments of the PIT Act.
| Taxable base (EUR) | | Tax on column 1 (EUR) | Tax on excess (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over (column 1) | Not over |
| 0 | 9,210.26 | 0 | 16 |
| 9,210.26 | 27,089.00 | 1,473.64 | 26 |
| 27,089.00 | 54,178.00 | 6,122.11 | 33 |
| 54,178.00 | 78,016.32 | 15,061.48 | 39 |
| 78,016.32 | and above | 24,358.43 | 50 |
Note that capital gains, interest, dividends, and rental income are taxed at a flat rate of 25%. The tax rate on capital gains is decreased according to the length of the holding period. *See the [Income determination](slovenia/individual/income-determination.html) section for more information*.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year in Slovenia is the calendar year.
## Tax returns and payment
### Annual tax return
Employment income, income from business activity, income from agriculture and forestry, transfer of property rights, and other income must be included in the annual tax return. In addition, all compulsory contributions and advance tax payments made during the tax year must also be reported.
The Slovene tax authority issues a preliminary tax calculation by end of March or end of May for the previous tax year. A taxpayer may file an objection against the preliminary tax calculation within 30 days after its dispatch. If the taxpayer does not object to the preliminary tax calculation within the prescribed deadline, the preliminary tax calculation is considered as annual PIT assessment. If a taxpayer does not receive a preliminary tax calculation by 15 June for the previous tax year, the taxpayer has to submit an annual tax return by 31 July for the previous tax year.
The difference between the total tax payable and the total amount of advance tax payments made during the year must be paid or refunded within 30 days after receipt of the tax assessment.
### Income from capital
Income from capital (i.e. dividends, interest, capital gain) and rental income is taxed separately and is not included in the annual tax return.
Income from interest and dividends received from abroad has to be declared by 28 February for the previous calendar year. The income tax paid is considered as final tax.
Income from interest on monetary deposits with banks or savings banks registered in Slovenia or the European Union should be declared by 28 February for the previous calendar year if the total interest exceeds EUR 1,000. The income tax paid is considered as final tax.
Income from capital gains has to be declared by 28 February for the previous calendar year. Capital gain derived from disposal of real estate shall be declared within 15 days from disposal of real estate. The income tax paid is considered as final tax.
Rental income should be declared by 28 February for the previous calendar year. The income tax paid is considered as final tax.
### Income from business activity
The tax return for income from business activities should be submitted by 31 March for the previous calendar year.
### Income from agriculture and forestry
The tax return for income from agriculture and forestry should be submitted by 31 March for the previous calendar year.
### Prepayment tax returns
In case the employment income is paid by a person who is not considered as a payer of tax in Slovenia, the recipient of the income should declare the income to the tax authority by the 15th day in the month for the previous month. A non-resident should declare the employment income within 15 days after receipt of the income.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The Slovenian VAT Act is in line with Directive 2006/112/EC.
A standard VAT rate of 22% applies to all taxed supplies.
A reduced VAT rate of 9.5% generally applies to foodstuffs, live animals, seeds, plants, water supplies, medicines, medical equipment, transport of passengers, books, admission fees, royalties for writers and performers, certain works of art, certain residential properties, renovation of residential properties, cleaning of residential properties, hotel accommodation, use of sport facilities, burial and cremation services, public hygiene services, minor repairs of bicycles, shoes and clothing, domestic care services, hairdressing services, and supply of flowers. From January 2025, the lower 9.5% VAT rate increases to a general 22% VAT rate for drinks with added sugar or sweeteners.
Slovenia has implemented the provisions on VAT groups, which will come into effect on 1 January 2026.
The threshold for VAT registration is EUR 50,000, which will increase to EUR 60,000 from 1 January 2025 and does not apply to foreign taxable persons. Non-EU companies must appoint a fiscal representative.
A VAT return must be submitted for each tax period separately, as well as in case of no transactions. The deadline for submitting the VAT return is the last business day of the month following the end of the tax period. In cases of intra-EU supplies of goods and EU business-to-business (B2B) reverse-charge services, the VAT return is due by the 20th day of the month. In the latter case, the Recapitulative Statement also needs to be submitted. All forms are submitted electronically.
From 1 January 2025, the mandatory monthly electronic submission of VAT ledgers of issued and received invoices to the tax authorities will come into effect.
The payment of the VAT liability is due by the last working day of the month. In case of VAT surplus, the tax authorities refund it to the bank account of the taxable person within 21 days after the date of the submission of the form.
From 1 January 2025, the period for carrying forward VAT surpluses to the next tax period and for submitting claims for VAT surpluses to a period of five years from the submission of the VAT return will be limited. The five-year limit applies only to VAT surpluses established by VAT returns for tax periods from 1 January 2025. For all existing VAT surpluses arising in tax periods before 1 January 2025, a limit is set for carrying forward surpluses and submitting claims for VAT refunds until 31 December 2030.
Based on the Slovenian VAT Act, the following categories do not allow input VAT deduction:
The person liable to pay the VAT is generally the supplier, or, in certain cases, the recipient (reverse-charge mechanism). Slovenia implemented Art 194 of the VAT Directive in 2022, which means that foreign taxable persons do not need to get VAT-registered in case of performing taxable B2B activity in Slovenia.
Domestic reverse charge applies for construction work (including repair, cleaning, maintenance, alteration, and demolition services in relation to immovable property), supply of staff involved in the performance of these activities, supply of certain immovable property where the taxation option was exercised, supply of waste, residues, and used material and services, and transfer of greenhouse gas emission rights as defined by the act governing the protection of the environment.
On 1 January 2024, the implementation of the CESOP Directive (Central Electronic System of Payment Information) into Slovene tax legislation entered into force.
## Customs duties
For purposes of communication with the customs offices, each person has to be identified by an Economic Operator Registration and Identification (EORI) Number, which is registered by the customs authorities on request. EORI registration is mandatory for customs clearance.
Import VAT is charged based on customs declaration at the time of the import. However, if certain conditions are met, taxpayers are able to pay the import VAT through the VAT return at the end of the month. Accordingly, the importers are not forced to finance their import VAT, as they are able to account for it and deduct it in the same VAT return.
## Excise tax
Excise tax is charged on the release into free tax circulation or import of tobacco products, alcohol and alcoholic drinks, fuel and mineral oils, and electricity. The table below presents the valid rates of excise tax.
| Product | Excise tax rate |
| --- | --- |
| Cigarettes | From EUR 78.947 per 1,000 pieces. In case the retail price of a pack of 20 cigarettes amounts to less than EUR 3.76, the excise tax is a minimum of EUR 120 per 1,000 pieces |
| Beer | EUR 12.10 per 1 volume % alcohol in 1 hl |
| Alcohol drinks (except wine) | EUR 132 per 1 hl |
| Ethyl alcohol | EUR 1,320 per 100 volume % alcohol in 1 hl |
| Unleaded petrol | EUR 507.80 per 1,000 l |
| Natural gas | EUR 1.71 per m3 for heating purposes and EUR 0 per m3 for propelling purposes |
| Heating oil | EUR 15.02 per 1,000 kg |
| Electricity | EUR 3.05 per 1 MWh Usage of more than 10,000 MWh per year: EUR 1.80 per 1 MWh |
## Property tax
Currently, there is no specific tax levied on immovable property in Slovenia. However, charge for the use of building land is levied on vacant and constructed building land in possession of legal persons and individuals. Charge is set by local communities for vacant building land based on the area of the building land planned for building, and for constructed building land based on the useful area of the residential house or business premises thereon.
## Real estate transfer tax
Real estate transfer tax of 2% is charged on real estate transfers and financial leases of real estate, unless VAT has been charged on the transaction.
## Stamp tax
There is no stamp duty in Slovenia.
## Payroll taxes
## Social security contributions
Both employer and employee must make social security contributions. Contributions are withheld by the Slovene employer at the payment of income. The basis for calculation of the social security contributions is the gross amount of income. The types of contributions are as follows:
| Type of contribution | Employee (%) | Employer (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pension and disability insurance | 15.50 | 8.85 |
| Health insurance | 6.36 | 6.56 |
| Unemployment insurance | 0.14 | 0.06 |
| Injury at work | 0 | 0.53 |
| Parental insurance | 0.10 | 0.10 |
| **Totals** | **22.10** | **16.10** |
## Financial services tax
Slovenia levies tax on financial services provided by banks and other financial institutions. The tax rate is 8.5% and is applied to the fee of the financial service.
## Insurance premium tax
Insurance premium tax is levied on insurance premiums at the rate of 8.5% and paid by insurance companies, unless the insurance lasts for at least ten years.
## Environmental tax
Environmental tax is charged on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, waste disposal, lubricating oils and fluids, used tyres, and used motor vehicles.
## Motor vehicle tax
Motor vehicle tax applies to all vehicles that are registered for the first time in Slovenia. The taxpayer is the person that acquires the vehicle from abroad. The tax amount depends on the type of motor vehicle (tariff code), type of fuel, CO2 emission, engine power, and EURO emission standard.
## Water vessel tax
The existing water vessel tax is imposed on:
The tax is as follows:
| Class of vessel length (in metres) | | General part of tax liability (in EUR) | The liability per metre of length (in EUR) | The liability per kilowatt propulsion power (in EUR) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Above | To |
| 5 | 8 | 10.00 | 2.50 | 0.50 |
| 8 | 12 | 15.00 | 3.00 | 1.00 |
| 12 |  | 20.00 | 3.50 | 2.00 |
In addition to the water vessel tax described above, the government levies the following additional tax on water vessels:
| Class of vessel length (in metres) | | General part of tax liability (in EUR) | The liability per metre of length (in EUR) | The liability per kilowatt propulsion power (in EUR) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Above | To |
| 5 | 8 | 2.00 | 0.50 | 0.10 |
| 8 | 12 | 10.00 | 2.00 | 1.00 |
| 12 |  | 20.00 | 3.50 | 2.00 |
The tax liability decreases by 5% per each year of age of the vessel. The tax cannot, however, be lower than 50% of the tax liability calculated for a new vessel.

# Slovenia
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax period should be the calendar year. However, a tax period may differ from the calendar year but may not exceed a period of 12 months. In this case, the tax authorities must be informed about the chosen tax period, and the taxable entity will not be allowed to change its tax period for the following three years.
## Tax returns
A tax return must be submitted to the tax authorities by the end of the third month following the end of the tax year.
## Payment of tax
CIT is paid in advance in monthly instalments (if the amount of prepayment exceeds EUR 400 per month) or in quarterly instalments (if the amount of prepayment is less than EUR 400 per month) determined on the basis of the previous year’s assessment.
The final CIT payment must be made within 30 days of the tax return submission.
## Tax audit process
Slovene legislation does not define an audit cycle. However, we understand that the Slovene tax administration has its own criteria for how to determine audit targets, which is in accordance with their annual tax plan.
## Statute of limitations
Under Slovene legislation, a tax inspection may be initiated within five years from the date when a tax return was due for submission to the tax authorities. However, the five-year period runs following each interrupting act (generally, certain actions by the Tax Office or the taxpayer within the tax period may be considered as interrupting acts), but may not surpass a maximum of ten years counting from the date when the tax return is due. A concluded tax inspection will foreclose any further tax authorities’ inspection only for the period and the items that were subject of the concluded tax inspection. Any issue not examined remains open for a future tax inspection. The right of the tax authorities to assess and collect tax permanently expires after ten years counted from the date when the tax return is due.
## Fiscal verification of invoices
According to the Act on Fiscal Verification of Invoices, all legal and natural persons that perform cash transactions and are obligated to keep books and records must use certified tax registers. No exceptions are envisaged, so electronic confirmation of invoices applies to anyone that is obligated to use receipts in accordance with the VAT Act. Certified cash registers are connected to the central information system of the financial authority via the Internet, so processed invoices are verified and saved in real time.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
Slovenian tax residents are liable to pay corporate income tax (CIT) on their worldwide income. Slovenian tax non-residents are taxed only on income from sources in Slovenia, including income earned through permanent establishments (PEs) in Slovenia.
Due to the floods causing highly material damage to Slovenian infrastructure in August 2023, the Slovene government passed a Law on reconstruction, development, and the provision of financial resources to finance the reconstruction of the infrastructure. One of the provisions of the Law is also an increase in the CIT rate to 22% (from 19%) for years 2024 to 2028. Thus, the prepayments made in FY24 shall be calculated based on the newly adopted CIT rate of 22%.
Non-profit taxpayers and charitable organisations, associations, foundations, etc. are exempt from CIT on their non-profit-making activities.
Investment funds, as well as pension funds and pension insurance companies, may be taxed at a rate of 0% if certain conditions are met.
## Tonnage tax
A company may request to be subject to tonnage tax instead of CIT if it meets certain conditions (i.e. it operates in maritime transport in international shipping) and notifies the tax authorities in advance.
The tax base for tonnage tax is the sum of the tax bases for each of an entity’s ships that are included in the tonnage tax regime. The tax base for a particular ship is calculated by multiplying the number of ship operating days by the daily tax base shown in the following table:
| Net tonnage (NT) | EUR/day for 100 net tonnes |
| --- | --- |
| For the first 1,000 tonnes | 0.90 |
| For the next 1,001 to 10,000 tonnes | 0.67 |
| For the next 10,001 to 25,000 tonnes | 0.40 |
| Above 25,001 tonnes | 0.20 |
## Local income taxes
There are no municipal or local taxes on income in Slovenia.

Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
## Limitation of recognised interest
On 14 November 2024, the National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia adopted the Act on Amendments to the Corporate Income Tax Act (hereinafter referred to as 'ZDDPO-2U'). The amended provisions will apply to all tax periods from 1 January 2025.
Since the introduction of the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rule as part of the implementation of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD Directive), two rules on limiting the recognition of interest have existed in Slovenian tax legislation at the same time: the so-called thin capitalisation and the EBITDA rule. The amendment to the ZDDPO-2U completely abolishes the thin capitalisation rule set out in Article 32 of the ZDDPO-2. As a result, loan amounts exceeding four times the book value of capital will no longer be considered as excess loans. Interest attributed to the excess loans referred to in Article 32 will be tax deductible from the tax period 2025 onwards. The recently implemented EBITDA rule is also being changed, namely the absolute threshold for the recognition of excess borrowing costs is being raised from 1 million to 3 million euros (EUR). The change will thus unify the absolute threshold with that set out in the directive.
## Directive (EU) 2022/2523 - Pillar II
In 2022, the Council of the European Union (EU) adopted Council Directive (EU) 2022/2523 on ensuring a global minimum tax rate for international corporate groups and large domestic groups in the Union (the so-called ‘Pillar II Directive’).
In December 2023, Slovenia adopted a new Minimum Tax Law, which transposes this Directive, ensuring global minimum taxation into Slovene national law and will apply to fiscal years beginning on or after 31 December 2023. The newly adopted Law generally applies to multinational and large domestic groups that exceed a threshold of EUR 750 million in revenue on a consolidated basis and will impose a new, highly complex administrative burden to groups in scope in efforts to ensure a minimal tax rate of 15%.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
A legal entity is considered to be a Slovenian tax resident if the entity has its statutory (registered) seat or place of effective management located in Slovenia. These conditions, however, do not exclude a society or any association of persons, including an association under civil or foreign law that does not have legal identity, from also being considered to be a Slovene tax resident.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The Slovene definition of a PE is generally in line with the definition set out in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) model tax treaty. Thus, it is a place of business in Slovenia in or through which the non-resident’s activities are conducted in whole or in part. The following, in particular, are considered to constitute a PE:
A place of business is not considered a non-resident’s PE if the non-resident:
Please note that with the ratification of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (MLI), certain PE provisions of Double Tax Treaties (DTTs) that Slovenia has in place with other countries could be affected from July 2018 onwards.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
In general, business expenses that are necessary to generate taxable revenues are fully tax deductible.
## Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation of tangible fixed assets, amortisation of intangible assets, and depreciation of investment property are recognised as expenditures in line with the accounting treatment, up to a maximum of the amount calculated using the straight-line depreciation method and the maximum tax depreciation rates listed below. Any accounting depreciation in excess of these rates is not tax deductible in the period concerned but may be deductible in subsequent tax periods until the asset is fully depreciated or disposed of.
The maximum annual depreciation rates are as follows:
| Depreciation category | Types of assets | Annual depreciation rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Buildings, including investment property | 3 |
| 2 | Parts of buildings, including investment property | 6 |
| 3 | Equipment, vehicles, and machinery | 20 |
| 5 | Computer equipment, hardware, and software | 50 |
| 6 | Crops lasting several years | 10 |
| 7 | Breeding animals | 20 |
| 8 | Other fixed assets | 10 |
As of 1 January 2020, depreciation rates for operating leasing, regardless of above-mentioned rates, shall be determined in accordance with the actual depreciation period of the tangible asset.
## Goodwill
In general, if goodwill is impaired for accounting purposes, then the impairment cost may be treated as tax deductible. The amount that may be treated as tax deductible in any tax period is limited to 20% of the initial value of the goodwill.
However, based on the amendments of the CIT Act, recognition of expenses from the amortisation of goodwill are, as of 1 January 2017 onwards, considered as non-deductible expenses.
## Start-up expenses
In accordance with Slovene legislation, costs that occur prior to the entry of a legal entity into the court register may not be treated as tax deductible. Such a principle arises from a common legal principle whereby an entity may be subject to rights and obligations only after its establishment date. The date of entry into the court register is deemed to be the date of the establishment.
## Related-party interest
Companies may deduct interest expense on loans from their owners or other associated parties up to a maximum of the amount calculated by using the prescribed interest rate published by the Ministry of Finance. Taxpayers must increase taxable profits by the amount of any excess interest expense unless they can prove that they could have received the loan on comparable terms from an unrelated party.
## Provisions
Certain provisions are only 50% tax deductible when accrued, with the remaining 50% being treated as tax deductible when the provision is utilised. The provisions that are subject to this treatment are provisions for warranties granted when selling products or providing services, reorganisations/redundancies, anticipated losses from onerous contracts, pensions, long-service bonuses, and severance payments on retirement.
From 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2026, provisions for pensions, jubilee awards, and severance pay upon retirement shall be 100% tax deductible when formed for each individual tax period.
## Bad debt
Bad debt provisions are only tax deductible if the amount does not exceed the lower of:
In order to take advantage of this deduction, a company must be able to calculate amounts for both tests and then take the lower of the two amounts so calculated. If the company is not able to determine the amount for either, the cost of the bad debt provision is not tax deductible until the provision is utilised.
Costs of bad debts are tax deductible when the debt is finally written-off, provided there is a finalised court procedure, the creditor can demonstrate that it would cost more to pursue the debtor than the debt is worth, or the creditor can demonstrate that it has done everything required by good business practice to try to recover the debt.
## Charitable contributions
A taxpayer may claim a reduction of its taxable profits for donations made for humanitarian, disabled, charitable, scientific, educational, medical, sports, cultural, ecological, and religious purposes to residents of Slovenia or of EU or European Economic Area (EEA) member states, up to 1% of the taxable person’s taxable revenues. An additional allowance of 0.2% of the taxpayers’ taxable revenue is available for payments made for cultural and sport purposes and to voluntary organisations that work for the public interest to protect the public from natural and other disasters.
## Compensation
Salaries and other payments relating to employment (e.g. wage compensation, holiday allowances, employer’s social security contributions, long-service awards, severance benefits paid upon retirement, solidarity assistance, reimbursement of business-related expenses) are generally fully tax deductible.
The costs of benefits in kind are also tax deductible if such benefits are taxed for the individual under the PIT Act.
## Pension allowances
Under certain conditions, a tax-deductible allowance for voluntary supplementary pension insurance may apply, of up to 24% of compulsory contributions for pension and disability insurance for insured employees, but may not exceed EUR 2,390 annually per employee. This amount is reconciled each year and amounts to EUR 2,903.66 for the year 2024. Moreover, the utilisation of the allowance is limited to the tax base of the tax period.
## Fines and penalties
Costs relating to compulsory collection of taxes and other levies are, in accordance with Slovene legislation, tax non-deductible.
## Taxes
Taxes paid by a shareholder as a natural person and VAT that was not deducted as an input VAT, even though there was a right to deduct, are not tax deductible. In addition, interests on late payment of taxes are not tax deductible.
## Other significant items
The following expenses are considered unnecessary for the generation of taxable revenues and are not deductible for tax purposes:
Some of the most common non-deductible expenses include:
## Net operating losses
The use of retained tax losses is limited to a maximum of 63% of the actual tax base.
The amendment to the ZDDPO-2U introduces a time limit on the coverage of past tax losses, which could previously be carried forward indefinitely. With the tax period starting on or after 1 January 2025, taxpayers will be able to reduce their tax base by covering past tax losses in the following five tax periods after the period in which they occurred. Based on the transitional provision, taxpayers will be able to claim tax losses incurred before the entry into force of the ZDDPO-2U ('old losses') in the following five tax periods.
Loss relief may not exceed the amount of current taxable income. Generally, losses that are generated in multiple tax years are absorbed chronologically. The right to carry losses forward may be forfeited if the ownership of the capital or voting power of the taxpayer claiming the loss carryforward changes by more than 50% within the tax period and the taxpayer either has not performed business activities for two years prior to the change of ownership or substantially changes its business activity two years prior to or after the change in ownership.
Treatment of tax losses mentioned in the preceding paragraph does not apply for those losses that are generated in the year of the change of ownership or prior tax periods.
## Payment to foreign affiliates
Payments to foreign affiliates are normally subject to WHT if there is no right to apply exemptions in accordance with Slovenian legislation or DTT. Payments similar to dividends, including disguised distribution of profit, are not tax deductible. Any other payments to foreign affiliates are tax deductible if they are made in accordance with the arm’s-length principle.

# Slovenia
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
Group tax returns were abolished with the introduction of the CIT Act on 1 January 2007.
## Transfer pricing
Prices between a Slovenian entity and its related parties must be set, for tax purposes, at fair market value using the arm’s-length principle. Broadly speaking, taxpayers are related by direct, indirect, or common shareholdings of over 25%; through a participation in management; or by control through other means, including through contractual terms.
For transactions between two related Slovenian tax residents, provided neither is in an ‘advantaged’ position (advantaged usually means having unutilised tax losses), there is no actual requirement for the companies to adjust their tax returns to reflect an arm’s-length price.
Taxable persons must prepare transfer pricing documentation. The Slovenian rules regarding such documentation follow the EU Code of Conduct on transfer pricing documentation for associated enterprises in the EU (EU TPD).
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
From January 2017 onwards, provisions of the Slovene Tax Procedure Act are in force imposing a CbC reporting obligation on the multinational enterprises with annual consolidated group revenue equal to or exceeding EUR 750 million. The first submission of CbC reporting was thus required for the financial year 2017, whereas the deadline for the submission of CbC reporting was within 12 months after the end of financial year (i.e. 31 December 2017).
## Thin capitalisation
There is no thin capitalisation rule in Slovenia. It was abolished as of 1 January 2025.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
CFC rules cover transactions between Slovene companies and related entities that are not taxed under CIT Act-2 and in which the Slovene company by itself, or together with associated enterprises, holds direct or indirect participation of more than 50% of the voting rights, directly or indirectly owns more than 50% of capital, or is entitled to receive more than 50% of the profits of that entity. Such related entity shall be considered a CFC in case the actual CIT paid by the related entity is lower than half the CIT that the entity would be required to pay based on the valid CIT system in Slovenia for such income. Income that falls under the scope of a CFC is so-called passive income, such as interest or other income from financial assets, property rights, or other income arising from intellectual property, dividends, and income from the disposal of shares, income from financial leasing, etc. This shall, however, generally not apply if it is clear from the facts and circumstances that the CFC carries on an economic activity for which it has personnel, equipment, assets, and premises available. Notwithstanding that, if the jurisdiction is included in the list of jurisdictions that do not participate for tax purposes for a minimum of three months in the taxpayer's tax period, the taxpayer's tax base shall be increased with the undivided income of the CFC.
## Exit taxation
As of 1 January 2020, implemented provisions of exit taxation to the Slovene tax legislation were put into effect. Exit taxation for cross-border situations is determining when the taxpayer is ought to disclose the hidden reserves for the transferred assets and to include the relevant value in the tax base. The purpose in this regard is to tax the value of possible capital gain that was created in Slovenia when that gain itself had not yet been realised at the time of the exit. The CIT Act defines 'hidden reserves' as the difference between fair and tax value of the transferred assets at the time of the transaction. 'Fair value' is defined as a market value unlike tax value, which represents the amount determined for the relevant asset in the CIT return. If the difference between fair and tax value is negative, hidden reserves shall be deemed as equal to zero. The CIT Act also defines the criteria when and how a taxpayer that is required to include hidden reserves in one's taxable base is eligible to exercise the tax deferral. Particularly, Slovene domestic legislation entitles a taxpayer, if the required conditions are met, to a five-year deferred tax payment.
## Hybrid Mismatch Rules
As of 1 January 2020, implemented provisions of Hybrid Mismatch Rules to the Slovene tax legislation have come into effect. Hybrid mismatches arise from interaction between legal systems and, in practice, result in a situation of double deduction, deduction of income in a country without inclusion in the taxable base of another, or non-taxation of the income in a country that is not included in the taxable base of another. A particularity of the hybrid mismatch section of the CIT Act is that the related entities are not defined as in other sections of the CIT Act. Thus, the relevant entities for the purpose of Hybrid Mismatch Rules are defined as the participation of more than 50% (instead of the common participation of 25%).
Additionally, as of 1 January 2022, the new provision of reverse-hybrid mismatch stipulates that if one or more non-resident entities that together (in)directly participate in at least 50% of voting rights, capital shares, or profit-sharing rights in a hybrid entity in Slovenia and the hybrid entity is located in a jurisdiction that treats the hybrid entity as a taxable person, the hybrid entity shall be treated as a resident of Slovenia and taxed accordingly (provided such income is not otherwise taxable according to Slovene or other tax legislation).

# Slovenia
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
If a branch meets the conditions, as set out in the tax legislation and relevant DTT, to be treated as a PE, then it will be liable to pay tax in Slovenia on profits that are attributable to the PE.
The profit that is attributed to a PE is determined broadly in line with OECD principles. Generally, the attributable profit is the profit that would be expected to be earned by the PE if it were an independent taxpayer performing the same or similar activities and/or businesses.
A branch whose activities do not create a PE is not subject to CIT in Slovenia.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
## Foreign tax credit
Tax paid abroad can be credited against tax liability in Slovenia. The amount of tax that can be credited is the amount of final and actually paid tax. If there is a DTT made between countries in question, the amount of tax that can be credited is the amount calculated at the rate determined in the DTT. A taxpayer needs to provide proof of the amount of foreign tax, the basis for calculation of the tax, and the amount of the tax paid.
## Investment allowances
The tax allowance for investment in equipment and intangible assets is limited to 40% of the value of the assets (also intangibles) invested into and can be utilised up to a maximum of 63% of the actual tax base.
### Investment allowances for investing in digital transformation and green transition
As of 1 January 2022, the new tax allowances shall be recognised at 40% amount of the investment in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, big data, environmentally friendly technologies, cleaner, cheaper public and private transport, decarbonisation of the energy sector, energy efficiency of buildings, and implementing of other standards for climate neutrality. These investment allowances can be utilised up to a maximum of 63% of the actual tax base.
A 100% investment allowance is granted for investments in R&D within the tax period, regardless of the location of establishment of the company within Slovenia. The investment can be utilised up to a maximum of 63% of the actual tax base. Such an investment tax allowance may be obtained for expenditures on:
## Allowances for employing certain individuals
A taxpayer that employs trainees or students to undertake practical work may reduce its taxable profits by an additional 80% of the average monthly payment paid to such persons for every month the person carries out the work.
A taxpayer that employs disabled persons may decrease its taxable profits by an additional 50% of the salary paid to such persons (in addition to the deduction for their actual salary cost). A taxpayer that employs a severely disabled person or a person with a combination of total hearing loss and speech impairment may reduce its taxable base by an additional 70% of the salary paid to such a person (in addition to the deduction for their actual salary cost).
As of 1 January 2022, a new tax allowance shall be recognised for employing a person in the deficit occupations in the amount of 45% of the salary paid to such a person. Another higher tax allowance in the amount of 55% shall be recognised for employing of young people who are first-time job seekers.
## Tax relief for employment of hard-to-place workers
A taxpayer who employs a hard-to-place worker may be able to benefit from a tax allowance for both CIT and tax on activity. A hard-to-place worker is a person younger than 29 or older than 55 who has been registered as unemployed for at least six months and who has not been employed by the taxpayer or a related party in the past 24 months. The tax allowance equates to 45% of the salary paid to the person during the first 24 months of their employment, up to the amount of the tax base.

# Slovenia
## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
## State aid
As the EU Treaty, relevant EU Regulations and Directives, and EU Court case law are of direct application in Slovenia, Slovene courts follow the same policy as reflected in the noted documents and case law. Thus, state aid in Slovenia is defined as an advantage in any form whatsoever conferred on a selective basis to undertakings by national public authorities and causing distortion of the competition.
## Multilateral Convention (MLI)
With the ratification of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (MLI) in mid-March 2018, certain provisions of DTTs that Slovenia has in place will be affected. In addition to the minimum standards on treaty abuse (Articles 6 and 7 of MLI), Slovenia also adopted changes to dividend transfer transactions, threshold for PE, arbitration, etc.
In November 2019, the Slovene Tax Authorities issued an explanation regarding international taxation and the application of international DTTs, which serves as guidance in relevant cases.
## Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS)
The transfer pricing landscape of Slovenia remains relatively unchanged but is nonetheless dependent on the updated or added guidance published by the OECD as a result of the BEPS action plan. It can be anticipated that the changes due to the BEPS project will also have an appropriate impact on the transfer pricing environment, legislation, and practices in Slovenia.
## United States (US) Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
On 2 June 2014, the Republic of Slovenia concluded an Agreement to Improve International Tax Compliance and to implement FATCA (the Agreement) with the United States that entered into force on 1 July 2014, which further defines the obligations of Slovenian financial institutions and the Financial Administration of the Republic of Slovenia related to FATCA implementation. The Agreement supplements the existing rules on cooperation between the Republic of Slovenia and the United States in the field of avoidance of double taxation and exchange of information and will contribute to the reduction of administrative burden to Slovenian financial institutions.
The conclusion of the Agreement, which is based on the Model 1 Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA), ensures the implementation of FATCA provisions on the basis of reporting and exchange of information in accordance with the convention for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and capital. According to the Agreement, Slovenian financial institutions are required to report information as determined in the Agreement to the Financial Administration of the Republic of Slovenia, which reports the information to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Reciprocally, Slovenia is receiving information from the US IRS about the funds of Slovenian taxpayers in the United States.
## Directive on Administrative Cooperation - Directive 2011/16/EU (DAC6)
The sixth amendment to the Directive on Administrative Cooperation in the field of taxation (Directive 2011/16/EU, otherwise known as ‘DAC 6’) entered into force on 25 June 2018.
The legislation is part of the European Commission's aim to enhance tax transparency in the European Union and combat aggressive tax planning. DAC 6 applies for companies or professionals that design or promote tax-planning arrangements with cross-border elements involving an EU member state.
The scope of the DAC6 is very wide, which means that companies will have to thoroughly assess whether they are required to report future transactions to the financial administration.
On 1 July 2019, DAC6 was transposed into the Slovenian legal system with an amendment to the Tax Procedure Act (TPA-2). The amendments follow the provisions of DAC6 almost in its entirety, with a few local specifics, such as provisions regarding penalties and professional secrecy privilege.
It should be noted that such cross-border arrangements, where the first step of implementation has been or will be made between 25 June 2018 (date on which DAC 6 came into force) and 30 June 2020, must be reported between 1 July 2020 and 31 August 2020. The report will have to cover the agreements that were carried out between 25 June 2018 and 1 June 2020, when the Directive starts to apply. The first reporting to local financial authorities will follow on 31 August 2020.
The changes to the local legislation introducing DAC6 have been in effect since beginning of July 2019 and are generally following the exact wording of the Directive. Hence, there have not been any distinguished local deviations in this regard.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
PIT is levied on six different sources of income:
## Capital gains and investment income
Capital gains, interest, dividends, and rental income are generally taxed at a flat rate of 25%.
The tax rate on capital gains is decreased according to the length of the holding period. The tax rate is 25% for a holding period from 0 to 5 years, 20% for a holding period from 5 to 10 years, 15% for a holding period from 10 to 15 years, and 0% for a holding period greater than 15 years. The tax on capital gains and rental income is treated as a final tax for residents and non-residents alike.
Interest derived from bank deposits with banks or savings banks registered in Slovenia or elsewhere in the European Union is not subject to taxation up to the amount of EUR 1,000.

## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives

## Tax treatment of payments to seconded employees
There is a reduction of the tax base for PIT for employees that are on a secondment in a foreign country, as follows:
Moreover, seconded workers are entitled to a special tax base, which does not include 20% of the salary or maximum EUR 1,000 in a single month, under the following conditions:
The mentioned exclusion is temporary and can only apply to income that has been paid out in a maximum of 60 months in the time period of ten years from the first secondment.
## Taxation of the business performance payment
The changes to the PIT Act are bringing a more beneficial taxation of the business performance payment. The business performance payment is excluded from the taxable base in the amount of one average monthly wage of the employees in Slovenia. It can be paid in cash as well as benefits-in-kind (e.g. company shares).
Such a treatment is possible if the right for business performance payment to all entitled employees is specified in the employer’s general act or the collective bargaining agreement.
