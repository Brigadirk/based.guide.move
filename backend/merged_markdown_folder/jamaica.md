# Jamaica
## Overview
Last reviewed - 02 August 2024
The official language of Jamaica is English, and the currency is the Jamaican dollar (JMD).
Jamaica is divided into 14 parishes. Its capital is Kingston, located on the south coast of the island. Other major cities and towns include Montego Bay, Spanish Town, Port Antonio, Ocho Rios, Mandeville, and Negril. Although small in size, Jamaica boasts a rich and unique culture, and many Jamaicans (e.g. Bob Marley, Jimmy Cliff, Marcus Garvey, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, and Usain Bolt) have made an indelible impact in the fields of music, politics, religion, and sports worldwide.
The principal drivers of the Jamaican economy are tourism, manufacturing, agribusiness, energy, business process outsourcing, and bauxite/alumina. The country also relies heavily on remittances from citizens living and employed overseas.
The last two decades have seen significant improvements in the country's infrastructure, including several tolled highways and by-passes, which have enhanced road access within the island. Its major airports are Norman Manley International in Kingston and Sangster International in Montego Bay (both of which have seen significant modernisation and improvements) as well as a smaller third international airport, Ian Fleming Airport located in Boscobel, Saint Mary, which is near Ocho Rios.
The principal seaports are Kingston and Montego Bay. There are also extensive cruise shipping facilities in Montego Bay, Ocho Rios, Falmouth, and Port Antonio. The Port of Kingston is located on the world's seventh largest natural harbour, at the centre of the north-south and east-west axes through the Caribbean, approximately 32 miles from the trade routes passing through the Panama Canal.
Jamaica's telecommunication system has also grown significantly in the last decade and is now one of the most sophisticated in the Caribbean. Jamaica's advanced telecoms infrastructure utilises a hybrid of fixed-line and wireless technologies, including 3G and 4G broadband networks.
We advise more companies listed on the Jamaica Stock Exchange than any other professional services firm in Jamaica and are the only firm in the English-speaking Caribbean that has been certified by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. We also provide services to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registrant companies, international conglomerates, and statutory bodies, as well as individuals.

Notes
1. Substantial holdings refer to resident companies that hold 25% or more of the voting rights of the paying Jamaican resident company.
2. Tax is withheld at the rate of 15% where a dividend is paid by a company resident in Jamaica to a resident individual shareholder, regardless of shareholding.
3. Tax is deducted from interest paid to Jamaican residents if payment is made by a prescribed person.
4. Provided the income is not effectively connected with a PE in Jamaica.
5. Applies only to companies owning a substantial holding (percentage ownership as prescribed by the treaty).
6. Rates apply only to residents of member states that have ratified the tax treaty.
7. Rate reduced further if received by a bank recognised as a banking institution under the laws of that state.
8. Provided the services are rendered outside of Jamaica or if in Jamaica (within a prescribed period).
WHT is also imposed at the rate of 15% on insurance premiums paid by Jamaican residents to non-residents (subject to certain exceptions and protection under a tax treaty). WHT of 3% is imposed on payments in respect of ‘specified services’ purchased locally (above a *de minimis* amount of JMD 50,000 per invoice).
WHT withheld should be available for offset against the payee’s income tax liability on the filing of returns.

## Inventory valuation
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value. The Commissioner General, TAJ has not made any pronouncement on a required valuation methodology, but last in first out (LIFO) is not generally permitted.
Any method of valuation that accords with standard accounting practice should be acceptable for tax purposes, provided it is consistently applied at the beginning and end of the accounting period and it is not in contravention of the Income Tax Act.
## Capital gains
## Dividend income
Ordinary dividends paid by Jamaican tax resident companies to Jamaican tax resident shareholders are liable to tax at the rate of 15%. The tax is to be deducted on payment by the distributing company and represents the final tax on such dividends. The Income Tax Act provides relief from taxation for dividends received by Jamaican tax resident corporate shareholders where they hold at least 25% of the voting rights of the distributing company (referred to as ‘group relief’).
Additionally, the dividend income on which tax is payable may not be offset by tax losses, and expenses incurred to earn the dividend are not deductible in arriving at chargeable income, with the exception of expenses incurred in respect of specified dividend income. Specified dividend income refers to the dividend income of companies that are subject to tax and are regulated by the Bank of Jamaica or the Financial Services Commission and whose dominant trade or business is comprised of making investments in loans, securities, and other financial assets. However, this exception does not apply to dividends enjoying group relief.
Preference dividends that qualify as tax deductible expenses of the paying company (*see below*) continue to be liable to tax at a rate of 25%/30% where the recipient is an individual and at the applicable CIT rate where paid to a company. Dividends paid to non-resident shareholders are subject to income tax thereon at the default rate of 33⅓% in the case of a company and 25% in the case of an individual (subject to any treaty protection or incentive relief available).
Subject to certain conditions being met, a company may claim an income tax deduction in respect of preference dividends paid during the year of assessment. However, to the extent that these preference dividends do not qualify for this income tax deduction, they will be treated on a similar basis as ordinary dividends.
### Stock dividends
Stocks issued by way of the capitalisation of retained earnings (referred to as 'bonus issues') do not create a taxable distribution in the hands of the shareholders.
## Interest income
## Royalty income
Royalty income is included in chargeable income.
## Foreign income
Resident corporations are taxable in Jamaica on their worldwide gains or profits. This includes the income of a foreign branch of a Jamaican company, as well as dividends arising abroad. Non-resident corporations are generally taxable on Jamaican-sourced income.
Tax deferral is not permitted in Jamaica.

# Jamaica
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 02 August 2024
Jamaica has established the following departments to handle tax administration:
There is also a Financial Investigations Division in the Ministry of Finance, which investigates customs breaches and fraudulent acts in respect of tax legislation.
## Taxable period
A corporation is subject to tax on its income for a calendar year. However, where the Commissioner General, TAJ is satisfied that a corporation normally prepares financial statements to a date other than 31 December, the company may be permitted to use the profits of its own financial year rather than the calendar year as the basis of assessment. The basis period should not exceed 12 months; however, a company wishing to file its income tax return for a period exceeding this period must obtain the approval of TAJ.
## Tax returns
Income tax returns are due for filing by 15 March in the year following the year of assessment and are based on a system of self-assessment of the tax payable.
## Payment of tax
Tax is payable in quarterly instalments on the 15th day of March, June, September, and December of each tax year. Quarterly instalments are based on an estimate of the year's liability or the actual tax payable for the previous year. The balance of income tax payable for a taxation year, after deduction of the instalments of estimated tax, is due on 15 March of the following year. Interest is charged on unpaid tax at a rate of 16.62% *per annum* while the amount remains unpaid. A penalty of up to 50% may also be imposed if TAJ issues an assessment.
TAJ has implemented an electronic tax system that taxpayers are required to use to file various tax returns and remit taxes online.
## Tax assessments and audits
The Commissioner General, TAJ is empowered to conduct audits on selected tax returns or to assess a taxpayer for additional tax at any time prior to the expiration of the statute of limitation, which is six years, except in certain cases. Tax audits can be carried out whether or not notices of assessment have been issued. Tax assessments may be raised where the Commissioner General, TAJ is of the opinion that a taxpayer has been assessed for less tax than the taxpayer ought to have been charged, or where the taxpayer failed to file a tax return.
The Jamaican revenue authorities have indicated that their focus is centred around improving tax collections, enhancing voluntary compliance, increasing audit coverage, and improving the ease with which taxpayers conduct business.
TAJ conducts comprehensive audits that cover multiple tax types and administers Jamaica's transfer pricing regime.
TAJ also continues to enhance electronic/online platforms and processes.

# Jamaica
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 02 August 2024
## General consumption tax (GCT)
GCT is a value-added tax (VAT) imposed on the supply of goods or services within Jamaica (above a minimum turnover threshold) and on the import of goods or services to Jamaica. The annual turnover GCT registration threshold is currently JMD 10 million. The standard rate of GCT is currently 15%; however, higher or lower rates of GCT are applicable to certain goods and services. The provision of telephone services (including phone cards) and handsets is subject to GCT at the rate of 25%, while the tax is imposed on hotels and other businesses in the tourism sector at an effective rate of approximately 10%. Operators within the tourism industry who were granted approval under legacy tourism incentives and who have not elected to move to the current regime cannot benefit from the 10% tourism GCT rate.
Subject to certain exceptions, an additional 5% advance GCT is levied on the commercial importation of goods by a GCT-registered taxpayer.
Where services are imported from a supplier who is not resident in Jamaica, the recipient of those services is deemed to be liable to account for GCT on the services. The recipient may be able to claim a credit for GCT incurred on imported services in certain circumstances; in particular, there are specific conditions where such services are received from overseas connected parties.
The list of items exempt from GCT includes a range of basic food items, prescription drugs, certain medical supplies, as well as certain construction, transportation, and financial and insurance services. Zero-rated goods and services include certain agricultural and fisheries inputs, exported goods and services, and purchases by diplomatic and international organisations and foreign governments.
A GCT group accounting mechanism is available, whereby two or more affiliated entities may be approved by the Commissioner General, TAJ to be treated as a single taxpayer for GCT purposes.
## Customs duties and related imposts
Customs duty is levied on the customs value of goods imported, which is determined in accordance with the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules on customs valuation.
The rates are specified by a prescribed Customs Tariff, having regard (where appropriate) to the Common External Tariff agreed between Caribbean Community (CARICOM) member states.
In addition to normal customs duties, an environmental protection levy (EPL) and a standards compliance fee (SCF) are imposed at the rate of 0.5% and 0.3%, respectively, of the customs value of goods imported. The EPL is also imposed on 75% of the sales value of locally manufactured goods with an input tax credit available for any EPL paid in respect of imported productive inputs.
Other import levies apply in certain instances, such as additional stamp duty (ASD) on certain goods and a customs administration fee (CAF).
Historically, a CAF of JMD 3,000 was also imposed on each Export Declaration filed with the Jamaica Customs Agency (JCA). This has created a significant cost for exporters, particularly manufacturers of crafts and other artisan products who export in low volumes on a retail basis via online sales.
With effect from 1 April 2021, the CAF shall no longer be levied on Export Declarations with an export value less than USD 500. Export Declarations for exports valued at more than USD 500 will continue to attract the CAF.
## Special consumption tax (SCT)
SCT is imposed at various rates on the importation or local manufacture of ‘prescribed goods’ (i.e. certain petroleum products, ethanol, alcoholic drinks, tobacco, and motor vehicles).
## Property tax
All land in Jamaica is valued for property tax purposes on the 'site value' or 'unimproved value' (as reflected on the 2013 Property Valuation Roll). Property tax is levied by reference to various value bands at a scale of rates ranging from 0.50% to 0.90%.
## Transfer tax
A transfer tax of 2% is applicable on the consideration payable (or market value in certain instances) on the transfer of land, buildings, securities, and shares (provided that a refund is available where the transfer tax charged exceeds 37.5% of the capital gain made). Transactions in listed securities on the Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE) are exempt from transfer tax.
A form of transfer tax is also imposed on the estate of any individual who is domiciled in Jamaica at the date of death. The tax-free threshold for the imposition of transfer tax on estates is JMD 10 million.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is imposed on a wide variety of legal instruments. The rate of stamp duty depends on the legal instrument involved. Transfers of listed securities on the JSE are exempt from stamp duty.
## Payroll taxes
Payroll taxes are imposed at the national level on emoluments paid by employers to their employees, including (subject to certain conditions) expatriates who undertake work in Jamaica. The taxes comprise Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) Income Tax, Education Tax, and contributions to the National Housing Trust (NHT), the National Insurance Scheme (NIS), and the Human Employment and Resource Training (HEART) Trust.
Employers are obligated to deduct and remit payroll taxes within 14 days after the end of the month in which the emoluments are paid. Employers and employees contribute at the following rates:
| Payroll tax | Basis | Employee rate (%) | Employer rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PAYE Income Tax | Taxable emoluments up to JMD 6 million *per annum* less the annual tax-free threshold | 25.00 | N/A |
| Taxable emoluments in excess of JMD 6 million *per annum* | 30.00 | N/A |
| Education Tax | Taxable emoluments | 2.25 | 3.50 |
| NHT contributions | Gross emoluments | 2.00 | 3.00 |
| NIS contributions | Gross emoluments up to a maximum of JMD 5 million *per annum* | 3.00 | 3.00 |
| HEART contributions | Gross emoluments | N/A | 3.00 |
## Asset tax
An *ad valorem* asset tax at the rate of 0.125% is imposed on the ‘taxable value’ of the assets of deposit-taking institutions regulated by the Bank of Jamaica, as well as securities dealers, life assurance companies, and property and casualty insurance companies regulated by the Financial Services Commission. The taxable value of assets is broadly determined as the value of assets on the balance sheet with adjustments for certain items specific to each type of institution.
## Contractors levy
Payments to contractors (including sub-contractors) in respect of construction, haulage, or tillage operations are liable to a withholding of a contractors levy of 2% of the gross amount paid. This must be remitted to TAJ within 14 days of the end of the month in which the payment is made. The levy paid is allowable as a credit against the income tax liability of the contractor in the year of assessment in which the levy is deducted. To the extent that there is any excess, it is not refundable.
## Guest accommodation room tax (GART)
GART is levied at a specific rate on hotels and other tourist accommodation facilities based on room occupancy. GART is tiered depending on the number of rooms at the hotel or other tourism accommodation facility.
## Telephone call tax
A levy is imposed on telephone calls, including inbound calls terminating on fixed or mobile networks.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 02 August 2024
## Taxable period
An individual is subject to tax on one’s income for a calendar year; however, a taxpayer may obtain the approval of the Commissioner General, TAJ to file on a fiscal-year basis.
## Tax returns
Income tax returns are due for filing on 15 March in the year following the year of assessment and are based on a system of self-assessment of the tax payable. However, an individual who expects that income tax will be payable by one’s self only in respect of emoluments is not required to file an income tax return.
Husbands and wives generally file separately and must elect in writing to be jointly assessed.
Individual income tax returns must be filed electronically.
## Payment of tax
Tax is payable in quarterly instalments on the 15th day of March, June, September, and December of each tax year. Quarterly instalments are based on an estimate of the year's liability or the actual tax payable for the previous year. The balance of income tax payable for a taxation year, after deduction of the instalments of estimated tax, is due on 15 March of the following year. Interest is charged on unpaid tax at a rate of 16.62% *per annum* while the amount remains unpaid. A penalty of up to 50% may also be imposed if TAJ issues an assessment.
Income tax (PAYE) is withheld from emoluments; however, where withholding is not possible (e.g. because the employer is not resident in Jamaica), the taxpayer will be required to make payment of estimated tax in quarterly instalments.
## Tax assessments and audits
The Commissioner General is empowered to conduct audits on selected tax returns or to assess a taxpayer for additional tax at any time prior to the expiration of the statute of limitation, which is six years, except in certain cases. Tax audits can be carried out whether or not notices of assessment have been issued. Tax assessments may be raised where the Commissioner General is of the opinion that a taxpayer has been assessed for less tax than one ought to have been charged, or where the taxpayer failed to file a tax return.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 02 August 2024
In general, Jamaican residents and domiciled individuals are taxed on their worldwide income, while non-resident individuals are taxed on Jamaican-sourced income. A non-Jamaican domiciled individual is generally not taxable on foreign-sourced income unless one remits this to Jamaica. Notwithstanding this, a non-domiciled individual working in Jamaica is taxed on the compensation attributable to services rendered in and in relation to Jamaica (subject to certain exceptions) as well as Jamaican-sourced income.
## Personal income tax rates
Individuals are generally liable to income tax at the rate of 25% on their chargeable income (not exceeding JMD 6 million *per annum*) less an annual tax-free threshold (where applicable). Chargeable income derived in excess of JMD 6 million *per annum* is subject to income tax at a rate of 30%.
An annual tax-free threshold of JMD 1,500,096 is available to Jamaican tax-resident individual taxpayers (JMD 1,700,088 *per annum* with effect from 1 April 2024).
## Local income taxes
Tax is imposed on individuals at the national level. Income tax is not separately imposed at the local level.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 02 August 2024
A resident corporation is taxable on its worldwide income. Non-resident companies are subject to tax on Jamaican-sourced income. Tax is imposed on certain sources of income, such as interest, dividends, royalties, and fees, by way of withholding at a rate of 33⅓% for non-resident corporations. Lower rates of withholding are possible, provided that the recipient is resident in a country that has concluded a double taxation treaty (DTT) with Jamaica.
The current rates of corporate income tax (CIT) are as follows:
| Classification | Definition | CIT rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Regulated company | A company that is regulated by the Bank of Jamaica (other than building societies), the Financial Services Commission (other than life assurance companies), the Office of Utilities Regulation, or the Ministry of Finance. | 33⅓ |
| Regulated companyexceptions | From 2023:   * Regulated Independent Power Producers (IPPs) that generate 75% or more of their production from renewable sources (wind or solar). * Service providers rendering trust and corporate services rendered under the Trust and Corporate Service Providers Act. | 25 |
| Building society | A society incorporated under the Building Societies Act. | 30 |
| Life assurance companies |  | 25 |
| Unregulated company | A company (that is not a regulated company) registered and operating within Jamaica. | 25 |
The income of certain organisations is specifically exempt from income tax. These include pension and superannuation funds and charitable organisations that are approved by the Commissioner General, TAJ.
## Local income taxes
Income tax is imposed at the national level. Income tax is not separately imposed at the local level.

## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 02 August 2024
## Reduction in corporate income tax (CIT) rate for independent power producers (IPPs)
In order to encourage further investment in renewable energy, the government has announced its intention to amend the income tax law to exclude independent power producers (facilities generating electricity for sale to the national grid) who produce energy from renewable sources from the definition of 'regulated company', which is currently liable to income tax at a rate of 33⅓%. The amendment, which became effective for the year of assessment 2023, will have the effect of reducing the CIT rate for IPPs to the standard rate of 25%. This reduction, however, will be applicable only to IPPs who produce 75% or more of renewable energy from wind or solar and are regulated by the Office of Utilities Regulation. They will be ineligible to claim an employment tax credit in computing their net income tax liability.
## Amendment to the equity cap for new listings on the Junior Stock Exchange
Companies listed on the Junior Stock Exchange benefit from a number of tax incentives; however, the maximum participating voting share capital of these entities is restricted to 500 million Jamaican dollars (JMD). This equity cap has been in place since 2016 and is seen as an impediment to the growth of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) wishing to raise capital through the junior market. With effect from the 2024 year of assessment, the maximum voting capitalisation will be increased to JMD 750 million, but this new cap shall be applicable only to new listings on the Junior Stock Exchange.
## CIT rate applicable to regulated trust and corporate service providers
The Trust and Corporate Service Providers Act regulates service providers engaged in the provision of regulated trust and corporate services. Under this framework, these entities are regulated by the Financial Services Commission (FSC). Consequent on their regulation by the FSC, this brought them within the scope of the higher rate of CIT imposed on regulated companies. The proposed amendment, which came into effect in the 2023 year of assessment, seeks to reinstate the standard rate of CIT of 25% to such activities and alleviate concerns expressed by the industry.
## General consumption tax (GCT) margin scheme for sales of second-hand vehicles by car dealers, etc.
A GCT margin scheme mechanism has been introduced whereby GCT-registered taxpayers (such as car dealers) may account for GCT on the second sale of a motor vehicle based on the difference between the purchase and selling price of the vehicle. Second sales by private individuals will continue to be liable to a flat rate GCT of JMD 12,000/18,000). This measure will provide more options for the sale of second-hand vehicles, build out the market for second-sale vehicles, and provide greater visibility of the transactions to Tax Administration Jamaica (TAJ).
## Removal of GCT on imported raw foodstuff
Under the current regime, the standard rate of GCT (15%) is applicable to the importation of raw foodstuff (e.g. fruits, vegetables, meats, fish, ground provisions), whereas the supply within Jamaica of domestically produced raw foodstuff is exempt from GCT. This disparity in treatment was an attempt to provide an additional measure of protection for local agricultural products against cheap imports; however, this differentiation in the GCT treatment of local products versus imported products is seen as potentially being in contravention of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
The government announced its intention to extend the same GCT exemption that is now afforded to locally produced products to imported raw foodstuff with effect from the first quarter of the current financial year.
## Removal of GCT on armoured cash courier vehicles
Companies operating an approved cash courier business will be able to import armoured vehicles in excess of cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) value of 33,000 United States dollars (USD) free of GCT. The added cost of armouring an existing courier vehicle will not be subject to GCT.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 02 August 2024
A corporation, wherever incorporated, is resident in Jamaica if the central management and control of its business is exercised in Jamaica. Normally, this is the case if meetings of directors and shareholders are held in Jamaica and major policy decisions of the corporation are made in Jamaica.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The definition of a PE in domestic law is similar in a number of respects to those contained in DTTs and is defined as a fixed place of business through which the business of a business organisation is carried on. Where a DTT applies, then the treaty definition of a PE will prevail.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 02 August 2024
Subject to certain restrictions, expenses are generally tax deductible to the extent that they are incurred wholly and exclusively to earn the income and are claimed in the year in which they are incurred.
## Depreciation
Generally, capital gains on depreciable property are not taxed. However, a recharge limited to the extent of the capital allowances allowed (or balancing charge) is taxable. Tax depreciation may not conform to book depreciation.
## Goodwill
The amortisation or write-off of goodwill is not an allowable deduction.
## Start-up expenses
The costs of incorporation and other expenses incurred in connection with establishing a business are not deductible against income.
## Interest expenses
A deduction is available for interest that is paid on capital employed in acquiring income. Additionally, where interest is paid to a non-resident, tax must be withheld where required and remitted to the tax authorities in order to secure a deduction.
## Bad debts
A deduction is available in respect of specific debts that become bad during the year of assessment.
## Charitable contributions
Approved donations (not exceeding 5% of taxable income) to registered charitable organisations and certain educational institutions are deductible.
## Foreign exchange gains/losses
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from trading are included in or deducted from chargeable income when realised. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on capital assets are not taxable or allowable for tax purposes; however, where they pertain to fixed assets, on realisation, they may become part of the underlying acquisition cost and tax depreciation is computed thereon.
## Fines and penalties
Fines, penalties, and interest arising from tax arrears are not deductible.
## Taxes
Taxes on income are not deductible. Additionally, GCT, contractors’ levy, transfer tax and stamp duty incurred on capital assets, input tax credits for GCT purposes, as well as the asset tax, are generally disregarded for income tax purposes. Other taxes, such as property tax, payroll taxes, and other business taxes, are deductible, to the extent that they were incurred to earn the income.
## Net operating losses
Subject to certain exceptions for newly established and micro businesses, any claim for deduction of tax losses incurred in a prior year will be capped at 50% of the taxpayer’s chargeable income (before deduction of tax losses carried forward) of the year in which the claim is being made. Tax losses are not available for carryback. Certain anti-avoidance provisions restrict the ‘purchase’ of accumulated tax losses.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Royalties, management and other service fees, rentals, and interest charges paid to foreign affiliates are deductible to the extent that these payments are made at arm's-length rates. WHT should be paid in respect of such services, normally at 33⅓% where payment is to a company and 25% in the case of individuals, unless a lower rate is provided for under a DTT. Furthermore, interest paid to non-residents is not deductible until the WHT is remitted.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 02 August 2024
Group taxation is generally not permitted in Jamaica, with the exception of a mechanism to permit group filing of returns for GCT purposes.
## Transfer pricing
Jamaica has implemented a transfer pricing regime consistent with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD’s) guidelines on transfer pricing for multinationals in an effort to protect its tax base and address issues of tax avoidance, particularly in relation to cross-border transactions. Detailed transfer pricing rules seek to ensure that taxpayers compute their taxable income using a deemed arms-length consideration (determined in accordance with prescribed methodologies) for all transactions between connected parties (where different to the actual consideration involved).
The rules also empower the tax authorities to deem an unconnected person located in a low-tax jurisdiction to be a connected person under certain circumstances.
## Thin capitalisation
The Jamaican income tax regime does not currently have thin capitalisation provisions.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There is no CFC regime in Jamaica.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 02 August 2024
Branch income is taxed at the same rate as that of local corporations and on a similar basis. The transfer of profits to its overseas head office is subject to a withholding tax (WHT) of 33⅓% or at a lower treaty rate, where applicable.
A branch operation, irrespective of the nature of its business activities, is subject to Jamaican income tax on income derived by the branch from the island and elsewhere. In computing the income for tax purposes, expenses incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the branch's trade are deductible, including a reasonable proportion of head office expenses.
Taxable profits derived by the branch from transactions between the branch and affiliates should be computed at arm's-length values.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 02 August 2024
Jamaica grants relief from taxation to persons who have been approved under the following incentive legislation:
## Special Economic Zones (SEZ)
A person may be declared to be a ‘developer’ or ‘occupant’ under the SEZ Act. Tax incentives that are available to a developer or occupant under the SEZ Act include a reduced rate of income tax and relief from property tax, transfer tax, GCT, and customs duty. However, these incentives are not available to developers or occupants who are eligible for relief under a number of other enactments.
A number of industries/business activities are specifically prohibited in the SEZ, including (but not limited to) mining or quarrying for natural resources, services pertaining to tourism, telecommunications, public utilities, financial services, construction, real estate, property management and intellectual property activities.
## The Urban Renewal (Tax Relief) Act
The Urban Renewal (Tax Relief) Act provides tax incentives to persons approved under the Act in connection with undertaking programmes of development in areas designated as special development areas, with a view to improving or restoring them. The tax incentive provides certain tax benefits, including relief from income tax on rental income and interest earned by an investor in an Urban Renewal Bond. There is also exemption from stamp duty and transfer tax on the transfers of property.
A tax credit based on expenditure incurred on capital improvement works in a designated special development area is also available. In addition, lessees of the improved properties, who satisfy certain criteria, are able to claim a tax deduction of double the rental paid.
## The Income Tax Act (Junior Stock Market Companies)
Subject to certain conditions being met, a company listed on the Junior Market of the JSE is eligible for full exemption from income tax on their profits in the first five years from the date of admission to the Junior Market, with a 50% exemption from income tax on their profits in next following five years.
## Employment tax credit (ETC)
The ETC is comprised of a non-refundable tax credit that is available to employers in computing their income tax liability. A number of taxpayers are ineligible to claim this tax credit.
The ETC is computed by reference to payroll taxes (excluding PAYE income tax) filed and remitted by their due date by the employer, subject to an overall cap. With a headline income tax rate of 25%, the ETC therefore provides tax-compliant employers with an opportunity to reduce the effective income tax rate on their trading profits to as low as 17.5%.
Where a company makes a distribution (dividends and certain other benefits to shareholders), the credit is clawed back by TAJ to the extent of 10% of the distribution, less the tax payable by the recipient of the distribution (i.e. the ETC claw back only applies where tax imposed on the recipient of the distribution is less than 10%). The credit clawed back must be repaid to TAJ within 14 days of the end of the month in which the distribution is made.
## Incentives for large-scale projects/pioneer industries
The Income Tax Relief (Large-Scale Projects & Pioneer Industries) Act is designed to encourage innovation and high-value investments. It provides a mechanism through which additional income tax incentives can be offered in circumstances where the Minister of Finance designates (subject to affirmative resolution in Parliament) a project as an approved large-scale project or an economic activity as an approved pioneer industry.
Participants in either a designated large-scale project or a pioneer industry may subsequently be approved by Ministerial Order, which will stipulate the extent of relief granted. The income tax relieved under all orders issued pursuant to this mechanism in any year will be capped at 0.25% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) for the previous financial year.
## Productive inputs relief (PIR)
There is relief from customs duty and additional stamp duty on the importation of certain ‘productive inputs’ that are directly used in the ‘production of primary products’ or the ‘manufacture of goods’. In addition to the manufacturing and agricultural sectors, relief is also granted on certain products imported for use in the tourism, creative arts, and healthcare industries.
The relief is subject to the proviso that imported items are not available in adequate supplies from a local manufacturer or from a manufacturer within the CARICOM Common Market area or are not otherwise prohibited from benefiting from this relief.
## Bauxite and Alumina Industries (Encouragement) Act
A person engaged in winning bauxite and producing alumina in Jamaica may be approved as a recognised bauxite producer or a recognised alumina producer (or both) and obtain the following tax reliefs:
## Tax incentives for charitable organisations
The Charities Act provides a mechanism for registered charitable organisations to obtain exemption from income tax, customs duty, GCT, property tax, stamp duty, and transfer tax.
## Non-resident deposits
Non-residents who place deposits with Jamaican banks can earn interest free of Jamaican tax in certain circumstances. The deposits may be designated in foreign currency or Jamaican dollars.
## Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP)
Certain tax benefits accrue to employees and employers in respect of contributions to an approved ESOP as well as the allocation of shares from such plans.
## Income tax credit for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs)
A non-refundable income tax credit of JMD 375,000 is available to MSMEs in computing their net income tax liability. The annual income tax credit will be available for both regulated and unregulated companies with annual revenues that do not exceed JMD 500 million. In the case of unregulated companies, the credit may be claimed in addition to any ETC available. The income tax credit must be utilised in the year in which it is granted and may not be carried forward to be claimed against income tax liabilities in subsequent years of assessment.
## Foreign tax credit
The avoidance of double taxation is achieved by means of foreign tax credits available under most tax treaties or by means of exemption in the case of the CARICOM treaty. Under the provisions of the Income Tax Act, a foreign tax credit is also available to companies in Jamaica that have paid or are liable to Commonwealth Income Tax. Where recourse cannot be had through either of these methods, by convention, in practice, partial relief by way of expense deduction is granted against income for the foreign tax.

## Intergovernmental agreements (IGAs)
The government of Jamaica has entered into an agreement (Model 1) with the government of the Unites States (US) to improve international tax compliance and to implement the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). The agreement seeks to provide an effective mechanism for the automatic exchange of information for tax purposes and addresses the burden of domestic reporting and the legal impediments that Jamaican financial institutions may face in complying with FATCA.
## OECD Multilateral Tax Convention
Jamaica has signed the OECD BEPS Multilateral Convention. Upon signature, TAJ also filed Jamaica’s list of notifications and reservations in relation to the Multilateral Instrument (MLI). Jamaica has also ratified this multilateral treaty and lodged instruments of ratification with the OECD.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
As part of Jamaica's participation in the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes, the Island implemented the CRS under local law in 2021. The CRS requires jurisdictions to obtain information from their financial institutions and automatically exchange that information with other jurisdictions on an annual basis. The CRS sets out the financial account information to be exchanged, the financial institutions required to report, the different types of accounts and taxpayers covered, as well as due diligence procedures to be followed by these financial institutions.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 02 August 2024
## Increase in annual personal income tax-free threshold
The Government of Jamaica announced an increase in the personal income tax (PIT) threshold available to Jamaican tax-resident individual taxpayers from 1,500,096 Jamaican dollars (JMD) *per annum* to JMD 1,700,088 *per annum* with effect from 1 April 2024.
## Increase in annual pension income exemption and age allowance
The Income Tax Act historically provided an exemption from income tax (generally referred to as the pension relief) in respect of JMD 80,000 of pension income for pensioners aged 55 years and over. Individuals 65 years and older have also been entitled to a further exemption (generally referred to as age relief) in respect of JMD 80,000 of income from any source.
The Government of Jamaica announced its intention to increase each of these amounts to JMD 250,000 *per annum* with effect from 1 April 2024.
## Increase in duty-free inbound passenger allowance / *de minimis* import value
With effect from April 2024, the duty-free inbound passenger allowance for personal/household effects was increased from 500 to 1,000 United States dollars (USD), while the *de minimis* value of imported goods for customs purposes (on which import charges may be imposed) was increased from USD 50 to USD 100.
## Reverse income tax credit for individual taxpayers
The Government of Jamaica announced the implementation of a reverse income tax credit amounting to JMD 20,000 applicable to Jamaican individual taxpayers (whether employed or self-employed) who earn less than JMD 3 million annually and meet the annual income tax filing/payment requirements for the 2023 Year of Assessment. Tax Administration Jamaica (TAJ) is to establish a system to facilitate the application, processing, and payment of this reverse credit programme, which is slated to become operational during the current fiscal year.
## Tax credit for investment in residential solar installations
An income tax credit has been introduced to encourage the purchase and installation of residential solar photovoltaic systems. The tax credit is available to employed and self-employed taxpayers and is calculated at 30% of the cost of the system, up to a maximum system cost of JMD 4 million. The credit takes effect from the year of assessment 2023.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 02 August 2024
## Personal deductions
Social security and contributions to pension schemes approved under the Income Tax Act are deductible in determining taxable income, as is interest paid on capital employed in acquiring income.
Approved charitable contributions, restricted to 5% of taxable income, are also deductible.
## Standard deductions
There are no standard deductions in Jamaica.
## Personal allowances
There are no personal allowances in Jamaica. However, the first JMD 1,500,096 of a Jamaican tax resident individual’s statutory income is tax free (JMD 1,700,088 with effect from 1 April 2024).
There are also exemptions from income tax on the first JMD 80,000 (JMD 250,000 from 1 April 2024) for an individual who is aged 65 and over. A person who is 55 years and over who is in receipt of income from an approved superannuation fund or an approved retirement scheme also enjoys an exemption of JMD 80,000 (JMD 250,000 from 1 April 2024) of income from that source and any other source. If the individual is younger than 55 years of age, the exemption is limited to income from the approved scheme not exceeding JMD 80,000 (JMD 250,000 from 1 April 2024).
## Business deductions
To the extent not reimbursed, individuals (resident or non-resident) can deduct all expenses that are incurred wholly and exclusively by them in earning their income (e.g. business-related travel, automobile, and entertainment expenses), provided these expenses are not of a capital nature or specifically mentioned in the tax legislation as non-deductible. Expenses for travel to and from work are not deductible.
## Fines and penalties
Fines, penalties, and interest arising from tax arrears are not deductible.
## Net operating losses
Any claim for deduction of tax losses incurred in a prior year will be capped at 50% of the taxpayer’s chargeable income (before deduction of tax losses carried forward) of the year in which the claim is being made.
This cap will not apply:

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 02 August 2024
## Employment income
An individual who is resident but not domiciled in Jamaica is taxed on the emoluments (salary, living allowances, benefits in kind, use of company cars, etc.) received for work done for or relating to Jamaica, regardless of where payment is made and regardless of whether the emoluments are remitted to Jamaica.
Benefits provided to employees, whether in cash or kind, are taxable. The taxable benefit arising from the private use of a company car ranges from JMD 30,000 to JMD 140,000 *per annum* and is determined by reference to the cost, the age, and the relative percentage of private use.
### Housing accommodation benefit
Housing accommodation provided to an employee by an employer is a taxable benefit. The taxable value of benefit varies, subject to certain conditions being met.
### Uniform and other non-cash benefits
The charge to income tax in respect of uniform and other non-cash benefits is to be determined by reference to the full cost of providing the uniform and other benefits in kind. Previously, the Income Tax Act did not prescribe a basis for the valuation of non-cash benefits derived by employees, with certain exceptions (e.g. the provision of accommodation benefit, company cars, or preferential loans by specified financial institutions). Nominal tax-free allowances of up to JMD 5,739 *per annum* in respect of the provision of uniforms and JMD 3,395 *per annum* in respect of laundry still apply for specified categories of workers.
## Capital gains and investment income
An individual who is resident but not domiciled in Jamaica is taxed in Jamaica on investment income arising outside of Jamaica to the extent that the income is remitted to Jamaica.
### Capital gains
### Dividend income
Ordinary dividends paid by Jamaican tax-resident companies to Jamaican tax-resident shareholders are liable to tax at the rate of 15%. The tax is to be deducted on payment by the distributing company and represents the final tax on such dividends. Additionally, the dividend income on which tax is payable may not be offset by tax losses, and expenses incurred to earn the dividend are no longer deductible in arriving at chargeable income.
Preference dividends that qualify as tax deductible expenses of the paying company (*see below*) continue to be liable to tax at applicable rates (25%/30%) where the recipient is an individual. Dividends paid to non-resident shareholders are subject to income tax thereon at the default rate of 25% in the case of an individual (subject to any treaty protection or incentive relief available).
Subject to certain conditions being met, a company may claim an income tax deduction in respect of preference dividends paid during the year of assessment. However, to the extent that these preference dividends do not qualify for this income tax deduction, they will be treated in the manner indicated above.
### Interest income
Income tax at the rate of 25% is deducted at source from gross interest paid to Jamaican residents (i.e. individuals and companies) by a ’prescribed person‘. Prescribed persons include commercial banks and other financial institutions. The interest is taxable at applicable rates (25%/30%) with a credit for withholding tax (WHT) borne.
Interest paid by a resident person to a non-resident individual is subject to WHT of 25% (unless a lower rate of withholding is applicable by virtue of tax treaty protection available).

## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives

## Employment tax credit (ETC)
The ETC is a non-refundable tax credit that is available to tax-compliant employers, including individuals, in computing their income tax liability.
ETC is capped at the lower of eligible payroll taxes (excluding PAYE) remitted on time or 30% of the income tax payable on profits derived by the individual from the conduct of one's trade. The tax credit therefore provides tax-compliant individuals with an opportunity to reduce the effective income tax rate on their trading profits.
The ETC may not be claimed against any income tax chargeable on non-trading income (e.g. passive investment income) nor can it be claimed in the year of assessment where the taxpayer incurred a tax loss on business operations. The amount must be utilised in the year that the statutory payments are made. Unutilised amounts are not available to be carried forward or back to be utilised in the other years of assessment.
