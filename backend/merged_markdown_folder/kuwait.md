## Social security contributions
For Kuwaiti employees, contributions are payable monthly by both the employer and employee under the Social Security Law. The employer’s contribution is 11.5% and the employee’s is 8% of monthly salary, up to a ceiling of 2,750 Kuwaiti dinars (KWD) per month. Benefits provided include pensions on retirement and allowances for disability, sickness, and death.
In addition to the above contributions, effective 1 January 2015, the employee’s contribution under the Social Security Law will increase by 2.5% of the monthly salary, up to a ceiling of KWD 1,500 per month.
Currently, there are no social security obligations for expatriate workers in Kuwait. However, for such expatriate workers, the Kuwait Labour Law provides for terminal indemnity payments (applicable only to those who have completed three years of their service) calculated at 15 days’ pay-per-year for the first three years of service and 2/3 month’s pay-per-year thereafter.

# Kuwait
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
## Taxable period
Tax is imposed on profits arising in a taxable period, which is defined as the accounting period of the taxpayer and further assumed to be one calendar year. The first taxable period can, however, be a minimum of six months and a maximum of 18 months. The DIT may also agree to a written request from the taxpayer to change the year-end to a date other than 31 December.
## Tax returns
The taxpayer must submit a tax return, based on the taxpayer’s books of account, within three months and 15 days from the end of the taxable period. Taxpayers can, in certain cases, request an extension of up to 60 days to file the tax return. If such an extension is granted, no tax payment is necessary until the tax declaration is filed, and payment must then be in one lump sum.
The taxpayer must maintain certain accounting records in Kuwait, which are subject to inspection by the tax department’s officials after submission of the tax declaration. Accounting records can be in English and may be in a computerised system used to prepare financial statements if the system includes the required records and the tax department is previously informed.
## Payment of tax
Tax is payable in four equal instalments on the 15th day of the fourth, sixth, ninth, and 12th months following the end of the tax period. If an extension is granted by the DIT, all of the tax is payable upon the expiration date of the extension. Failure to file or pay the tax on time attracts a penalty of 1% of the tax liability for every 30 days of delay or part thereof.
## Objection process
If a company disagrees with an assessment issued by the DIT, the company should submit an objection within 60 days from the date of the assessment. The DIT is required to resolve the objection within 90 days of the filing of the objection, after which a revised tax assessment is issued by the DIT. Upon issuance of a revised tax assessment, any additional tax is payable within 30 days. If the DIT issues no response within 90 days of filing the objection, this implies that the taxpayer’s objection has been rejected.
## Appeals process
In case the objection is rejected or the taxpayer is still not satisfied with the revised tax assessment, the company may contest the matter further with the Tax Appeals Committee (TAC) by submitting a letter of appeal within 30 days from the date of the objection response or 30 days from the expiry of the 90 days following submission of an objection if no response is provided by the DIT.
The matter is then resolved through appeal hearings, and a final revised assessment is issued based on the decision of the TAC. Tax payable per the revised assessment must then be settled within 30 days from the date of issuance of the revised assessment. Failure to do so results in a delay penalty of 1% of the amount of the tax due per the final assessment for each period of 30 days or part thereof of the delay.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations period is five years. Moreover, under Article No. 441 of the Kuwait Civil Law, any claims for taxes due to Kuwait or applications for tax refunds may not be made after the lapse of five years from the date on which the taxpayer is notified that tax or a refund is due.
The DIT has implemented an active approach to ensure the compliance of local companies with the tax retention mechanism in order to ensure that foreign entities earning income from Kuwait are subject to tax on such income. The DIT’s attention is often directed to local companies having franchise operations and agreements with foreign franchisors in Kuwait. In some cases, the DIT has asked the Kuwaiti companies to settle the 5% retention where the franchisors have failed to comply with the tax law requirements.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The GCC states (including Kuwait) executed the GCC VAT framework agreement in February 2017. The signing of the treaty paves the way for the introduction of VAT with effect from 1 January 2018 in the GCC. However, the GCC countries could implement VAT in either 2018 or 2019 as per the terms of the treaty. In Kuwait, the GCC framework agreement is currently under discussion in the Parliament while the draft Law is under preparation by the government.
## Customs tariffs
The GCC states have approved a unified customs tariff of 5% on cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) invoice price, subject to certain exceptions. A higher tariff is imposed on imports of tobacco and its derivatives, among other products.
## Excise taxes
There are no excise taxes in Kuwait.
## Property taxes
There are no property taxes in Kuwait.
## Transfer taxes
There are no transfer taxes (e.g. stamp duty, real estate) in Kuwait.
## Payroll taxes
There are no payroll taxes applicable in Kuwait, other than those for social security contributions (*see below*).
## Social security contributions
For Kuwaiti employees, contributions are payable monthly by both the employer and employee under the Social Security Law. The employer’s contribution is 11.5% and the employee’s is 8% of monthly salary, up to a ceiling of 2,750 Kuwaiti dinars (KWD) per month. Benefits provided include pensions on retirement and allowances for disability, sickness, and death.
In addition to the above contributions, the employee must contribute 2.5% of their monthly salary, up to a ceiling of KWD 1,500 per month, under the Social Security Law.
There are no social security obligations for expatriate workers. However, for foreign employees, it is generally necessary to make terminal indemnity payments calculated at 15 days’ pay-per-year for the first three years of service and 2/3 month’s pay-per-year thereafter.
The purpose of the NLST law is to encourage the national labour force to work in the private sector by closing the gap in salaries and benefits between public and private sectors.
As per the law, Kuwaiti companies listed in the Kuwait Stock Exchange (KSE) are required to pay an employment tax of 2.5% of the company’s net annual profits.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
Kuwait does not impose corporate income tax (CIT) on companies wholly owned by the nationals of Kuwait or other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries (Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates). However, GCC companies with foreign ownership are subject to taxation to the extent of the foreign ownership. CIT is imposed only on the profits and capital gains of foreign 'corporate bodies' conducting business or trade in Kuwait, directly or through an agent.
The current CIT rate in Kuwait is a flat rate of 15%.
Foreign companies carrying on trade or business in the offshore area of the partitioned neutral zone under the control and administration of Saudi Arabia are only subject to tax in Kuwait on 50% of their taxable profit under the law.
## Zakat
Zakat is imposed on all publicly traded and closed Kuwaiti shareholding companies at a rate of 1% of the companies’ net profits.

# Kuwait
## Overview
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
Kuwait is a sovereign Arab state situated in the northeast of the Arabian Peninsula in Western Asia. It is bordered by Iraq to the north and west, Saudi Arabia to the south, and the Persian Gulf to the east. Kuwait is divided into six governorates, with Kuwait City as the capital. The official language of Kuwait is Arabic, and the currency is the Kuwaiti dinar (KWD).
Kuwait has a geographically small, but wealthy, relatively open economy with crude oil reserves of about 102 billion barrels, which is more than 6% of the world’s crude oil reserves. Kuwaiti officials plan to increase oil production to 4 million barrels per day by 2020. Petroleum accounts for over half of gross domestic product (GDP), 94% of export revenues, and 90% of government income.
In 2015, for the first time in 15 years, Kuwait reported a budget deficit after decades of high oil prices. Kuwaiti authorities have tried to reduce the deficit by decreasing spending on subsidies for the local population, but with limited success. Despite Kuwait’s dependence on oil, the government has cushioned itself against the impact of lower oil prices by annually saving at least 10% of government revenue in the Fund for Future Generations.
With the Kuwaiti dinar pegged to a basket of currencies dominated by the United States dollar (USD), the Central Bank of Kuwait raised the discount rate by 25 basis points to 3%, effective from March 2018, in order to maintain the competitiveness of the Kuwaiti dinar. Private sector credit is growing at a moderate pace, mitigating concerns about financial risks. The banking sector is well capitalised, yet has exposure to the real estate sector.
Fiscal reforms remain limited. With current spending amounting to 90% of total spending, cutting expenditures has proved challenging. Electricity and fuel subsidy cuts have been proposed, but face strong opposition in the Parliament. In mid-March 2016, the Cabinet approved a reform package focused on public sector and expenditure reforms, public private partnership (PPP) and privatisation, small and medium enterprise (SME) development, and labour market and investment climate reforms, but these still need to be approved by the Parliament. In January 2017, the Kuwaiti government unveiled the country’s new National Development Plan up to the year 2035, under the name ‘New Kuwait’. Among the targets of the plan is reforming governmental administrative and bureaucratic practices to facilitate and accelerate obtaining business licences, reducing the dependency on oil export revenues by allowing the establishment of new small businesses, and improving infrastructure, where around ten infrastructure development projects are already underway as of March 2018, among others.
On 15 November 2023, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) announced that Kuwait joined the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS), an international collaboration with 145 member countries. As indicated in the announcement, Kuwait has agreed to participate in the Two-Pillar Solution to reform international taxation laws and ensure that multinational enterprises pay their fair share of taxes wherever they operate. Kuwait will participate in the implementation of the BEPS package of 15 measures to tackle tax avoidance, enhance the coherence of international tax laws, and provide a more transparent tax environment. Relevant legislation and implementation dates are yet to be released.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
## Social security contributions
For Kuwaiti employees, contributions are payable monthly by both the employer and employee under the Social Security Law. The employer’s contribution is 11.5% and the employee’s is 8% of monthly salary, up to a ceiling of 2,750 Kuwaiti dinars (KWD) per month. Benefits provided include pensions on retirement and allowances for disability, sickness, and death.
In addition to the above contributions, effective 1 January 2015, the employee’s contribution under the Social Security Law will increase by 2.5% of the monthly salary, up to a ceiling of KWD 1,500 per month.
Currently, there are no social security obligations for expatriate workers in Kuwait. However, for such expatriate workers, the Kuwait Labour Law provides for terminal indemnity payments (applicable only to those who have completed three years of their service) calculated at 15 days’ pay-per-year for the first three years of service and 2/3 month’s pay-per-year thereafter.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
Kuwaiti tax law does not impose withholding tax (WHT). However, all public bodies and private entities are required to retain 5% from the contract, agreement, or transaction value or from each payment made to any incorporated body until presentation of a tax clearance certificate, by the recipient of such payment from the Ministry of Finance (MoF), confirming that the respective company has settled all of its tax liabilities in Kuwait. The final payment should not be less than 5% of the total contract value.
## Tax treaties
Kuwait has entered into tax treaties with several countries for the avoidance of double taxation. Treaties with several other countries are at various stages of negotiation or ratification.
The domestic tax law in Kuwait does not provide for WHTs. The WHT rates listed in the table are for illustrative purposes only.

# Kuwait
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
Income tax is imposed on the profit of a business in Kuwait as calculated by the normal commercial criteria, using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), including the accrual basis. Note that provisions, as opposed to accruals, are not deductible for tax purposes. In addition, for contract accounting, revenue is recognised by applying the percentage of completion method.
Article 2 of the Executive Bylaws to the Kuwait Tax Law provides that income earned from the following activities in Kuwait shall be considered subject to tax in Kuwait:
## Inventory valuation
Inventory is normally valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value, on a first in first out (FIFO) or average basis.
## Capital gains
Capital gains on the sale of assets and shares by foreign shareholders are treated as normal business profits and are subject to tax at a 15% rate. The tax law provides for a tax exemption for profits generated from dealing in securities on the KSE, whether directly or through investment portfolios.
## Dividend income
Dividends declared by companies listed on the KSE after 10 November 2015 are exempt from tax in Kuwait.
## Interest income
In principle, tax is levied on the foreign company's share of the profits (whether or not distributed by the Kuwaiti company) plus any amounts receivable for any other income in Kuwait (e.g. interest, royalties, technical services, management fees). However, the Kuwait tax law will still subject the interest received from a Kuwaiti source to tax in Kuwait, whether this interest is the only source of income for the foreign entity in Kuwait or the foreign entity has more sources of income in Kuwait other than the interest income.
## Royalty income
Royalty income earned from “the sale, lease, grant of franchise to use or utilise any trademark, design, patent, intellectual property, or copyright in Kuwait” is taxable in Kuwait. Kuwait tax law imposes a deemed profit of 98.5% on royalties earned from Kuwait (1.5% being an allowance for head office overhead), on which the prevailing flat corporate tax rate of 15% is applied.
## Foreign currency exchange rates and related profits and losses
The tax treatment for realised and unrealised losses and gains related to foreign currency transactions are as follows:
## Exempt income
The following sources of income are exempt from tax in Kuwait:
## Foreign income
The Kuwait tax law does not clearly provide for the tax treatment of foreign income. Such income is currently treated on a case-by-case basis.

## Permanent establishment (PE)
A place of business or the presence of company employees/representatives in Kuwait, even if for short-term visits, can trigger a PE in Kuwait. If the company is proven to have a PE in Kuwait, the Kuwait Tax Authority can subject to tax either the profit attributable to the PE or the full value of the contract, including the value of work performed outside Kuwait. The interpretation and application of the tax law by the Kuwait Tax Authority is usually inconsistent with international standards, and is subject to the widest possible interpretation in order to tax all income from Kuwait.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
## Depreciation
Depreciation is taken on a straight-line basis at specified rates. However, within 90 days prior to submission of the tax declaration, the taxpayer may request that the tax department calculate the depreciation using a different method than the straight-line method. The tax department shall accept this request if it is based on a reasonable basis in accordance with the tax accounting principles and rules.
The principal depreciation rates are specified in the law, as follows:
| Type of fixed asset | Depreciation rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Buildings | 4 |
| Pre-fabricated buildings, furniture, and office equipment | 15 |
| Electronics and electrical equipment | 15 |
| Transportation and freight vehicles (trucks) | 15 |
| Tools and equipment | 20 |
| Cars and buses | 20 |
| Drilling equipment | 25 |
| Software | 25 |
| Computer equipment and accessories | 33.3 |
## Goodwill
In accordance with Executive Rule No. 30, amortisation of incorporated body goodwill is not allowed as a tax deductible expense.
## Start-up expenses
Expenses incurred prior to signing of the contract are not allowed as tax deductible costs.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are deductible if they are related to operations in Kuwait and are paid to a local bank.
## Bad debt
Bad debt is deductible if it is related to operations in Kuwait and a final decision by the court is available.
## Charitable contributions
Grants, donations, and subsidies paid to licensed Kuwaiti public or private agencies are deductible.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are not tax deductible.
## Taxes
Taxes and fees, except income tax, are deductible in Kuwait.
## Subcontract costs
A subcontractor is any third party, provider, or beneficiary that in any way executes a portion of the contract or any phase thereof.
As per Executive Rule No. 28, subcontract costs are deductible if the following conditions are met:
During inspection, the tax department shall disallow the amounts paid to subcontractors if the incorporated body does not notify the tax department of the subcontractors or does not withhold 5% of the contract value signed with the subcontractor as income tax retention.
## Net operating losses
As per the amended tax law, losses may be carried forward for a maximum of three years, provided that the following situations do not arise in the fiscal period following the period in which the loss was recorded:
Please note that losses cannot be carried back under the Kuwait tax law.
## Head office expenses/payments to foreign affiliates
The deduction of head office expenses (the overhead or the indirect expenses) is limited to 1.5% of the company's Kuwait revenue after deducting the subcontractors’ shares (if any).
The direct costs allocated by the head office (e.g. supply of goods, design and consultancy costs) are regulated as follows.
For costs of supply from outside Kuwait:
| Supply from | Maximum allowable costs as a percentage of revenue |
| --- | --- |
| Head office | 85% |
| Affiliated companies | 90% |
| Third parties | 95% |
For design costs incurred outside Kuwait:
| Work conducted by | Maximum allowable costs as a percentage of revenue |
| --- | --- |
| Head office | 75% |
| Affiliated companies | 80% |
| Third parties | 85% |
For consultancy costs incurred outside Kuwait:
| Work conducted by | Maximum allowable costs as a percentage of revenue |
| --- | --- |
| Head office | 70% |
| Affiliated companies | 75% |
| Third parties | 80% |
In case there is no separate revenue for consultancy, design, or supply work, although the nature of the contract requires the existence of such work, the following formula shall be applied:
Consultancy, design, or supply revenue = (consultancy, design, or supply costs / total direct costs) x contract revenue

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
If a foreign company conducts more than one business activity in Kuwait, one tax declaration aggregating the income from all activities is required to be submitted in Kuwait. In addition, in case two affiliates are involved in similar lines of business or work on the same project, their taxable results may be aggregated for the assessment of tax by the Department of Inspection and Tax Claims (DIT), a department of the Kuwait Tax Authority.
## Transfer pricing
There is no Transfer Pricing Law in Kuwait. However, Executive Rule No. 49 to the Kuwait Tax Law states that inter-company transactions should be comparable to transactions among companies that are not legally or financially associated. It also states that the Kuwait Tax Authority is entitled to inspect such transactions to ensure that they are made on an arm’s-length basis and not made for obtaining illegal tax privileges.
## Thin capitalisation
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no CFC rules in Kuwait.

## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
## United States (US) Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
The state of Kuwait has signed an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the United States, dated 29 April 2015, in light of FATCA. In this regard, Ministerial Order Number 48 of 2015 (MO No. 48) was issued on 3 September 2015, setting a compliance framework for the financial institutions operating in Kuwait.
Financial institutions (FIs) operating in Kuwait have a series of compliance requirements to adhere to within the deadlines provided by MO No. 48. FIs were primarily required to register with the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS), appoint the Responsible Officer, and implement the compliance requirements by 31 December 2015.
FIs in Kuwait are expected to report on an annual basis on or before 30 September of each year; the report is to include the Specified US Persons identified for each period ending 31 December (i.e. nine months from the year-end). It has been the practice of the MoF to request the reports by 30 August to ensure all financial institutions are reporting prior to the deadline specified by the IRS.
## The Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
Kuwait committed to the CRS on 19 August 2016 by signing the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA), with a plan to commence the first reporting period in 2018.
On 12 July 2017, MO No. 36 of 2017 was published in the Official Gazette, which confirmed Kuwait’s commitment to implement the CRS. On 20 August 2017, MO No. 46 of 2017 was issued, whereby specific deadlines for reporting, due diligence, and update of on-boarding procedures were published. Moreover, as specified by the MO, the FIs are required to hire an auditor to provide an opinion on the process and reporting undertaken by the FIs to meet the requirements of the CRS. As per MO No. 36 of 2017, the first report by FIs was expected on or before 31 May 2018. However, it was postponed to 31 August 2018 and again to 1 November 2018. The cut-off date for pre-existing accounts is 31 March 2017 and for new customer accounts on or after 1 April 2017. That said, as of November 2018, the MCAA is yet to be approved by the Kuwaiti Parliament.

# Kuwait
## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
## Foreign tax relief
There is no PIT regime in Kuwait.
## Tax treaties
The tax treaties signed by Kuwait provide residency rules for individuals. However, such rules are irrelevant for foreign employees working in Kuwait given the fact that there is no PIT regime in Kuwait. Nevertheless, these rules may apply to Kuwaiti nationals having work assignment in one of the signing countries.
The State of Kuwait is currently in the process of renegotiating the terms of multiple of its previously signed tax treaties. Kindly ensure to always review the latest version of the respective tax treaty for updates.
