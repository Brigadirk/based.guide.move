# Saint Lucia
## Overview
Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
Saint Lucia is an island nation located in the Caribbean Sea. It has 11 quarters or parishes, with Castries as the capital and largest city. The official language of Saint Lucia is English, and the currency is the East Caribbean dollar (XCD).
Saint Lucia, with its fine natural harbour at Castries, was contested between England and France throughout the 17th and early 18th centuries (changing possession 14 times). It was finally ceded to the United Kingdom in 1814. Even after the abolition of slavery on its plantations in 1834, Saint Lucia remained an agricultural island, dedicated to producing tropical commodity crops. Self-government was granted in 1967 and independence in 1979.
The island nation has been able to attract foreign business and investment, especially in its offshore banking and tourism industries, with a surge in foreign direct investment in 2006, attributed to the construction of several tourism projects. Although crops such as bananas, mangos, and avocados continue to be grown for export, tourism provides Saint Lucia's main source of income, and the tourism industry is the island's biggest employer. The Saint Lucia manufacturing sector is the most diverse in the Eastern Caribbean, and the government is trying to revitalise the banana industry.

# Saint Lucia
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
## Inventory valuation
Inventory is generally valued at the lower of cost or market value. The Saint Lucia IRD will generally accept a valuation method that is in line with the common accounting practice of the particular trade or industry. First in first out (FIFO) or average costing are normally used for both book and tax purposes.
Obsolescence is permitted where it occurs, but there are no provisions to account for monetary inflation on inventory valuation.
## Capital gains
There is no tax on capital gains except in instances where such gains comprise a portion of the income-earning activities of the business. In such instances, the corporate tax rate applies.
## Dividend income
Dividends are tax exempt in Saint Lucia.
### Inter-company dividends
Inter-company dividends are not subject to tax in Saint Lucia.
## Interest income
The corporate tax rate applies to interest income. However, income earned on securities issued by member governments of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank and income accruing from trading in securities under the Securities Act to any citizen or resident of any member state of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States or to any company incorporated in and registered in any member state of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States is tax exempt.
## Royalty and rental income
The corporate tax rate applies to royalty and rental income. However, rental income from a residential accommodation shall be exempt from tax if certain requirements, as defined by regulations, are met.
## Foreign exchange gains/losses
Foreign exchange gains or losses arising from foreign exchange transactions on trading items are assessable or deductible as realised gains or losses if settled within normal credit terms. Gains or losses on other instruments, including inter-company loans, are recognised only when actually realised.
Unrealised exchange gains/losses are not taxable/deductible.
## Bribes, kickbacks, illegal payments
Bribes, kickbacks, and illegal payments received by a company are includible in taxable income.
## Foreign income
Resident companies are not taxed in Saint Lucia on income deemed to have been earned outside Saint Lucia. Reciprocal understandings exist with some countries for the avoidance of double taxation, and foreign tax is allowed as a credit against tax charged in Saint Lucia. Saint Lucia has no tax treaties with other countries, except for the member states that make up CARICOM. There is an agreement among the governments of CARICOM for the avoidance of double taxation. Where no agreement exists, the foreign tax offset is the lesser of the foreign tax paid or the tax payable on that income in Saint Lucia.
Tax deferral is not permitted in Saint Lucia.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate is 12.5%. There is also a 0% rate charged on certain goods and services. In respect of the hotel sector and related services, the rate is 10%, with a reduced rate of 7% for a supply of a tourism accommodation service applicable from 1 December 2020.
The threshold for registered taxpayers is currently set at 400,000 East Caribbean dollars (XCD) *per annum*. This means that it is not mandatory for businesses earning less than the threshold to register for VAT. The threshold is based on the annual sales turnover of the taxpayer.
The VAT rate of 0% has been legislated on certain supplies, which include, but are not limited to, the following:
The following goods and services are exempted from VAT, but this list is not exhaustive:
The government secured the Caribbean Community and Common Market's (CARICOM's) approval to remove the import duty on medical supplies for a period of four years from 1 May 2012 to 30 April 2016. Although this was meant to be a temporary measure, the instrument instituting the exemption had no end date and there have been no official pronouncements terminating the exemption. Prescription drugs are currently exempt from VAT.
The government has established a special VAT Refund Account in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Administration Act to facilitate the timely processing and payment of refunds to taxpayers.
## Customs duties
Customs duties are charged on a wide range of imported goods. Exemptions are granted for raw materials and plant and machinery used in manufacturing and for certain items imported by hotels under construction, extension, or refurbishing projects.
## Excise taxes
Excise taxes are imposed on four main categories of goods manufactured or imported into Saint Lucia, namely fuel, liquor, beer, and cigarettes. Most excisable goods are subject to tax at a specific rate.
The excise tax on fuel applies when the fuel is imported by a wholesaler. Tax is included in the price of fuel paid at the gas pump. The tax rate formula is based on the current price provided by the supplier and regulated price at the gas pump.
Effective 1 July 2023, Saint Lucia has increased excise tax on tobacco products by 50%.
## Commercial property tax
Commercial property tax is assessed annually at 0.4% of the open market value of the property. The owner is required to obtain a commercial valuation assessing the open market value of the property. All new commercial properties completed after 1 April 2001 can benefit from a three-year exemption from commercial property tax.
## Residential property tax
The property tax rate for residential property is 0.25% of the open market value.
## Stamp tax
Stamp tax is charged on any document that evidences a legal or contractual relationship between two or more parties. Additionally, many types of commercial and legal documents must be stamped as evidence of the payment of taxes. Stamp tax may be charged either at a fixed rate or at an *ad valorem* rate, depending, for example, on the value of the property being transferred.
| Instrument | Stamp duty rate | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Conveyance or sale of immovable property (resident or non-resident purchaser) | 2% | |

| Conveyance or sale of debenture, stock, debt, or shares where less than 75% of assets comprise immovable property | Greater of 0.5% of net assets of company or XCD 10 |
| Conveyance or sale of debenture, stock, debt, or shares where more than 75% of assets comprise immovable property: |  | |
| Non-resident vendor | 10% | |
| Resident vendor: |  | |
| XCD 50,000 to XCD 75,000 | 2.5% | |
| XCD 75,001 to XCD 150,000 | 3.5% | |
| XCD 150,001 and over | 5% | |
## Payroll taxes
Other than employers’ portion of the statutory National Insurance Corporate (NIC) contributions (*see below*), there are no other payroll taxes, where the burden falls on the employer. Employers are, however, responsible for deducting the employees’ income tax liability at source, through the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system.
## Social security contributions
The employee's share of NIC contributions (for retirement, sickness, and disability benefits) is 5% of gross salary, up to a maximum contribution of XCD 250 per month (i.e. on a monthly salary of XCD 5,000). The employer matches the contribution and files monthly returns.
## Tourism levies
Effective from 15 December 2020, guests staying at registered accommodation service providers will be charged 3 United States dollars (USD) per person and night on room rates below USD 120 or USD 6 per person and night on room rates above USD 120. A rate of 50% of the tourism levy will apply to guests who are 12 to 17 years of age.
## Health and Citizen Security Levy
Saint Lucia has introduced a 2.5% Health and Citizen Security Levy, effective 2 August 2023, on:
The levy is to be applied *ad valorem* on the cost, insurance, and freight value of goods. It is to be applied to invoices generated for goods and services effective 2 October 2023.

# Saint Lucia
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
## Taxable period
Returns must cover a 12-month period, which may be changed only with the Comptroller’s permission.
## Tax returns
Tax returns must be filed within three months of the company’s fiscal year-end. An extension of the filing date may be obtained.
Financial statements must be submitted with the returns, together with a schedule reconciling taxable income with book income and various other schedules of additional information.
The system is one of self-assessment. Upon receipt of the returns, the IRD examines the information provided and issues a notice of assessment at any time, subject to the statute of limitations. The Revenue Department may also issue assessments in the absence of returns.
## Payment of tax
Tax is payable in instalments on 25 March, 25 June, and 25 September in each year of income, based on the preceding year’s income. Any remainder is payable within three months of the end of the fiscal year.
### Penalties and interest
The following civil penalties and interest, which are non-deductible, are imposed:
## Appeals
Within 30 days after the date of service of a notice of assessment or reassessment, the taxpayer may submit a written objection to the Revenue Department on any matters in such assessment or reassessment. If the Revenue Department confirms its assessment, the taxpayer may file an appeal with the Appeal Commission, which comprises seven persons appointed by the Minister of Finance. A decision by that body may be further appealed to the Saint Lucia High Court within 30 days. An appeal against an order from this Court may be made to the Court of Appeal.
## Tax audit process
The IRD carries out audits of a selection of tax returns, usually at the taxpayer’s place of business. Audits may be carried out at any time prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations, whether or not notices of assessment have been issued. The Revenue Department has wide powers in determining the information it requires for these audits.
## Statute of limitations
Assessments are not final until six years after the end of the income year, within which period assessments may be made at any time. In cases of misrepresentation or failure to disclose any material fact, a reassessment can be made at any time.
The tax authorities in Saint Lucia often focus on the deductibility of related-party expenses during the completion of tax audits and WHTs on head office or management charges.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
Resident companies are taxed on gains or profits accrued directly or indirectly from all sources in Saint Lucia and are subject to tax at a flat rate of 30%. The 30% tax rate is only applicable to companies that, prior to income year 2003, have no tax arrears and have complied with the requirements of any enactment administered by the Inland Revenue Department (IRD). The tax rate of 33.33% will still apply to those companies that have tax arrears and have not complied with the requirements.
A new territorial tax system for all companies is in effect after 31 December 2018, subsequent to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) Harmful Tax Practices - 2018 Progress Report on Preferential Regimes publication on 24 January 2019.
Based on the new territorial system, resident companies shall not be taxed on certain types of income accruing from sources outside of Saint Lucia.
Non-resident companies are taxed on Saint Lucia-source income. The gross amount of such income is liable to 25% WHT, while WHT of 15% applies to interest.
Associations of underwriters are taxed at 30% on 10% of the gross premium arising in Saint Lucia, and life insurance companies are taxed at 30% on 10% of the gross investment income arising in Saint Lucia.

## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
Saint Lucia has extended the tax amnesty program for taxpayers who have outstanding tax arrears of corporation tax, personal income tax (PIT), value-added tax (VAT), pay-as-you-earn (PAYE), withholding tax (WHT), and property tax. The amnesty will run until 1 May 2025, and there will be a waiver of all penalties and interest for periods up to and including income year 2021.

Effective 1 July 2023, Saint Lucia has increased excise tax on tobacco products by 50%.

# Saint Lucia
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
Accrued expenses are deductible as long as they are business related. Contingent liabilities are deductible expenses once they are recognised in the book of accounts. Any expenditure incurred for the purpose of producing exempt income is not deductible.
## Depreciation
The following capital allowances are available in Saint Lucia:
The Comptroller of the IRD may also grant, on application, a higher rate for annual allowance for assets that have higher or abnormal wear and tear.
Gains on disposal are taxable as ordinary income to the extent of depreciation recovered, and any proceeds in excess of the cost of the asset are treated as a capital gain, which is not subject to tax. Where the proceeds on disposal are lower than the tax written-down value of the asset, a balancing allowance is granted for the shortfall.
## Goodwill
Neither the amortisation of impaired goodwill nor the related write-off of it is an allowable deduction.
## Organisational and start-up expenses
All expenditures incurred in connection with incorporation costs for the establishment of a new small business enterprise are allowable deductions. A small business enterprise is an enterprise incorporated during the year of income that:
## Interest expenses
Interest on any loan, including interest payable on debentures, is an allowable deduction to the extent that the amount of such loan was used for the purpose of producing assessable income.
## Bad debt
Bad debt expense is deductible, provided it has been brought to account in generating the company’s assessable income for any income year and that the company has taken all reasonable steps to establish that the collection of such debt is unlikely.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions are an allowable deduction when the contributions are made under a deed of covenant for a period of not less than three years to any religious, charitable, medical, or educational institution; sporting body; or fund of a public character, approved by Cabinet, if such contributions are made to the Saint Lucia National Trust. However, the deduction with respect to such contributions shall not exceed 25% of the assessable income of the company for that income year.
## Pension expenses
Current annual contributions to an approved pension fund are deductible expenses. However, where a special payment is made to an approved pension fund, in relation to a period of service by an employee prior to the setting up of the approved pension fund, or to meet any actuarially ascertained insufficiency in the resources of the approved pension fund to meet its obligations to its employees, such amount shall be deductible as follows:
1. Where the special payment does not exceed the current annual contribution, such amount is wholly deductible.
2. Where the special payment exceeds the current annual contribution, the special payment is an allowable deduction in such years of income, not exceeding five in number, as in the opinion of the Comptroller is reasonable under the circumstances.
3. Where under (ii) above, annual deductions are allowable over a number of years of income, the first such deduction is allowable for the income year for which the special payment is made.
## Taxes
VAT paid on goods imported or purchased, and sold in the ordinary course of business, is deductible for tax purposes. Property taxes are deductible where the property is used in producing assessable income. Income taxes, penalties, and interest on tax in arrears are not deductible.
## Other significant items
Meals and entertainment, officer’s compensation/life insurance, and payment to directors are deductible expenses, provided they are wholly and exclusively incurred by a company during that year of income for the purpose of producing its assessable income.
## Net operating losses
Net operating losses may be carried forward for up to six years if the losses have not been fully absorbed earlier. In carrying losses forward, the amount that can be claimed in any subsequent year is restricted to one-half of the assessable income of that year. Losses may not be carried back.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
There are no restrictions on the deductibility of interest paid to foreign affiliates if the transaction is carried out at arm’s length and at commercial rates. However, deductions for management charges, allocations of head office expenses, royalties, and other charges that are subject to 25% WHT are restricted to the lesser of the aggregate of those charges or 10% of all allowable business deductions, excluding cost of sales and capital allowances.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
Group tax filing is not allowed in Saint Lucia; however, group tax relief is available under certain circumstances to allow the trading losses, excluding the current loss, of a resident company within a group to offset the profits of another resident company within the same group. A claim for group relief requires the consent of the Comptroller of the IRD and is only available to resident companies.
## Transfer pricing
Related-party transactions are accepted if they are made on an arm’s-length basis. The IRD has the power under the Income Tax Act to make any adjustment deemed necessary to place such transactions at arm’s length.
## Thin capitalisation
No provision exists for thin capitalisation in Saint Lucia.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no provisions relevant to CFCs in Saint Lucia.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
## Foreign tax credit
Where income has accrued to a resident and has been taxed in a foreign country with which there is no double tax agreement (DTA) or is income to which a DTA, if there is one, does not relate, credit for tax on such income is allowed for the lesser of the tax payable in the foreign country or the tax charged under Saint Lucia tax law.
## Tax holidays
Tax holidays are available for manufacturing companies. The incentives are aimed at increasing the manufacturing base of Saint Lucia, the level of exports, and the use of local materials and labour in production. An approved manufacturing enterprise will be granted a tax holiday, up to a maximum of 15 years. In determining the length of the tax holiday, the extent of the local value added to approved products is taken into account.
## Investment incentives
Income tax incentives and other fiscal concessions are provided under the Fiscal Incentives Act, the Tourism Incentives Act, the Special Development Areas Act, and other concessions granted by the Cabinet of Ministers. The extent of the incentives and concessions granted are specific to the legislation or Cabinet conclusions and depend on the impact that the investment would have on local employment, exports, and the generation of foreign exchange earnings. The incentives granted include the following:
## Employment incentives
Employment incentives are available in the Income Tax Act for the following:
## International Business Companies (IBCs) Act
Effective 1 July 2021, all IBCs are subject to income tax at a rate of 30%.
Freedom from exchange controls is granted to IBCs, as well as from stamp duty on the transfers of any property, assets, shares, debt obligation, or other securities. No WHT is levied on remittances of dividends and distributions, royalties, interest, management fees, or fees or other income paid by IBCs to persons outside Saint Lucia. Supplies to an IBC are also deemed to be an export, and VAT is applied at the rate of 0%.
In common with many other territories, Saint Lucia has also adopted economic substance legislation.
## Other incentives
Complete or partial waivers of income tax are available on the taxable profits of companies engaged in providing services to the offshore financial services industry.
Special tax concessions are also available for capital construction in the hotel industry. Capital expenditures on the construction of a hotel may offset profits for up to 15 years.

Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
## Economic substance
Saint Lucia, in common with a number of other jurisdictions, was required by the European Union (EU) Code of Conduct Group on Business Taxation to introduce economic substance requirements for companies that are tax resident on the island. As a result, Saint Lucia has introduced economic substance legislation commencing 2021. Saint Lucia tax resident companies carrying on relevant activities will be required to meet an economic substance test. Relevant activities are defined as any of the following businesses:
## Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs)
TIEAs provide for the exchange of information on tax matters. TIEAs with Aruba, Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Netherlands Antilles, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States are in force.
## United States (US) Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
On 19 November 2015, the government of the United States and the government of Saint Lucia signed an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) entitled, ‘Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of St. Lucia to Improve International Tax Compliance and to Implement FATCA’. The IGA requires, in particular, the exchange of certain information with respect to US and Saint Lucia reportable accounts on an automatic basis, pursuant to the provisions of Article 4 of the Agreement between both Governments for the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes, done at Washington on January 1987 (the ‘TIEA’).
## Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters
Saint Lucia signed the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters in November 2016. Under the convention, Saint Lucia will exchange tax information based on OECD standards, but is not required to collect taxes on behalf of another country or provide assistance in the service of related documents.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
In November 2014, the G20 countries endorsed a new CRS for automatic exchange of information developed by the OECD. Under the CRS, foreign tax authorities will provide information to the IRD relating to financial accounts in their jurisdiction held by Saint Lucian residents. The IRD will, on a reciprocal basis, provide corresponding information to the foreign tax authorities on accounts held by residents of their jurisdiction in Saint Lucia. Saint Lucia has committed to implementing the CRS by September 2018.
## Inclusive Framework (IF) on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)
In May 2018, Saint Lucia joined the IF on BEPS, becoming the 114th jurisdiction to do so. By joining the IF, Saint Lucia will work on creating an equal footing with all other IF members on the implementation of the BEPS package and on developing further standards to address the remaining BEPS issues. As a signatory to the IF, Saint Lucia has committed to implementing minimum standards related to:
Subsequent to the OECD's Harmful Tax Practices - 2018 Progress Report on Preferential Regimes, the following regimes have been abolished but grandfathered in accordance with the Forum on Harmful Tax Practices:

## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
## Foreign tax relief
A tax credit for foreign tax paid is granted where income accrues to a resident in Saint Lucia, when that income has been taxed in another country, whether or not there is a double taxation agreement (DTA) with that country, and whether or not the income is covered by the applicable agreement. Where there is an agreement with another country, the tax credit is given in the manner provided in the agreement. Where there is no agreement, the tax credit is the lesser of the tax payable in the other country or the tax charged in Saint Lucia.
## Tax treaties
Saint Lucia has no tax treaties with other countries, except for certain member states that make up the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). There is an agreement among the governments of CARICOM for the avoidance of double taxation.

# Saint Lucia
## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
Individuals are assessed on income from unincorporated businesses, partnerships, employment, rentals and royalties, investment income, premiums, commissions, fees, annuities, and any other gains or profits of an income nature other than those specifically exempted in the Act.
## Employment income
Employees resident in Saint Lucia are taxed on their income from employment, including the value of any allowances or benefits, whether in cash or otherwise, received from an employer. Taxable benefits include employer-provided automobile and housing (except where representative occupation can be established) but do not include travel and entertainment allowances where the employee substantiates expenditure in the performance of duties to the extent of the allowances.
### Stock options
Stock options form part of an individual's taxable income and are subjected to the tax rates outlined in the tax table.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are not subject to tax.
## Investment income
Investment income in the form of dividends from corporations and interest from banks in Saint Lucia is exempt from income tax. For individuals not ordinarily resident in Saint Lucia (i.e. those present for a short term), interest income, if arising outside Saint Lucia, is taxable only to the extent that it is remitted to Saint Lucia.
## Intellectual property (IP)
IP forms part of an individual's taxable income and is subjected to the tax rates outlined in the tax table. If payable to a non-resident, a 25% withholding tax (WHT) rate applies.
