## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
Germany taxes its corporate residents on their worldwide income. However, most DTTs exempt income attributable to a foreign permanent establishment (PE). Non-residents with PE or property income are taxed by assessment on German-source income; those earning royalties and dividends are taxed by withholding at source. Interest paid abroad is, in most cases, free of German tax altogether.
German business profits are subject to two taxes, corporation tax and trade tax.
## Corporation tax (*Körperschaftsteuer*)
Corporation tax is levied at a uniform rate of 15% and is then subject to a surcharge of 5.5% (solidarity surcharge). This results in a total tax rate of 15.825%.
## Trade tax (*Gewerbesteuer*)
The trade tax rate is a combination of a uniform tax rate of 3.5% (base rate) and a municipal tax rate (*Hebesatz*) depending on where the PEs of the business are located. Currently, municipalities with at least 80,000 inhabitants currently levy trade tax at a rate of between 8.75% (*Hebesatz* of 250%) and 20.3% (*Hebesatz* of 580%).
The basis for this tax is the adjusted profit for corporation tax purposes: in particular, 25% of all financing costs over 200,000 euros (EUR), including the implicit financing costs in leasing, rental, and royalty payments, are added back to taxable income.
If the basis for the two taxes is identical (unlikely in practice), the overall burden on corporate profits earned in Munich would be approximately 33%. In Frankfurt, the burden would be 32%. In Berlin, it would be 30%.
## Global Anti Base Erosion Proposal – Pillar Two in Germany
## Windfall tax (EU energy crisis solidarity contribution)
The EU energy crisis contribution is to apply to EU enterprises and establishments active in the oil, natural gas, coal, and refinery sectors, which, in the relevant taxation periods 2022 and 2023, generate at least 75% of their annual turnover through business activities in the sectors of extraction, mining, refining of petroleum, or the manufacture of coke oven products. It will be levied in addition to any taxation charged under the Income Tax Act or the Corporate Tax Act. The tax rate of 33% will be applied on the assessment basis, which is calculated as the positive difference between (i) the taxable income for the relevant tax period calculated according to income or corporation tax regulations, and (ii) 1.2 times the average taxable income arising in the financial years beginning after 31 December 2017 and ending before the first tax year of the EU energy crisis solidarity contribution (i.e. 2018 to 2021 if the financial year is the calendar year).

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
All resident individuals are taxed on their worldwide income. Non-resident individuals are taxed (in case of investment and employment income usually by withholding) on German source income only.
Taxable income covers income from the following categories:
### Net income
Net income is based on all gross earnings received during a calendar year and reduced by income related expenses during the same period for each of the above categories. Losses from one of the seven basic income categories (except capital investment) can fully be offset against positive income from another income category (exceptions for 'other income' may apply).
### Taxable income
The total income after deductions in each category, which may be further reduced by lump-sum deductions or, within limits, by actual payment for special expenses defined by tax law, represents the taxable income.
## Personal income tax rates
Germany has progressive tax rates ranging as follows (2025 tax year):
| Taxable income range for single taxpayers (EUR) | | Taxable income range for married taxpayers (EUR) | | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over | Over | Not over |
| 0 | 12,096 | 0 | 24,192 | 0 |
| 12,096 | 68,429 | 24,192 | 136,858 | 14 to 42\* |
| 68,430 | 277,825 | 136,860 | 555,650 | 42 |
| 277,826 | and above | 555,652 | and above | 45 |
\* Geometrically progressive rates start at 14% and rise to 42%.
The figures are adjusted on a regular basis.
## Surcharges on income tax
To improve the economic situation and infrastructure for certain regions in need, the German government has been levying a 5.5% solidarity surcharge tax. The surcharge is imposed as a percentage on all individual income taxes.
Members of officially recognised churches pay church tax as a surcharge on their income tax. The rates are either 8% or 9% of the income tax, depending on the federal state where the individual resides.
## Trade income tax
Trade income tax is levied on business income, whereas for individuals and partnerships a tax-free amount of EUR 24,500 has to be considered (i.e. not for corporations).
The respective municipality is responsible for the final tax assessment. The rate fixed by the municipality ('*Hebesatz*') is for larger cities between approximately 250% and 580% of the basic amount, which is 3.5% of the business income.
## Local and state income taxes
There are no local or state income taxes levied in Germany.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Married couples file joint returns unless they are legally separated or one spouse requests otherwise. Annual returns must be filed by 31 July of the year following the tax year. The filing deadline expires on 28 (29) February of the second year following the tax year if the income tax return is prepared by a certified tax adviser. For the 2023 income tax returns, the deadline is 2 September 2024 (2 June 2025 if tax advisor is instructed).
There is no self-assessment. The tax office issues a final assessment notice after having reviewed the income tax return.
A non-resident taxpayer will have to file a return and receive an assessment only if the German income is not subject to wage tax withholding. Where income is subject to wage tax withholding, the income tax liability is normally settled through the withholding system and no returns or assessments are required. However, there is a tax filing obligation with progression effect for non-resident taxpayers who benefited from the so-called 'one-fifth' rule in payroll on multi-year income (e.g. long-term incentive payments) or on severance payments.
## Payment of tax
In general, taxes are payable within one month of the date that the final assessment is issued. Tax on wages and salaries is withheld at source. The same applies for capital investment income with domestic banks. The amounts withheld are treated as a payment on account of the final income tax liability. If taxpayers have additional income not subject to withholding, they will usually be asked to make quarterly instalments. Assessed quarterly instalments are due on 10 March, 10 June, 10 September, and 10 December.
A self-employed person must prepay income tax that will be offset on filing an annual return. The advance payment is determined on the basis of the return made for the previous year. In the event of a new business, the advance will be calculated on the basis of estimates made by the owner of the business. The advance payment is made on the dates mentioned above.
## Tax audit process
The supreme tax authority in Germany is the Federal Ministry of Finance (*Bundesministerium der Finanzen*), whereas the taxpayer usually deals with the local tax offices. Employees are usually not audited as the annual income tax return is already subject to review (all income tax returns are subject to an internal review with the tax authorities prior to issuing the tax assessment). However, employees with income exceeding EUR 500,000 per year might be subject to additional audits.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitation for income tax returns usually amounts to four years. An extension up to five years is possible in cases of tax evasion or up to ten years in cases of tax fraud, with even longer periods for criminal prosecution. Further prescriptions have to be considered regarding the start date and suspension of the statute of limitation.
Tax authorities in the meanwhile focus on international mobile employees and assignees. Specific forms within the annual income tax return have to be filed to provide the tax office with more detailed information about the assignment.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
Proceeds of sales and services effected in Germany are subject to VAT under the common system of the European Union at the standard rate of 19% (7% on certain items, such as food and books, and 0% for the sale and installation of photovoltaic systems and certain related devices). The taxpayer is generally entitled to deduct the VAT charged on inputs from that payable on outputs.
VAT is generally administered by the tax office in the district where the taxable person operates one's business, wholly or predominantly; for taxable persons established abroad, the responsible tax office depends upon the taxable person’s country of establishment. As a general rule, preliminary VAT returns are filed on a monthly or quarterly basis by the tenth day of the following month (e.g. monthly where the VAT payable in the previous calendar year exceeded EUR 7,500). The taxpayer may be relieved from the obligation to file preliminary returns if the VAT payable in the previous calendar year did not exceed EUR 1,000 (EUR 2,500 from 2025 onwards). A permanent filing extension of one month is generally available against an advance payment of one-eleventh of the total net tax due during the previous year. Otherwise, payment is due by the tenth day of the following month as well.
Legally, VAT is an annual tax. Each taxpayer must, as a general rule, file an annual return for each calendar year, regardless of the actual accounting date for the business. If the sum total of the annual return does not agree with the total of the monthly or quarterly returns, the tax office can generally be expected to ask for a detailed explanation.
There are additional reporting obligations in certain cases, particularly in cases of cross-border intra-EU supplies of goods and services to other taxable persons.
The Growth Opportunities Act (*Wachstumschancengesetz*) of 27 March 2024 introduced mandatory electronic invoicing for supplies of goods and services between taxable persons (B2B) established in Germany (in the case of a local establishment via a fixed base: provided that establishment is involved in the respective supply). The electronic invoice must be issued, transmitted, and received in a specific structured electronic format and also enable electronic processing. The law contains various transitional provisions starting 1 January 2025. The general transition period is two years (up to and including 2026), and the transition period for small entrepreneurs with a total turnover of up to EUR 800,000 in the previous calendar year is three years (up to and including 2027). Another transition period of three years relates to the transmission of e-invoices in other formats if transmitted by means of electronic data interchange (EDI). Please note that the transitional provisions merely refer to the issuing of e-invoices while the receipt of e-invoices is obligatory in domestic B2B cases already from 2025. In cases not subject to obligatory e-invoicing, any e-invoicing (including but not limited to e-invoicing in the above format) is subject to approval of the recipient.
## Customs duties
Customs duties are levied under a common system on imports into the European Union. The rate is set at zero on most imports from EU candidate countries and on many imports from countries with which the European Union has an association agreement.
For manufactured products from other countries, the rates generally lie within the range of 0% to 15%. The basis is the import value of the goods and thus includes uplifts for royalty or other payments associated with their use but not apparent from the transit documents.
The European Commission (EC) also sets ‘countervailing’ duties from time to time on specific imports from specific countries in order to counter attempts at dumping. The countervailing duty rate is set to fully absorb the dumping margin and is therefore usually much higher than 15%.
In terms of customs valuation, the eagerly awaited ruling of the German Supreme Tax Court (17 May 2022 /VII R 2/19) in the Hamamatsu case was issued. While the relevant European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruling (C-529/16) had already raised questions of implementation, associated companies that declare a transfer price as the basis for customs valuation are now facing severe problems, as the dicta of the Supreme Tax Court can partly be interpreted in many ways. A first interpretation was made by the Munich tax court (14 K 588/20), which ruled that subsequent adjustments to levies based on flat-rate transfer price adjustments were also unjustified. Now the Federal Fiscal Court (VII R 36/22) must decide in the appeal proceedings.
A further challenge for many companies is that customs processing is increasingly becoming IT-based and the customs administration are increasingly focusing on internal control systems. Recently, the EU commission published a proposal for a general customs reform that suggests, in particular, a new EU database. The envisaged comprehensive reform of the EU Customs Code is going to bring innovations in the near future. Numerous changes are planned, including the establishment of an EU customs authority.
Since the 2022 escalation of the war of Russia against Ukraine, not only political representatives, but also companies and the general population, have been increasingly impacted. The 15th EU sanctions package against Russia was published in the Official Journal of the EU on 16 December 2024. These measures are also far-reaching. For example, ships in the Russian shadow fleet are sanctioned, and the sanctions list was expanded by 94 additional listings. In addition, 32 further companies were subjected to stricter export restrictions in relation to dual-use goods. Also, further measures were imposed in the financial sector. In order to comply with the sanction regulations, many companies needed to improve the control of operational processes, to clearly define personnel responsibilities, and to audit standardised processes.
## Excise taxes
Excise taxes on fuel, electric power, and some other products are not a compliance issue for businesses other than dealers in bonded goods, although they can be a significant additional cost factor for business users. These excise taxes also have an environmental element in as much as the rates are set to discourage excessive use of pollutants. However, an air passenger duty is the only tax on pollution per se. Energy producers (such as power stations) can claim a refund of the excise tax borne in the cost of the energy products used in the production process. In the area of both refunds and taxation, reforms have been announced, meaning that both the basis for refunds and, in particular, the tax rates on special energy products will have to be reviewed. The system will give preference to sustainable energy products in the future.
The draft law to modernise and reduce bureaucracy in energy and electricity tax law (*Gesetz zur Modernisierung und zum Bürokratieabbau im Strom- und Energiesteuerrecht*), which was published in May 2024, is intended to modernise and reduce bureaucracy in energy and electricity tax law. The laws are to be updated with regard to electromobility, among other things. Due to the dissolution of the governing coalition, it is not clear whether it will still be implemented in this legislative period.
What is certain, however, is that digitalisation at the administrative level is well advanced in the area of excise duty; from 2025, it will only be possible to submit many applications via the customs portal.
## Environmental taxes
Besides the air passenger duty and environmental elements in excise taxes, there are no environmental taxes, as such, in Germany.
## Property taxes
There are no taxes on wealth or capital employed. There is a minor local authority tax on property, but the effect of this is partly offset by an additional trade tax deduction.
## Stamp taxes
The only significant German stamp tax is the real estate transfer tax (RETT) charged on the consideration on conveyances of German property. The rate varies by province; from 2024 the rate is 3.5% for property in Bavaria; 5% in Baden-Württemberg, Bremen, Lower Saxony, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia; 5.5% in Hamburg and Saxony; 6% in Berlin, Hesse, and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania; and 6.5% in Brandenburg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Saarland, and Schleswig-Holstein.
This tax may also be levied on the direct or indirect transfers of at least 90% of the shares in property-owning companies or the interest in property owning partnerships (so-called 'share deals') to new shareholders/partners within a ten-year period. This applies to shares/interests of the shareholder/partner throughout the chain of participation. Further an (economic) 'unification' of 90% of the shares/interest in a property-owning corporation/partnership can also give rise to a taxable event.
In any case of a transfer of German real property or a transfer of real property-owning companies subject to RETT, the tax authorities have to be notified. While notification requirements are in general fulfilled by the responsible notary if German real property is transferred, there are special notification obligations for the parties involved if shares in a real property-owning company are transferred. Missing a timely notification may result in penalties and, under certain circumstances, even to a substantial additional tax burden.
In general, RETT is calculated based on the value of the consideration. Where RETT is triggered due to a restructuring, transfer of shares in a corporation or interest in a partnership of at least 90%, or in cases where no consideration exists, the tax base is determined based on the valuation principles applied for inheritance tax purposes.
Subject to certain conditions, German RETT is not levied on direct or indirect transfers (without the payment of consideration) in the course of a corporate reorganisation under the laws of a member state of the European Economic Area (EEA), provided at least 95% of the interest of the controlling entity in the parties involved in the reorganisation remains unchanged for five years before and after the transaction (group privilege).
## Payroll taxes
Employers are required to pay employee remuneration under deduction of the income tax due. The amounts deducted are paid over to the tax office at regular, usually monthly, intervals. The actual deductions are calculated from the gross pay, taking the employee’s marital, family, and other personal circumstances into account. The necessary personal details can be downloaded from a government database. For the employee, the payroll tax deduction is in general a prepayment on the income tax due after filing one’s annual income tax return. As such, the payroll tax is a withholding tax (WHT) and not a financial burden on the employer. However, employers are required to deduct the correct amounts and are thus exposed to the risk from a later tax audit assertion of under-deduction, especially as there are often legal or practical impediments to recovery from the employees after the event. The administrative effort involved is also far from insignificant.
## Social security contributions
All employers are required to account for social security contributions on wages and salaries paid, up to an income ceiling (monthly limits). There are five branches of social security insurance: pension insurance, unemployment benefits, health care insurance, nursing care insurance, and work accident insurance. All branches are compulsory for all employees. However, employees regularly earning more than EUR 73,800 in 2025 can opt out of the health and nursing care insurances if they take out appropriate coverage with a private insurance company. The pension and unemployment contributions are capped by a monthly upper salary limit of EUR 8,040 (2025) with a monthly upper salary cap of EUR 5,512.50 (2025) for health and nursing care insurances.
From 1 January 2025, the rates are as follows:

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year in Germany is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Returns are filed for each calendar year and reflect the financial statements for the business year ending in that calendar year. Assessments are issued once the tax office has reviewed the return.
Returns are, in principle, due by 31 July of the following year. However, for tax returns prepared by a professional tax adviser, the deadline is extended to the last day of February of the subsequent year. Under certain conditions (e.g. known late-filers and those with a record of other irregularities), one can be asked to submit their returns before these extension dates, though not before 31 July.
For tax years 2019 to 2024, the deadlines for filing tax returns have been extended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
### Electronic returns
Please note that, under the special procedures for foreign taxable persons, certain VAT related reports and applications, such as the EC Sales List and VAT refund applications, must be submitted electronically as well.
## Payment of tax
Taxes are payable in quarterly instalments during the year, with a final settlement when the assessment is issued. The quarterly instalments are based on the estimated ultimate liability. Usually, this is the total tax due shown by the last assessment issued, as adjusted by any rate changes. The corporation tax instalments are due on the tenth day of March, June, September, and December. For trade tax, the due dates are the 15th day of February, May, August, and November. Failure to pay by the due date followed by a three-day period of grace leads to a penalty of 1% per month.
Corporation and trade tax assessments bear interest on the net amount payable after deduction of all credits and previous payments.
In principle, the interest period begins 15 months after the year-end for which taxes are levied. For the tax years 2020 through 2024, the interest period has been delayed by two to six months due to extended filing deadlines for tax returns as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic.
For periods from 1 January 2019 onwards, an interest rate of 0.15% per month (1.8% per year) applies. In the light of the enduring low-interest period, the German Constitutional Court declared the interest rate of 0.5% per month to be unconstitutional from 2014 onwards. Nevertheless, the 0.5% interest rate remains applicable for interest periods until 31 December 2018.
## Rulings
Tax offices are able to issue binding rulings in respect of planned transactions, provided the taxpayer can show a particular interest in the tax consequences of the intended action. The fee varies between EUR 266 and EUR 120,721 depending upon the amount of tax involved (no fee is charged if the tax amount is less than EUR 10,000).
## Advance pricing agreements (APAs)
A taxpayer can request the Central Tax Office to negotiate an APA on related-party transactions with a foreign tax authority on one's behalf. The vehicle is the mutual agreement procedure under the treaty, and the fee is a lump sum EUR 30,000 for each new agreement.
## Tax audit process
Germany relies heavily on tax audits as a means of ensuring taxpayer discipline. Audits of small businesses are carried out on a random basis, although those for larger corporations and for the local subsidiaries of foreign groups tend to be regular. With some district variations, audits are usually conducted at four to five yearly intervals, though not always with equal intensity for the entire period since the auditors’ previous visit.
## Statute of limitations
The statutory limitation period for the issue or correction of assessments is four years from the end of the year in which the return was filed. If no return was filed, the period runs from the end of the third year following the end of the year of assessment. The four-year period is extended to five in cases of taxpayer negligence and to ten in the event of evasion.
The statutory limitation period for the collection of tax debts is five years from the end of the year in which payment became due.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
## Social security contributions
The following social security contributions (as of January 2022) are levied on employment income. Employer contributions are generally tax-free.
An individual can apply for private health and long-term care insurance if certain conditions are met.
Self-employed individuals generally do not have to pay mandatory social security contributions.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
Proceeds of sales and services provided in Germany are subject to VAT under the common system of the European Union (EU) at the standard rate of 19% (7% on certain items, such as food and books). For an interim period between 1 July 2020 and 31 December 2020, the rates were reduced to 16% and 5%. An entrepreneurial taxpayer generally is entitled to deduct the VAT charged on input from that payable on output.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
At this point of time, no wealth taxes are levied in Germany.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Inheritance and gift tax is a tax levied on lifetime gifts and on transfers of value passing on death. This tax is imposed on transfers if testator/donor and/or heir/donee is a German tax resident. If no individual is involved who is resident in Germany under national tax rules, only the transfer of assets situated in Germany is liable. Tax benefits for business assets are possible.
Progressive tax rates of 7% up to 50% and tax-free amounts between EUR 20,000 and EUR 500,000 apply, depending on the value and the degree of the relationship between testator/donor and beneficiary. For the calculation of the tax, acquisitions within the last ten years are taken into account. The allowances are granted once every ten years. For a surviving spouse, an additional tax-free allowance of EUR 256,000 is granted. This allowance is reduced by the discounted value of any pension entitlements, which are not subject to inheritance tax. For surviving children, an additional tax-free allowance of up to EUR 52,000, depending on age at the time of inheritance, may apply.
## Property tax
There is a local tax on real estate property. The respective municipality is responsible for the final tax assessment. As the current system of the property tax has been declared unconstitutional by the German Federal Constitutional Court, it can only be levied in its current form on a transitional basis until 31 December 2024. From 1 January 2025, property tax will then be levied on the basis of the new law. The property tax reform of 2025 replaces the previous unconstitutional system from 1935/1964 with a new valuation model that takes into account the current value of the property.
The property values are reassessed as part of this reform. Much of the data required for the revaluation of real property is not available to the tax authorities in electronically usable form, so that they had to be collected from the property owners. Even if the reform as a whole is designed to be revenue-neutral (i.e. all taxpayers do not pay more or less property tax), individual tax payments will change.
## Luxury taxes
There are no additional taxes on luxury goods in Germany.
## Real estate transfer tax
Real estate transfer tax is levied at 3.5% to 6.5% of the consideration on all conveyances of German property.
It is also levied on indirect transfers on acquisition of at least 90% of the shares (directly or indirectly) in property owning companies.
The tax is not levied on direct or indirect transfers without consideration in the course of a corporate reorganisation, under the laws of a member state of the European Economic Area (EEA), provided that at least 90% of the ultimate interest in the property remains unchanged for ten years before and after the transaction.
Tax exemptions are available, among others, for transfers between relatives in a direct line and transfers that are already subject to the German Inheritance and Gift Tax Act.
## Customs duties
Customs duties are levied under a common system on imports into the European Union, and the rates depend on various criteria. The basis is the import value of the goods. The European Commission also sets 'countervailing' duties from time to time on specific imports from specific countries in order to counter dumping attempts.

# Germany
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
The taxable income is generally determined on the basis of a tax balance sheet, which in turn is based on the statutory accounts according to German generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). There are certain specific tax law and accounting adjustments to be made to the statutory accounts, and additional accounting options are available. If accounting options are exercised in the tax balance sheet that diverge from the financial statements according to German GAAP, a register must be kept of the resulting variances between the financial statements and the tax computation showing the basis on which each arose and its reversal. International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) financial statements are not accepted as a basis for computing taxable income.
## Inventory valuation
Inventories are normally valued at the lower of actual cost, replacement cost, and net realisable value. However, any write-downs below actual cost must be made for specific reasons. If specific identification of the inventories is not possible, valuation at either standard or average cost is acceptable. The last in first out (LIFO) method is accepted as an option where it meets German GAAP in the individual case.
## Long-term liabilities and accruals
Long-term liabilities and accruals are generally recognised at the settlement amount. Accruals with a remaining term of 12 months or more must be discounted at 5.5% per year with an exception for accruals for obligations that are interest-bearing or based on a down payment or advance payment.
## Capital gains
Generally, capital gains realised by a corporate entity from a disposal of business assets are treated as ordinary income. It is possible to postpone the taxation of part or all of the gain on real estate by offsetting the gain against the cost of a replacement property.
Capital gains from the sale of investments in other corporations are exempt from corporation and trade taxes. Corresponding losses are not deductible. However, 5% of the capital gains are added back to taxable income as non-deductible expenses where the seller is resident or has a PE/representative in Germany.
## Dividend income
Dividends received on significant holdings are exempt from corporation and trade taxes. Portfolio dividends are taxable. For corporation tax and trade tax purposes, different qualified portfolio holdings are applicable. In relation to corporation tax, a minimum shareholding of at least 10% is required and must be met at the beginning of the calendar year in which the dividend was received. For trade tax purposes, a minimum shareholding of at least 15% at the beginning of the relevant tax year is required.
For corporation tax purposes, 5% of the tax-free gross dividend is added back to taxable income as non-deductible business expenses. For dividends exempted for corporation tax purposes as well as for trade tax purposes, the taxable amount of 5% of the dividends for corporation tax purposes is also taxable for trade tax purposes.
Note that banks do not enjoy this exemption on dividends from securities held for trading.
### Stock dividends
## Interest income
Interest received is taxed as part of a company’s ordinary trading income. There is no exemption corresponding to the trade tax disallowance of 25% of the interest expense or to the general tax disallowance of net interest expense in excess of 30% of ‘earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation’ (EBITDA) under the interest limitation rule (*see the [Deductions](germany/corporate/deductions.html) section*). However, since the interest limitation is based on the net interest margin, a company can benefit from earning income as interest as opposed to an interest substitute.
## Royalty income
Royalties received are taxed as part of a company’s ordinary trading income. There is no special regime such as an IP Box or the like.
Based on the wording of long-standing German tax law, income generated upon the licensing of IP rights or the sale of IP rights may be considered to be within the scope of German non-resident taxation if the underlying IP is registered in a German book or register. This may hold true even if the transactions are 'foreign-to-foreign', i.e. do not include a German resident counter-party. The respective rules have been amended through the Finance Act 2022 (*Jahressteuergesetz 2022*). According to the new regulation, royalties and capital gains received from 1 January 2023 onwards are only subject to limited taxation where a tax treaty precluding Germany’s taxation right of the income does not exist or cannot be claimed in the specific case (e.g. based on the German domestic anti-treaty shopping rules) or if the payment is made to a taxpayer residing in a tax haven within the meaning of the German Tax Haven Defence Act (*Steueroasenabwehrgesetz*) (*see the [Other issues](germany/corporate/other-issues.html) section*).
## Foreign income
Foreign income, except dividends, received by a resident corporation from foreign sources is included in taxable income for corporation tax unless a tax treaty provides for an exemption. Foreign PE income, in most cases, is exempt from corporation and trade taxes, while double taxation on most items of passive income (e.g. interest and royalties) is avoided by foreign tax credit or, at the taxpayer’s option, by a deduction of the foreign taxes as an expense.
Irrespective of any tax treaty, income from a foreign branch or partnership is, in general, not subject to trade tax. However, certain passive income arising to a foreign PE will be deemed to have been earned by a domestic PE for trade tax purposes.
The Foreign Tax Act provides for anti-avoidance (including controlled foreign company [CFC]) rules with respect to subsidiaries in certain lines of business subject to a low-tax regime. A low-tax regime is one in which the rate applicable to the income in question is less than 15% for business years of the subsidiary ending after 31 December 2023 or 25% for business years of the subsidiary ending before 1 January 2023. Most forms of passive income fall under the CFC rules, which essentially attribute the income to the German shareholder as though it had been earned directly. Active business income is not generally caught where the business operates from adequately established facilities.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
Resident corporations paying certain types of income are required to withhold tax as shown in the following tables. There is also a solidarity surcharge of 5.5% on the tax due.
## General
| Recipient of German-source income | WHT (%) | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dividends (1) | Interest (1) | Royalties |
| Resident corporations and individuals | 25 | 0/25 (2) | 0 |
| Non-resident corporations and individuals (1): |  |  |  |
| EU corporations (4, 5) | 0/25 | 0/25 (3) | 0/15 |
| Non-treaty corporations | 25 | 0/25 (3) | 15 |
| Non-treaty individuals | 25 | 0/25 (3) | 15 |
Notes
1. Corporate recipients of dividend and interest income (interest on convertible and profit-sharing bonds) can apply for refund of the tax withheld over the corporation tax rate of 15% plus solidarity surcharge, regardless of any further relief available under a treaty.
2. Generally, only interest paid by banks to a resident is subject to a WHT. A 25% tax plus solidarity surcharge is also withheld from income on convertible or profit-sharing bonds.
3. Interest paid to non-residents other than on convertible or profit-sharing bonds and over-the-counter transactions is generally free of WHT. Tax on loans secured on German property is not imposed by withholding, but by assessment to corporation tax at 15% (plus solidarity surcharge) of the interest income net of attributable expenses. The tax authorities can order a WHT of 15.825% (including solidarity surcharge) if ultimate collection of the tax due is in doubt. Both forms of tax are reduced by treaty relief.
4. Where the EC Parent/Subsidiary Directive applies, dividends paid by a German company to a qualifying parent company resident in another EU member state are exempted from German WHT. The minimum shareholding is 10%, to be held continuously for at least one year.
5. The EC Interest and Royalties Directive exempts payments from WHT if made to an associated company in another EU member state. The association must be through a common shareholding of at least 25%.

Notes
1. Corporate recipients of dividend and interest income (interest on convertible and profit-sharing bonds) can apply for refund of the tax withheld over the corporation tax rate of 15% plus solidarity surcharge, regardless of any further relief available under a treaty.
2. Generally, only interest paid by banks to a resident is subject to a WHT. A 25% tax plus solidarity surcharge is also withheld from income on convertible or profit-sharing bonds.
3. Interest paid to non-residents other than on convertible or profit-sharing bonds and over-the-counter transactions is generally free of WHT. Tax on loans secured on German property is not imposed by withholding, but by assessment to corporation tax at 15% (plus solidarity surcharge) of the interest income net of attributable expenses. The tax authorities can order a WHT of 15.825% (including solidarity surcharge) if ultimate collection of the tax due is in doubt. Both forms of tax are reduced by treaty relief.
4. The lower rates on dividends apply under certain conditions (minimum shareholding, specific shareholders, in some cases minimum holding period).
5. The treaty does not limit the taxation of certain profit-based interest income, which is deducted by the debtor from their tax base; consequently, the domestic rate (plus solidarity surcharge) applies.
6. The USSR treaty continues in force with Moldova.
7. The applicable maximum WHT rate on royalties depends on the type of royalty granted (film and television royalties, trademarks, patents, franchises, etc.).
8. The lower rate on interest income applies under certain circumstances (e.g. for certain recipients, such as banks or pension funds, or for interest paid in connection with certain purchases on credit).
9. The Yugoslav treaty continues in force with Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, and Serbia.
10. The dividend exemption applies under certain conditions to corporate shareholders with at least 80% throughout the previous 12 months.
11. The Czechoslovak treaty continues to apply to the Czech Republic and to Slovakia. Interest on profit-sharing bonds is taxed as a dividend.
12. Treaty expired on 31 December 2021.
13. The lower rate applies to royalties paid for the use of industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment.
14. The treaty is not applicable for the years 2024 onwards to the extent that German taxing rights are limited due to the treaty. This is due to the treaty override in Section 1 (3) of the Tax Haven Defence Act (*Steueroasenabwehrgesetz*), *see the [Other issues](germany/corporate/other-issues.html) section*.
Treaties or protocols amending existing treaties have been signed but await ratification with Austria, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Oman, and South Africa.

Proceeds of sales and services provided in Germany are subject to VAT under the common system of the European Union (EU) at the standard rate of 19% (7% on certain items, such as food and books). For an interim period between 1 July 2020 and 31 December 2020, the rates were reduced to 16% and 5%. An entrepreneurial taxpayer generally is entitled to deduct the VAT charged on input from that payable on output.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
At this point of time, no wealth taxes are levied in Germany.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Inheritance and gift tax is a tax levied on lifetime gifts and on transfers of value passing on death. This tax is imposed on transfers if testator/donor and/or heir/donee is a German tax resident. If no individual is involved who is resident in Germany under national tax rules, only the transfer of assets situated in Germany is liable. Tax benefits for business assets are possible.
Progressive tax rates of 7% up to 50% and tax-free amounts between EUR 20,000 and EUR 500,000 apply, depending on the value and the degree of the relationship between testator/donor and beneficiary. For the calculation of the tax, acquisitions within the last ten years are taken into account. The allowances are granted once every ten years. For a surviving spouse, an additional tax-free allowance of EUR 256,000 is granted. This allowance is reduced by the discounted value of any pension entitlements, which are not subject to inheritance tax. For surviving children, an additional tax-free allowance of up to EUR 52,000, depending on age at the time of inheritance, may apply.
## Property tax
There is a local tax on real estate property. The respective municipality is responsible for the final tax assessment. As the current system of the property tax has been declared unconstitutional by the German Federal Constitutional Court, it can only be levied in its current form on a transitional basis until 31 December 2024. From 1 January 2025, property tax will then be levied on the basis of the new law. The property tax reform of 2025 replaces the previous unconstitutional system from 1935/1964 with a new valuation model that takes into account the current value of the property.
The property values are reassessed as part of this reform. Much of the data required for the revaluation of real property is not available to the tax authorities in electronically usable form, so that they had to be collected from the property owners. Even if the reform as a whole is designed to be revenue-neutral (i.e. all taxpayers do not pay more or less property tax), individual tax payments will change.
## Luxury taxes
There are no additional taxes on luxury goods in Germany.
## Real estate transfer tax
Real estate transfer tax is levied at 3.5% to 6.5% of the consideration on all conveyances of German property.
It is also levied on indirect transfers on acquisition of at least 90% of the shares (directly or indirectly) in property owning companies.
The tax is not levied on direct or indirect transfers without consideration in the course of a corporate reorganisation, under the laws of a member state of the European Economic Area (EEA), provided that at least 90% of the ultimate interest in the property remains unchanged for ten years before and after the transaction.
Tax exemptions are available, among others, for transfers between relatives in a direct line and transfers that are already subject to the German Inheritance and Gift Tax Act.
## Customs duties
Customs duties are levied under a common system on imports into the European Union, and the rates depend on various criteria. The basis is the import value of the goods. The European Commission also sets 'countervailing' duties from time to time on specific imports from specific countries in order to counter dumping attempts.

## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
Following the collapse of the governing coalition in November 2024, the legislative process in the German parliament (*Bundestag*) became more difficult towards the end of the year 2024. Early elections are envisaged to take place on 23 February 2025. Against this background, it is not clear which legislative projects will still be implemented in this legislative period. This, *inter alia*, applies to the Act to Modernise and Reduce Bureaucracy in Energy and Electricity Taxes (*Gesetz zur Modernisierung und zum Bürokratieabbau im Strom- und Energiesteuerrecht*) and the Second Future Financing Act (*Zweites Zukunftsfinanzierungsgesetz*).
Surprisingly, the former coalition partners agreed on 13 December 2024 to implement the Tax Reform Act (*Steuerfortentwicklungsgesetz*), which foresees certain minor adjustments to the income tax rate. On 19 December 2024, the *Bundestag* approved a ’lite‘ version of the Tax Reform Act. The controversially discussed reporting obligations for domestic tax arrangements are no longer included in the Act. Further, other changes to income tax rates were already implemented with the Act on the Tax Exemption of the Minimum Subsistence Level (*Gesetz zur steuerlichen Freistellung des Existenzminimums*) earlier in December 2024.
Additionally, an updated version of the Tax Haven Defence Ordinance was issued in December 2024 reflecting the recent European Union (EU) blacklist of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes.
Furthermore, on 5 December 2024, the Federal Ministry of Finance published a discussion draft for a Minimum Tax Adjustment Act (*Mindeststeueranpassungsgesetz*). This Act aims to adjust German Pillar Two Rules and to implement the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Administrative Guidance of June 2024. The discussion draft also foresees changes in income taxation (e.g. the abolition of the royalty limitation rule).
The legislative process for the so-called Finance Act 2024 (*Jahressteuergesetz* 2024). was finalized in December 2024. This Act implements changes to various areas of German tax law focusing on technical adjustments required by EU law and case law as well as follow-up amendments to previous legislative changes.
The legislative process for the Bureaucracy Relief Act (*Viertes Bürokratieentlastungsgesetz*) was finalised in October 2024. Additionally, a so-called Multilateral Instrument (MLI) Implementation Act modifying nine German double taxation treaties (DTTs) according to the MLI passed through parliamentary procedures in June 2024.
Furthermore, at the beginning of the year, the legislative process for the Growth Opportunities Act (*Wachstumschancengesetz*) was finalised. Nevertheless, the broad tax incentives for investments in climate protection, which were included by the *Bundestag* in November 2023 in the first legislative resolution on the law, have now been removed. Among other things, the Act includes changes in the treatment of net operating losses, a temporary reintroduction of extended depreciation rates for movable assets, and new regulations restricting the deductibility of interest from cross-border financing relationships.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
A corporation is resident in Germany for tax purposes if its place of incorporation or its main place of management is in Germany. A corporation meeting neither of these criteria will be regarded as non-resident with tax obligations limited to its income from German sources. These include active business activities through a PE or the letting of property and equipment rental (leasing), as well as specific investment income and royalties. Income of the first three categories is generally taxed by assessment on the actual net earnings. That of the last two is usually taxed at source by withholding from the gross amount payable. Interest paid to a non-resident is generally not taxable (certain exceptions apply, e.g. in respect to interest on convertible or profit-sharing bonds).
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Domestic law defines a PE as any fixed business facility serving the corporate purpose. A permanent representative is someone who 'habitually' deals on behalf of the principal acting on the principal's instructions. In its tax treaty PE definitions, Germany mostly follows the OECD model. Recent tax treaties partly reflect the Authorised OECD Approach to PE income. The Authorised OECD Approach has been adopted into domestic law and is generally followed in practice unless doing so would lead to double taxation from continued adherence to the old approach (of treating a PE as part of the same legal entity as its head office) in the other state. The widening to the PE definition in the 2017 update of the OECD Model Tax Convention following the so-called 'Multilateral Instrument' (MLI) of 24 November 2016 has (partly) been reflected in some of the German DTTs. As a consequence of the implementation of the MLI, PE-relevant changes in the DTTs with Croatia, Slovakia, and Spain are to be applied from 1 January 2025 onwards. The DTT with Japan contains PE-relevant changes and is covered by the MLI Implementation Act too but has not yet received official notification. Some other tax treaties have or will be amended selectively through bilateral agreements.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
## Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation on movable fixed assets is calculated on the straight-line method over the asset’s anticipated useful life. Depreciation takes the residual value of the asset into account only if it is material, with any gains on a sale being treated as normal business income. Certain assets worth less than EUR 800 can be depreciated in total in the year of acquisition. Alternatively, certain assets acquired in one business year worth less than EUR 1,000 each can be pooled together as a compound item and depreciated over five years.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, enhanced depreciation rates were introduced for movable assets acquired or made after 31 December 2019 and before 1 January 2023 of up to the factor of 2.5 compared to regularly applicable straight-line depreciation rates and up to a maximum of 25% *per annum*.
Furthermore, according to the legislative changes in the Growth Opportunities Act of 27 March 2024, for movable fixed assets that are acquired or manufactured after 31 March 2024 and before 1 January 2025, the declining-balance method may be applied instead of the straight-line method with a depreciation rate of up to 20% *per annum* with a maximum of two times the straight-line depreciation rate.
For other movable assets, the regular straight-line method applies.
The German tax administration allows, for business years ending 31 December 2020 onwards, the taxpayer to assume a useful life of only one year for specific digital assets (software and hardware) for tax purposes, resulting in a full depreciation/amortisation of the acquisition costs in the year of the acquisition. The measure is also available for the remaining acquisition costs of the assets acquired in earlier business years.
Buildings are depreciated on a variety of straight-line or reducing-rate systems designed to reach a full write-down between 25 and 50 years, depending on the age of the building and on whether the taxpayer was its first owner. With changes coming into force by 1 January 2023, the regular deprecation rate for buildings for residential purposes completed after 31 December 2022 has been increased from 2% *per annum* to 3% *per annum.*
Through the Growth Opportunities Act of 27 March 2024, a declining-balance depreciation of 5% was introduced for residential buildings whose construction begins after 30 September 2023 and ends before 1 October 2029 or whose acquisition is based on a legally binding contract concluded after 30 September 2023 and before 1 October 2029.
In addition to normal depreciation, special depreciation is deductible for tax purposes in certain limited circumstances (e.g. small businesses, ancient monuments, buildings in designated renovated city zones).
Acquired intangibles are amortised straight-line over their estimated useful lives; goodwill is amortised over 15 years.
Assets such as securities, stocks and bonds, shares, land, and working assets cannot be depreciated according to plan.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up and formation expenses are deductible as incurred.
## Interest limitation
Annual net interest expense (the excess of interest paid over that received) is only deductible at up to 30% of EBITDA for corporation and trade tax purposes. The 30% limitation applies to all interest, whether the debt is granted by a shareholder, related party, or a third party.
The interest limitation rule has been adapted in order to meet to the requirements of the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD). The definition of 'interest expense' has been broadened for business years that begin after 14 December 2023 but do not end before 1 January 2024. Whilst previously the rule only covered remuneration paid for borrowed capital, it now also applies to ’economically equivalent‘ expenses and other expenses connected with the procurement of borrowed capital within the meaning of the ATAD.
This limitation does not apply where the total net interest expense for the year is less than EUR 3 million or where there is a stand-alone operation. In order to adapt the interest limitation rule to the requirements of the ATAD, the definition of a stand-alone operation has been amended for business years that begin after 14 December 2023 but do not end before 1 January 2024. According to the amended version, it is a requirement of the stand-alone operation exception that the taxpayer is not a related party to any other person within the meaning of Section 1 (2) Foreign Taxes Act and that it does not have a PE outside its country of residence. A further exemption applies where the net amount paid to any one shareholder of more than 25% (or a related party) is no more than 10% of the total. However, this latter concession is dependent on showing that the equity-to-gross assets ratio of the company is no more than two percentage points below that of the group as a whole.
Unused EBITDA potential may be carried forward for up to five years to cover future excess interest cost. Non-deductible interest expenses can be carried forward without time limit and will be deductible from future income as if it were interest of the relevant year (viz. there is an excess of EBITDA). This carryforward is otherwise subject to the same principles as the loss carryforward, including curtailment on change of shareholder(s).
In a decision on 14 October 2015, the Federal Fiscal Court held the interest limitation to be in breach of the constitution and asked the German Federal Constitutional Court to give a definitive ruling. Only the Constitutional Court is authorised to decide if the regulation is unconstitutional and may thus no longer be applied.
It must be emphasised that the interest limitation is additional to, and not a substitute for, the transfer pricing requirement that related-party finance be at arm’s length.
## Royalty limitation
Following (and beyond) the OECD recommendations on Action 5 of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project, Germany has introduced a restriction on the deductibility of certain royalty payments to related parties. According to the royalty limitation rules, expenses arising for the assignment of use or the right to use rights, in particular of copyrights and industrial property rights, in trade, technical, scientific and similar know-how, knowledge, and skills (e.g. plans, designs, processes), may not be a deductible business expense or may only be partially deductible.
The limitation will apply where:
If the conditions of the provisions are met, the expenses in question will become proportionately non-deductible. The non-deductible portion of expenses is calculated as follows:
(15% *-* Income tax burden in %) / 15%
## Hybrid mismatch arrangements
Under Article 9 and 9b of the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD), EU member states are, *inter* *alia*, required to disallow the tax deduction of expenses that arise from hybrid mismatch arrangements. Hybrid mismatches can arise (i) if the income corresponding to the expenses is not taxed (or is taxed at a lower rate) in the creditor's jurisdiction (deduction / non-inclusion; D/NI outcome) or (ii) if the expenses are tax deductible in another jurisdiction (double deduction; DD outcome). An exception may apply to the extent the taxpayer has so-called 'dual inclusion income' (i.e. income that is included in the ordinary income of two jurisdictions).
In addition, the tax deduction of expenses shall be disallowed in cases of an imported hybrid mismatch. An imported hybrid mismatch can arise if a hybrid mismatch between two foreign jurisdictions is shifted ('imported') into another jurisdiction via the use of a non-hybrid instrument (e.g. normal loan).
The aforementioned obligation was implemented into German law by the introduction of Section 4k Income Tax Act (ITA) in June 2021 being applicable for expenses incurred after 31 December 2019. Section 4k ITA is accompanied by amendments in other sections of the German ITA and CITA to ensure the inclusion as ordinary income in cases of hybrid mismatch arrangements (e.g. through disallowing the application of the German domestic participation exemption).
A grandfathering rule exempts certain expenses that were already legally incurred before 1 January 2020.
## Bad debts
Bad debts incurred on trading with unrelated parties are deductible once it is apparent that they are irrecoverable and all attempts to pursue the debt have failed or been abandoned. Provision for future bad debts may be made; general provisions must reflect the past experience of the business; specific provisions require specific justification based on the actual circumstances. Expenses from the write-down of loans or similar liabilities due to shareholders of more than 25% or to their related parties may not be deducted from taxable income unless a third-party creditor would have granted the loan or allowed it to remain outstanding in otherwise similar circumstances. Exchange rate losses incurred after 31 December 2021 are no longer affected by the prohibition of deduction.
## Charitable contributions
Donations to recognised charities in cash or in kind are deductible up to the higher of 20% of otherwise net taxable income or 0.4% of the total of sales revenue and wages and salaries paid during the year. Donations to charities registered in other EU/EEA member states also qualify for deduction if the recipient charity meets the German requirements for recognition.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and other penalty payments levied by a court, or other authority, with an intent to punish, as well as related costs, are not deductible. By contrast, payments levied to confiscate ill-gotten gains, or to relieve damage to the victims or to the public good, are deductible. Penalty payments levied for attempted tax evasion are not deductible, but late payment surcharges are deductible if the tax itself is (e.g. VAT).
## Taxes
All taxes borne are deductible except for corporation tax, trade tax, and the VAT on most non-deductible expenses.
## Net operating losses
Net operating losses are carried forward without time limit. For corporation tax (but not trade tax), there is an optional carryback to the previous year of up to EUR 1 million. For losses incurred from tax year 2022 onwards, the loss carryback period has been extended to two tax years preceding the tax year in which the losses were incurred.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the maximum loss carryback for a corporation was increased from EUR 1 million to EUR 10 million for losses incurred in 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023.
The loss relief brought forward claimable in any one year is limited to EUR 1 million plus 60% of current income exceeding that amount. The remaining 40% of income over EUR 1 million is charged to trade and corporation taxes at current rates. This is referred to as ‘minimum taxation’.
However, the Growth Opportunities Act of 27 March 2024 amends the minimum taxation rule and provides that, for the assessment periods from 2024 until 2027 (i.e. up to and including the assessment period 2027), 70% of current income instead of 60% can be offset from an annual taxable profit exceeding EUR 1 million. However, this more generous regulation is only to apply to income or corporation tax, but not to trade tax.
The loss carryforward, as well as current losses of the ongoing fiscal year accrued up to the date of a harmful share transfer, is forfeited if a single shareholder directly or indirectly acquires more than 50% of the issued capital (voting rights) within a five-year period.
The forfeiture rule does not apply to share acquisitions as part of certain group internal reorganisations without effect on the single ultimate shareholder, or to the extent that the loss carryforward is covered by hidden reserves in the company’s assets that, on realisation, will lead to German taxation. This excludes the appreciation in value of shareholdings in other companies as well as business assets held in tax exempt foreign PEs.
Further, there is an exemption from the forfeiture of tax loss carryforwards for share transfers for the purpose of restructuring the respective corporate entity.
A loss forfeiture upon a harmful share transfer can, in certain cases, be avoided upon application. Relief may be available where the company has maintained exclusively the same business during a specified observation period and during this period no ‘harmful event’ has occurred. In this context, harmful events include, for example, the discontinuance of the business, the commencement of an additional business, and a change in activity/business sector. Where the conditions are fulfilled and the company has made the application, the total tax loss carryforward available at the end of the period of assessment, in which the harmful share transfer occurred, will be classified as so-called ‘continuance-bound’ loss carryforward (*Fortführungsgebundener Verlust*).
The occurrence of one of the harmful events as set out in the provision will result in the forfeiture of the continuance-bound loss carryforward last assessed as far as the continuance-bound tax loss carryforward is not matched by hidden reserves under the hidden reserve exception.
In a decision on 29 August 2017, the Lower Tax Court of Hamburg has referred the question to the German Federal Constitutional Court whether the full forfeiture of losses in the case of a harmful share transfer of more than 50% is unconstitutional, which it is in the opinion of the Lower Tax Court of Hamburg. Only the Constitutional Court is authorised to decide if the regulation is unconstitutional.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
A German corporation can claim a deduction for remuneration, such as interest charges (subject to the interest limitation) service fees, and royalties (subject to the royalty limitation), paid to foreign affiliates, provided the amounts are at arm’s length. Detailed provisions covering both form and substance define this. In particular, all services must be covered by prior written agreement, and it is also necessary to conclude agreements for the purchase and sale of goods in writing where this would be usual between third parties (e.g. for quantity rebates on sales). The substance tests must be satisfied, both as to value for money and as to business relevance. Thus, the manager of a German subsidiary must be able to show an adequate business benefit from a related-party transaction. These and all other aspects of inter-company (related-party) trading fall under strict and extensive documentation requirements, breach of which can lead to serious penalties.
Nevertheless, payments to foreign affiliates may not be deductible where anti-tax avoidance rules are applicable, e.g. in case of a so-called hybrid mismatch arrangement (*see above*) or where payments are non-deductible under the Tax Haven Defence Act ('*Steueroasenabwehrgesetz*', *see Tax Haven Defence Act in the [Other issues](other-issues.html) section*).
## Special features for trade tax
There are a number of differences between the income subject to trade tax and to corporation tax. The most significant is the trade tax disallowance of one-quarter of the interest costs, including interest implicit in leasing, rental, and royalty charges. Banks have an exemption from this interest disallowance.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
If a parent holds more than 50% of the voting rights in a subsidiary having its place of management in Germany, the two may conclude a formal court-registered profit and loss pooling agreement (PLPA), which must be concluded for a period of at least five years. If certain conditions are fulfilled, the ensuing relationship is referred to as an *Organschaft*. Effectively, the annual results of an *Organschaft* are pooled at the level of the parent. The tax group subsidiary itself is only subject to tax with respect to 20/17 of the compensation payments made to outside minority shareholders, if applicable. Profits and losses within a group can therefore be offset, but there is no provision for the elimination of intra-group profits from the total tax base. It should also be noted that negative income of the parent or of the subsidiary incurred within an *Organschaft* is excluded from offset in the same or another year if a foreign country takes it into account in the taxation of an *Organschaft* member, or of any other entity.
The main conditions for a tax group for corporate tax/trade tax purposes are:
## Transfer pricing
Extensive rules on transfer pricing in respect of all transactions with foreign-related parties are in force. The basic principle is that all cross-border inter-company business transactions should be priced at arm's length. Failure to meet the extensive documentation requirements applicable exposes the company to serious risk of penalties as well as unfavourable estimates by the tax authorities, who have the right to exercise every possible leeway or margin to the taxpayer's disadvantage.
Germany has adjusted its transfer pricing documentation rules to meet the recommendations of the OECD BEPS Project. The taxpayer has to prepare documentation specific to the country and each business (local file) as well as a master file with information regarding the global business operations of the group. Furthermore, a so-called country-by-country reporting (CbCR) must be prepared if the group's revenues exceed EUR 750 million and has to be submitted within one year after the end of the respective business year.
Until 31 December 2024, it was not a requirement for the documentation (local file and master file) to be set up at the time of transaction nor during the course of the tax return process; it was only necessary for the taxpayer to provide the relevant documentation upon request during a tax audit. However, in case of extraordinary business transactions (e.g. restructurings, cost sharing, other material long-term agreements), it was a requirement that documentation had to be prepared within six months after the end of the business year in which the business transaction occurred (but again, it only had to be provided upon request during a tax audit).
Starting 1 January 2025, the tax authorities may request the submission of transfer pricing documentation at any time in the future. Additionally, the transaction matrix, the master file, and documentation for extraordinary business transactions (contemporaneous preparation still a requirement) must now be submitted unsolicited within a period of 30 days from the start of a tax audit, i.e. upon receipt of the notification of a tax audit. The local file needs to be submitted only upon a separate request of the tax authorities within a period of 30 days.
The Fourth Bureaucracy Relief Act (*Viertes Bürokratieentlastungsgesetz*), published on 29 October 2024, has added an additional component to the record-keeping requirements of Section 90 (3) General Tax Code: namely, the transaction matrix as an ’overview of business transactions‘. An ordinance will clarify the necessary content. The explanatory memorandum to the Fourth Bureaucracy Relief Act provides initial indications in this regard. According to this, it can be assumed that the documentation for the transaction matrix must contain the following elements: subject matter and nature of the transactions, parties involved in the business transactions (with identification of the service provider or recipient), volume and consideration of business transactions, contractual basis, transfer pricing method applied, tax jurisdictions concerned, and indication of whether transactions are subject to standard taxation in the relevant tax jurisdiction. On 9 June 2021, the Act on the Modernisation of the Relief from and the Certification of Withholding Taxes (*Gesetz zur Modernisierung der Entlastung von Abzugsteuern und der Bescheinigung von Kapitalertragsteuer - AbzStEntlModG*) entered into force. The Act contained amendments or supplements to the Foreign Taxes Act (FTA - *Außensteuergesetz*) and the General Tax Code that are also relevant from a transfer pricing perspective.
The Act addresses key contents of BEPS action points 8-10 (‘Aligning Transfer Pricing Outcomes with Value Creation‘). For example, the Act contains a comprehensive revision and new version of Section 1 of the FTA and emphasises, among other things, the substance-over-form approach envisaged by the OECD and the application of the OECD 'DEMPE' concept in the context of intangibles. It should be mentioned that the German tax authorities assume that the DEMPE concept should also be applied to German transfer regulations prior to the implementation of the Act: The revised version of Section 1 FTA is only intended to clarify this.
The Growth Opportunities Act (*Wachstumschancengesetz*) of 27 March 2024 introduced a new Section 1 (3d) Foreign Taxes Act (FTA) and a new Section 1 (3e) FTA. According to Section 1 (3d) FTA the interest deduction is to be restricted to a so-called group interest rate. The regulation contains a rebuttal option that requires proof that a rate calculated from the corporate group rating complies with the arm's-length principle. The group interest rate is the rate at which the corporate group could finance itself vis-à-vis third parties based on the rating calculated for the corporate group. This limitation should apply to interest expenses from cross-border financing within multinational groups of companies.
Alongside the group interest rate limitation, Section 1 (3d) FTA provides for the introduction of higher evidentiary obligations regarding the loan relationships concerned, e.g. with respect to the ability to service the debt and the necessity of the debt for the business perspective.
According to the new Section 1 (3e) FTA, it is a rebuttable presumption that the brokering or transfer of funds within a multinational group of companies is a low-function and low-risk service that can only be remunerated on a cost-plus basis. The regulation is also intended to cover cases in which one company in the group is responsible for managing the financial resources, such as liquidity management, financial risk management, currency risk management, or acting as a financing company, on behalf of one or more companies in the group.
The new provisions in section 1 (3d) and (3e) FTA are to apply from the period of assessment 2024. For expenses incurred up to 31 December 2024, the Finance Act 2024 of 5 December 2024 stipulates that Section 1(3d) FTA does not apply if the expenses are based on financing relationships that were agreed under civil law before 1 January 2024 and whose actual implementation began before 1 January 2024.
## Thin capitalisation
There are no thin capitalisation rules as such; their substitute is the 'interest limitation' of, basically, 30% of EBITDA discussed in the *[Deductions](deductions.html) section.*
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Pursuant to the German CFC taxation rules regulated in the Foreign Tax Act (FTA - *Außensteuergesetz*), certain low-taxed (i.e. a rate of less than 15%, or 25% for passive income of a business year of the intermediate company ending prior to 1 January 2024) income, referred to as passive income generated by a CFC, is subject to German tax at the level of the German shareholder, provided the CFC is deemed to be a so-called intermediate company (*Zwischengesellschaf*t) and the German ownership criterion is fulfilled.
Passive income generated by a CFC that qualifies as an intermediate company will be attributed to the German shareholder regardless of whether the income is actually distributed or not (CFC income). The CFC income is subject to German corporation tax and trade tax.
EU/EEA subsidiaries will not be qualified as an intermediate company if a so-called motive test is fulfilled (i.e. the German shareholders prove that the specific income is derived from a substantial economic activity performed in the state of residence of the CFC).
According to the so-called Tax Haven Defence Act (*Steueroasenabwehrgesetz*, *see Tax Haven Defence Act in the [Other issues](other-issues.html) section*), CFC taxation may also apply to the entire income (including active income and income for which the motive test is fulfilled) of an intermediate company if the intermediate company is resident in a non-cooperative tax jurisdiction.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
Both corporation tax and trade tax are imposed on the taxable income of a foreign company's German branch. The rates are the same for branches as for resident German companies, although the WHT on dividend distributions by German companies is not deducted from profits transferred by a German branch to its foreign head office.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
Germany does not offer tax incentives except in very limited circumstances, not usually of direct business relevance (e.g. special depreciation for buildings under a conservation order). Partly, this is a question of the state budget, and partly, it reflects the constitutional requirement for equal treatment of all taxpayers.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the assessment basis for the R&D allowance in Germany was increased with effect from 1 July 2020, for a limited period until 30 June 2026. During this period, the maximum amount of the R&D allowance is EUR 1 million *per annum*.
A further scaling-up of the R&D allowance was introduced by the Growth Opportunities Act of 27 March 2024. Amongst other things, eligible expenses may include depreciation expenses from movable fixed assets acquired or manufactured after 27 March 2024.
Furthermore, the maximum assessment basis for eligible expenses incurred after 27 March 2024 has been increased up to EUR 10 million resulting in a maximum amount of the R&D allowance of EUR 2.5 million per year (EUR 3.5 million for certain small and medium-sized enterprises).
## Other incentives
Local authorities may offer facilities on favourable terms, such as the provision of cheap land on industrial estates, as well as certain direct government aid.
## Foreign tax credit
If foreign-source income is not exempt from German taxation, a credit will be given for the foreign tax actually paid and not otherwise recoverable. However, the credit is limited to the corporation tax (including the solidarity surcharge) on the net income after deducting the related expense (a per-country limitation applies). Unused credit is lost, as there are no provisions for carryforward or for offset against other taxes, such as trade tax. There are still a few cases of fictitious foreign tax credits under tax treaties with developing countries (to protect the treaty partner's investment incentives), but German treaty policy is to abandon such provisions at the first opportunity.

Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
## International exchange of information
In recent years, Germany has been vigorous in promoting the international exchange of tax information and has either agreed to obligations regarding the exchange of information in DTTs or concluded Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs) with countries with which it has not concluded a general DTT.
The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) agreement of 31 May 2013 with the United States (US) on the automatic exchange between national tax authorities of bank account information on each other's residents has been in force since December 2013.
Moreover, Germany has signed and implemented into domestic law the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information as of 29 October 2014, which is based on the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Tax Matters (1988/2010), which itself was also signed and implemented into domestic law by Germany. The first exchange of information on financial accounts in tax matters based on the so-called common reporting standard (CRS) from Germany took place in September 2017.
Automatic exchange of information has further been pushed as part of the BEPS Project of the OECD. The Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on the Automatic Exchange of Country-by-Country Reports as of 27 January 2016 was signed by Germany and implemented into domestic law in 2016. At the level of the EU, the Directive on Administrative Cooperation in the Field of Taxation was extended with respect to the exchange of information regarding CbCR as well as advance cross-border tax rulings and APAs. Both amendments were implemented by Germany into domestic law in December 2016. Furthermore, the Directive regarding the disclosure of income information by certain companies and branches (so-called public country-by-country-reporting) was transposed into national law in June 2023.
## Mandatory reporting of cross-border tax arrangements (DAC 6)
With the Act Introducing an Obligation to Report Cross-border Tax Arrangements of 21 December 2019 (DAC 6 Act), Germany has implemented the provisions of the Directive amending the EU Mutual Assistance Directive 2011/16/EU (DAC 6) on the mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation on reportable cross-border arrangements. Since 1 July 2020, the regulations are to be applied.
The reportable tax arrangements included in the German provisions are mainly in line with the Directive. Germany has adopted the hallmarks listed in Annex IV of DAC 6 and has not added further hallmarks. In line with DAC 6, certain hallmarks will trigger a reportable tax arrangement only to the extent that the main benefit test (MBT) is met. Taxes covered under the latter are all taxes that are levied by the EU member states except VAT, customs duties, and specific excise duties.
The reporting for cross-border arrangements must be made electronically to the German Federal Tax Office ('*Bundeszentralamt für* *Steuern*') according to the officially prescribed data forms within 30 days after the start of the reporting period. In addition, with regard to so-called 'marketable cross-border tax arrangements' that do not have to be adapted individually, there are some special reporting periods and requirements.
Violations of the reporting obligation are treated as administrative offences and are punishable by fines of up to EUR 25,000.
## BEPS Project of the OECD
On the initiative of the G20 group of countries, the OECD developed a 15-point Action Plan to address BEPS by multinational companies. It aims to adjust local tax regimes and DTTs to keep pace with globalisation and technical developments.
Germany transposed some of the measures developed by the OECD or provided for by the European Union into domestic law, in particular rules concerning the international exchange of information in tax matters. Further, applicable from 2018 onwards, Germany introduced a restriction on the deductibility of royalty payments to related parties in certain cross-border situations where a preferential tax regime is considered harmful.
In August 2016, the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (EU-ATAD) entered into force, which includes certain minimum standards to combat tax avoidance schemes (interest limitation rule, exit taxation, general anti-abuse rule, CFC rules, hybrid mismatch arrangements).
In May 2017, the Council of the European Union further adopted a directive amending the EU-ATAD (ATAD II) to address hybrid mismatch arrangements with third countries. The standards of the ATAD were implemented into German law in June 2021 through an amendment of the German CFC rules, an amendment of the rules on exit taxation, and the introduction of new rules on hybrid mismatch arrangements.
Together with numerous other countries, Germany signed the so-called 'Multilateral Instrument' (MLI) at an official signing ceremony on 7 June 2017. In a first step in November 2020, a Consent Act, which served to transpose the MLI into national law, passed through all its parliamentary procedures. The concrete adaptation of the DTTs took place in a second step by means of an Implementation Act (2nd stage of implementation of the MLI), the legislative process for which was finalised in June 2024. Based on the Implementation Act, nine German DTTs are being modified by means of the MLI. On 2 October 2024, Germany notified the OECD of the completion of its domestic legislative procedures for implementing the MLI in relation to Croatia, France, Greece, Hungary, Malta, Slovakia, and Spain. Based on this, the amended DTTs are to be applied from 1 January 2025 onwards. Although the DTTs with Japan and the Czech Republic are also covered by the MLI Implementation Act, these DTTs were not mentioned in Germany's notification of 2 October 2024.
Beyond the changes in DTTs by means of the MLI, Germany is either currently negotiating a number of bilateral agreements in order to modify other German DTTs or it has already finalised these negotiations, respectively. The negotiations refer predominantly to selected elements of the MLI. In 2024, the amendment of the DTT with Latvia entered into force (and is applicable from 1 January 2025 onwards).
## Tax Haven Defence Act
The Tax Haven Defence Act (THDA) of 25 June 2021 (*Steueroasenabwehrgesetz*) contains tax defence measures in relation to tax jurisdictions that are mentioned in the Tax Haven Defence Ordinance (to provide, in particular, for restrictions on available deductions [Section 8], for stricter rules on CFC adjustments/add-backs [Section 9], for the expansion of WHT obligations [Section 10], for the suspension of the participation exemption under Section 8b Corporation Tax Act [Section 11], and for an expansion of the obligation to cooperate with the tax authorities [Section 12]).
The Tax Haven Defence Ordinance (in its most recent version of December 2024) includes the following jurisdictions:
As Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Belize, the Seychelles, and Turks and Caicos Islands have been removed from the Tax Havens Defence Ordinance, the defence measures pursuant to Section 8-11, 12 THDA are therefore declared retroactively inapplicable to these jurisdictions from 1 January 2024 onwards.

## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
## Foreign tax relief
If a double tax treaty (DTT) exists, double taxation is usually avoided by exempting the foreign income with progression. Foreign income taxes can only be credited against German income tax if a tax credit is provided in the applicable DTT or a DTT does not exist. A tax credit is only possible up to the amount of German income taxes on the specific foreign income.
## Tax treaties
German national income tax law has been modified and superseded by various tax treaties with foreign countries to ensure that income is not taxed by more than one country. Germany has concluded DTTs, applicable for income taxes, with nearly 90 countries, amongst them most of the industrialised countries. However, DTTs have not been concluded with, for example, Brazil and Hong Kong. The DTT with the United Arab Emirates expired on 31 December 2021 and has not been renewed.
Germany currently has double-taxation agreements with the below mentioned countries:

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
## Social security contributions
As of 1 January 2024, the income ceiling for mandatory pension insurance has increased from 87,600 euros (EUR) to EUR 90,600 (EUR 89,400 in the new federal states). The adjustment of the contribution ceiling is also applicable to unemployment insurance.
Additionally, the income ceiling for mandatory health and long-term care insurance in 2025 has increased to EUR 5,512.50 per month (EUR 66,150 per year).
The 2025 contribution rate to German state unemployment insurance will remain 2.6% compared to 2024. The rate for pension insurance is 18.6%. The contribution rate to the health insurance system is fixed at 14.6% and the rate for nursery care insurance at 3.4%. All mentioned rates are shared equally between employer and employee.
## COVID-19 reliefs
A number of COVID-19 relief measures were enacted in 2020. The maximum amount of loss carryback for income tax purposes was increased to EUR 10 million (single filing) / EUR 20 million (married filing) for tax years 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. In 2024, the amount limits were returned to the legal status prior to 2020 of EUR 10 million to EUR 1 million (single filing) / of EUR 20 million to EUR 2 million (married filing).
## Property tax
As the current system of the property tax has been declared unconstitutional by the German Federal Constitutional Court, property tax will be levied on the basis of the new law from 1 January 2025 onwards. The property tax reform of 2025 replaces the previous unconstitutional system from 1935/1964 with a new valuation model that takes into account the current value of the property. From 2025, new assessment rates will apply, and property tax notices will be based on the new valuations. The reform leads to individual shifts in the tax burden but aims to keep the overall tax revenue constant.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
## Employment expenses
Various properly documented and necessarily incurred income related expenses may be deducted by an individual unless they are, in cases of employment relationship, reimbursed by the employer.
For employees, common tax deductions include:
There is a blanket employee allowance for business deductions of EUR 1,230 per year. To the extent actual employment connected expenses exceed the lump sum of EUR 1,230, they are deductible if they can be substantiated.
## Personal deductions
### Alimony payments
Individual taxpayers may take deductions up to EUR 13,805 for the alimony paid to a divorced partner.
### Charitable contributions
Contributions to German charities and certain international charities are deductible up to 20% of adjusted gross income. Church tax is also fully deductible.
### Childcare expenses
Fulfilling certain requirements, a portion of the actual expenses for childcare can be deducted up to a maximum of EUR 4,000 (EUR 4,800 as of 2025) per year/child for children younger than 14 years or for handicapped children.
### Education expenses
30% of tuition fees (except for housing, care, and food) for qualifying dependent children is deductible if a recognised private school located in the EU/EEA countries or a German school is attended and if graduation is approved by the government. The special expenses that can be claimed are limited to EUR 5,000 *per annum* per child.
### Social security contributions
Social security contributions and insurance premiums can be deducted up to specified limits, as follows.
#### Health insurance and long-term care contributions
Contributions to health insurance are completely tax deductible as far as these contributions are paid for primary basic healthcare. Contributions to long-term care insurance are also tax deductible under these circumstances.
#### Unemployment insurance contributions
Additionally, contributions paid to certain other insurance policies (e.g. unemployment insurance) can be deducted up to a maximum of EUR 2,800 per year (EUR 1,900 for employees and pensioners). This only applies if these amounts have not already been utilised for health and long-term care insurance contributions.
#### Pension scheme contributions
In 2024, contributions to old-age pension schemes are tax deductible up to an overall limit of EUR 27,566 (EUR 55,132 for married taxpayers filing jointly). For a transitional period (2005 to 2023), only a reduced amount could be deducted. In 2022, the tax deduction amounted to 94% of the actual contributions, at a maximum of 94% of EUR 25,639 (EUR 51,278), and increased to 100% in 2023. For employees contributing to the state pension scheme, the deductible amount was reduced by contributions paid by the employer to the state pension scheme, as those contributions were already tax exempt under the income tax act.
### Mortgage deduction
Mortgage interest is only deductible against income from the property (i.e. not deductible for privately used property).
## Standard deductions
A lump sum special expense deduction totalling EUR 36 for a single person or EUR 72 for married couples is provided without need for proof. Furthermore, there are also a number of other specific allowances and reliefs, for example, for children, the elderly and the disabled.
## Personal allowances
Deductions are allowed for extraordinary burdens such as:
The allowances shown below are deductible in computing taxable income.
| Per year / per taxpayer | EUR |
| --- | --- |
| Employee's allowance | 1,230 |
| Investor's allowance (for interest, dividends, and capital gains) | 1,000 |
| Social security allowance | variable |
| Lump sum special expense deduction | 36 |
| Child allowance - per child registered in Germany and per parent | 4,800 |
## Business deductions
Fixed assets and intangibles are subject to depreciation or amortisation.
For businesses common tax deductions are:
## Losses
Losses not offset in the year in which they occur can either be carried back to the previous year up to EUR 1 million (for 2020 until 2023 this amount was increased to EUR 10 million) or carried forward to future years indefinitely, whereby in the latter case an amount of EUR 1 million can be offset fully per year and a loss carryforward exceeding EUR 1 million can only be used within detailed thresholds per year. For married taxpayers filing jointly, the mentioned amounts are doubled.

## Immigration and work permit
If foreign nationals shall become employed with or assigned to a German branch or subsidiary, German immigration law requirements have to be observed. The requirements have to be checked in each individual case from an immigration expert.
Generally, EU nationals do not need a German work permit. Foreign nationals of non-EU member states intending to work in Germany need a work and residence permit, which is regularly granted as an electronic permit (so-called '*elektronischer Aufenthaltstitel*').
Some nationals are privileged (US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Japan, Israel), and they do not need to apply for a visa when entering Germany for working purposes. They can directly apply for their German work and residence permit in Germany within a certain time after entrance. However, they are not allowed to start working before they have registered their German address and at least a preliminary permit is issued by the immigration office.
All other nationalities (Visa-nationals) have to apply for an entry visa for working purposes (D-Visa) at the Germany embassy/consulate in the country where one officially resides abroad.
German immigration law provides various different work permit types, depending on the type of employment (assignment vs. local hire), salary level, qualification of the employee, nationality etc. Germany also implemented the EU Blue Card for high qualified individuals and the ICT (Intra-Corporate-Transfer) Card for third country nationals.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
## Employment income
Salaries paid under the German payroll are subject to wage tax, which is withheld by the employer and credited against the final annual income tax charge. Account is taken of the personal situation by the application of certain tax classes and certain deductions are applied.
Salaries that are paid by a foreign employer (who does not have a permanent establishment in Germany) but are recharged to the German company are also subject to wage tax withholding. The same applies for salary that is not actually recharged but should have been recharged under an arm's-length perspective. The German company is deemed to be the 'economic employer' and thus required to calculate and transfer the appropriate wage tax to the tax office on a monthly basis.
Salaries that are paid by a foreign employer and are neither charged to a German company nor should have been recharged under an arm's-length perspective to a German company are generally not subject to wage tax withholding. As with other income, tax for these employees is levied by assessment generally following the first annual return. Pension income is also taxable, subject to further allowances.
## Equity compensation
Stock options are basically taxable when exercised. Taxable income is computed at the time of exercising the option, normally as the difference between the market price of the shares and the exercise price. Tax exemption may be granted if during the period between grant and vesting employment was not performed in Germany and thus the employment income was not taxable in Germany. The stock option benefit is sourced based on workdays between grant and vesting.
Shares provided free of charge or at a low-price may be tax-free up to an amount of EUR 2,000 *per annum* if certain conditions are fulfilled. This relief is granted for shares of the employing company and of the parent company controlling and consolidating its subsidiary.
A favourable tax rate may apply if the period between grant and exercise exceeds 12 months and if the employee is employed with the granting company at least for the first 12 months of this period. In the case of a limited taxpayer status, the application of the favourable tax rate in payroll leads to an individual income tax filing obligation for the non-resident taxpayer, including progression impact of otherwise tax-exempt income.
## Business income
Tax on net income from professional activities or from carrying on a trade or business is collected by assessment. Quarterly instalments might be assessed on an estimated basis by the tax authorities and credited against the final income tax burden.
## Capital gains
Capital gains from financial investments (e.g. sale of shares) are subject to a flat tax rate of 25% plus 5.5% solidarity surcharge (in total 26.375%, plus church tax if applicable), which is generally withheld at source automatically upon distribution of the gains. Related expenses cannot be deducted. Capital gains qualify for the 'investor's allowance' of EUR 1,000 per taxpayer and year for the total of all financial investment income. This amount is doubled in the case of married taxpayers filing jointly. Special rules apply on the taxation of capital gains from the sale of a significant interest in a corporation (1% or more).
Special partial tax exemptions apply on capital gains from the sale of mutual funds units, depending on the nature of the fund.
Other capital gains are taxable in Germany at individual progressive rates only if the sale is within one year (for movable assets) or ten years (for real property) after the purchase date. Since 2024, these capital gains are only taxable if the profit exceeds EUR 1,000 (previously EUR 600) per year in total. Further tax relief may be applicable under specific conditions if the property was used for private purposes.
## Exit tax
The German Foreign Tax Act contains regulations concerning an exit taxation for individuals if certain requirements are met. If the individual has been subject to unlimited tax liability in Germany for a certain time and holds at least 1% in a corporation as private asset, they could qualify for exit tax. The exit tax will be triggered in case the unlimited tax liability in Germany is terminated (e.g. in most cases due to relocation of the shareholder). As a result, the capital gain of a deemed sale of the shares will be taxed under German income tax regulations. The exit taxation could, in some cases, be avoided by appropriate structuring.
## Dividend income
Dividend income is subject to a flat tax rate of 25% plus 5.5% solidarity surcharge (in total 26.375%, plus church tax if applicable), which is basically withheld at source. Related expenses cannot be deducted. Dividend income qualifies for the annual investor's allowance of EUR 1,000 (previously EUR 801) per taxpayer for the total of all financial investment income. This amount is doubled in the case of married taxpayers filing jointly.
Special partial tax exemptions apply on distributions of mutual funds, depending on the nature of the fund.
Mutual funds retaining their profits can trigger deemed income to be taxed at the investor level even if no actual distributions are made.
## Interest income
Interest income is subject to a flat tax rate of 25% plus 5.5% solidarity surcharge (in total 26.375%, plus church tax if applicable), which is basically withheld at source. Related expenses cannot be deducted. Interest income qualifies for the annual investor's allowance of EUR 1,000 (previously EUR 801) per taxpayer for the total of all financial investment income. This amount is doubled in the case of married taxpayers filing jointly.
Note that the investor's allowance is only provided one time for the total of interest and dividend income and capital gains.
## Rental income
Rents received less allowable expenses form part of taxable income. Under treaty provisions rental income from sources abroad is mostly exempt. Tax exemption with progression will be applicable if sources are not located within the EU/EEA.
## Exempt income
Employment income connected to special construction, engineering, or consulting work outside Germany, lasting at least three months, might be exempt if:

## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
## Child benefits
Depending on criteria like residency status, age of the children, and possibly social security status, qualifying families will receive a monthly child benefit for dependent children. In 2025, this amounts to EUR 255 (EUR 250 in 2024) per month for each child.
An additional child benefit supplement of up to EUR 292 can be applied for if the income is not sufficient to cover the child’s living expenses.
The mentioned benefits and bonus payments are offset against a potential tax relief from the lump sum deduction of the child allowance of EUR 4,800 in 2025 (EUR 4,770 in 2024) per parent when calculating the taxable income, so that only either the mentioned benefits and bonus payments are granted or the lump sum deduction of the child allowance.
## Other tax credits and incentives
There are no other significant tax credits or incentives for individuals in Germany.

Objective circumstances are decisive. Nationality is not, in itself, a criterion for determining residence or tax liability. Also, registration with the German (tax) authorities is only an indicator.
