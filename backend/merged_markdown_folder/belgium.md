## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 28 August 2024
## Social security contributions
The employee's share of social security taxes is 13.07% of the total gross compensation, with no cap.
The employer's share currently varies around 27%.
As an example, foreign employees who are transferred to Belgium by a United States (US) employer for a period not exceeding five years and who remain covered by the US social security scheme, the Belgium/US social security agreement provides for full exemption from Belgian social security taxes.
### Special social security contribution
A special social security contribution is also due, the amount varying between EUR 9.30 and EUR 60.94 per month. This contribution is collected by means of monthly deductions from net salary, although the final amount due will be determined through the tax return process on the basis of actual net taxable family income.
The special social security contribution is not tax deductible. The maximum amount due by a family on a yearly basis amounts to EUR 731.28.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate is 21%. This rate applies to all goods and services not qualifying for one of the reduced VAT rates.
The following supplies of goods and services have a 12% VAT rate:
The following supplies of goods and services have a 6% VAT rate:
The following supplies of goods and services are VAT exempt with credit ('zero-rated'):
The following supplies of goods and services are VAT exempt without credit:
It should be noted that specific conditions may apply to the above two categories.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, deliveries, intra-community acquisitions, and imports of vaccines against COVID-19 and of in-vitro diagnostic medical devices for this disease, as well as the provision of services related to these vaccines and medical devices, are exempt from VAT for two years, from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2022 included.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
Since March 2018 and until 30 September 2019, there was a 0.15% tax due on securities accounts that reached or exceeded EUR 500,000 (per account holder). In October 2019, the Belgian Constitutional Court issued a decision annulling this tax on securities accounts, with effect as of 1 October 2019.
A solidarity tax of 0.15% is now applicable on securities accounts that reach or exceed EUR 1 million.
## Inheritance and gift taxes
A special form of inheritance tax arises on the death of a Belgian non-resident who leaves property in Belgium. Tax is chargeable on the gross value of the property instead of on the net amount inherited by each recipient, at standard rates of inheritance tax. Inheritance tax rules differ depending on the region where the deceased had fiscal residence.
In principle, a gift must be made by way of a Belgian notary deed. As all notarial deeds are required to be registered, Belgian gift taxes becomes due. Manual gifts and indirect gifts are exempt from Belgian gift taxes.
Gift tax rates vary based on the region where the gift is registered. In the Flemish and Brussels capital regions, registered gifts of movables are taxed at a reduced flat registration rate of:
According to Article 7 of the inheritance taxation codes (IHTC) of each region, gifts made no more than three years prior to the death of the donor and that were not subject to Belgian gift taxes are deemed added to the estate of the donor and are subject to inheritance taxes. Such gifts must be reported in the inheritance tax return at the value that the donated assets have at the time of death.
The inheritance tax law has recently been deeply reformed at the federal level, and the new rules have entered into force on 1 September 2018. As a result, important changes in the regional inheritance taxes have been implemented and specific advice is highly recommended in this respect.
## Property taxes
Local property tax is assessed on 'cadastral income', i.e. the deemed rental value attributed to the property by the authorities. Rates generally range between 20% and 50% of the 'indexed cadastral income'.
Resident taxpayers who own real estate abroad must report their foreign property in their Belgian tax return. Since 2021, they must submit a declaration to the Administration of Measurement and Valuations, which will determine the deemed rental value of the foreign real estate.
## Stock exchange tax
The stock exchange tax is a flat-rate tax that is due on transactions (i.e. purchases and sales) of stocks and bonds as well as on redemptions of capitalisation shares of collective investment vehicles that are executed by Belgian residents through Belgian or non-Belgian financial intermediaries. The tax rates vary from 0.12% to 1.32% depending on the type of transaction. The tax is automatically withheld at source in case the transaction occurs through a Belgian financial institution. Otherwise, in case the foreign bank does not comply with its withholding and reporting obligation, it is the beneficiary's responsibility to report the transaction and pay the tax.
## Other non-income taxes
### Registration duties
Purchases and transfers of real estate located in Belgium, including buildings (except new buildings, which are subject to VAT as described above), are subject to registration duty at the rate of 12.5% of the higher of transfer price or fair market value in the Walloon and Brussels Regions. In the Flemish Region, the applicable rate is 10%. Since income year 2017, the Brussels Region has introduced an exemption of registration duties for the first EUR 175,000 provided several strict conditions are met.
In case the purchase or transfer of land is subject to VAT, no registration duties will be charged on this purchase or transfer.
In principle, no registration duty is due upon a capital contribution; only a fixed fee of EUR 50 is due.
### Stamp duties
Stamp duties are due on transactions relating to public funds that are concluded or executed in Belgium, irrespective of their (Belgian or foreign) origin, to the extent that a professional intermediary intervenes in these transactions. Exemptions for non-residents and others are available.

## Overview
Last reviewed - 28 August 2024
Belgium lies in the heart of the largest industrialised trading bloc in the world, the European Union (EU), and has existed as an independent kingdom since 1830. It is a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy, with King Philippe I reigning as the sovereign as of 21 July 2013. Belgium has a population of about 11 million people and three official languages: Dutch, French, and German. The currency of Belgium is the euro (EUR).
Industry is concentrated mainly in the populous Flemish area in the north, and much of Belgium's trade is with other EU countries. It has a relatively equal income distribution, and its gross domestic product (GDP) was EUR 584.7 billion in 2023.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Domestic corporations and PEs of foreign corporations paying dividends, interest, royalties, service fees, and/or certain rentals are required to withhold tax.
Capital reductions decided by the general meeting as of 1 January 2018 will be deemed to derive proportionally from paid-up capital, taxed reserves (incorporated and non-incorporated into capital), and exempted reserves incorporated into the capital. The reduction of capital will be allocated to paid-up capital in the proportion of the paid-up capital in the total capital increased by certain reserves. The portion allocated to the reserves is deemed to be a dividend and will become subject to WHT (if applicable). Share premium distribution is submitted to the same system.
A uniform WHT rate of 30% is applicable on dividends, interest, and royalties. There are some exceptions.
Some WHT reductions/exemptions are foreseen under Belgian domestic tax law.
With respect to payments made to non-resident corporations or individuals, WHT exemptions and/or reductions can also be found in the DTTs concluded by Belgium.

Notes
1. The treaty concluded with ex-Yugoslavia is still applicable to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, and Serbia.
2. Not applicable to Hong Kong.
3. The treaty concluded with the former USSR is still applicable to Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan.
4. It concerns an EU country or the treaty contains a qualifying exchange of information clause. Hence, the rate of 0% is applicable subject to the same conditions as invoked by the Parent-Subsidiary Directive (*see above*). Where multiple rates apply, the difference is generally based on the percentage of participation the recipient holds (directly) in the capital of the company paying the dividends.
5. Under the Bilateral II agreement concluded between Belgium and Switzerland, a rate of 0% is applicable under certain conditions.
6. With respect to EU countries, a WHT exemption is applicable, provided that the conditions laid down in the Interest & Royalty Directive are met (*see above*). Furthermore, note that some treaties contain an exemption for commercial debt claims or loans concluded with a bank or a governmental body.
7. This table does not take into account most favoured nation clauses.
The treaties that are currently in force are listed above. Based on the websites of the Belgian government, the following tax treaties/protocols are signed, modified, or under renegotiation (including some for the exchange of information clause): Botswana, Canada, Congo, France, India, Isle of Man, Macao, Malaysia, Moldova, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Oman, Qatar, Russia, Rwanda, Tajikistan, Uganda, the United Kingdom, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Inventory valuation
Belgian accounting law provides for the following four methods of inventory valuation: the method based on the individualisation of the price of each item, the method based on the weighted average prices, the last in first out (LIFO) method, and the first in first out (FIFO) method. All of these methods are accepted for tax purposes.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are subject to the normal CIT rate. For tax purposes, a capital gain is defined as the positive difference between the sale price less the costs related to the disposal of the asset and the original cost of the acquisition or investment less the depreciations and write-offs that have been deducted for tax purposes.
Capital gains realised on tangible fixed assets and intangible assets could be subject to a deferred and spread taxation regime, provided that certain conditions are met.
### Capital gains on shares
Net capital gains on shares are fully exempt provided that the subject-to-tax condition, the one-year holding period, and the participation condition are fulfilled. The conditions to benefit from the capital gains exemption are, as such, entirely aligned with the conditions to benefit from the DRD. Indeed, the participation condition implies a minimum participation threshold of at least 10% or an acquisition value of at least EUR 2.5 million in the share capital of the company concerned.
The tax rate amounts to 25% if either the subject-to-tax condition, the one-year holding period, or the participation condition is not met.
## Dividend income
Dividends received by a Belgian company are first included in its taxable basis on a gross basis when the dividends are received from a Belgian company or on a net basis (i.e. after deduction of the foreign WHT) when they are received from a foreign company.
Provided certain conditions are met, 100% of the dividend income can be offset by a DRD.
### Dividends-received deduction (DRD)
A DRD of 100% of dividend income can be applied under certain conditions (*see below*). Any unused portion of the DRD from dividends received from a European Economic Area (EEA) subsidiary or a subsidiary from a country with which Belgium has concluded a DTT with a non‑discrimination clause on dividends can be carried forward to future tax years (taking into account the possible limitations introduced by the basket). The same also applies for dividends from Belgian subsidiaries.
The DRD is subject to a (i) minimum participation condition and (ii) taxation condition.
In addition, based on a rule against hybrid instruments, dividends received by the parent company will no longer be tax exempt whenever the distributed profit is tax deductible in the jurisdiction of the subsidiary (e.g. hybrid loans). Further, as a result of a general anti-abuse rule (GAAR), the DRD will be denied whenever the dividends originate from legal acts or a whole of legal acts that are artificial (i.e. no valid business reasons that reflect economic reality) and merely in place to obtain the DRD exemption.
### Minimum participation condition
According to the minimum participation condition, the recipient company must have, at the moment of attribution, a participation of at least 10% or an acquisition value of at least EUR 2.5 million in the capital of the distributing company. The beneficiary of the dividend must have been holding the full legal ownership of the underlying shares for at least one year prior to the dividend distribution or commit to hold it for a minimum of one year.
### Taxation condition
The taxation condition, in summary, means that the dividend income received must have been subject to tax at the level of the distributing company and its subsidiaries if the former redistributes dividends received.
The taxation condition is based on seven ‘exclusion’ rules and certain exceptions to these rules. Basically, the exclusion rules apply to the following:
While this is a summary of the exclusion rules, numerous exceptions to these exclusion rules exist and need to be analysed on a case-by-case basis.
### Bonus shares (stock dividends)
Distribution of bonus shares to shareholders in compensation for an increase of the share capital by incorporation of existing reserves is, in principle, tax free. The situation may be different if the shareholder has the choice between a cash or stock dividend.
## Interest, rents, and royalties
Interest that accrued, became receivable by, or was received by a company, and rents and royalties received by a company, are characterised as business profits and taxed at the general CIT rate of 25%. The income can be offset against available tax assets.
## Foreign income
A foreign tax credit may be available for foreign royalty income and foreign interest income. *See the [Tax credits and incentives](belgium/corporate/tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for more information*.
Undistributed income of subsidiaries, whether or not they are foreign, is subject to Belgian income tax in the hands of the Belgian corporate shareholder if certain conditions are met (*see Controlled foreign companies [CFCs] in the [Group taxation](belgium/corporate/group-taxation.html) section*).

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Taxable period
The assessment is based on the taxable income of a financial year. For the application of the rules on statutory limitations and of new laws, a tax year is related to each taxable period. If the financial year corresponds with the calendar year, the tax year is the following calendar year (e.g. financial year closing 31 December 2024 corresponds with tax year 2025). If the financial year does not correspond with the calendar year, the tax year, in principle, equals the calendar year during which the financial year ends (e.g. financial year closing 30 June 2024 corresponds with tax year 2024).
## Tax returns
As a general rule, the annual resident or non-resident CIT return must be filed, at the latest, on 30 September of the tax year for financial years ending between 31 December of the previous year and the last day of February of the tax year. For instance, assuming that the accounting year has been closed on 31 December 2024, the corporate tax return needs to be filed, in principle, by 30 September 2025 at the latest.
In other cases, the deadline for filing the tax return is the last day of the seventh month following the end of the financial year.
An extension of the deadline is possible in case of serious reasons or force majeure.
## Payment of tax
CIT is payable within two months (some temporary exceptions apply) following the issue of the tax assessment. Interest for late payment is charted at the (non-cumulative) rate of 4% per year.
Advance tax payments give rise to a tax credit. For tax year 2025, the tax credit amounts to 12%, 10%, 8%, or 6% of the advance tax payment made, depending on whether such payment has been made, respectively, in the first, second, third, or fourth quarter.
If the total amount of credits exceeds the surcharge, no surcharge is due, but the excess is not further taken into account for the final tax computation. The taxpayer can choose to either have the excess reimbursed by the tax authorities or used as an advance tax payment for the next year.
## Tax audit process
A tax audit normally begins with a written request for information from the tax inspector. The taxpayer must provide the data requested within (in principle) one month. Any documentary evidence considered relevant to the audit can be requested and reviewed by the authorities. Once the tax inspector has completed the analysis, any adjustment is proposed in a notification of amendment outlining the reasons for the proposed amendment. The taxpayer has a month to agree or to express disagreement. The tax inspector then makes an assessment for the amount of tax that the tax inspector believes is due (taking into account any relevant comments of the taxpayer with which the inspector agrees). Thereafter, the taxpayer has a year within which to lodge an appeal with the Regional Director of Taxes. The decision of the Regional Director of Taxes may be appealed and litigated. In a number of circumstances, the intervention of the courts can be sought prior to receiving the decision of the Regional Director of Taxes.
Pilot projects on horizontal monitoring are also in progress.
### Tax supplements
Tax supplements resulting from a tax audit will imply an effective tax cash out, without the possibility to offset these supplements against any tax deductions (with the exception of the current year DRD). These tax supplements will thus constitute a minimum tax base. This measure, however, only applies if tax penalties equal to or higher than 10% are effectively applied.
## Statute of limitations
Based on the Belgian income tax statute of limitations, the period during which the tax authorities are authorised to perform a tax audit and adjust the taxable basis is three years starting from the first day of the tax year, unless the company’s financial year does not correspond to the calendar year.
Further to a tax procedure reform in 2022, some extended investigation and assessment periods were introduced, but the following statutes of limitations remain unchanged:
In addition, as of tax year 2023, the investigation and assessment periods are extended to:
\* The new periods of six and ten years (for complex tax returns) cannot be used to examine certain disallowed expenses (including car costs, restaurant costs, or promotional gifts).
For social security contributions for employees, a statute of limitations of three years (ten years in case of fraud), is applicable. Social security contributions for employees are only due by the end of the month following the quarter to which the contributions are related. Hence, the statute of limitations will only start on the first day of the second month following the relevant quarter.
## Belgian ruling practice
Belgium has a long tradition of providing formal and informal rulings. Currently, a taxpayer may request an advance tax ruling on a wide range of subjects, including, but not limited to, CIT, individual tax, non-resident income tax, legal entity income tax, VAT, customs, and registration duties. The filing of the official ruling request is preceded by a prefiling meeting, which can be anonymous. The request should cover a ‘specific and concrete’ operation, which effectively is envisaged to be realised in the foreseeable future. The ruling should be filed before the transaction takes place. In practice, the ruling decision should be granted prior to the filing of the CIT return of the year of the transaction. A ruling is binding upon the Belgian tax authorities for a renewable period of a maximum of five years. Delivery of a requested ruling takes, on average, three months.
The Ruling Office is autonomous from the Belgian tax authorities and has the legal authority to issue decisions, which are, in principle, binding upon the Belgian tax authorities. The Ruling Office increasingly has adopted a constructive approach towards the taxpayer and is seen in the Belgian tax practice as a powerful insurance instrument in ascertaining the Belgian tax treatment of contemplated operations.

Last reviewed - 28 August 2024
## Social security contributions
The employee's share of social security taxes is 13.07% of the total gross compensation, with no cap.
The employer's share currently varies around 27%.
As an example, foreign employees who are transferred to Belgium by a United States (US) employer for a period not exceeding five years and who remain covered by the US social security scheme, the Belgium/US social security agreement provides for full exemption from Belgian social security taxes.
### Special social security contribution
A special social security contribution is also due, the amount varying between EUR 9.30 and EUR 60.94 per month. This contribution is collected by means of monthly deductions from net salary, although the final amount due will be determined through the tax return process on the basis of actual net taxable family income.
The special social security contribution is not tax deductible. The maximum amount due by a family on a yearly basis amounts to EUR 731.28.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate is 21%. This rate applies to all goods and services not qualifying for one of the reduced VAT rates.
The following supplies of goods and services have a 12% VAT rate:
The following supplies of goods and services have a 6% VAT rate:
The following supplies of goods and services are VAT exempt with credit ('zero-rated'):
The following supplies of goods and services are VAT exempt without credit:
It should be noted that specific conditions may apply to the above two categories.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, deliveries, intra-community acquisitions, and imports of vaccines against COVID-19 and of in-vitro diagnostic medical devices for this disease, as well as the provision of services related to these vaccines and medical devices, are exempt from VAT for two years, from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2022 included.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
Since March 2018 and until 30 September 2019, there was a 0.15% tax due on securities accounts that reached or exceeded EUR 500,000 (per account holder). In October 2019, the Belgian Constitutional Court issued a decision annulling this tax on securities accounts, with effect as of 1 October 2019.
A solidarity tax of 0.15% is now applicable on securities accounts that reach or exceed EUR 1 million.
## Inheritance and gift taxes
A special form of inheritance tax arises on the death of a Belgian non-resident who leaves property in Belgium. Tax is chargeable on the gross value of the property instead of on the net amount inherited by each recipient, at standard rates of inheritance tax. Inheritance tax rules differ depending on the region where the deceased had fiscal residence.
In principle, a gift must be made by way of a Belgian notary deed. As all notarial deeds are required to be registered, Belgian gift taxes becomes due. Manual gifts and indirect gifts are exempt from Belgian gift taxes.
Gift tax rates vary based on the region where the gift is registered. In the Flemish and Brussels capital regions, registered gifts of movables are taxed at a reduced flat registration rate of:
According to Article 7 of the inheritance taxation codes (IHTC) of each region, gifts made no more than three years prior to the death of the donor and that were not subject to Belgian gift taxes are deemed added to the estate of the donor and are subject to inheritance taxes. Such gifts must be reported in the inheritance tax return at the value that the donated assets have at the time of death.
The inheritance tax law has recently been deeply reformed at the federal level, and the new rules have entered into force on 1 September 2018. As a result, important changes in the regional inheritance taxes have been implemented and specific advice is highly recommended in this respect.
## Property taxes
Local property tax is assessed on 'cadastral income', i.e. the deemed rental value attributed to the property by the authorities. Rates generally range between 20% and 50% of the 'indexed cadastral income'.
Resident taxpayers who own real estate abroad must report their foreign property in their Belgian tax return. Since 2021, they must submit a declaration to the Administration of Measurement and Valuations, which will determine the deemed rental value of the foreign real estate.
## Stock exchange tax
The stock exchange tax is a flat-rate tax that is due on transactions (i.e. purchases and sales) of stocks and bonds as well as on redemptions of capitalisation shares of collective investment vehicles that are executed by Belgian residents through Belgian or non-Belgian financial intermediaries. The tax rates vary from 0.12% to 1.32% depending on the type of transaction. The tax is automatically withheld at source in case the transaction occurs through a Belgian financial institution. Otherwise, in case the foreign bank does not comply with its withholding and reporting obligation, it is the beneficiary's responsibility to report the transaction and pay the tax.
## Other non-income taxes
### Registration duties
Purchases and transfers of real estate located in Belgium, including buildings (except new buildings, which are subject to VAT as described above), are subject to registration duty at the rate of 12.5% of the higher of transfer price or fair market value in the Walloon and Brussels Regions. In the Flemish Region, the applicable rate is 10%. Since income year 2017, the Brussels Region has introduced an exemption of registration duties for the first EUR 175,000 provided several strict conditions are met.
In case the purchase or transfer of land is subject to VAT, no registration duties will be charged on this purchase or transfer.
In principle, no registration duty is due upon a capital contribution; only a fixed fee of EUR 50 is due.
### Stamp duties
Stamp duties are due on transactions relating to public funds that are concluded or executed in Belgium, irrespective of their (Belgian or foreign) origin, to the extent that a professional intermediary intervenes in these transactions. Exemptions for non-residents and others are available.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
### Scope of VAT
The following transactions are subject to VAT in Belgium if they are considered to take place in Belgium:
### Intra-Community supply and intra-Community acquisition
An intra-Community supply of goods is a supply of goods whereby the goods are moving from one EU member state to another EU member state. In the member state of departure of the goods, the goods can be, under certain conditions, VAT exempt. As a result, the intra-Community acquisition of the goods (i.e. the arrival of the goods in the other member state) will be taxable.
### Standard and other VAT rates
The standard VAT rate is 21%. This rate applies to all goods and services not qualifying for one of the reduced VAT rates.
The following supplies of goods and services have a 12% VAT rate:
The following supplies of goods and services have a 6% VAT rate:
The following supplies of goods and services are VAT exempt with credit (‘zero-rated’):
The following supplies of goods and services are, under certain conditions, VAT exempt without credit:
It should be noted that specific conditions may apply to the above two categories.
### VAT grouping
Under a VAT group, independent legal persons are treated as one single taxable person for VAT purposes if they are closely linked financially, economically, and organisationally. Hence, for VAT purposes, all supplies of goods and services to or by the group members are deemed to be made to or by the group itself.
The application of a VAT group has, amongst others, the following consequences:
## Import duties
Goods coming from outside the European Union and imported into Belgium are subject to import duties. Import duties are calculated based on three main elements:
### Classification
All products are classified based on the rules laid down in the Combined Nomenclature (CN). All products traded in the world can be classified in accordance with the tariff nomenclature and the six General Rules of Interpretation (GIR). An import duty rate is linked to every commodity code and is based on TARIC level.
### Origin
Based on international trade agreements (i.e. bilateral), a preferential import duty rate (i.e. a lower import duty rate) may apply to products imported in the European Union in case the goods meet the applicable criteria in the country benefiting from the agreement. In addition, it should be determined if your goods are produced in the beneficiary countries eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the EU's Scheme of General System of Preferences (GSP) for developing countries.
Furthermore, non-preferential rules of origin are used to determine the country of origin of goods for the application of the most-favoured nation treatment but also for the implementation of a number of commercial policy measures, such as trade embargoes, safeguard measures, anti-dumping and countervailing duties, or tariff quotas.
### Valuation
The customs value is determined based on one of the six rules laid down in the Union Customs Code (UCC). The most commonly used rule to determine the customs value upon importation in the European Union is the ‘transaction value’ (i.e. Article 70 of the UCC).
These valuation rules are harmonised on a global level through Article 7 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) valuation agreement.
Various economic customs regimes (i.e. bonded warehouse, inward processing procedure, outward processing procedure) are available, allowing optimisation schemes throughout the supply chain.
## Excise duties
Excise goods are divided into the following two groups:
The European Union determined the threshold (with minimum and maximum rates) in which the EU member states have to define the applicable excise duty rate per product on a national basis. With respect to the national excise goods, every member state has the liberty to freely decide upon the national excise duty rates applicable.
## Property taxes
Immovable property is subject to an immovable WHT (also called ‘real estate tax’) due on a yearly basis to the region in which the property is located. This tax is calculated as a percentage of the so-called ‘cadastral income’ of the property (a kind of ‘deemed’ rental income). This deemed rental income should constitute the average normal net income of one year (based on rental incomes of similar properties in 1976). Since the cadastre has not been updated since 1976 and since this merely concerns a fictitious income, this 'deemed' rental income can only be considered as a presumed income, which generally will not match the actual income the immovable property could generate.
The tax rate depends on where the property is located (as it is a combination of regional, provincial, and communal tax).
Machinery and equipment can also be considered as immovable property if certain conditions are met (e.g. sustainable connection to the property although intrinsically being movable property).
## Registration duties
If the purchase or transfer of land is subject to VAT, no registration duties will be charged on the purchase or transfer.
In principle, only a fixed fee of EUR 50 is due upon a capital contribution.
Note that registration duties are also due when concluding (long-term) lease agreements on land/buildings located in Belgium. The applicable tax rate in this respect is 5% as of 1 January 2024.
## Stamp duties
Stamp duties are due on transactions relating to public funds, irrespective of their (Belgian or foreign) origin, that are concluded or executed in Belgium (including when the order is given directly or indirectly to a foreign intermediary by a Belgian resident or a legal entity for the account of a seat or establishment thereof in Belgium), to the extent that a professional intermediary intervenes in these transactions. Exemptions for non-residents and others are available.
## Payroll taxes
In Belgium, there are no payroll taxes applicable other than those for social security contributions (*see below*) and income tax withholding.
## Social security contributions
### Contributions for employees and employers
The employers’ social security contributions in Belgium amount to 25%, to be calculated on uncapped income. This percentage consists of the base rate of the employers’ contribution (i.e. 19.88%) and the wage moderation (i.e. 5.12%).
For low wages, a reduction on the employer social security contributions applies, next to specific target group reductions. Moreover, for certain types of employers, a structural reduction, combined with a low wage component, may apply, next to specific target group reductions.
The employees’ social security contributions are fixed at 13.07% and are also to be calculated on uncapped income. Employees with a monthly gross salary of +/- EUR 3,200 or less are entitled to an automatic reduction of the personal contributions (i.e. 'employment bonus'). This reduction is applied as a flat rate that decreases gradually based on the employee's gross monthly salary. The calculation of the employment bonus differentiates between low and very low wage categories.
When calculating the social security contributions for blue collar workers (both employees’ as well as employers’ contributions), the calculation should always be done on the basis of 108% of the normal gross salary.
Social security contributions are deductible in determining taxable income both for the employer (CIT) and for the employee (PIT).
### Contributions for self-employed workers
The social security contributions due by individuals working as sole traders or on a self-employed basis are calculated (and collected) in an entirely different manner.
The contributions amount to (amounts for 2024):
No contributions are due on the income above EUR 107,300.30.

## Taxable period
The Belgian tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December. The tax return for income year 'x' must be filed during the year 'x+1', called the tax year (e.g. income year 2023, tax year 2024). The assessment notice must be sent by the tax authorities by 30 June of the year 'x+2'.
## Tax returns
A tax return is sent during the tax year by the tax authorities to be filled in by the taxpayer. An assessment note is sent by the tax authorities within six months following the tax year. Any tax due must be paid to the tax authorities within two months following the sending of the assessment notice.
Spouses and legal cohabitants must file a joined tax return even though their income is taxed separately.
## Payment of tax
There is a compulsory income tax withholding (WHT) from salaries (also for directors, now called 'key men').
Professional WHT is due under the following circumstances:

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 28 August 2024
Belgium taxes its residents on their worldwide income, irrespective of their nationality.
Residents of Belgium are taxable on their worldwide income, while non-residents are only taxable on Belgian-source income.
Personal income tax (PIT) is calculated by determining the tax base and assessing the tax due on that base. Taxation is charged on a sliding scale to successive portions of net taxable income. For income year 2024, the federal tax rates range between nil and 50% (*see below*).
The tax calculation contains two major components, notably the 'federal PIT' and the 'regional PIT'. Pursuant to the 6th Reform, the Belgian regions are now entitled to retain surcharges on 'reduced federal personal income taxation', and also grant tax reductions/tax credits. The tax liability may therefore differ (although slightly at this stage) depending on the region in which the residence of the taxpayer is located on the 1st of January of the respective tax year.
Tax rates are the same for resident and non-resident taxpayers, but some deductions or tax rebates are only granted to non-residents, provided that they earn at least 75% of their worldwide professional income in Belgium.
## Personal income tax rates
Tax brackets for income year 2023 are applicable to net taxable income after the deduction of social security charges and professional expenses.
| Taxable income (EUR) | | Rate (%) | Tax on bracket (EUR) | Cumulative tax (EUR) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 15,820 | 25 | 3,955 | 3,955 |
| 15,820 | 27,920 | 40 | 4,840 | 8,795 |
| 27,920 | 48,320 | 45 | 9,180 | 17,975 |
| 48,320 | and above | 50 |  |  |
## Tax on investment income
Income from capital includes interest, dividends, or other forms of investment.
Interest and dividends paid out and collected via a Belgian financial institution are, in principle, subject to a flat-rate tax of 30%. Interest from ordinary savings accounts is exempted from taxation up to a limit of EUR 1,020 (income year 2024). Any interest exceeding this amount is subject to tax at a rate of 15%. Dividend payments are exempted for the first EUR 833.
Foreign interest and dividends collected abroad by resident taxpayers must be declared in their annual tax return for the net amount (after the deduction of the foreign tax withheld at source), and the flat-rate tax is paid on assessment. Please note that pursuant to a decision of the European Court of Justice, communal taxes should no more be applied on these foreign interest and dividends.
Pursuant to a ruling of the Belgian Supreme Court, it is now possible to subtract a part of the French WHTs from the Belgian WHTs that are due on dividends received from those French stocks. Investors can claim back excessive WHTs from the past five years. Please note that this regime only applies to French dividends and cannot be extrapolated to dividends received from other countries.
## Local income taxes
For residents of Belgium, communal taxes are levied at rates varying from 0% to 9% of the income tax due. The average rate being 7%. For non-residents, a flat surcharge of 7% is due. In some cases, communal taxes may also be levied on exempted foreign-source income.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Corporate income tax (CIT)
In general, the tax base for CIT purposes is determined on an accrual basis and consists of worldwide income less allowed deductions. The rules are equally applicable to companies and PEs. It is assumed that all income received by a company is, in principle, business income. The income tax base is based on the Belgian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) financial statements of the company.
### General rate
CIT is levied at a rate of 25%. This rate applies to both Belgian companies (subject to Belgian CIT) and Belgian permanent establishments (PEs) of foreign companies (subject to Belgian non-resident CIT).
Capital gains on qualifying shares realised when meeting all conditions are fully exempt, while non-qualifying shares are subject to the 25% rate.
### Reduced rate
SMEs (based on article 1:24 of the Code for Companies and Associations, and provided several other conditions are met) are able to benefit from a reduced rate of 20% on the first bracket of EUR 100,000 profit.
## Surcharge
## Secret commissions tax
A special assessment of 100% is applicable to so-called ‘secret commissions’, which are any expenses of which the beneficiary is not identified properly by means of proper forms timely filed with the Belgian tax authorities. These expenses consist of:
The secret commissions tax can be limited to 50% if certain conditions are met. In some cases, no secret commissions tax applies.
The special assessment is a non-deductible expense. As of 10 December 2022, secret commissions for which the special assessment is applied are also no longer tax deductible (subject to exceptions).
## Minimum tax base ('basket rule')
A minimum tax base applies for companies with a taxable profit that exceeds EUR 1 million via the limitation of certain deductions. Deductions outside the basket are fully deductible. Deductions within the basket can only be claimed up to the amount of 70% of the profits exceeding the EUR 1 million threshold. The remaining 30% is fully taxable at the CIT rate. The threshold of 70% was temporarily replaced by 40% as of tax year 2024, associated with a taxable period beginning, at the earliest, on 1 January 2023. It has become 70% again as of tax year 2025, linked to a taxable period starting, at the earliest, on 1 January 2024, considering the law transposing the Council Directive (COM/2021/823) on ensuring a global minimum level of taxation for multinational groups in the European Union (so-called ‘Pillar Two’) has entered into force.
The deductions within the basket are the deduction of tax losses carried forward, the dividends-received deduction (DRD) carried forward, the innovation income deduction carried forward, and the notional interest deduction (NID) (both carried forward and incremental NID before it was abolished). Other deductions are excluded from the basket and thus fully deductible (e.g. current year tax losses, current year dividends-received deduction, current year innovation income deduction, investment deduction [both current year and carried forward]).
## Taxable income of non-residents
Certain income attributed by a Belgian tax resident to a non-resident is taxable in Belgium. A paragraph in the BITC functions as a ‘catch all clause’ to tax certain payments made to a non-resident of Belgium.
The ‘catch all clause’ applies in case the following conditions are all met:
Given the condition of ‘any direct or indirect links of interdependence’, provision of services between non-related parties should thus, in principle, remain out of scope.
The rate amounts to 25% on the gross fee paid (resulting in an effective tax rate of 12.5%, as a lump sum deduction of 50% as professional expenses is allowed).

## Federal government negotiations: expected tax reform
In the context of the federal government negotiations, a tax reform is anticipated following the elections held on 9 June 2024. Although proposals for adjustments to certain tax measures are being negotiated, in December 2024 no agreement has been reached yet.
## Changes to the Belgian transfer pricing documentation forms (Royal Decree of 16 June 2024, Official Gazette of 15 July 2024)
The Belgian administration has published adjusted transfer pricing documentation forms and guidance (Master File, Local File, and Country-by-Country Reporting). The adjusted forms (275 LF, 275 MF and 275 CBC NOT) and explanatory notices were included in the Royal Decree dated 16 June 2024 and were published on 15 July 2024 in the Belgian Official Gazette. The adjusted forms will come into effect from financial years starting per 1 January 2025.
The most significant adjustments are on the form 275LF where transactions in Part B must be completed per country instead of aggregating the countries and the form 275CBC NOT where a notification can be the first notification, a change in the previous notification or a termination of the notification if the Belgian entity is no longer part of the Multinational group.
## Public CbC Reporting law of 8 January 2024 (Official Gazette of 26 January 2024) and Royal decree of 18 April 2024 (Official Gazette of 6 June 2024)
The Public CbC Reporting Directive has been implemented by the law of 8 January 2024 and the Royal decree of 18 April 2024.
Companies that fall in scope of the Belgian Public CbC Reporting law are: (i) Belgian (parent) companies with a net turnover of more than EUR 750 million and subject to income taxation in multiple jurisdictions as well as (ii) non-European parent companies with a net turnover of more than EUR 750 million that are economically active in Belgium through a subsidiary or branch and subject to the Belgian tax system.
Although the Belgian Public CbC Reporting law was generally drawn up to be consistent with the Directive, specific deviations include, among others:
It is important to bear in mind that CbC Report data will soon be publicly available as the first Belgian Public CbC Report must be published for financial years starting on or after 22 June 2024. Hence, the first Belgian Public CbC Report filing date is set at 21 June 2026 (31 December 2026 for companies with financial statements following the calendar year).
## Law of 12 May 2024 on various tax provisions (Official Gazette of 29 May 2024)
On 29 May 2024, the law of 12 May 2024 containing various tax provisions was published in the Belgian Official Gazette. This law implements several changes to the regime of the investment deduction and the innovation income deduction (IID).
The new regime is organised around three 'tracks':
The law provides for fixed investment deduction rates. Hence, going forward, these rates will no longer be subject to the yearly indexation mechanism.
A taxpayer can only choose one of the above-mentioned types of investment deduction per fixed asset.
The general conditions to benefit from the investment deduction remain the same.
The new regime, as well as the correction related to the (partial) professional withholding tax (WHT) exemption regime to determine the investment deduction basis, will be applicable for investments made as of 1 January 2025.
In addition, the law of 12 May 2024 provides for the following modifications to the IID and tax credit for innovation income:

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
A company is a resident of Belgium for tax purposes if it has its principal place of business or its seat of management in Belgium. The seat of management has been defined by Belgian case law as the place from where directing impulsions emanate or the place where the company's effective management and central administration abide, meaning the place where the corporate decision-making process actually takes place.
Although in company law the 'registered seat' theory has become the new general rule since the reform of Belgian company law in 2019, from a tax point of view, the 'real seat' theory remains applicable. Therefore, new definitions of 'companies', 'resident companies' (combined with a rebuttable presumption to avoid situations of double non-residence), and 'foreign companies' have been introduced in the BITC.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The definition of a Belgian establishment under Belgian domestic tax law corresponds, but is broader than, the definition of a PE under either the OECD Model Tax Convention or Belgium’s DTTs. Since the latter prevail over domestic law, Belgium generally cannot levy tax if a non-resident has a Belgian establishment that does not constitute a PE under the relevant DTT. Although Belgium would not be entitled to tax the profit attributable to the Belgian establishment in such a case, the foreign company should still abide by certain formal tax requirements (e.g. filing a non-resident tax return, responding to requests for information).

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
As a general rule, expenses are tax deductible in Belgium if they are incurred in order to maintain or to increase taxable income, they are incurred or have accrued during the taxable period concerned, and evidence of the reality and the amount of such expenses is provided by the taxpayer.
## Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation of an asset is tax deductible to the extent that it results from a devaluation of the asset, and the devaluation effectively occurred during the taxable period concerned. The depreciation methods that are accepted by Belgian tax law are the straight-line method (linear method) and, in the past, the double-declining balance method. In the latter case, the annual depreciation may not exceed 40% of the acquisition value.
Depreciation rates are based on the expected lifetime of the assets concerned, which are normally agreed upon by the taxpayer with the tax authorities. However, for certain assets, rates are set by administrative instructions as follows:
| Assets | Depreciation rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Commercial buildings | 3 |
| Industrial buildings | 5 |
| Machinery and equipment (depending on the type) | 20 or 33 |
| Rolling stock | 20 |
Intangible fixed assets must be amortised over a period of at least five years for tax purposes (except R&D expenses, for which the minimum amortisation period is three years).
For the year of acquisition of an asset, only the proportionate share of an annual depreciation calculation can be accepted as depreciation for income tax purposes (in principle to be computed on a daily basis). The same rule applies for acquisition-related costs, such as registration duties and notary fees due upon a purchase of real estate, but SMEs can opt to fully deduct these costs in the year of the acquisition.
## Goodwill
Belgian accounting and tax laws allow amortisation of goodwill arising at the occasion of an asset deal. For Belgian tax purposes, the amortisation period, which depends on the elements included in the goodwill, is a minimum of five years, and the straight-line method must be applied. According to the Minister of Finance, '*clientele*' (client lists) should be amortised over a period of 10 to 12 years. The aforesaid accounting and tax amortisation for goodwill is not available if tax-free mergers or de-mergers occur (i.e. they, among other things, follow the continuity principle from an accounting perspective).
## Start-up expenses
Incorporation costs, at the election of the taxpayer, may be deducted fully in the year of incorporation or can be depreciated over a maximum period of five years.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are, in principle, tax deductible insofar as thin capitalisation/30% EBITDA limits are respected (*see Thin capitalisation in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*) and the interest is at an arm’s-length rate.
## Provisions and bad debt reserves
Provisions and bad debt reserves are tax deductible provided that:
Provisions for risks and charges are only deductible for tax purposes if:
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions may not be less than EUR 40 and may not exceed 5% of the total net income of the taxable period, with a maximum of EUR 500,000 to be tax deductible. The law includes an exhaustive list of gifts that are deductible, including gifts in cash to certain social, cultural, or scientific organisations.
## Car costs
### Current rules
As of 2020, the deductibility of car costs and fuel costs is calculated based on the following formula: 120 – (0.5 x coefficient x number of grams CO2/km), whereby the coefficient equals:
The maximum deductibility percentage is limited to 100% and the minimum amounts to 50% (or 40% if the grams CO2/km are at least 200 gm/km).
Special rules apply to plug-in hybrid cars, with a distinction as to whether they were bought or leased after 31 December 2017.
### Future rules
As of 2026 onwards, only zero-emission company cars will be able to benefit from a tax deduction. Zero-emission company cars purchased before 1 January 2027 will remain 100% tax deductible. For zero-emission cars purchased after this date, this percentage will be gradually reduced to 67.5% by 2031. For polluting cars (i.e. any car with a CO2-emission higher than 0g/100km) purchased before 1 July 2023, the current tax regime will remain unchanged. For polluting cars purchased after 1 July 2023, a cool-down period is foreseen whereby the deduction will be gradually reduced to zero by 2028.
As for the deduction of fuel costs, a maximum deduction of 50% for the costs related to fossil fuel will be introduced if the car is purchased or leased as from 2023. Electricity for powering the vehicle will continue to be tax deductible at 100%.
Investments in public charging stations made by companies during certain periods are incentivised by allowing an increased tax deduction:
## Taxes, fines, and penalties
The following taxes and penalties are not tax deductible in Belgium (non-exhaustive list):
Immovable WHT (i.e. real estate tax) and foreign taxes, however, are considered as tax deductible.
## Disallowed expenses
The following expenses are not tax deductible in Belgium (this list is not exhaustive):
## Net operating losses
### Principle: Carried forward without limitation in time
### Change of control
If a change of control of a Belgian company takes place (e.g. if the shares of the company are transferred and along with them the majority of the voting rights), the amount of tax losses, investment deduction, NID carried forward, IID carried forward, and DRD carried forward available in that company (before the change of control) can no longer be offset against future profits unless the change can be justified by legitimate needs of a financial or economic nature in the hands of the loss realising company (i.e. evidence must be brought that the change is not purely tax driven).
A ruling can be requested from the Belgian tax authorities to obtain upfront certainty on the Belgian tax treatment of the contemplated operation and to ensure the losses are not forfeited as a result of a change of control.
### Tax-free merger or (partial) de-merger
If a tax-free merger or (partial) de-merger takes place, Belgian tax law provides for a partial transfer/maintenance of the rollover tax losses of the absorbed/absorbing company. The carried forward tax losses of the companies involved are then reduced based on the proportionate net fiscal value of the company (before the restructuring) compared to the sum of the net fiscal values of both the merging entities (before the restructuring). The current limited deduction of prior-year losses in the framework of a tax-neutral reorganisation also applies to the carried forward dividends-received deduction.
### Carryback
There is no tax loss carryback provision under Belgian tax law (except for the agriculture sector).
## Foreign PE losses
Foreign PE losses can only be deducted from the profits of the Belgian head office profits if certain conditions are fulfilled. As of 2020, the deduction has been limited to definite PE losses. In addition, the recapture rule only comes into play if the losses were set off in any taxable period against Belgian profits or against treaty-exempt profits.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
A Belgian company can claim a deduction for royalties, management service fees, and interest charges paid to foreign affiliates, provided such amounts are at arm's length. However, when such payments are made, either directly or indirectly, to a foreign affiliated person, entity, or PE that is not subject to tax or is subject to a tax regime that is notably more advantageous than the Belgian tax regime on such income, there is a reversal of the burden of proof. Such charges will be disallowed unless the Belgian company can prove that the transaction:
Fees, commissions, etc. paid to beneficiaries located in foreign countries and not properly reported, will, in principle, be subject to the secret commissions tax.
### Payments to tax havens
Companies subject to Belgian CIT or Belgian non-resident CIT that make direct or indirect payments to recipients established in tax havens at the time the payment is made are obligated to declare them if they are equal to or exceed EUR 100,000 during the tax year. The reporting must be made on a special form to be attached to the (non-resident) CIT return.
In the event of non-reporting, the payments will be disallowed expenses for CIT purposes. Where the payments have been reported duly and timely, their tax deductibility will be subject to the ability of the taxpayer to prove that (i) said payments were made as part of genuine, proper transactions and (ii) they were not made to an entity under an artificial construction.
A tax haven is defined as a jurisdiction:
The reporting concerns direct or indirect to payments made to:

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Belgium applies a tax consolidation mechanism with respect to corporate tax. Under this tax consolidation regime, which is also known as the 'group contribution' regime, Belgian companies (and Belgian PEs of foreign companies) may compensate taxable profits with current year tax losses if certain conditions are fulfilled, such as, amongst others:
The group companies must compensate each other for the tax burden of the group contribution; because of which, the tax consolidation is financially neutral on a group level. Transferred taxable profits can only be offset against current-year tax losses and not against carried forward tax losses that have been generated in the past. The scope of the tax consolidation regime is limited to certain qualifying companies and subject to various conditions. To benefit from the tax consolidation regime, the group companies concerned have to conclude a so-called 'group contribution agreement' that meets several conditions.
## Transfer pricing
The arm's-length principle is formally codified in the Belgian Income Tax Code (BITC). A Belgian circular of 25 February 2020 provides an overview of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines for multinational enterprises and tax administrations.
In addition, the tax authorities can make use of other, more general, provisions in the BITC to assess the arm’s-length nature of transfer prices (e.g. the general rules on the deductibility of business expenses). The BITC contains provisions that tackle artificial inbound or outbound profit shifting. These are the so-called provisions on abnormal or gratuitous benefits.
If a Belgian tax resident company grants an abnormal or gratuitous benefit, the benefit should be added back to the taxable income as a disallowed expense unless the benefit was considered to determine the taxable basis of the beneficiary. Even if the abnormal or gratuitous benefit was included in the taxable basis of the beneficiary, the tax deductibility of the related expenses can still be denied in the hands of the grantor. Notwithstanding the above exception, the abnormal or gratuitous benefit should be added back to the taxable income when the benefit is being granted to a non-resident affiliated company. Such granted abnormal or gratuitous benefits can be offset against any tax-deductible items (e.g. tax losses carried forward, NID).
If a Belgian tax resident company receives an abnormal or gratuitous benefit, and to the extent that such benefit is received from a related company, the benefit received cannot be offset by the Belgian company against its current year or carried forward tax losses or other tax deductions. According to the position of the tax authorities (by the Minister of Finance), the taxable basis of a Belgian company equals at least the amount of the benefit received. This position has been confirmed by the Supreme Court.
Belgium has a special transfer pricing investigation unit with a mission to (i) build up and share transfer pricing expertise and (ii) carry out in-depth transfer pricing audits of multinationals present in Belgium through a subsidiary or PE. The number of transfer pricing audits being initiated in Belgium has increased significantly.
Belgian tax law has introduced specific transfer pricing documentation requirements. These requirements are based on Action 13 of the OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project.
Belgian tax law requires a three-tier documentation approach as provided under BEPS Action 13: Master File, Local File, and Country-by-Country (CbC) Reporting. According to these documentation requirements, Belgian entities of a multinational group that exceed one of the following criteria:
need to submit to the tax authorities a master file and a local file (the detailed form that is part of the local file only when at least one of the business units of the entity has realised intra-group cross-border transactions of more than EUR 1 million).
Belgian ultimate parent entities of a multinational group with a gross consolidated group revenue of at least EUR 750 million should file a CbC report. Under certain conditions, the Belgian entity that is not the ultimate parent entity of the multinational group may be required to file the CbC report directly with the Belgian tax authorities.
The master file and CbC report should be filed no later than 12 months after the last day of the reporting period concerning the multinational group. The local file, however, should be filed with the tax return concerned.
There are also specific transfer pricing documentation penalties, ranging from EUR 1,250 to EUR 25,000.
Advance pricing agreements (APAs) can be concluded (unilaterally, bilaterally, and multilaterally) via which the taxpayer can obtain upfront certainty.
## Thin capitalisation
### Old thin capitalisation rule (until tax year 2019 with grandfathering)
Belgian tax law provides for a general thin capitalisation rule (5:1 debt-equity ratio) according to which interest payments or attributions in excess of a 5:1 debt-equity ratio are not tax deductible.
For the purposes of the thin capitalisation rule, equity is defined as the sum of the taxed reserves at the beginning of the taxable period and the paid-up capital at the end of the taxable period.
For the purposes of the thin capitalisation rule, debt is defined as:
Bonds and other publicly issued securities are excluded, as well as loans granted by financial institutions.
Interest payments or attributions in excess of the 5:1 ratio are not tax deductible. The thin capitalisation rule is not applicable to loans contracted by (movable) leasing companies and companies whose main activity consists of factoring or immovable leasing (within the financial sector).
In case the loans are guaranteed by a third party or in case loans are funded by a third party that partly or wholly bears the risk related to the loans, the third party is deemed to be the beneficial owner of the interest if the guarantee or the funding has tax avoidance as its main purpose.
To safeguard companies having a centralised treasury function in Belgium, a netting for thin capitalisation purposes is allowed at the level of the interest payments and interest income related to the centralised financing function/cash pool function.
The thin capitalisation rule existed until and including tax year 2019. As of tax year 2020 (financial years ending 31 December 2019 or later), the EBITDA-based rule applies.
However, the thin capitalisation rule remains applicable in case of (i) grandfathered loans (i.e. loans granted before 17 June 2016, in case no 'fundamental' modifications have been made) and (ii) interest paid to a beneficiary located in a tax haven.
### EBITDA-based rule (as of tax year 2020)
The EBITDA-based rule is in line with the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD) I requirements. Exceeding borrowing costs are only tax deductible up to the highest of (i) 30% of the taxpayer’s fiscal EBITDA or (ii) EUR 3 million. The exceeding borrowing costs that could not be deducted in the current taxable period can be carried forward for an unlimited time. Furthermore, upon certain conditions, taxpayers belonging to the same group also have the possibility to transfer unused EBITDA capacity to other group companies.
A grandfathering clause applies for loans granted before 17 June 2016. However, the old thin capitalisation rule remains applicable for interest payments to tax havens.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
The Belgian CFC regime was introduced in 2017 as part of the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD). The first version of the CFC regime taxed non-distributed income arising from non-genuine arrangements that have been put in place for the essential purpose of obtaining a tax advantage (transactional approach). Basically, this approach required that the significant people functions generating the CFC income were located in Belgium.
From tax year 2024, the CFC regime has been reformed based on an entity approach, as it now focuses on the taxation of passive income subject to low taxation abroad (defined as half of the taxation that would occur under the Belgian rules), unless the taxpayer can prove that sufficient substance is available locally.
A foreign company qualifies as a CFC if both the participation and the taxation condition are met:
If the foreign entity (or PE) qualifies as a CFC, the amount of income/profit to be allocated to the Belgian taxpayer needs to be calculated/assessed according to Belgian accounting and tax rules (recalculation is thus necessary). The foreign profits are then allocated to the Belgian taxpayer taking into account the following parameters:
For the additional taxable basis in Belgium, a tax credit of the foreign tax effectively paid would be available.
There are also some exceptions (‘safe harbours’) foreseen that, when applicable, would safeguard certain foreign income from taxation at the Belgian taxpayer’s level, more specifically when:
From a tax compliance perspective, all entities qualifying as CFCs have to be reported in the Belgian CIT return.
### Circular letter of 13 December 2024
On 13 December 2024 the Belgian tax administration issued a circular regarding the CFC rule (Circular 2024/C/82). It elaborates quite extensively on the different aspects of the updated Belgian CFC rules, including the interpretation of the Belgian tax authorities on how taxpayers are expected to apply these rules. The key elements that are addressed by this circular letter are the following:
#### Participation Condition
The circular provides extensive clarification on the interpretation of the participation condition, including a number of examples. It confirms that the participation condition is only fulfilled if the Belgian taxpayer holds at least one share in the foreign entity, excluding ‘sister’ entities (and indirect subsidiaries) from qualifying as a CFC of the Belgian taxpayer.
#### Taxation Condition
For foreign entities within the EEA, local GAAP accounts do not need to be converted into Belgian GAAP, reducing the compliance burden for EEA-based entities held by a Belgian taxpayer. For entities outside the EEA, the circular letter explicitly states that a conversion to Belgian GAAP financials is required.
Certain formalities related to Belgian corporate income tax provisions may not be fulfilled by the foreign entity. In such cases, these provisions can still be considered for recalculating the deemed Belgian taxable base.
If a (Q)DMTT under Pillar 2 is levied in the jurisdiction of the foreign entity, it will not be considered an income tax for assessing the taxation condition under the Belgian CFC rules. This could have an impact on groups that are subject to the Pillar 2 rules.
The circular also provides additional clarifications on temporary and permanent differences (temporary differences can be excluded subject to certain conditions), the interplay with foreign fiscal consolidation regimes and interest limitation rules (a stand-alone entity approach is mentioned) and relevance of carried-forward losses/tax assets of the foreign entity.
Finally, it confirms that the Belgian CFC rules are not applied in ‘cascade’, meaning they do not need to be considered to determine the recalculated Belgian tax base of a foreign entity that holds (potential) CFCs.
#### Safe harbours
The circular letter focusses especially on the uncertainty linked to the substantial economic activity safe harbour and tries to nuance certain parts of the parliamentary works. As reiterated in the circular letter, the application of the substance safe harbour is a safe harbour that is to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Some elements linked to this that have been further clarified in the circular:
Goods and services delivered in an intra-group context are not automatically excluded to determine the presence of a ‘substantial economic activity’.
Outsourced activities can also be considered in assessing whether a ‘substantial economic activity’ is deemed present.
Foreign holding companies can be part of the group’s economic activities, assuming the holding company actively participates in managing the enterprises it holds.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
PE profits and capital gains on shares that do not meet the one-year holding period are subject to the standard CIT rate of 25% (or fully exempt for certain capital gains on qualifying shares if all conditions are met).
In general, the taxable basis is the difference between the profits actually realised and the tax-deductible costs actually incurred in the hands of the Belgian PE as determined from the separate set of accounts of the Belgian PE. No legal requirement exists to keep a separate set of accounts in the hands of the PE, unless there is a legal PE/branch in Belgium.
Should no separate set of accounts be kept, the taxable basis in the hands of the Belgian PE, in principle, can be determined on a lump-sum basis with minima per employee that vary between EUR 7,000 and EUR 24,000 (depending on the kind of business) and an absolute minimum of EUR 40,000 (to be indexed) in case of non or late declaration. Note that such determination of the taxable basis is often formalised in a written agreement with the local Belgian tax inspector without deviating from the tax law criteria as mentioned.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Foreign tax credits (FTCs)
Unilateral relief from double taxation of foreign-source income may be provided in the form of an exemption, credit, or tax reduction, depending on the type of income. Where taxable, foreign income is subject to tax only on its net amount (i.e. after deduction of expenses and foreign taxes).
### Dividend income FTC
Generally, no FTC is available for foreign dividends.
### Royalty income FTC
### Interest income FTC
## Investment deductions
The investment deduction has been revised by the Law of 12 May 2024 on various tax provisions, as published in the Official Gazette on 29 May 2024. This law implements major changes to the investment deduction regime.
### Former regime: investments made before 2025
The investment deduction is a deduction from the tax base in addition to the normal tax depreciation on, amongst others, qualifying patents, environmentally friendly R&D investments, and energy-saving investments.
A company can benefit from a one-off investment deduction for investments made during the taxable period linked to tax year 2025 until 31 December 2024. Please find below an overview of the percentages that apply for companies:
If there are insufficient or no taxable profits, the investment deduction can be carried forward, but certain restrictions apply as to the maximum amount of investment deduction carried forward that is tax deductible in a given year. The carryforward of the above-mentioned ordinary one-time investment deduction is also limited in time.
Under certain conditions, the investment deduction carried forward can be lost after a change of ownership (*see Net operating losses in the [Deductions](deductions.html) section*). Note that the investment deduction for patents and R&D cannot be combined with the tax credit for patents and R&D.
### New regime: investments made as of 2025
The new regime is organised around three 'tracks':
The law provides for fixed investment deduction rates and will no longer be subject to the yearly indexation mechanism.
A taxpayer can only choose one of the above-mentioned types of investment deduction per fixed asset.
The general conditions to benefit from the investment deduction remain the same.
The new regime, as well as the correction related to the (partial) professional WHT exemption regime to determine the investment deduction basis, will be applicable for investments made as of 1 January 2025.
## Patents and R&D tax credit
As an alternative for the above investment deduction for patents and R&D, a company may opt for a tax credit for which the advantage corresponds to the advantage of the investment deduction, multiplied by the normal CIT rate of 25%. The investment deduction implies a deduction of the taxable basis, while the tax credit is a reduction of the tax due. A key advantage of the tax credit for patents and R&D is that it is refundable if it has not been deducted for five subsequent tax years.
As of tax year 2025, taxpayers can choose either to fully credit the tax credit for R&D against CIT or to carry it forward according to the rules specified in the law.
## Reduced wage WHT for qualifying R&D
A partial wage withholding tax (WHT) exemption for R&D activities executed in Belgium is available to companies in Belgium. This exemption can be applied by companies if the following (cumulative) conditions are met: the applicant must execute R&D activities, the R&D projects must be notified with Belspo prior to starting their execution, and the employees need to be in the possession of a qualifying degree (PhD, master’s, or bachelor’s degree in [applied] sciences, engineering, etc.). Since mid-2023, an additional requirement was introduced by the legislator. It is today mandatory for applicants of the measure to prove they have instored fitting internal processes regarding the application of the exemption. The requirements of said internal processes have, however, not been specified.
The measure allows a maximum of 80% of the wage WHT to be exempted on behalf of the employees for whom the aforementioned conditions are met. However, the time spent on R&D activities (indicated by a percentage of the total working time of the employee) should be considered when determining the maximum applicable exemption of 80%. The exemption can only be applied for those employees that are included on the Belgian payroll and for whom the applicant is paying wage WHTs to the Belgian treasury. One should note that, contrary to the past, the benefit obtained from the application of the partial wage WHT exemption cannot be applied in combination with the R&D tax credit for the same expenses.
Particular attention should be brought to the evolving regulatory landscape with regards to the measure. Today, it has become even more important to ensure the R&D activities are notified in the Belspo portal prior to the application of the exemption by the applicant under penalty of nullity of the applied exemption for the full duration of the particular R&D activities. Towards the future, the legislator has promised to foresee more legal certainty to applicants. However, the modalities of said legal certainty and what these modalities will entail, have not yet been defined.
## Innovation income deduction (IID)
The IID is based on Action Point 5 of the OECD BEPS Action Plan (applying the so-called ‘modified’ nexus approach) and replaces the (previous) Belgian patent income deduction (PID) regime, which was grandfathered for five years (until 30 June 2021).
The qualifying patent/innovation income is calculated on a net basis. The percentage of this deduction is raised from 80% under the (old) PID regime to 85% under the IID regime, resulting in an effective tax rate of 3.75% as of tax year 2021 over the lifetime of the intellectual property (IP).
### Qualifying intellectual property (IP)
The IID can apply to income derived from the following IP of which the company or branch has the full ownership, co-ownership, usufruct, or license of or right to use:
Under the IID regime, the benefit is available as of the date the patent is requested (and provided that the patent is actually granted afterwards).
### Innovation income
Without making any restrictions to SMEs, the following income is considered as derived from the above qualifying IP in so far as the remuneration is included in the Belgian taxable result of the Belgian company or branch concerned:
Furthermore, the proceeds from a transfer of qualifying IP are also in the scope of the deduction, subject to a reinvestment condition to be met within five years.
For the first taxable period during which the IID will be applied, the (net) innovation income should be decreased by the overall expenditure incurred during (preceding) taxable periods ending after 30 June 2016. Alternatively, one can opt to spread this recapture on a straight-line basis during a period of a maximum of seven years. In the case that the qualifying IP right terminates or is alienated before the end of this seven-year period, a correction will apply in order to limit the IID actually applied to the amount that would have been applied if no spread recapture had been opted for.
### Calculation of the IID
The IID is determined by multiplying the net innovation income by a fraction. This fraction represents the ratio between one’s own R&D activities and the outsourced R&D activities (towards related parties). As such, the taxable result of a Belgian company or branch is reduced by 85% of the total net innovation income after this fraction has been applied.
IID = ((qualifying expenditures + uplift) / overall expenditure)) x net innovation income x 85%
It is important to note that the ratio should be calculated on a net basis, implying that current year deducted overall expenditure should be deducted from the current year qualifying innovation income.
However, the law of 12 May 2024 provides that as of tax year 2025 taxpayers will have the option not to offset part or the full amount of IID against the taxable basis but to convert it into a non-refundable tax credit for innovation income. The law of 12 May 2024 provides that the tax credit can be carried forward and offset against CIT of (one of) the following taxable periods. Taxpayers will have the choice for each taxable period whether or not to apply this tax credit.
From 2026 onwards, the effect of the tax credit for innovation income will be evaluated on a yearly basis, paying special attention to the budgetary cost of the measure and Belgium’s competitive position compared to neighbouring countries.
Excess deduction that cannot be used due to insufficient taxable basis can be carried forward to be compensated with future taxable profits.
The qualifying expenditure may be uplifted by 30%, with a maximum of the overall expenditure. This means that the uplift may increase the qualifying expenditure but only to the extent that the taxpayer has non-qualifying expenditure. The purpose of this uplift is to ensure that the nexus approach does not penalise taxpayers excessively for acquiring IP or outsourcing R&D activities to related parties.

Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Cayman Tax
The ‘Cayman Tax’ was introduced as of 1 January 2015 in the BITC and was recently adjusted by the Program law of 22 December 2023. The regime introduces a tax transparency of certain legal arrangements that have been set up or that are being directly or indirectly held by Belgian private individual tax residents (and Belgian entities subject to legal entities income tax).
More precisely, the Cayman Tax targets the ‘founder’ of the legal arrangement in its broad sense. That concept includes, among others, any direct or indirect shareholder of an entity, whether or not the foreign entity is controlled by the Belgian founder and irrespective of any ownership threshold. Registered ultimate beneficial owners (UBOs) qualify as founders of the structure for tax purposes.
The Cayman Tax provides for three distinct taxable events:
These three taxable events create a risk of double taxation, which is addressed by a reclassification of taxable dividends, under certain conditions, into exempted dividends.
Concerning the legal arrangement, a distinction is made between three categories:
1. trusts and other structures without legal personality (type 1),
2. foreign entities with legal personality that are subject to an effective tax rate of less than 15% calculated according to the rules of Belgian income tax law (type 2), and
3. a type 1 or type 2 legal arrangement wrapped up in an agreement (type 3).
Regarding the type 2 legal arrangements, the tax applies to entities with a zero or lower than a 15% effective tax rate (according to the Belgian rules) or to those established in a country on blacklists (the EU list for non-cooperative jurisdictions or the Belgian list for countries with a low tax regime or zero tax regime). Further, the following entities fall in the scope of the Cayman Tax:
The tax also does not apply to:
Besides taxation, founders are also obligated to report legal constructions in their annual income tax returns. This reporting must include detailed information on the legal arrangements involved, their administrators, and financial data, thereby enabling a precise tax audit at a later stage.
### New Circular Letter
After almost ten years of existence, the Belgian tax authorities finally issued on 13 December 2024 a first circular letter on the Cayman Tax (2024/C/79).
This circular letter does not address the practical difficulties generated by the Cayman Tax such as the so-called ‘Belgian recalculation’, but only aims at justifying the application of the Cayman Tax irrespective of whether the legal arrangement is resident in a country with which Belgium has concluded a DTT.
In short,
The aforementioned Report of the Court of Auditors highlights that there are differing viewpoints in the doctrine and jurisprudence regarding the interaction between the Cayman Tax and the DTT.
## Transparency
### FATCA, CRS, and DAC2
#### Goals
FATCA (a United States [US] initiative: US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) and CRS (an OECD initiative: Common Reporting Standard) aim to tackle offshore tax evasion via a shared objective of Automatic Exchange of Information (AEoI) in Tax Matters. Although CRS relies to a large extent on the FATCA system, there are noticeable differences, and interpretation can also substantially vary across different jurisdictions.
In a nutshell, financial institutions have to comply with due diligence and reporting obligations with respect to: (i) accounts held by specified US persons (FATCA) or reportable residents of other participating states (CRS) and (ii) accounts of certain non-financial entities qualifying as 'passive', which are controlled directly or indirectly by private individuals who are reportable persons. Financial institutions also have registration obligations under FATCA.
#### FATCA
The US Congress enacted FATCA in 2010. FATCA is applicable in other jurisdictions in either of the following situations:
Belgium entered into a Model I IGA (Belgian IGA) with the US authorities on 23 April 2014, which was implemented into Belgian domestic law through the Act of 16 December 2015.
On 20 April 2015, the Belgian tax authorities published draft Belgian Guidance Notes on the Belgian IGA related to FATCA, which are subject to modifications, but can offer more insight on certain FATCA concepts.
Of particular interest, on 24 May 2023, the Contentious Chamber of the Data Protection Authority decided to prohibit the processing of data of accidental Belgian Americans by the Belgian tax administration (Decision 61/2023). On 21 June 2023, the Belgian tax administration decided to file an appeal and a request for suspension of the execution of such a decision.
On 22 December 2023, the Market Court nullified decision 61/2023. The case has been referred back to the Contentious Chamber, with a different composition, for a new reasoned decision on the merits. Therefore, the exchange of information provided for in the FATCA agreement will continue according to the specified terms and schedule, according to the Federal Public Service Finance.
#### CRS/DAC2
On 15 July 2015, the OECD approved its CRS on AEoI. This model has been endorsed by more than 120 countries so far (Belgium has been amongst the early adopters).
At the level of the European Union, the main legal framework for administrative cooperation, including exchange of information, is the Directive 2011/16/EU of 15 February 2011 on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation and repealing Directive 77/799/EEC (DAC).
The Council Directive 2014/107/EU of 9 December 2014 (DAC2) integrates the CRS into the DAC, and the Belgian Act of 16 December 2015 implements DAC2 into domestic law.
On 14 March 2017, the Belgian tax authorities published the Belgian Guidance Notes on CRS (version 1), which contain valuable clarifications on the practical application of the CRS and DAC2. An update (version 2) was published on 28 August 2017.
The Royal Decree of 14 June 2017 implements the Act of 16 December 2015. Amongst other things, the Royal Decree lists ‘other reportable jurisdictions’ (non-EU states) based on the year during which the first CRS reporting is required.
### AEoI of advance cross-border tax rulings and APAs (DAC3)
Council Directive (EU) 2015/2376 of 8 December 2015 (DAC3) completes the DAC by requiring EU member states to automatically exchange a basic set of information on advance cross-border tax rulings ('rulings') and advance pricing arrangements ('APAs'), which are broadly defined.
From 1 January 2017, EU member states must exchange information twice a year (i.e. 'within three months following the end of the half of the calendar year during which the rulings or APAs have been issued, amended or renewed'). For rulings and APAs issued before 1 January 2017, a five-year look-back period applied.
The Act of 31 July 2017 implements DAC3 into domestic law and foresees a retroactive application by requesting the exchange of reportable rulings and APAs from 2012 till 2016. Before the entry into force of this Act, reportable rulings and APAs were in practice already exchanged to a certain extent (spontaneous exchange of information). DAC3 was also implemented at regional level.
### Country-by-country report (DAC4)
The Council Directive (EU) 2016/881 of 25 May 2016 (DAC4) completes the DAC by providing for the AEoI on the country-by-country report (CbCR).
The Act of 1 July 2016 and the Royal Decrees of 28 October 2016 have introduced the results of the OECD’s BEPS Action 13 in Belgian tax law (*see Transfer pricing in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*). As a result, multinational groups with operations in Belgium should, under certain circumstances, submit a CbCR.
Such CbCR is then subject to AEoI to other EU member states pursuant the Act of 31 July 2017 implementing DAC4.
The Belgian tax administration has adopted a circular in the form of a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) regarding BEPS action 13 (Circular 2020/C/88).
### UBO register
#### Principles
The Act of 18 September 2017, modified a.o. by the Act of 8 February 2023, provides for the creation in Belgium of a centralised register of ultimate beneficial owners (UBO register) in accordance with Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing (the so-called 'fourth' Anti-Money Laundering Directive).
Companies, (international) non-profit organisations, and foundations (amongst others) are required to collect and hold information on their beneficial owners. The register should contain at least their name, date of birth, nationality, and country of residence, as well as the nature and extent of the beneficial interest held. A UBO is defined as any private individual who directly or indirectly controls a company or another legal entity incorporated in Belgium, either by holding 25% of the shares / voting rights / ownership interest or otherwise. The weighted percentage of shares or voting rights that the indirect UBO holds or controls in the obligated entity and in each intermediary entity must be recorded. If no UBO can be identified, senior management of that entity will be considered to be the UBOs.
In addition to the initial registration of the UBOs, every change must be updated within the month and, moreover, the accuracy of the information must be confirmed annually. Not only the currently registered information is accessible, but also the complete history of the registration.
As per the Royal Decree of 30 July 2018, modified by the Royal Decree of 8 February 2023, the Belgian UBO register is accessible to the competent authorities, sanctioning authorities, other authorities authorised to identify or monitor the ultimate beneficial owners, eligible entities, and each natural person or legal entity demonstrating a legitimate interest or, in some cases, who submits a written request.
The new provisions particularly alter the procedure for consulting the UBO register, in order to comply with the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union dated 22 November 2022 (joined cases C-37/20, Luxembourg Business Registers and C-601/20, Sovim). From now on, the situations considered to have a legitimate interest are as follows:
Every access to the register will be saved and can be traced during ten years. A beneficial owner can file a request to restrict the disclosure of the registered information for citizens and organisations, provided there is a high risk of fraud, abduction, extortion, intimidation, or when the beneficial owner is a minor or not legally competent.
#### Access by tax authorities and exchange of information (DAC5)
The Council Directive (EU) 2016/2258 of 6 December 2016 (DAC5) completes the DAC by providing access to anti-money-laundering information to tax authorities. The latter has been implemented into domestic law by the Act of 26 March 2018 and Royal Decree of 12 May 2019.
The Belgian tax authorities will communicate any information contained in the UBO register in the case of a request from a foreign tax administration.
### Exchange of information by 'intermediaries' on cross-border arrangements (DAC6)
Council Directive (EU) 2018/822 of 25 May 2018 (DAC6) completes the DAC as regards mandatory AEoI in relation to reportable cross-border arrangements. It aims at strengthening tax transparency and deterring aggressive tax planning. DAC6 was implemented in Belgium by the Act of 20 December 2019 and the Royal Decree of 20 May 2020. Regional decrees were also adopted to that end. In June 2020, the Belgian tax authorities published a FAQ with further guidance on the application of the DAC6 rules.
These rules require disclosure to tax authorities of cross-border arrangements entered into by taxpayers that fall within certain broadly defined hallmarks. Some of the hallmarks, but not all of them, will only apply where objectively the main benefit, or one of the main benefits, of the arrangement is to obtain a tax advantage (so-called 'main benefit test'). DAC6 also mandates AEoI of disclosed information among EU member states and gives the EU Commission (partial) access to it.
When there is an intermediary (such as a tax advisor) based in an EU member state, that intermediary will be required to make the disclosure. If there is no intermediary required to report the transaction, the obligation will normally pass to the taxpayer.
The Belgian implementation of DAC6 foresees that an intermediary bound by legal professional privilege (such as a lawyer or a registered tax advisor) has to inform the other intermediaries (if any) or the taxpayer that there is a reporting obligation due but that the actual reporting is prevented due to legal professional privilege rules. The legal professional privilege rules do not apply for reporting obligations related to so-called ‘marketable’ arrangements.
In Belgium, these specific rules are being challenged before the Constitutional Court (17 December 2020, 167-168/2020; 11 March 2021, 45-46/2021; 17 June 2021, 94-95/2021, 103/2022, 15 September 2022, 20 July 2023, 111/2023, 11 January 2024, 1-2-3-4/2024) and the Court of Justice of the European Union (Case C694/20, Orde van Vlaamse Balies and Others, 8 December 2022; Case C-623/22, Belgian Association of Tax Lawyers and Others, 29 July 2024).
Penalties ranging from EUR 1,250 to EUR 100,000 per infringement may, in principle, be applied by the tax authorities. The intentional character (or not) of the breach will be considered. Since the Act of 20 December 2024, if the infringement occurs independently of one's will, the minimum penalty is set at 0 EUR.
The normal reporting deadline of 30 days is fully applicable since February 2021. A periodic report on marketable arrangements is also due every three months.
### Reporting obligations for platform operators (DAC7)
Council Directive (EU) 2021/514 of 22 March 2021 (DAC7) completes the DAC as regards the AEoI for digital platform operators (both EU and non-EU platforms). DAC7 introduces specific obligations to collect, verify, and exchange information on their sellers with the tax authorities.
The scope of the Directive is very broad as the term platform covers 'any software, including a website or a part thereof and applications, including mobile applications, accessible by users and allowing sellers to be connected to other users for the purpose of carrying out a relevant activity, directly or indirectly, to such users. It also includes any arrangement for the collection and payment of a consideration in respect of a relevant activity'.
It should be noted that DAC7 aims to cover both private individuals and companies that are sellers of the platform. The mere fact of being registered on the platform during the reportable period is sufficient to qualify as a 'seller' if one of the activities covered by the Directive is carried out for consideration, such as:
Once the 'seller' falls into the scope of the Directive, some information will have to be communicated to the tax authorities (e.g. the name and identity of the seller, the total consideration paid or credited to the seller).
In addition, the administrative cooperation between EU member states' tax administrations is also strengthened, including by providing a legal basis for 'joint audits'. Furthermore, active participation in tax investigations by foreign tax officials is made possible.
The Act of 21 December 2022 (amended by the Act of 22 December 2023 aiming to strengthen the oversight and enforcement of the law at the platform operator level and by the Act of 20 December 2024) and Royal Decree of 25 December 2023 implement DAC7 into domestic law. Regional decrees were also adopted to that end.
#### Belgian former reporting obligations
As a precursor to DAC7, Belgium had already introduced certain reporting obligations for digital platform operators through the Act of 20 December 2020. This preliminary version of the DAC7 obligations was applicable as of 1 January 2021 until 31 March 2023.
The reporting obligations under the Belgian law applied to ‘digital co-operation platforms’ (non-defined term), both Belgian and foreign. The material scope of the Belgian reporting obligations was more limited compared to DAC7 as it was limited to personal services (provided by individuals only, irrespective of whether the services were provided in a professional context or not). Platform operators had to (i) inform their users on their legal (tax and social) obligations and provide these users with an overview of all transactions performed through the platform and (ii) report this information to the Belgian tax authorities. These obligations had to be fulfilled for the last time by 31 March of each year.
### Crypto-asset reporting framework, high-net-worth individuals, sanctions policy, and other changes (DAC8)
Council Directive (EU) 2023/2226 of 17 October 2023 (DAC8) again further modifies the DAC to provide for an AEoI regarding new means of payment and investment, such as crypto-assets and e-money. It is expected that such reporting will facilitate tax control of crypto-assets and e-money. The Directive also further strengthened the rules on administrative cooperation, in particular, regarding high-net-worth individuals (exchange of information about cross-border rulings), the use of the information exchanged (for purposes other than tax), exchange of information on non-custodial dividend income, and sanctions policy.
Member states are required to adopt and publish the necessary laws, regulations, and administrative provisions to comply with the Directive by 31 December 2025. These provisions should be applied from 1 January 2026. The Directive also sets additional deadlines for specific articles, with provisions to be adopted by 31 December 2027 and 31 December 2029, and to be applied from 1 January 2028 and 1 January 2030, respectively. The specific implementation and entry into force dates may vary between member states.
### Public Country-by-Country Reporting (Public CbCR)
#### Directive of 24 November 2021
The Directive (EU) 2021/2101 of 24 November 2021 (the so-called 'Public CbCR' Directive) introduced specific European transparency rules and requires certain European and/or non-European multinational groups or standalone undertakings to publicly disclose certain financial data. More in particular, multinational enterprises or stand-alone undertakings with a total consolidated revenue of more than EUR 750 million over the last two consecutive financial years should make certain (tax) information public.
The Directive provides for a combination of aggregation and disaggregation of the information to be made public.
According to the Directive, the information must be disclosed on a disaggregated basis, that is, on a country-by-country basis, for every:
Under the Directive, the information related to other jurisdictions may be disclosed on an aggregated basis.
The Public CbCR Directive entered into force on 21 December 2021.
#### Belgian Public CbCR Law and Royal Decree: Broad Implementation
The Public CbCR Directive has been implemented by Belgium into national legislation via the law of 8 January 2024 and the Royal decree of 18 April 2024.
In addition to member states and jurisdictions included in the EU black and grey lists, the Belgian implementation provides that the information of the report on income tax information should also be disaggregated for the following jurisdictions:
The Belgian implementation does not specify the effective dates for the various lists related to Public CbCR. It defines a 'non-cooperative tax jurisdiction' as a tax jurisdiction listed in Annexes I and II of the Council conclusions on the revised EU list of non-cooperative countries and territories for tax purposes, updated annually in February and October, deviating from the directive’s specified timings.
The first Public CbCR is foreseen for financial years that start on or after 22 June 2024. The publication should take place within 12 months from the date of the balance sheet of the financial year in question.
### ATAD 3
On 22 December 2021, the European Commission released a new important proposal laying down rules to prevent the misuse of shell entities for tax purposes (commonly referred to as ATAD 3 proposal).
The ATAD 3 proposal has as its objectives to (i) identify the so-called shell entities with no minimal substance and economic activity (based on a substance test), (ii) define common tax-related substance requirements for these entities operating within the European Union, and (iii) deny certain tax benefits and impose disclosure requirements and AEoI between EU member states.
The ATAD 3 proposal stems from the European Commission's Communication on Business Taxation for the 21st Century, in which the European Commission pledged to tackle the abusive use of entities and arrangements that have no or little substance. ATAD 3 would apply to all undertakings that are considered tax resident and are eligible to receive a tax residency certificate in an EU member state, regardless of their legal form (e.g. including SMEs, partnerships that are deemed residents for tax purposes, trusts). Undertakings falling into either of the following categories would not be in scope of the Directive however:

## Foreign tax relief
Belgian tax residents must report their worldwide income on their Belgian resident tax returns. Income that is taxable/taxed/effectively taxed (depending on the wording of the particular treaty) abroad is exempted with progression from Belgian tax (i.e. the foreign income is exempt from taxation in Belgium but is taken into account to determine the marginal tax rate applicable to the other income taxable in Belgium).
Exempted income from Bahrain, China, Congo, France, Germany, Japan, Macedonia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Rwanda, San Marino, Seychelles, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Uruguay is, however, subject to communal taxes in Belgium.
## Tax treaties
Belgium has concluded a double tax treaty with more than 150 countries.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 28 August 2024
## New expat tax regime
The essential characteristics of the 'new' expat regime can be summarised as follows:
## Tax measures in response to COVID-19
### Double tax treaties (DTTs)
There is no general 'force majeure' tolerance for cross-border employment.
Belgium has, however, concluded specific agreements with France, the Netherlands, Germany, and Luxembourg, which implement a mutual 'force majeure tolerance' for cross-border workers in relation to COVID-19 (travel) restrictions. These agreements have been extended until 30 June 2022.
Similarly, the Belgian and French authorities consider that the situation related to the coronavirus met the characteristics of a force majeure situation. Therefore, it was decided that, as of 14 March 2020 until 30 June 2022, the presence of a French frontier worker at one's place of residence (in particular for teleworking) will not be taken into account for the calculation of the 30-days period by reference to which tax residents of France who usually work in Belgium can work outside Belgium.
Please note that there is no administrative tolerance foreseen for foreign executives working in Belgium under the 'old' special tax regime with respect to the foreign travel that is impacted solely because of COVID-19 measures.
From a social security point of view, according to the European Union (EU) regulation for social security nr 883/2004, employees who works at least 25% of their time in the country of residency are covered by the social security system in that country. Employees who perform less than 25% of work in their country of residence are usually covered by the social security system in the country where their employer is located. In June 2020, due to travel restrictions linked to COVID-19, the European Union adopted guidelines indicating that changes in the work pattern of employees due to COVID-19 should not be taken into account for the determination of the country responsible for social security. This measure has been extended until 30 June 2023. No further extension is expected after that date.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 28 August 2024
## Employment expenses
In determining the tax base, compulsory social security contributions (paid in Belgium or abroad) are fully deductible.
Employment-related expenses are also deductible, provided they are substantiated; alternatively, standard deductions may be claimed.
For employees, the standard expense deduction amounts to 30% of the gross earning, up to a ceiling of EUR 5,750.
For remunerated directors, the standard deduction is a flat 3% and cannot exceed the ceiling of EUR 3,030.
In addition to social security contributions and professional expenses, some non-business expenses can also be deducted from the taxable basis, and personal exemptions are granted.
## Personal deductions
### Tax reductions
Some non-business expenses give rise to a tax reduction.
At the federal level, the most commonly granted reductions mainly concern:
At the regional level, the most commonly granted tax reductions concern:
## Personal exemptions
In addition to the above-mentioned deductions, some personal exemptions are granted. The following amounts are deductible in determining taxable income.
### For each taxpayer
The personal basic exemption amounts to EUR 10,160.
### For dependent children
| Number of children | Exemption increase (EUR) | Accumulated exemption (EUR) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1,920 | 1,920 |
| 2 | 3,030 | 4,950 |
| 3 | 6,140 | 11,090 |
| 4 | 6,850 | 17,940 |
For any other dependent person, an amount of EUR 1,920 is deductible.
It must be stressed that the exemption takes place on the lowest part of income (at the lowest marginal tax rates).
Handicapped children or other dependants count for two children/dependants in the above scale.
For each child less than three years old on 1 January of the tax year, the above amounts are increased by EUR 690, provided no child custody expenses are deducted.
The rates and brackets applicable as of assessment year 2025 (income year 2024) to determine the taxes linked to the personal exemptions are as follows:
| Personal exemptions (EUR) | | Rate (%) | Gains on bracket (EUR) | Total (EUR) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 11,120 | 25 | 2,780 | 2,780 |
| 11,120 | 15,820 | 30 | 1,410 | 4,190 |
| 15,820 | 26,360 | 40 | 4,216 | 8,406 |
| 26,360 | 48,320 | 45 | 9,882 | 18,288 |
| 48,320 | and above | 50 |  |  |
The income of each spouse/legal cohabitant is taxed separately. Special rules exist when one spouse has no or low earned income, as noted below.
The exempt income, personal deductions, and the attribution of income to the spouse are, in principle, applicable both to residents and non-residents, although for non-residents these exemptions and deductions are only applicable provided they earn at least 75% of their worldwide professional income in Belgium. Moreover, in order to be entitled to regional tax benefits in Belgium, those non-residents must also maintain their tax residency in another member state of the European Economic Area.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 28 August 2024
Belgian residents are taxed on their worldwide income, but their foreign-source income is exempted with progression in Belgium if it is taxable, taxed, or effectively taxed (depending on the wording of the DTT) in another country according to the applicable DTT. Please note that in some cases exempted income may be subject to local taxes (e.g. exempted income from Bahrain, China, Congo, France, Germany, Japan, Macedonia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Rwanda, San Marino, Seychelles, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Uruguay).
Belgian non-residents are taxed on their Belgian income source only.
## Employment income
Employment income is widely defined and includes all fringe benefits provided by an employer (e.g. the private use of a company car, bonuses, stock options, commissions, tax equalisation reimbursements, cost of living allowances, housing allowances).
In determining the tax base, employee compulsory social security contributions paid either in Belgium or abroad are fully tax-deductible. Professional expenses can also be deducted from the taxable income (either on an actual basis, or on a lump sum basis). Income tax is calculated on that base, after allowing for part of that base to be exempt from tax (the so-called personal tax exemption - *see Personal exemptions in the [Deductions](deductions.html) section for more information*).
In addition to these standard personal deductions, some non-business expenses may reduce tax liability (such as gifts made to recognised institutions, childcare expenses for children younger than 14 years old, titres-services/dienstencheques, reduction for own dwelling, etc.).
Non-resident taxpayers are only entitled to personal deductions (at the federal income level - such as deduction for childcare expenses, tax reductions for gifts made to recognised institutions, etc.) if they earn at least 75% of their income in Belgium. Tax reductions at the regional level are only granted to non-residents who earn at least 75% of their income from Belgian sources and who remain resident of another European Economic Area (EEA) country. *See the [Deductions](deductions.html) section for more information*.
### Special tax regime
The Law introducing the new expat regime was published in the Official Gazette on 31 December 2021. It is applicable as of 1 January 2022.
The essential characteristics of the new regime can be summarised as follows:
### Company cars
The private use of a company car is considered a taxable benefit in kind but is exempted from employee social security charges.
The yearly benefit in kind on which the employee or company director is taxed is equal to 6/7 of the catalogue value of the car (to be understood as the list price of the car for a sale to an individual when it was new, including options and the actually paid VAT, but excluding any discounts and rebates) multiplied by a percentage linked to the car’s CO2 emission rate (the 'taxable percentage').
In addition, the benefit in kind takes into account the age of the car, by multiplying the catalogue value with a percentage in function of the age of the car (based on the first registration of the car).
The base taxable percentage to apply to the catalogue value of the car is 5.5% for a diesel car with a CO2 emission rate of 65 g/km and for a petrol car with a CO2 emission rate of 78 g/km (figure for income year 2024 - assessment year 2025). This base taxable percentage of 5.5% is then increased/decreased by 0.1% for each CO2 gram/km above or below the CO2 reference emission threshold (with a minimum percentage of 4% and a maximum percentage of 18%). In no circumstance can the benefit in kind be lower than EUR 1,600 per year (amount for income year 2024).
The following formula will be applied to determine the taxable benefit in kind (figures 2023):
The list of the so-called 'false hybrid cars' is updated annually. This has an impact on the determination of the taxable benefit in kind for the beneficiary and on the corporate tax deductibility.
#### Mobility budget
Since 1 March 2019, the government has introduced a mobility budget in order to stimulate employees that have a company car to opt for different means of transportation. If offered by the employer, the mobility budget gives the employee the opportunity to change one's car in exchange for a budget based on the total cost of ownership of the car handed in. With this budget, the employee can choose a less polluting car, sustainable means of transportation, and/or a cash payment. The mobility budget is subject to a favourable tax and social security regime that differentiates depending on the options chosen by the employee.
## Equity compensation
### Stock options accepted in writing within 60 days of the offer date
Stock options accepted in writing within 60 days of the offer date are taxed to the beneficiary on the 60th day following the offer date. The taxable basis of a stock option listed on a stock exchange is determined as the closing market price of the day preceding the offer date of the option.
The taxable basis of a stock option accepted in writing within 60 days and not listed on a stock exchange is the sum of
### Stock options accepted in writing after the 60th day following the offer and stock options that have not been formally accepted
Stock options accepted in writing after the 60th day following the offer date and stock options that have not been accepted in writing are taxable at exercise. The taxable basis for such options consists of the positive difference between the fair market value of the underlying shares at exercise and the exercise price paid, after deduction of possibly applicable Belgian employee’s social security contribution.
Please note that a reporting and withholding obligation is now applicable in any case to Belgian companies when benefits (in cash or in kind) are granted directly by a foreign affiliated company to employees/company directors working for the benefit of the Belgian entity. In practice, this means that the Belgian company must report on the employee's salary slips/summary statements all benefits granted by a foreign-related company even if there is no recharge of the costs and no intervention of the Belgian employer. The reporting obligation is applicable since 1 January 2019. The withholding obligation is applicable since 1 March 2019.
## Business income
Profits from a business or profession also include capital gains on the sale of business assets, although a favourable tax treatment applies if these assets have been held for more than five years. Self-employed expatriates do not qualify for the special tax regime described above.
## Capital gains
### Real estate
Capital gains realised in the scope of a professional activity are taxed at the normal progressive rates. Capital gains realised outside the scope of normal management of one's private estate is taxed at 33% plus communal tax.
In case the sale occurs outside the scope of a professional activity, but inside the normal management of one's private estate, the capital gain can be taxable depending on the length of the investment. A difference is made whether it concerns a residence or land.
#### Residence
Capital gains realised on the sale of the primary residence are not taxed provided that the taxpayer has actually occupied the residence continuously for at least 12 months. At least six months of this must fall within the 12-month period before the sale of the residence.
In case the building is not the primary residence and the sale occurs within five years following the acquisition of the building, the capital gain will be taxed at 16.5% to be increased with communal tax.
#### Land
Capital gains realised on land are potentially taxable depending on the duration of the ownership:
#### Taxable basis
The taxable basis is the difference between the sales value and the purchase value. A lump sum amount of purchase cost equal to 25% of the purchase price is taken into account (unless one can prove that one incurred more costs) as well as the costs of any renovation work carried out by a registered contractor. Finally, the purchase value is also increased by 5% for each full year that has passed between the purchase and the sale. Costs incurred during the sale are, in principle, deductible to determine the sale price.
#### Exemptions
Several exemptions exist:
### Assets other than real estate
Capital gains are not taxable to individuals in Belgium, provided they are realised within the framework of the normal management of the individual's private estate. Capital gain taxes for private individuals are levied only on sales to a foreign (non-EEA) company of substantial holdings in a Belgian company and on sales of property in certain circumstances.
Capital gains and foreign-source investment income cashed outside the country are not taxable for non-residents working in Belgium.
## Dividend income
Since 1 January 2017, dividends paid or attributed via a Belgian financial institution are subject to withholding tax (WHT) at a flat rate of 30% (15% is also applicable on dividends in some restrictive cases). The first EUR 1,020 (income year 2024) are exempted from tax.
## Interest income
Since 1 January 2017, the WHT rate on most movable income, such as interest, is fixed at 30%.
The first EUR 1,020 (income year 2024) of interest on a savings account is exempted from taxation (limit applicable to each taxpayer in case of a joined account). Interest from saving accounts exceeding that threshold remains taxable at 15%.
## Rental income
Owners occupying residential houses are taxed on the notional rental income. Properties rented out are taxed on the notional rental income or on the net rental income received (after deducting lump-sum rental expenses). Non-resident expatriates are liable to tax on Belgian real estate.
## Cayman tax
The ‘Cayman tax’ is a tax charge on certain income from certain legal constructions (which are deemed to be transparent) in the hands of Belgian individuals (and Belgian entities subject to legal entities tax).
The legal constructions include, among others, foreign trusts, foundations, undertakings for collective investments or pension funds when not publicly offered, low-taxed or non-taxed entities, etc. to which the Belgian individual (or Belgian entity subject to legal entities tax) is, in one way or another, linked as a founder, effective beneficiary, potential beneficiary, etc.
Under these provisions, the income of certain legal constructions becomes taxable in the hands of the private individual before distribution of the income. Consequently, the owner may be taxed on income that one has not yet received.
The taxpayer has to mention on one's yearly tax return the existence of a legal construction (including additional information) of which one (or one's spouse or one's children) is the founder or the third beneficiary.

The Program Act of 10 August 2015 has introduced a new tax deduction for individual taxpayers (both residents and non-residents) who acquire new shares in a starting small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) even when the investment is made via a recognised crowdfunding platform or via a recognised starters’ fund. This tax deduction amounts to 30% (45% if it concerns micro-companies) of the qualifying amount (which is limited per taxable period) and is only granted if several conditions are met regarding shares, time of acquisition of these shares, and enterprise, in which the taxpayer invests. The tax deduction can be cancelled retroactively in the case where the taxpayer does not meet a four-year holding period. This is applicable to shares issued as of 1 July 2015.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 28 August 2024
Residents of Belgium are those who have established their domicile or, if they do not have a domicile in Belgium, their centre of economic interests in Belgium. Persons deemed to be residents of Belgium are those who have registered in the population register of a commune in Belgium. The fiscal residence of married couples and legal cohabitants is determined by the place where the family is located.
In civil law, domicile is essentially the same as residence in income tax law; the term is generally used when considering liability to inheritance tax.
Generally, an international assignee is considered to be a Belgian resident if:
