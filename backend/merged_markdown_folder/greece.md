## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
Resident corporations are taxed on their worldwide income. Non-resident corporations are taxed in Greece on any Greek-source income they derive therein.
For the tax year 2021 onwards, the corporate income tax (CIT) rate of legal entities, with the exemption of credit institutions, has been reduced to 22%.
Furthermore, credit institutions are taxed at a rate of 29% only if and for those tax years that they are subject to the specific provisions of Art. 27A of the Income Tax Code (ITC) regarding deferred taxation.
## Shipping companies
The Greek tonnage tax regime model intends to tax shipping activity and applies to Greek or foreign ship-owning companies with vessels flying a Greek flag and foreign ship-owning companies with vessels flying a foreign flag that maintain a ship management company in Greece that is exclusively engaged in ship management activities. The Greek tonnage tax regime applies to vessels of ‘A’ and ‘B’ category that are either flying a Greek or foreign flag. In the case of vessels flying a foreign flag, the foreign ship-owning company should maintain a ship management office in Greece. Category ‘A' vessels include cargo vessels, tankers, steel hull vessels for dry or liquid cargo that fly to/between foreign ports, passenger vessels, drilling platforms, etc. Category ‘B' vessels include small boats and any other motor vessels not listed under category ‘A’.
Based on Law 4336/2015, the tonnage tax levied on certain categories of vessels flying a Greek flag (i.e. professional vessels, leisure yachts, ferries, etc.) has been expanded to vessels flying flags of the European Union or EU area member states, with exhaustion of the income tax liability of the ship owners on income earned from the related activity.
Said provision aligns the regime applying to said category of vessels following the European Commission’s accusation of discriminatory treatment of foreign-flag vessels compared to Greek-flag ones.
The gross tonnage is calculated by multiplying coefficient rates by each scale of gross registered tonnage. This taxable tonnage is then multiplied by an age-corrected rate.
Various exemptions/reductions of the tonnage tax apply, such as:
The tonnage tax exhausts the tax liability of the owner, and, if the owner is a company, this extends to its shareholders. Tonnage tax also exhausts the tax liability in relation to operating profits and capital gains arising out of the sale of the vessel flying the Greek flag. Tonnage tax also exhausts the tax liability of the foreign ship-owning company flying a vessel under a foreign flag managed by a ship management company in Greece, as well as of the shareholders thereof. No CIT or dividend withholding tax (WHT) is levied on shipping profits.
This tax burdens the ship owners or ship-owning companies, while the ship management companies are jointly and severally liable for the payment thereof.
An obligation of the liable parties for submitting before the Ministry of Mercantile Marine an annual statement indicating the name, flag, total tonnage, and age of the vessel under the foreign flag is established.
For calculating the tonnage tax (tax rates and tax brackets, criteria) and the special tax return and payment of tax, the provisions on the tonnage tax payable for Greek-flagged vessels apply in analogy. A credit for the tonnage tax paid abroad is provided.
As of 1 January 2020, the application of the tonnage tax regime is extended beyond ship owning companies and their shareholders and partners, also to bareboat charterers and lessees in case of ship leasing arrangements, and their shareholders and partners up to the level of Ultimate Beneficial Owners.
### Annual contribution imposed on ship management companies
An annual contribution is imposed on offices or branches of foreign enterprises that have been established in Greece by virtue of Article 25 of Law 27/1975 and that are engaged in the chartering, insurance, average (damage) settlements, purchase, chartering or shipbuilding brokerage, or chartering of insurance of ships under Greek or foreign flag of total tonnage over 500 shipping tons, as well as the representation of ship owner companies or undertakings, whose object is identical to the above-mentioned activities. Said contribution is also imposed (referring only to years 2019 onwards) on Greek legal entities operating in Greece in accordance with article 25 of Law 27/1975, which are engaged to activities similar to those stated above.
Greek and foreign companies of Law 27/1975 that are engaged in the management of vessels flying a Greek or foreign flag (that are subject to tonnage tax), as well as in other activities approved by the license of operation, are exempt. Passenger coastal ships or merchant vessels that perform internal routes are exempt.
This contribution is imposed on the total amount of imported foreign exchange and, for the years 2018 onwards, the tax scale is as follows:
| Bracket of annual total foreign exchange (USD) | Rate (%) | Tax per bracket (USD) | Total foreign exchange (USD) | Total tax (USD) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 200,000 | 7 | 14,000 | 200,000 | 14,000 |
| Excess amount | 6 |  | | |
For the years 2016 through 2018, the contribution was calculated on a minimum 50,000 United States dollars (USD), while for the years 2019 and 2020 a minimum contribution of USD 5,000 was imposed on an annual basis. It is increased to USD 6,000 from 2021 onwards.
A special tax return for calculating the contribution on the basis of the imported foreign exchange of the previous year should be filed within March of each year. The contribution is paid in two instalments (April and September).
The distribution of profits by a foreign ship management company maintaining an office or branch in Greece by virtue of Article 25 of Law 27/1975 that is exclusively engaged in the chartering, insurance, brokerage, etc. of vessels to Greek individual tax residents was subject to tax at a rate of 10% up to 2022 and of 5% from 2023. From 2019 onwards, the said provision applies equally to Greek companies.
This tax applies to dividends paid or credited and shall be rendered to the Greek state by the beneficiary of the dividend.
Nevertheless, the 10% tax rate remained the same with regards to cases of distributions of profits by the above-mentioned companies in the form of extraordinary fees and percentages (bonus) to Board of Directors (BoD) members, directors, and officials, in addition to the regular remuneration, exhausting the tax liability of the beneficiaries for said income. From 2019 onwards, the application of the said provision is expanded to all BoD members, directors, and any other employee of both chartering and ship management companies, regardless of whether they are Greek or foreign entities.
The compatibility of the Greek tonnage tax regime with the EU State Aid rules has been investigated by the European Commission and found, in principle, compatible with the EU Maritime Guidelines.
## Local income taxes
No municipal or local taxes on income are paid at a local level.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Taxable period
No taxable years other than the calendar year are permitted.
## Tax returns
The filing of tax returns of natural persons is effected only electronically (via the Internet).
During the marriage or civil-partnership, spouses are required to file a joint tax return starting from the tax year in which the marriage or civil-partnership occurs, covering the income of that year. One spouse is designated to submit the joint tax return and is responsible for reporting the income of both parties. Taxes, fees, and contributions are calculated separately for each spouse's income, with each spouse individually responsible for their respective payments.»
However, the taxable income of one spouse from a business that is financially dependent on the other spouse is added to the taxable income of the other spouse. Taxable income of dependent children is added, with certain exceptions, to the parent who declares the higher total income.
The income tax return may be submitted separately if at least one spouse opts to do so by filing a income tax return by February 28 of the submission year. This choice is binding for the other spouse, irrevocable for the first applicable year, and remains in effect for each subsequent tax year unless revoked by February 28 of the respective year. In the event of separate filings, the provisions related to taxable income of dependent children apply accordingly for the parent who reports the higher income.
For the purposes of the income tax return filing (single or joint), it is mandatory that the taxpayer(s) has obtained a Greek tax registration number. Non-Greek tax residents are required to file an annual income tax return only with the Greek tax office applicable for foreign residents. In this respect, they appoint against the Greek tax authorities, on a basis of a proxy document, a Greek tax resident as their representative. Legal entities are not allowed to be appointed as representatives.
The submission of the Greek income tax returns takes place from March 15 to July 15 for each tax year.
## Payment of tax
Income tax and special solidarity contribution are withheld from salaries and remitted to the tax office by the employer.
The employer must withhold 1/14 of this amount each month from the employee’s salary. The same amount of tax must be withheld from the Christmas bonus, while 1/2 (i.e. 1/28 of the annual tax) is the amount of tax that must be withheld from both the Easter and the vacation bonus. Overtime pay, bonuses, allowances, , as well as retroactive income, are subject to WHT at the rate of 20%. The final tax is computed with the year-end payroll clearance.
Annual income tax withholding on salaries, wages, and pensions is set off against the final income tax assessed on the basis of the individual income tax return. Any amounts withheld in excess of the annual income tax assessed are refunded.
If the taxpayer has income not subject to tax withholding at source (e.g. income from immovable property, freelance professions, or business/commercial activities), a tax prepayment of 55% on the current year’s income tax is assessed by the tax authorities and is paid together with the balance, if any, of the previous year. Only for the first year of tax return filing is such a tax advance payment reduced to 50%.

## Social security contributions
Social security contributions are due on salary and benefits in cash or in kind granted by an employer to its employees, with the exception of specifically enumerated extraordinary benefits of social character (e.g. marriage gifts, birth gifts). More specifically,as per the benefits in kind, said benefits might only be exempted from social security contributions,as lond as they are offered:
i) voluntarily by the employer and for the better serving of the employer's operational need, also contributing to the increase of the employees' productivity and the better quality of the employee's workplace,or
ii) they constitute a measure adopted for the hygiene and safety of the employees, as well as
iii) they are offered personally to the employees and not in cash.
The imposition of social security contributions depends on the social security fund in which the employee is registered.
As of 01.01.2025,the social security contributions will amount to 13.37% at the level of the employee and contributed at 21.79% at the level of the employer,i.e. totally 35.16%. The  monthly social security contribution cap for EFKA is set at 7,572.62 from 1 January 2025.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
## Uniform Tax on the Ownership of Real Estate Property (ENFIA)
The ENFIA applies to all types of real estate rights, including full ownership, usufruct, occupancy and surface rights on all real estate properties in Greece (principal tax). The supplementary tax on individuals was abolished by the provisions of L. 4916/2022 for the year 2022 onwards and replaced by an increase of the principal tax ranging from 5% to 20% according to the total value of the immovable property if it exceeds EUR 500,000.
Specifically, ENFIA is determined based on the data of real estate property of the previous year and respective changes occured, as indicated on the 1st January of the next year of the Real Estate Property Declaration (Specific Form E9).
The principal tax on buildings is calculated by multiplying the square metres of the building by the principal tax ranging from EUR 2 to EUR 16.20 per square metre and other coefficients affecting the value of the property (e.g. location, use).
The principal tax on land is calculated by multiplying the square metres of the land by the principal tax ranging from EUR 0.0037 to EUR 9.2500 per square metre and other coefficients affecting the value of the property (e.g. location, use).
Pursuant the provisions of the new tax law 5162/2024, starting from the year 2025, the Unified Property Tax (ENFIA) for insured individuals' residences will be reduced by 20%, provided that the taxable value of the property does not exceed 500,000 euros. If the property's value exceeds this threshold, the reduction remains at 10%. To qualify for this exemption, the insurance must cover the previous year and have a minimum duration of three months. If the insurance duration is less than one year, the real estate tax reduction will be applied proportionally.
## Inheritance Tax
Pursuant to the Greek tax legislation, Inheritance Tax is assessed on the current value of the property inherited. The said property includes any kind of movable and immovable property located in Greece, regardless of the descendant’s nationality. The taxable value of real estate property inherited is the 'objective value' (it is calculated on the basis of certain predetermined factors set by the Ministry of Finance) on the day of death of the deceased. Immovable assets located abroad are not subject to Greek Inheritance Tax, regardless of nationality and residency.
The tax rates are graduated and vary considerably, depending on the relationship between the deceased (inherited person) and the heir. Tax rates are based on a progressive scale. Relevant rates depend on the parties’ relationship (grade of relation, etc., and certain other factors - e.g. disabilities of the beneficiary); such rates range from 1% to 40%, while there is a tax-free amount (which depends on the proximity of the relationship). As a general rule, the closer the relationship the lower the tax rate. For example, in case of inheritance realised by individuals to their spouses or children (i.e. subject to A' category of the progressive scale), the respective rates range from 1% to 10%, while the tax-free amount is up to EUR 150,000.
Indicatively, the above mentioned tax category Α’ includes spouses, children, grandchildren, parents, and grandparents, category Β’ includes children from a spouse’s former marriage, parents-in-law, brothers, uncles, nephews etc., and category C’ includes distant relatives and non-relatives (blood or affinity relatives other than those referred to in the above-mentioned categories A’ and B’) as well as third parties.
| Value (EUR) | Tax rate (%) | Tax (EUR) | Total value (EUR) | Total tax (EUR) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Category A'** (a. the spouse, b. the children, c. the grandchildren, d. the parents, etc.) | | | | |
| 150,000 | - | - | 150,000 | - |
| 150,000 | 1 | 1,500 | 300,000 | 1,500 |
| 300,000 | 5 | 15,000 | 600,000 | 16,500 |
| Above | 10 |  |  |  |
| **Category B'** (a. the great-grandchildren et seq., the grandparents and great-grandparents, c. the brothers and sisters, etc.) | | | | |
| 30,000 | - | - | 30,000 | - |
| 70,000 | 5 | 3,500 | 100,000 | 3,500 |
| 200,000 | 10 | 20,000 | 300,000 | 23,500 |
| Above | 20 |  |  |  |
| **Category C'** (all the rest of the relatives) | | | | |
| 6,000 | - | - | 6,000 | - |
| 66,000 | 20 | 13,200 | 72,000 | 13,200 |
| 195,000 | 30 | 58,500 | 267,000 | 71,700 |
| Above | 40 |  |  |  |
## Donation tax and parental grant
Donation tax and parental grant (i.e. transfer of assets while the transferor is alive) are assessed on the current value of the property donated. Taxable property includes any kind of movable and immovable property located in Greece. The tax rates are graduated and vary considerably, depending on the relationship between donor and donee. In general, tax liabilities arise upon receipt of gifts and are paid by the donee. The acquisition of real estate property through donation is subject to the same tax scale as inheritance tax. The respective tax return should be submitted to the competent Greek tax office before the signing of the contract.
In case of parental grants (i.e. donation between each parent and each child), the respective tax is imposed on the basis of the same tax progressive scale for category A’ (ranging from 1% to 10%), whereas a tax free amount of EUR 800,000 is provided by law.
## Real estate transfer tax (Law 1587/1950)
Each transfer of real estate, which is not subject to VAT, is subject to real estate transfer tax. The real estate transfer tax is imposed at a rate of 3% on the taxable value of the property. Moreover, on the amount of main transfer tax is imposed an extra tax of 3% in favour of municipalities and communities.
## Other duties
### Municipality Duty (called Telos Akinitis Periousias or TAP)
The real estate ownership is subject to a Municipality Duty. The said duty is levied and collected annually through the electricity bill in favour of municipalities and communities at a currently calculated rate ranging between 0.25‰ and 0.35‰ on the real estate’s objective value (i.e. multiplying the real estate’s square metres by the specific value per square metre, depending on the area where the real estate property is situated [i.e. determined by the Ministry of Finance], and further multiplied by the rate deriving from the building age).
### Duty for the provision of cleaning and lighting services
A duty in compensation for the collection of garbage and waste and for the lighting of the streets, collected by the electricity bill, is due from the user of real estate. According to the relevant law provisions, these duties are calculated by multiplying the real estate’s square metres by a certain rate determined by the municipal council.
## Tax on electrified spaces
The Municipal Council may levy a tax on real estate connected to the grid, the collection of which is effected through the electricity bill. The tax is calculated by multiplying the real estate’s square metres by a rate determined by the municipal or community council ranging between EUR 0.018 and EUR 0.073. The said rate can be increased every year up to 20%.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Taxable period
The taxable period is the calendar year, which may end either on 30 June (for legal persons or legal entities keeping double entry books) or 31 December. The taxable year should not, in any case, exceed 12 months.
The exceptional case of closing the accounting period, for income tax purposes, at a date other than the 31 December or 30 June is limited only to Greek legal entities/other entities that are directly or indirectly owned at a percentage exceeding 50% by foreign legal entities/other entities.
## Tax returns
CIT returns of Greek SAs, limited liability companies (LLCs), and branches of foreign companies are filed on a special form between 15 March and 15 July following the end of the tax year.
Tax returns are required to be submitted electronically.
The CIT return constitutes the basis for the direct assessment of tax, which arises without a further action by the tax administration, simultaneously with the submission of the tax return by the taxpayer.
The taxpayer also has the right to amend the tax return by paying the respective difference in tax or by establishing one’s rights for a refund of tax paid in excess according to the amended tax return.
Moreover, the taxpayer may request the issuance of a corrective tax assessment act in case of filing an amending tax return for which an administrative assessment tax act has been issued, and the tax administration is obligated to issue such corrective tax assessment if the amending tax return is accepted.
## Payment of tax
As of 1 January 2021, an 80% prepayment of the current year’s CIT is withheld at source, based on the tax return, and is paid in eight (8)  equal monthly instalments.
CIT and tax prepayment based on the tax return are paid in six equal monthly instalments, the first of which should be paid until the last day of the seventh month following the end of the tax year and the remaining five until the last day of each consecutive month, which, however, may not extend beyond the same tax year.
For newly established companies, the prepayment is reduced by 50% for the first three years of operations.
## Tax audit process
### Tax audit procedures
The tax audit commences with the issuance of an audit order for open tax years, usually not more than five. The order concerns the audit of all tax issues (CIT, VAT, WHT, capital gain tax, etc.). The duration of the audit may vary from a few weeks to a few months, in certain cases.
The tax administration performs a tax audit from its offices on the basis of the financial statements, tax returns, and other documents that are submitted by the taxpayer, as well as the documents and information in its possession.
The performance of a complete on-site tax audit must be notified to the taxpayer by a previous written notification. A complete on-site tax audit is performed without prior notification in cases where indications of tax avoidance exist.
The tax administration may have access to the books and records and to other documents of the taxpayers, as well as to the receipt of copies thereof. The tax administration has the same rights with regard to books and records that are kept electronically. It is noted that the legal entity subject to keeping books and records must maintain these books and records for at least five years.
An extension of the on-site tax audit may be granted once for six months, as well as for another six months in extraordinary cases.
The right for a new audit of a tax period already audited is provided only in case new data arises that affects the calculation of the tax liability. ‘New data’ is defined as all data that could not have been known to the tax administration upon the commencement of the original tax audit.
The election of the cases subject to audit will be made on the basis of risk analysis criteria. Exceptionally, cases may be elected on the basis of other criteria, according to a decision of the General Secretary of Public Revenue. It should be noted that, based on Law 4389/2016, the General Secretarial for Public Revenue is abolished and a new Independent Authority for Public Revenue is formed aiming to the determination, the assessment, and the collection of tax, customs, and others public revenues.
The tax administration may use the following audit techniques for the indirect determination of the taxable basis:
The procedure of notification of the taxpayer of the results of the tax audit is provided. More specifically, a temporary corrective assessment of tax is issued in case a differentiation of tax arises on the basis of the tax returns of the taxpayer and the results of the audit.
Following the submission of such decisions and within 20 days from the receipt of the notification thereof, the taxpayer may submit its views in writing, whilst after that point a final corrective assessment of tax sheet is issued, which is notified to the taxpayer, within a month from the end of the deadline for submitting the taxpayer’s views in writing.
### Audit Centre for Taxpayers with Great Wealth
### Audit Centre for Large Enterprises
Following the audit and the notification of tax audit findings, the company may in turn:
Moreover, based on the provisions of Law 4438/2016, which was enacted on 28 November 2016, a Mutual Agreement Procedure is introduced in the Code of Tax Procedures, designated to cover the cases of elimination of double taxation in connection with the adjustment of transfers of profits between associated enterprises. Based on these provisions, the taxpayer may file a claim for the initiation of a Mutual Agreement Procedure by application of the Double Tax Conventions as well as the European Convention on the elimination of double taxation in connection with the adjustment of transfers of profits between associated undertakings. The details of application of this new procedure are determined by virtue of a Ministerial Circular issued by the Independent Authority for Public Revenue.
The Ministerial Circular issued by the Independent Authority for Public Revenue provides guidelines as regards the procedure for claiming the initiation of a Mutual Agreement Procedure, the content, the competent authorities for examining the relevant claims, the process for achievement of a Mutual Agreement, the notification of the outcome of the Mutual Agreement Procedure to the taxpayer, and the procedure for accepting such Agreement, as well as any relevant issue with respect to the above.
### Tax auditors’ practice
In the past, complexity of the Greek tax legislation and the vagueness of its requirements enabled the tax auditors to dispute either the company’s results reflected in its accounting records or to disallow expenses. This is true in all tax audits and, in spite of companies’ endeavours to comply with the tax requirements, tax audits have always resulted in assessment of additional taxes and penalties.
The amount of additional taxes depends mainly on the following:
In respect of deductible expenses, the legislation prescribes, among other requirements, that such expenses must be realised for the benefit of the company or in its ordinary course of normal business activity to represent, a valid transaction at a value that is not over or under the market value based on the data available by the tax administration, properly recorded in the company’s books in the respective period to which they relate, and can be evidenced by appropriate documentation, without defining what a business expense is. Consequently, the tax auditors dispute the deductibility of various items arguing that, in their opinion, they are not contributing to the company’s business income.
Greek SAs and LLCs whose annual financial statements are subject to a statutory audit by individual Certified Auditors and audit firms may optionally obtain an 'annual tax certificate' from their certified auditors upon the completion of a tax audit conducted, confirming compliance with Greek tax legislation. The tax audit is conducted on specific tax areas as defined by a special audit program issued by the Ministry of Finance in cooperation with the Committee of Accounting Standardization and Auditing (ELTE). The audit program is updated annually and is in accordance with the provisions of International Standard on Non-Audit Assurance Engagements 3000.
## Statute of limitations
The tax administration may issue an administrative, estimated, or corrective tax assessment within five years from the end of the year in which the deadline for filing the respective tax return lapsed.
This five-year prescription period may be extended for one year if:
For tax years, periods, and cases as of 1 January 2018 onwards, the statute of limitation period may be extended to ten years from the end of the year within which the deadline for filing the (last) return expires if no tax return has been filed within the five-year period. The same also applies if any new or not possibly known information within the five-year period comes to the attention of any tax administration service, based on which it appears that the actual tax liability exceeds the one determined by a previous tax assessment and solely for the matter to which it relates.
Especially, for cases of tax evasion pertaining to years 2012 to 2017, an extended statute of limitation period of ten years from the end of the year within which the deadline for filing a tax return expires, applies.
In case of a corrective tax assessment resulting in an amendment of the tax assessment act for a year for which the prescription period of the state’s right to audit has lapsed, the adaptation is made to the last year for which said right has not been prescribed.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate is 24% (applicable to all goods and services that are not subject to the reduced or super-reduced VAT rate, which are explicitly enumerated in the law).
A rate of 4% is applicable to the execution of work intended exclusively for the overcoming or removal of architectural elements and other fixed and non-fixed obstacles limiting the mobility of persons with disabilities, in public or private buildings.
The above VAT rates are reduced by 30% (i.e. they are 17%, 9%, 4%, and 3% respectively) in the Aegean islands of Chios, Kos, Lesvos, Leros, and Samos, under certain conditions.
In addition, COVID-19 vaccines, which have been approved by the European Commission or by other member-states, are subject to 0% VAT.
Supplies of goods and services to VAT-registered persons established in EU countries (intra-Community supplies) are not subject to VAT (zero rated). Exports of goods and services connected to exports to non-EU countries are VAT exempt (zero rated).
Real estate leases are generally exempt from VAT. However, commercial leases and lease contracts for shopping centres and logistics centres may be subject to VAT on the condition that the lessor opts for the taxation of the lease under VAT either prior to or after the commencement of the lease by filing a relevant application.
Furthermore, VAT will be suspended until 31 December 2025 and real estate transfer tax will be levied on all unsold real estate with a construction permit issued (or revised) from 1 January 2006 onwards, upon relevant application by taxable persons.
The main changes are the following:
Online sellers, including online marketplaces/platforms can register in one EU member state and this will be valid for the declaration and payment of VAT on all distance sales of goods and cross-border supplies of services to customers within the European Union.
The existing thresholds for distance sales of goods within the European Union were abolished and replaced by a new EU-wide threshold of EUR 10,000. Below this EUR 10,000 threshold, the supplies of telecommunications, broadcasting and electronic (TBE) services and distance sales of goods within the European Union may remain subject to VAT in the member state where the taxable person is established.
Special provisions are introduced whereby online marketplaces/platforms facilitating supplies of goods are deemed for VAT purposes to have received and supplied the goods themselves ('deemed supplier').
In addition, new record keeping requirements are introduced for online marketplaces/platforms facilitating supplies of goods and services, including where such online marketplaces/platform are not a deemed supplier.
The VAT exemption at importation of small consignments of a value up to EUR 22 has been removed. This means all goods imported in the European Union will now be subject to VAT.
A new special scheme for distance sales of low goods imported from third territories or third countries has been created. The IOSS has been created to simplify the declaration and payment of VAT.
Finally, simplification measures for distance sales of imported goods in consignments not exceeding EUR 150 has been introduced, in case the IOSS is not used (special arrangements).
## Customs duties
Many goods imported into Greece from outside the European Union are subject to customs duties. The rates of duty are provided by the EU’s Common Customs Tariff.
## Excise taxes
Excise taxes are imposed on energy and electricity products (e.g. petrol, natural gas, electricity), manufactured tobacco, alcoholic products, coffee, liquids used in electronic cigarettes, and the tobacco contained in electrically heated tobacco products. The tax rates vary depending on the category of products.
In addition, consumption tax has been introduced on the following products: (i) the substrate or container of nicotine or nicotine and other substances, or other substances without nicotine, in solid form contained in electrically heated non-tobacco products and (ii) the substrate of nicotine or nicotine and other substances in solid form contained in ’nicotine pouches‘.
## Environmental taxes
A special plastic bag duty is imposed on consumers per piece of thin plastic bag they use (except for biodegradable bags, which are not subject to this duty). The rate of the duty is 7 cents per plastic carrier bag.
Furthermore, the application of a uniform call rate, at 80 cents per kilogram, to the weight of plastic packaging waste that is generated in each member state and is not recycled was introduced through Council Decision (EU, Euratom) 2020/2053 of 14 December 2020, which was implemented in Greece by L. 4783/2021.
An environmental protection levy of 4 cents (per product) is imposed on the plastic products that are available as packaging of food and beverages during their sale by mass catering companies or by retail companies. In plastic products, the plastic cover or lid is considered as a distinct product, for which the levy is imposed separately.
Moreover, a recycling duty was introduced by virtue of Art. 80 of L. 4819/2021, imposing on consumers as of 1 June 2022 a duty of 8 cents per piece the packaging of which contains polyvinyl chloride (PVC).
These special levies are imposed on consumers at purchase and collected and rendered to the state by every trader who is selling these products. They are subject to VAT.
Lastly, following Law 5162/2024 (the new Tax law)  the climate resilience fee has been increased ranging from 0.50 to 5.00 Euros on the hospitality services sector (i.e. main hotel accommodation, rented furnished rooms, properties made available through short-term rentals, in case of self-catering accommodation - tourist furnished villas), which is levied per day of use and per room or apartment.
## Uniform Tax on the Ownership of Real Estate Property (ENFIA)
The ownership of real estate property/property rights in Greece is subject to the ENFIA, which consists of a principal tax imposed on each real estate property and a supplementary tax imposed on the total value of the property rights on real estate property of the taxpayer subject to tax.
More specifically, said tax is not imposed on the objective value of real estate property, but is determined on the basis of various factors, according to the final registration of the property at the land registry or ownership title.
The principal tax on buildings is calculated by multiplying the square metres of the building by the principal tax ranging from EUR 2 to EUR 16.20 per square metre and other coefficients affecting the value of the property (e.g. location, use).
The principal tax on land is calculated by multiplying the square metres of the land by the principal tax ranging from EUR 0.0037 to EUR 9.2500 per square metre and other coefficients affecting the value of the property (e.g. location, use).
The supplementary tax is imposed on the total value of the rights to property at a rate of 5.5‰. Self-used real estate is taxed at the reduced rate of 1‰.
Pursuant the provisions of the new tax Law 5162/2024, starting from the year 2025, the Unified Property Tax (ENFIA) for insured
individuals' residences will be reduced by 20%, provided that the taxable value of the property does not exceed 500,000 euros. If the property's value exceeds this threshold, the reduction remains at 10%. To qualify for this exemption, the insurance must cover the previous year and
have a minimum duration of three months. If the insurance duration is less than one year, the real estate tax reduction will be applied proportionally.
## Real estate transfer tax
Each transfer of real estate, which is not subject to VAT, is subject to real estate transfer tax. The real estate transfer tax is imposed at a rate of 3% on the taxable value of the property (increased by a municipality surcharge to a total rate of 3.09%).
## Abolition of Stamp taxes-Introduction of Digital Transaction Duty
Law 5135/2024 abolishes the Stamp Duty and introduces the Digital Transaction Duty into Greek tax legislation, which will be imposed on transactions and contracts from December 1, 2024, onwards.
The Digital Transaction Duty is imposed on loan agreements at a rate of 2.4%, with a cap of €150,000 per loan. It is clarified that the Digital Transaction Duty is not imposed, among others, on loan interest, bond loans under Law 4548/2018, and bank loans.
Rentals of non-residential properties are subject to 3.6% digital transaction duty (with the exception of shopping centres and logistics centres subject to VAT).
Other digital transaction duties may apply in certain limited cases.
## Capital accumulation tax following incorporation
Capital accumulation tax applies on any capital accumulation transactions, at a rate that has been recently reduced to 0.2% as regards transactions for which the tax liability arises from 11 December 2023 onwards. In particular, said tax is imposed on capital accumulation (share capital increase) by:
For Greek *Société Anonyme* (SA) companies, an additional 0.1% duty on capital is payable to the competition committee.
The capital accumulation tax is not imposed upon the incorporation/establishment of legal entities.
## Payroll taxes
Employers are liable to submit payroll withholding taxes on monthly salary payments (following the grossing-up to the yearly salary) at the following tax scale:
| Taxable income (EUR) | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Up to 10,000 | 9 |
| 10,001 to 20,000 | 22 |
| 20,001 to 30,000 | 28 |
| 30,001 to 40,000 | 36 |
| Above 40,000 | 44 |
Reductions may apply depending on the amount of the annual taxable income received by individual taxpayers and by the number of the dependent children the individual taxpayer has.
Benefits in kind are, in principle, subject to payroll taxes. However, to the extent that it is difficult to proceed to an evaluation of such benefits at the time of their granting, no employment withholdings are effected thereon, instead their value (assuming such benefits are taxable) shall be added to the employment income of the beneficiaries and be taxed upon the clearance of the annual income tax return filed by the employees.
## Social security contributions
Social security contributions are due on salary and benefits in cash or in kind granted by an employer to its employees, with the exception of specifically enumerated extraordinary benefits of social character (e.g. marriage gifts, birth gifts). More specifically, as per the benefits in kind, said benefits might only be exempted from social security contributions as long as they are offered:
i) voluntarily by the employer and for the better serving of the employer's operational needs, also contributing to the increase of the employees' productivity and the better quality of the employee's workplace,or
ii) the constitute a measure adopted for the hygiene and safety of the employees, as well as
iii) they are offered personally to the employees and not in cash.
The imposition of social security contributions depends on the social security fund in which the employee is registered.
As of **01.01.2025, the social security contributions will amount to 13,37% at the level of the employee and contributed at 21.79% at the level of the employer, i.e. totally 35.16%**. The monthly social security contribution cap for EFKA is currently set at EUR 7,572.62 from 1 January 2025.

# Greece
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Inventory valuation
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (replacement) value. The Greek tax system recognises various valuation methods, such as first in first out (FIFO), weighted average, etc.
## Capital gains
In general, capital gains are included in the taxable profits of Greek companies.
The income derived from the goodwill arising upon the transfer of Greek government bonds or Greek treasury bills that are acquired by legal entities that do not qualify as Greek tax residents and do not maintain a PE in Greece is tax exempt.
### Capital gains tax on sale of listed shares
Capital gains derived from the sale of listed and non-listed shares are considered business income taxable at the standard CIT rate.
Capital gains derived from the sale of listed and non-listed shares by foreign legal entities that are tax resident abroad shall be taxable in Greece only if they maintain a PE in Greece.
The sale of listed shares is also subject to a transaction duty at a rate of 0.1%.
### Participation exemption on capital gains
As of 1 January 2020, capital gains derived from the sale of shares in an EU subsidiary are tax exempt in case the participation is greater than 10% and has been maintained for at least 24 months.
The above-mentioned income is not further taxed neither at the distribution nor at the capitalisation of these profits, while no possibility of deducting the business costs associated with this participation is provided.
Exceptionally, any losses resulting from the above transfer of shares may be recognised for deduction after 1 January 2020, provided that they have been valuated by 31 December 2019 and recorded in the books or included in the audited financial statements of the company. However, the deduction of such losses will only be recognised if they become final by 31 December 2024 and will also be limited to either the amount of the evaluation or that of the definitive loss, whichever is smaller.
The income resulting from the capital gain on the transfer of shares to a legal entity established outside the EU, received by a legal entity that is a tax resident of Greece, is exempt from tax, if the legal entity whose shares are transferred meets the following cumulative conditions:
Exceptionally, any losses resulting from the transfer of shares may be recognized for deduction after 1 January 2025, provided that they have been valuated by 31 December 2023 and recorded in the company's books or are reflected in the audited financial statements of the company. However, the deduction of such losses will only be recognized if they become final by 31 December 2026 and will also be limited to either the amount of the evaluation or that of the definitive loss, whichever is smaller.
## Dividend income
Dividend income is generally taxable. For subsidiaries established in third countries, any dividend WHT that may have been paid is credited against the Greek CIT payable (up to the amount of tax that would arise in Greece).
However, a tax exemption of intra-group dividends received by Greek tax resident legal entities or PEs of foreign legal entities in Greece applies, provided that:
In case of further distribution of the reserve formed by tax-exempt dividends received from Greek or foreign subsidiaries established in an EU member state, said amount shall not be included in the taxable income of the legal entity proceeding to said distribution, but may be subject to dividend WHT.
Based on the general anti-abuse rule introduced, the tax exemption in the case of collection and payment of dividends is lifted in case it is considered that a ‘non-genuine arrangement’ exists (i.e. an arrangement that has not been put into place for valid commercial reasons reflecting the economic reality).
Should the aforementioned tax exemption of intra-group dividends not apply, any underlying CIT and dividend WHT that may have been paid by a Greek or foreign subsidiary established in an EU member state are credited against the Greek CIT payable (up to the amount of tax that would arise in Greece). In such a case, the tax corresponding, and not the tax paid, on such dividends can be deducted from the Greek tax due.
Intra-group dividends received by a legal entity that is a tax resident of Greece, from a legal entity established outside the EU, are exempt from tax, if the legal entity making the distribution, cumulatively:
### Stock dividends
Stock dividends are treated as cash dividends for CIT purposes.
## Interest income
Interest income is generally taxable.
## Partnership income
Both general partnerships (*Omorrythmi Etairia* or OE) and limited partnerships (*Eterrorythmi Etairia* or EE) are not tax transparent. They are subject to tax based on general rules (i.e. at a CIT rate of 22% plus a 5% WHT on distributions). Business income generated by partnerships that maintain single entry accounting books is taxed at a unified tax rate of 22%. In addition, any subsequent distribution of profits is not subject to dividend taxation.
## Rents/royalties income
Income derived from rents and royalties is taxed as ordinary income.
## Foreign income
Resident corporations are taxed on their worldwide income. Foreign income received by a domestic corporation is taxed together with other income. If related income tax is paid or withheld abroad, a tax credit is generally available up to the amount of the applicable Greek income tax.
Losses from foreign sources may not be set off against profits generated in Greece. Exceptionally, losses from EU and European Economic Area (EEA) member states may be set off with profits arising in those EU or EEA member states, provided that they are not exempt on the basis of the DTT concluded and applied by Greece.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
WHT rates are as follows:
| Type of income | WHT rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Dividends | 5 |
| Interest | 15 |
| Royalties and other payments | 20 |
| Fees for technical projects, management fees, and consultancy and other related services | 20 |
| By exception, fees received by contractors of every kind of technical projects and lessors of public, municipal, association, or port proceeds | 3% on the value of the project under construction or lease payment |
Legal entities tax resident in Greece are not subject to WHT in relation to royalties, fees received for the provision of consultancy and other related services, and management fees, unless provided to general government bodies.
Legal entities that are not tax resident in Greece and do not maintain a PE in Greece are not subject to Greek WHT in relation to technical services, consultancy services, or other related services and management fees.
By virtue of the provisions of the Ministerial Circular 1007/2017, it is clarified that the fees for technical services, management fees, fees for consulting services, and the remuneration for similar services received by an EU legal entity through its PE in Greece are not subject to WHT.
The above exemption does not include the fees received by EU legal entities from the services provided to the general government bodies, as well as the fees for technical services received by the EU legal entities.
Conversely, non-EU foreign legal entities that maintain a PE in Greece are subject to Greek WHT in relation to the provision of the aforementioned services.
Legal entities that are tax resident in Greece or foreign legal entities that maintain a PE in Greece are not subject to WHT in relation to royalty payments.
The exemption from the obligation of WHT for payments of dividends, interest, and royalties by a Greek subsidiary to its parent company includes payments of dividends, interest, and royalties to Greek parent companies.
For the exemption from dividend WHT, the following conditions apply:
A general anti-abuse rule is applicable by virtue of which the tax exemption in case of collection and payment of dividends is lifted in case it is considered that a ‘non-genuine arrangement’ exists. A ‘non-genuine arrangement’ is an arrangement that has not been put into place for valid commercial reasons reflecting the economic reality.
For the exemption from WHT for interest and royalty payments, the following conditions apply:
Payments of interest of bank loans (excluding bond loans), including default interest, as well as interest of intra-bank deposits, are exempt from WHT.
Interest received from Greek government bonds and treasury bills, as well as from listed corporate bonds, by legal entities that are not tax resident in Greece and that do not maintain a PE in Greece are not subject to WHT.
The following table provides a summary of the WHTs applicable under the respective DTTs entered into by Greece:
| Recipient | WHT (%) | | |

## Overview
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
Greece is a parliamentary republic along the Mediterranean Sea in Southeastern Europe. It is bordered by Bulgaria, the Republic of North Macedonia, and Albania to the north; the Ionian Sea to the west; the Mediterranean Sea to the south; and the Aegean Sea and Turkey to the east. The capital of Greece is Athens, the official language is Greek, and the currency is the euro (EUR).
Greece achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1829. During the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, it gradually added neighbouring islands and territories, most with Greek-speaking populations. Since the 'Kallikratis' programme reform entered into effect on 1 January 2011, Greece consists of 13 peripheries subdivided into a total of 332 municipalities. The implementation of the programme realised the administrative restructuring of the country. Moreover, the systems of controlling the legality of the actions of the local government authorities, as well as the public financial control of local governments, were further enhanced.
Greece joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1952. In 1981, Greece joined the European Community (EC) (now the European Union or EU). It became the 12th member of the European Economic and Monetary Union in 2001.

Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Social security contributions
Social security contributions are due on salary and benefits in cash or in kind granted by an employer to its employees, with the exception of specifically enumerated extraordinary benefits of social character (e.g. marriage gifts, birth gifts). More specifically,as per the benefits in kind, said benefits might only be exempted from social security contributions,as lond as they are offered:
i) voluntarily by the employer and for the better serving of the employer's operational need, also contributing to the increase of the employees' productivity and the better quality of the employee's workplace,or
ii) they constitute a measure adopted for the hygiene and safety of the employees, as well as
iii) they are offered personally to the employees and not in cash.
The imposition of social security contributions depends on the social security fund in which the employee is registered.
As of 01.01.2025,the social security contributions will amount to 13.37% at the level of the employee and contributed at 21.79% at the level of the employer,i.e. totally 35.16%. The  monthly social security contribution cap for EFKA is set at 7,572.62 from 1 January 2025.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
## Uniform Tax on the Ownership of Real Estate Property (ENFIA)
The ENFIA applies to all types of real estate rights, including full ownership, usufruct, occupancy and surface rights on all real estate properties in Greece (principal tax). The supplementary tax on individuals was abolished by the provisions of L. 4916/2022 for the year 2022 onwards and replaced by an increase of the principal tax ranging from 5% to 20% according to the total value of the immovable property if it exceeds EUR 500,000.
Specifically, ENFIA is determined based on the data of real estate property of the previous year and respective changes occured, as indicated on the 1st January of the next year of the Real Estate Property Declaration (Specific Form E9).
The principal tax on buildings is calculated by multiplying the square metres of the building by the principal tax ranging from EUR 2 to EUR 16.20 per square metre and other coefficients affecting the value of the property (e.g. location, use).
The principal tax on land is calculated by multiplying the square metres of the land by the principal tax ranging from EUR 0.0037 to EUR 9.2500 per square metre and other coefficients affecting the value of the property (e.g. location, use).
Pursuant the provisions of the new tax law 5162/2024, starting from the year 2025, the Unified Property Tax (ENFIA) for insured individuals' residences will be reduced by 20%, provided that the taxable value of the property does not exceed 500,000 euros. If the property's value exceeds this threshold, the reduction remains at 10%. To qualify for this exemption, the insurance must cover the previous year and have a minimum duration of three months. If the insurance duration is less than one year, the real estate tax reduction will be applied proportionally.
## Inheritance Tax
Pursuant to the Greek tax legislation, Inheritance Tax is assessed on the current value of the property inherited. The said property includes any kind of movable and immovable property located in Greece, regardless of the descendant’s nationality. The taxable value of real estate property inherited is the 'objective value' (it is calculated on the basis of certain predetermined factors set by the Ministry of Finance) on the day of death of the deceased. Immovable assets located abroad are not subject to Greek Inheritance Tax, regardless of nationality and residency.
The tax rates are graduated and vary considerably, depending on the relationship between the deceased (inherited person) and the heir. Tax rates are based on a progressive scale. Relevant rates depend on the parties’ relationship (grade of relation, etc., and certain other factors - e.g. disabilities of the beneficiary); such rates range from 1% to 40%, while there is a tax-free amount (which depends on the proximity of the relationship). As a general rule, the closer the relationship the lower the tax rate. For example, in case of inheritance realised by individuals to their spouses or children (i.e. subject to A' category of the progressive scale), the respective rates range from 1% to 10%, while the tax-free amount is up to EUR 150,000.
Indicatively, the above mentioned tax category Α’ includes spouses, children, grandchildren, parents, and grandparents, category Β’ includes children from a spouse’s former marriage, parents-in-law, brothers, uncles, nephews etc., and category C’ includes distant relatives and non-relatives (blood or affinity relatives other than those referred to in the above-mentioned categories A’ and B’) as well as third parties.
| Value (EUR) | Tax rate (%) | Tax (EUR) | Total value (EUR) | Total tax (EUR) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Category A'** (a. the spouse, b. the children, c. the grandchildren, d. the parents, etc.) | | | | |
| 150,000 | - | - | 150,000 | - |
| 150,000 | 1 | 1,500 | 300,000 | 1,500 |
| 300,000 | 5 | 15,000 | 600,000 | 16,500 |
| Above | 10 |  |  |  |
| **Category B'** (a. the great-grandchildren et seq., the grandparents and great-grandparents, c. the brothers and sisters, etc.) | | | | |
| 30,000 | - | - | 30,000 | - |
| 70,000 | 5 | 3,500 | 100,000 | 3,500 |
| 200,000 | 10 | 20,000 | 300,000 | 23,500 |
| Above | 20 |  |  |  |
| **Category C'** (all the rest of the relatives) | | | | |
| 6,000 | - | - | 6,000 | - |
| 66,000 | 20 | 13,200 | 72,000 | 13,200 |
| 195,000 | 30 | 58,500 | 267,000 | 71,700 |
| Above | 40 |  |  |  |
## Donation tax and parental grant
Donation tax and parental grant (i.e. transfer of assets while the transferor is alive) are assessed on the current value of the property donated. Taxable property includes any kind of movable and immovable property located in Greece. The tax rates are graduated and vary considerably, depending on the relationship between donor and donee. In general, tax liabilities arise upon receipt of gifts and are paid by the donee. The acquisition of real estate property through donation is subject to the same tax scale as inheritance tax. The respective tax return should be submitted to the competent Greek tax office before the signing of the contract.
In case of parental grants (i.e. donation between each parent and each child), the respective tax is imposed on the basis of the same tax progressive scale for category A’ (ranging from 1% to 10%), whereas a tax free amount of EUR 800,000 is provided by law.
## Real estate transfer tax (Law 1587/1950)
Each transfer of real estate, which is not subject to VAT, is subject to real estate transfer tax. The real estate transfer tax is imposed at a rate of 3% on the taxable value of the property. Moreover, on the amount of main transfer tax is imposed an extra tax of 3% in favour of municipalities and communities.
## Other duties
### Municipality Duty (called Telos Akinitis Periousias or TAP)
The real estate ownership is subject to a Municipality Duty. The said duty is levied and collected annually through the electricity bill in favour of municipalities and communities at a currently calculated rate ranging between 0.25‰ and 0.35‰ on the real estate’s objective value (i.e. multiplying the real estate’s square metres by the specific value per square metre, depending on the area where the real estate property is situated [i.e. determined by the Ministry of Finance], and further multiplied by the rate deriving from the building age).
### Duty for the provision of cleaning and lighting services
A duty in compensation for the collection of garbage and waste and for the lighting of the streets, collected by the electricity bill, is due from the user of real estate. According to the relevant law provisions, these duties are calculated by multiplying the real estate’s square metres by a certain rate determined by the municipal council.
## Tax on electrified spaces
The Municipal Council may levy a tax on real estate connected to the grid, the collection of which is effected through the electricity bill. The tax is calculated by multiplying the real estate’s square metres by a rate determined by the municipal or community council ranging between EUR 0.018 and EUR 0.073. The said rate can be increased every year up to 20%.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
A legal entity or other entity is considered as tax resident in Greece if one of the following conditions is met:
The determination by the tax authorities that the effective management of a legal entity is exercised in Greece is made on the basis of the actual facts and circumstances of each case and by taking into account mainly the place of exercising the day-to-day management, the place of making strategic decisions, the place where the annual general meeting of shareholders or partners is held, the place where the books and records are kept, the place where the meeting of the members of the BoD or other executive management board takes place, and the residence of the members of the BoD or other executive management board.
For determining a legal entity as being tax resident in Greece, the exercise of effective management in Greece for any period during the tax year is sufficient.
Companies that are established and operate according to Law 27/1975 ‘on the taxation of vessels [etc.]’ and L.D. 2687/1953 ‘on the investment and protection of foreign capital’ are explicitly excluded from the application of these provisions on tax residence.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The definition of a PE of foreign legal entities in Greece following the principles stipulated in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Tax Convention and its Commentary, as explicitly mentioned in the Explanatory Report of the Greek Corporate Income Tax Code, is 'a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on'.
The term ‘permanent establishment’ includes especially:
In order for a construction site in Greece to constitute a PE, a time period of at least three months is required, instead of the time period of 12 months provided in the OECD Model Convention.
A distinction applies between the cases of maintaining a PE through a dependent agent and not maintaining a PE when performing activities through an independent agent (e.g. broker, general commission agent).
Greece has also reserved the right to not apply the provisions of the OECD Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (Multilateral Instrument or MLI) concerning the artificial avoidance of PE status.

Mandatory depreciation on a fixed annual basis applies by using fixed depreciation rates stipulated in the law. The transfer of depreciated amounts between fiscal years is not permitted.
The rates of depreciation are determined on the basis of the following table:
| Category of assets of the enterprise | Rate of depreciation per tax year (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Buildings, installations, facilities, industrial and special installations, non-building facilities, warehouses, and stations, including their annexes (and special loading and unloading vehicles) | 4 |
| Constructions and installations for charging of vehicles of zero or low emissions up to 50 g CO2/Km | 100 |
| Plots of land used for mining and quarries, unless used for ancillary mining activities | 5 |
| Public means of transportation, including airplanes, trains, vessels, and ships | 5 |
| Machinery and equipment (aside from personal computers and software) | 10 |
| Means of transportation of individuals apart from zero or low-emission means up to 50 g CO2/Km | 16 |
| Zero-emission means of transportation of individuals | 50 |
| Low-emission means of transportation of individuals up to 50 g CO2/Km | 25 |
| Means of transportation of goods  apart from zero or low-emission means up to 50 g CO2/Km | 12 |
| Zero-emission means of transportation of goods | 50 |
| Low-emission means of transportation of goods up to 50 g CO2/Km | 25 |
| Zero-emission means of mass transportation of individuals | 50 |
| Low-emission means of mass transportation of individuals up to 50 g CO2/Km | 25 |
| Intangible assets, royalties, and expenses of multiannual depreciation | 10 |
| Personal computer equipment, principal and ancillary and software | 20 |
| Other fixed assets of the enterprise | 10 |
Specifically for intangible assets and royalties, the rate may be adapted on the basis of the lifetime of the right.
Depreciation expenses are deductible by the owner of the assets, and the lessee in the case of finance leasing. For the definition of finance leasing, the Greek Tax Code refers to the provisions of the Greek Accounting Standards (L.4308/2014). However, as of 1 January 2020, the definition is supplemented, so that it is determined based either on the meaning of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union pursuant to Regulation 1606/2002, or that of the Greek Accounting Standards, depending on the accounting framework followed by each entity.
## Goodwill
## Organisational and start-up expenses
Based on the provisions of Law 4308/2014 (Greek Accounting Standards), any amount of start-up expenses shall be, under conditions, tax deductible within the year that they have been incurred, to the extent that they do not fall within a category of assets (including tangibles and intangibles).
Any expenses incurred for the acquisition of an asset that are directly related to the latter asset and are necessary for its use are included in the acquisition cost of said asset (e.g. concerning real estate property the real estate transfer tax, notary fees, registration fees, etc.).
## Interest expenses
Interest deductibility restrictions apply.
Non-deductible expenses include interest expenses on loans undertaken by the enterprise from third parties, to the extent that they exceed the interest that would arise if the interest rate was equal to the interest rate of loans on open deposit/withdrawal accounts provided to non-financial enterprises, as indicated in a Statistical Bulletin of the Central Bank of Greece at the prior time period closest to the date such loan was undertaken.
The above interest deductibility restrictions do not apply to bank loans, inter-bank loans, inter-company loans, and bond loans issued by SAs.
## Bad debt
The amounts of bad debt provisions and the write-off thereof are deductible, as follows:
| Duration of late payment (in months) | Provision (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Greater than 12 | 50 |
| Greater than 18 | 75 |
| Greater than 24 | 100 |
The condition for the deduction of the provision for the aforementioned two cases is that the appropriate actions have been taken to ensure the right of collecting the said claim.
The formation of provisions of bad debt is prohibited in the following cases:
It is provided that a claim may be written off, provided that the following conditions are cumulatively met:
For tax years beginning on 1 January 2020 onwards, bad debts, the total amount of which does not exceed EUR 300 per counterparty, including VAT, may be written off under conditions, without needing though to fulfil the above stricter requirements.
Moreover, it is possible to write off bad debts under a mutual agreement or judicial settlement, regardless of whether a provision has been accounted and without requiring that all legal actions to recover the claim have been taken.
Banks may deduct provisions of bad debt at a percentage of 1% on the amount of the annual average of real grants, as indicated by their monthly accounting statements. Aside from the aforementioned deductibility percentage, banks may deduct from their income additional special provisions regarding their clients, for which the settlement of interest has ceased. Moreover, specific provisions on leasing and factoring companies are included.
## Charitable contributions
The tax deductibility of donations is not expressly regulated in the respective Greek tax legislation (in contrast to the previously applicable Greek ITC providing for the tax deductibility of specifically enumerated donations, up to a certain amount). Thus, the deductibility of charitable contributions shall be examined in light of the generally applicable deductibility criteria, focusing on the productivity of such expenses on a case-by-case basis.
For tax years beginning on or after 1 January 2020, expenses relating to corporate social responsibility actions are considered as incurred to the interest of a company or within its ordinary course of business and will be deductible in the tax year in which they were incurred. However, this will only be possible if the company’s accounting result is profitable, unless such actions are carried out at the request of the state.
## Fines and penalties
Fees from activities constituting a criminal offence, fees from penal clauses, fines, and penalties are not recognised as deductible expenses.
## Taxes
Taxes, other than income tax, extraordinary contributions, and VAT corresponding to non-deductible expenses that are not deductible as input VAT, are recognised as deductible expenses.
## Other significant items
A general rule on the deductibility of all real and evidenced business expenses realised for the benefit or in the frame of the usual transactions of the company, the value of which is not deemed as higher or lower than the market value, and duly registered in accordance with the rules of recording of transactions is established, with the exception of the restrictively enumerated expenses that are not deductible.
The non-deductible expenses include:
A super deduction by an additional 100% of specific expenses related to green economy, energy, and digitalisation is available for small and medium-sized businesses.
## Net operating and capital losses
Losses can be carried forward five years. Carrybacks are not permitted.
Pursuant to a rule on the abuse of provisions on the transfer and setoff of losses, in cases where the direct or indirect ownership or voting rights of an enterprise are changed at a percentage exceeding 33% and, in the same or the following year from such change of ownership or voting rights, the activity of the legal person/entity changes at a percentage exceeding 50% of its turnover in relation to the immediately preceding tax year from the change of shareholding structure or voting rights, the carryforward of tax losses ceases to apply.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Royalties, interest, and service fees paid to foreign affiliates are deductible expenses under certain requirements and conditions.
## Special restrictions on transactions with non-cooperative states and states with preferential tax treatment
Greek tax law has established rules in relation to non-cooperating states and states with preferential tax treatment.
As of the tax year 2018, jurisdictions shall be considered as non-cooperative if they are non-EU member states, their position regarding transparency and exchange of information in tax matters has been assessed by the OECD and has not been rated as ‘highly compliant’, and which:
Non-cooperative states are determined by a Ministerial Decision published annually, which takes into account changes as regards execution and implementation of mutual agreements for administrative assistance in tax matters by relevant jurisdictions.
Pursuant to a Decision issued in December 2024, the jurisdictions considered as non-cooperative for 2023 are specified as follows:
| Algeria | Gabon | Palau |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Angola | Ghana | Panama |
| Anguilla | Guatemala | Papua New Guinea (1) |
| Antigua and Barbuda | Guinea | Philippines |
| Belarus | Guyana | Rwanda |
| Benin (1) | Haiti | Sint Maarteen |
| Botswana | Honduras | Seychelles |
| British Virgin Islands | Kazakhstan | Tanzania |
| Burkina Faso (1) | Lesotho (Kingdom of) | Thailand |
| Cambodia | Liberia | Togo |
| Chad | Madagascar | Trinidad and Tobago |
| Cote d' Ivoire | Mali | Vanuatu |
| Congo (Republic of) | Niger | Vietnam (1) |
| Dominica | Nicaragua | Zambia |
| Djibouti | Sierra Leone | Zimbabue |
| Figi |  |  |
NOTE
(1) ***Based on Ministerial Decision A. 1198/2024,** the countries Benin, Burkina Faso, Vietnam, and Papua New Guinea are considered non-cooperative states for only part of 2023 (not for the entire year). Specifically, Vietnam and Papua New Guinea are non-cooperative states until December 1, 2023, Burkina Faso is a non-cooperative state until April 1, 2023, and Benin is a non-cooperative state until May 1, 2023*
A legal entity, irrespective of its legal form, is considered located in a preferential tax regime, even if its residence of registered office is located in an EU member state, in cases where it is not subject to taxation in this state or is de facto not subject to taxation, or is subject to tax on income or capital at an amount that is equal to or lower than 60% of the tax that would have been due, in accordance with Greek tax legislation, if such entity were resident or were maintaining a PE in Greece.
Preferential tax regimes are determined by a Ministerial Decision published annually, which takes into account the above criteria.
Pursuant to a Decision issued in December 2023, the states with preferential tax treatment for 2022 are specified as follows:
| Albania | Gibraltar | Mongolia |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Andorra | Guernsey | Montenegro |
| Anguilla | Hungary | North Macedonia |
| Bahamas | Ireland | Paraguay |
| Bahrain | Isle of Man | Qatar |
| Barbados | Jersey | Saba |
| Belize | Kosovo | Saudi Arabia |
| Bermuda | Kyrgyzstan | St. Eustatius |
| Bonaire | Liechtenstein | Timor-Leste |
| Bosnia and Herzegovina | Macau | Tokelau |
| British Virgin Islands | Republic of Maldives | Turkmenistan |
| Bulgaria | Marshall Islands | Turks and Caicos Islands |
| Cayman Islands | Republic of Moldova | United Arab Emirates |
| Cyprus | Monaco | Vanuatu |

# Greece
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
Group taxation is not permitted in Greece.
## Transfer pricing
Related entities are obligated to document the prices of their inter-company transactions by preparing the relevant transfer pricing documentation material.
An exemption from maintaining a transfer pricing documentation file is provided if:
If the local taxpayers meet or exceeds the relevant criterial, they are required to prepare both the Master File and the Local File to document its transfer pricing practices. Greek taxpayers qualifying as subject to documentation thresholds need to document all transactions irrespective of value.
The transfer pricing documentation file is accompanied by the ‘Summary Information Table for the inter-company transactions’, which is submitted electronically to the tax administration within the deadline for the submission of the annual income tax return.
The delayed submission of the Summary Information Table for the inter-company transactions incurs a penalty calculated at a percentage 0.1% of inter-company transactions subject to documentation requirements (not below EUR 500 and not exceeding EUR 2,000). In the event of filing an amended Summary Information Table, a penalty applies only to the extent that the declared amounts are amended and such amendments exceed the amount of EUR 200,000. In the event that the amended amounts exceed EUR 200,000, the penalty is calculated at 0.1% on the value of the transactions subject to documentation requirements (minimum penalty of EUR 500 and maximum penalty of EUR 2,000).
The penalty for inaccurate submission of the Summary Information Table for the inter-company transactions is calculated at a percentage 0.1% of the inter-company transactions (not below EUR 500 and not exceeding EUR 2,000), to the extent that the inaccuracy is higher than 10% of the transactions.
The penalty for the non-submission of the Summary Information Table for the inter-company transactions is calculated at a percentage 0.1% of the inter-company transactions (not below EUR 2,500 and not exceeding EUR 10,000).
The transfer pricing documentation file is kept at the registered seat of the liable party for the whole time period that the books and records are required to be kept and should be provided to the tax administration within 30 days from the receipt of the relevant request.
The obligation of updating the respective transfer pricing file is annual on the premise that the documentation thresholds are met.
The penalty for the non-submission of the transfer pricing documentation file (imposed upon the expiration of the one-month deadline) is EUR 5,000, which is increased to EUR 10,000 if transfer pricing documentation is provided after 60 days, and to EUR 20,000 if it is provided after 90 days or not provided at all.
A repetition within five years of the first infringement incurs double the initial penalty, whereas a second repetition within five years from the first infringement incurs quadruple the initial penalty.
The option of obtaining an Advance Pricing Arrangement (APA) of the methodology of specific future intra-group transactions with related parties is integrated in the Code of Tax Procedures. The object of the APA constitutes the total of the criteria used for the determination of the prices of intra-group transactions during a specific time period, which include mainly the transfer pricing methodology used, comparable or reference data, and the respective adjustments, as well as the critical assumptions on future developments. The object of the APA may constitute every other specialised matter concerning the pricing of transactions with related parties.
The validity of the APA decision cannot exceed four years. The possibility of implementing the APA decisions to previous tax years covers only cases of bilateral or multilateral agreements, explicitly excluding unilateral ones. The issuance of the APA decision does not impede the subsequent application of a mutual settlement procedure according to the applicable double tax treaty (DTT).
The APA decision may be renewed, revoked, or cancelled by a decision of the tax administration, provided that the legal conditions are met.
The Greek tax legislative framework provides for the possibility of roll-back implementation for bilateral/multilateral APAs, on the grounds that the following conditions are cumulatively met:
As of September 2022, it is provided that if, following a tax audit, additional profits relating to inter-company domestic transactions are taxed at the level of a taxpayer in Greece, the related party that is also subject to tax is entitled to perform a corresponding adjustment to its taxable profits accordingly. This is performed through the submission of an amending income tax return (accompanied by the tax audit report), which should be submitted within three months from the delivery of the tax audit report.
Condition for the refund or the offsetting of taxes, at the level of the taxpayer, is the payment from the related party of any taxes imposed due to the correction of profits of their inter-company transactions. If the tax assessment note is challenged by the taxpayer and an administrative or a legal decision is issued, the tax administration proceeds with the corresponding adjustment of profits to the related party.
These types of transfer pricing adjustments, known as corresponding adjustments, are met in various DTTs and have as primary objective the consistent allocation of profits by the two jurisdictions and the relief from double taxation. Through this provision, related parties could also obtain relief from double taxation resulting from transfer pricing adjustments in domestic transactions.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting regime
The CbC reporting requirements are applicable to Greek ultimate parent entities controlling a multinational group of entities (MNEs) with annual total consolidated group revenues exceeding EUR 750 million. The said requirements largely follow the guidance on CbC reporting provided under Action 13 of the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiatives. In order to enable the Greek tax authorities to analyse potential transfer pricing risks, said requirements provide for the preparation and filing of a CbC report.
The ultimate parent entity (UPE) established in Greece should file the relevant CBC reports with the Greek tax authorities. In exceptional cases, Greek entities belonging to MNEs without a Greek resident ultimate parent company may also be obligated to file a CbC report.
The relevant provisions also provide for notification requirements regarding the entity liable to file the CbC report.
The penalty for late/inaccurate filing of the CbC report stands at EUR 10,000, while the penalty for the non-filing of the CbC report amounts to EUR 20,000.
## Thin capitalisation
The thin capitalisation (more precisely 'interest limitation') rules are determined in connection to the taxable profits before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (ΕBITDA). More specifically, interest expenses are not deductible to the extent that the surplus of interest expenses compared to interest income exceeds a percentage of 30% of ΕΒΙΤDΑ.
By way of derogation, the taxpayer may deduct exceeding borrowing costs up to EUR 3 million.
Any excess amount of non-deductible interest expenses may be carried forward indefinitely to future years and will be deductible in future years to the extent that these future years indicate an uncovered EBITDA amount.
The aforementioned rules do not apply to credit institutions, insurance and reinsurance companies, and pension institutions.
Moreover, pursuant to a recently introduced exemption, additional interest expense may be deducted if the company is part of a consolidated group and to the extent that certain figures (e.g. share capital to assets ratio) do not vary from the respective figures of the consolidated group.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
The taxable income of a taxpayer with tax residence in Greece shall be increased by the undistributed income of a legal person or legal entity or PE with tax residence in another country, under the following conditions:

# Greece
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Foreign tax credit
Tax paid abroad for income taxable in Greece is credited but is limited to the amount of Greek tax due.
## Deferred taxation
The concept of deferred taxation applies on the basis of the IFRS to entities supervised by the Bank of Greece (namely banks and leasing companies, as well as factoring companies). In this respect, said entities may convert tax assets into tax credits in return for shares issued to the Greek state. Specific rules and conditions apply.
## Incentives for job enhancement
Under certain conditions, an increase of tax deductibility by 50% and up to 14 times the minimum wage of an unmarried employee over 25 years old per employment of the employers’ contributions is provided.
The criteria for the characterisation of the above expenses are determined by a joint decision of the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Development and Investments, which is issued after a suggestion of the Governor of the IAPR. In the event that losses occur after deduction of the above percentage, they shall be carried forward for up to five years, in accordance with Article 27 of the Greek ITC.
## Patent incentives
Moreover, the amount of the above-mentioned exemption is calculated as follows:
Eligible R&D expenses / Total R&D expenses x Profits from the exploitation of the patent = Exemption amount
The numerator may be increased up to 30%, on condition that it does not exceed the total amount of R&D expenses.
Additionally, the amount of the exemption, which is calculated as above, is depicted in a special reserve account and is subject to taxation in accordance with the general provisions of the Greek ITC when distributed or capitalised (i.e. upon use).
This exemption is granted provided that there is R&D expense that was carried out by the patent development company.
According to the new law 5162/2024, which will take effect from fiscal year 2025, the following modifications have been made:
1. **Extended Exemption Period**: Businesses that have developed and hold internationally recognized patents are entitled to an income tax      exemption for profits from these patents for up to three consecutive tax years. Additionally, for the following seven years, there is a 10%        exemption from the income tax payable on the company's profits from the exploitation of the patent.
2. **Calculation of Exemption:** The method for calculating the exemption remains the same, but the new law emphasizes the connection            between the patent and the R&D expenses incurred by the company for its development.
These changes aim to further incentivize innovation and the development of patents by providing extended tax benefits.
## Other tax incentives
### Strategic Investment Law
Investment plans are classified based on investment size, FTEs, and industry sectors in four categories: Strategic Investments 1, Strategic Investments 2, Emblematic Investments, and Fast-track licensed Strategic Investments. Types of aid vary depending on the kind of investment but typically include (i) spatial planning, (ii) income tax rate stabilisation, (iii) fast track licensing, (iv) tax exemption, (v) cash grants for capex/opex (only for emblematic investments, and (vi) cash grants for R&D or recruiting disabled. It should be noted that tax exemption can be used for a period of 15 years.
Important notes:
### Development Law - Greece Strong Development
On 4 February 2022, Law 4887/2022, 'Development Law - Greece Strong Development’, has been voted by the Greek Parliament. The new Development Law provides a general framework, specified for each aid scheme foreseen through ministerial decisions issued. In essence, the provisions of the new Law start to apply following the issuance of the relevant ministerial decisions. Up to date, the Ministry of Development and Investments has solely proceeded with the issuance of ministerial decision for the following aid schemes: 'Manufacturing - Supply chain', 'Enhancement of Tourism Investments', 'Agri food - primary production and processing of agricultural products - fisheries and aquaculture', and ‘Entrepreneurship 360°’.
Under the Law, an explicit reference to the provisions of the General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER) of the European Commission (651/17.07.2014, Law 187/1/26.06.2014) is made.
A threshold is being provided for the types of aid available to individuals’ investment projects, as well as to companies and groups of companies, in order to achieve dispersion of the beneficiaries of state aid.
Special categories of aid are being determined, either (i) on the basis of the performance of the companies (extroversion, mergers, employment increase, sectors, high added value), or (ii) on territorial basis (highland, border areas and areas with increased migration burden, industrial areas, innovations zones). Companies that fall under special categories may be reinforced through capital aids, in case the latter are not provided, or by additional capital aids, in case the latter are provided.
### General Section
The General Section of the new Law regulates the beneficiaries of aids provided, the terms and prerequisites for participation, the covered investment projects, the eligible expenses, the types of aids, the procedure regarding the filing of applications and evaluation of investments projects, as well as the issues regarding the implementation and completion of investments projects.
Beneficiaries of the aid schemes are commercial companies, cooperatives, social cooperative companies of Law 4019/2011, groups of producers, organisations of producers, agricultural partnerships of Law 4384/2016, urban cooperatives, companies under formation or under merger (on the condition that they have been incorporated or merged before the commencement of the project), public and municipal enterprises and their subsidiaries (under specific conditions), joint ventures provided that they have been registered with General Commercial Registry (GEMI), and individual companies with a maximum eligible investment project cost of EUR 200,000 and solely for the aid scheme 'agri food - primary production and processing of agricultural products - fisheries and aquaculture'.
The minimum investment amount ranges from EUR 50,000 (for social cooperative companies, agricultural partnerships, groups of producers, organisations of producers, urban cooperatives, and agricultural partnerships) to EUR 1 million (for large companies). Moreover, for medium-sized companies, the investment amount is set at EUR 500,000, for small companies at EUR 250,000, and for very small companies at EUR 100,000.
The investment projects that fall under the aid schemes should have the character of initial investment (buildings, machinery, intangible) and meet certain conditions (indicatively, creation of new plants, extension of existing plants’ capacity, etc.).
The investment projects that are covered by the Law relate, in principle, to all economic sectors, subject to certain exceptions (sector of steel, coal, synthetic fibres, shipbuilding, etc.). Under certain conditions, the covered investment projects could also relate to:
In respect of the eligible expenses, these are divided into: (i) eligible expenses of regional state aid nature based on the Regional State Aid Map (capital expenditure in tangible and intangible assets, employment cost of new employees) and (ii) eligible expenses of non-regional state aid, which aim to broaden and enrich the investment options towards new qualitative directions. The maximum amounts and percentages of regional state aids and non-regional state aids are also being determined. Based on the general framework, the maximum amounts and percentages of each individual aid scheme are being specified, in accordance with the provisions of the Special Section of the new Law.
Further, with regard to the types of aid, the following types are provided:
All types of aids can be provided either separately or in combination thereof and are all taken into account for the determination of the total aid amount of each investment project. The types of aid are granted (and, respectively, the benefit starts to apply), following a relevant certification, either in lump sum (following the issuance of the decision certifying the completion and the commencement of the productive operation of the project) or gradually (according to the specific requirements per each type of aid granted).
The evaluation process includes the stage of completion and legality control and the evaluation stage and is carried out either through the method of comparative evaluation or through the method of direct evaluation. Investment projects that fall under the aid schemes are audited at any time and at any stage of implementation of the investment project or at any stage of fulfilling their long-term liabilities.
### Special Section
#### Aid schemes
In the Special Section of the Law, the following aid schemes  are being prescribed:
| Aid scheme |
| --- |
| Digital and technological transformation of enterprises |
| Green transition - Environmental upgrade of enterprises |
| New entrepreneurship |
| Fair development transition |
| Agri food - primary production and processing of agricultural products - fisheries and aquaculture |
| Manufacturing - Supply chain |
| Enterprise’s extroversion |
| Enhancement of tourism investments |
| Alternative forms of tourism |
| Major investments |
| European value chains |

## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Intergovernmental agreements (IGAs) and cooperation
Greece and the United States have reached an agreement in substance and Greece has consented to disclose this status on the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) arrangements with effect from 30 November 2014. The IGA was ratified by L. 4493/2017, which was published in the Government Gazette in October 2017.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS) regime
By virtue of L. 4378/2017 and L. 4474/2017, Greece proceeded on 30 September 2017 to the exchange of information on accounts held by financial institutions. The exchange of information will take place in September of each respective year, and the deadline for the submission of the information to the tax authorities by the financial institutions is set in June of each year.
## Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS)
Greece adheres, in general, to the BEPS guidelines.
On 7 June 2017, Greece signed the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting ('Multilateral Instrument' or 'MLI'). On 26 January 2021, the Greek Government Officially published Law 4768/2021 to ratify the MLI. On 30 March 2021 Greece deposited its instrument of ratification for the MLI with the OECD.
In 2019, Greece transposed the Directive laying down rules against tax avoidance practices (ATAD) and more precisely the CFC rules, the General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR), and the interest deduction limitation rules, which are in the spirit of BEPS guidelines.
Furthermore, on 31 July 2020, Greece completed the transposition of the exit taxation and the hybrid mismatch rules laid down in the Directive (EU) 2016/1164, as amended by Directive (EU) 2017/952. Said provisions apply as of 1 January 2020.
## EU Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC6)
On 31 July 2020, the law implementing the Council Directive (EU) 2018/822 of 25 May 2018 into the local legislation was published in the Government Gazette. The law overall follows the scope of the Directive, and no major deviations are identified.
The rules of DAC6 introduce mandatory disclosure requirements for certain cross-border tax arrangements, provided the main benefit of such arrangements is the expectation of a lower tax burden and/or of other specific characteristics (hallmarks) defined in the Directive. The reporting obligation lies primarily with the intermediary business consultants of taxpayers and, in certain instances, with the taxpayers themselves.
The DAC6 provisions have a retroactive effect, and the reporting obligation captures transactions implemented from 25 June 2018 onwards.
The first reporting of information on reportable cross-border arrangements, which was implemented between 25 June 2018 and 31 January 2021, took place on 28 February 2021. The first automatic exchange of information between the tax authorities of the member states took place on 30 April 2021.
For transactions that have been designed or implemented as of 1 February 2021, there is a period of 30 days for filing relevant information by intermediaries and relevant taxpayers in accordance with the provisions of DAC6 legislation.
No or late filing triggers penalties for the intermediaries or the taxpayers.
## Choice of business entity
The main differences between a subsidiary (i.e. *Société Anonyme* [SA] or limited liability company [LLC]) and a branch of a company, from a corporate establishment perspective, are the following:
The main legal differences between an SA and an LLC in Greece from a company law/establishment perspective are the following:

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Standard deductions
The income tax is reduced based on certain expenditures for annual personal living.
More specifically, as of 1 January 2020, the maximum amount of tax reduction (applicable to salaried and pension income) is EUR 777 for income up to the maximum of EUR 12,000 for a single person or for a married person with no dependents.
Furthermore, the tax reduction amounts to nine hundred (900) euros for a taxpayer with one (1) dependent child, one thousand one hundred and twenty (1,120) euros for two (2) dependent children, one thousand three hundred and forty (1,340) euros for three (3) dependent children, one thousand five hundred and eighty (1,580) euros for four (4) dependent children, and one thousand seven hundred and eighty (1,780) euros for five (5) dependent children. For each additional dependent child beyond the fifth, the tax reduction increases by two hundred and twenty (220) euros for each subsequent child. If the amount of tax is less than these amounts, the tax reduction is limited to the amount of the applicable tax.
For salaried and pension income above EUR 12,000, the amount of tax deduction is reduced by EUR 20 for every EUR 1,000 of income.
With effect from 1 January 2020, the amount of expenditure required to be paid by electronic means is amended, and, instead of the applicable progressive computation, it should be equal to 30% of the actual income from salaried employment, pensions, and business. The amount of the annual expenditure is limited to EUR 20,000.
In the event that expenses incurred, which pertain to payments of personal income tax and ENFIA, loan obligations to financial institutions, and rent, exceed sixty percent (60%) of the actual income the required percentage of expenses is reduced to twenty percent (20%).
## Personal deductions
Certain expenses are deducted from the gross income to reach taxable income. These deductible expenses, provided for by specific provisions of the Greek ITC, mainly include the following:
Foreign taxpayers who qualify as non-Greek tax residents may enjoy the tax reliefs of Greek tax residents provided that they maintain their residence in an EU or European Economic Area (EEA) country and (i) generate at least 90% of their worldwide income in Greece or (ii) are able to prove that their taxable income is so low that they would be entitled to tax relief in their country.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Employment income
Greek tax residents are taxed on their worldwide income irrespective of the country where such income has been generated, paid, or remitted.
Non-resident aliens are taxed on salary earned for work performed in Greece, regardless of where payment is made and regardless of where it is remitted. They are not taxed to the extent their compensation relates to services performed outside of Greece.
All fringe benefits are normally considered taxable income for the employee and hence treated as such.
Board of Directors fees/remunerations paid to Board Members are considered as salaried income and are taxed based on the respective income tax scale for salaried services.
## Equity compensation
### New provisions for stock option plans (SOPs) and free shares
Benefit arising from SOPs shall be exempt from salaried income taxation and will be taxed at the time of their sale as capital gains at a rate of 15%, provided they are held for at least 24 months. Should the SOPs not be held for at least 24 months, the relative income will continue to be taxed as salary income. In case SOPs relate to small start-up entities, they are taxed at a rate of 5%, provided that they are held for at least 36 months, under conditions.
Moreover, the favourable tax treatment with the taxation of 15% applies for free shares granted to employees under incentives programs (e.g.Restricted Stock Units (RSUs),performance shares or performance units,restricted shares plan,matching shares or employee stock purchase plan, deferred stock, etc.) to the extent that are inextricably linked with the achievement of specific required performance milestones or the occurrence of an event (e.g. completion of a specific employment period). According to the new Law, the taxable event arises at the time the free shares are actually sold and not at the time of their acquisition as happened before. In addition, for free shares there is no retention period.
## Notional income
The cost of acquiring or maintaining certain assets (e.g. ownership or occupation of residence, purchase or occupation of private cars, recreation boats, construction/use/ownership of houses or swimming pools, tuition/private school fees, housekeepers [exceeding two]) give rise to deemed income, which forms the basis of taxation if this is higher than the actual declared income.
## Business income
## Capital gains
Transfer of non-listed shares is subject to capital gain tax at the rate of 15%. Transfer of listed shares is again taxed at 15% unless specific conditions/exemptions apply, if an individual holds at least 0.5% of the share capital of the listed entity.
A transfer duty of 2‰ is imposed on the gross sale proceeds of listed shares.
## Dividend income
Dividends distributed within taxable periods commencing after 1 January 2020 including participations in profits of personal companies as well as distributions of profits from any type of legal entity are taxed via corporate withholding taxation at the flat rate of 5%.
## Interest income
Interest on deposits with banks operating in Greece and interest from Greek bonds and treasury bills are subject to income tax at the rate of 15%, and this tax is withheld at source with exhaustion of any further income tax liability. Non-residents are exempt from the WHT where the deposit is kept in foreign currency.
## Rental income

## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Non-dom regime for investors
The non-dom regime provides for an alternative way of taxing income derived abroad for individuals transferring their tax residence to Greece (non-dom), porvided that cumulatively:
Under this regime, individuals will pay a lump-sum tax of EUR 100,000 per tax year, irrespective of the amount of income earned abroad, for a maximum of 15 fiscal years. Moreover, it is possible to extend the regime to any of their relatives by paying an additional tax equal to EUR 20,000 per person per tax year. In such cases, the provisions of inheritance, gift, and parental grant tax will not apply.
It is noted that any tax paid abroad on income covered by the alternative taxation regime will not be offset against the tax liability of the above persons in Greece.
Furthermore, in case the persons who have opted for the non-dom regime earn taxable income that arises in Greece, this will be taxed in accordance with the general provisions of the ITC. In addition, in the event of non-payment of the full amount of the lump-sum tax, the special regime will be abolished, and these persons will be taxed for their worldwide income in accordance with the general provisions as of the tax year in question onwards.
It should be noted that taxpayers opting for the regime are not required to declare any income earned abroad. Furthermore, they will be able to justify the imputed income calculated based on deemed expenses and assets acquisition by importing funds from abroad.
The relevant application for the transfer of tax residence and for obtaining the non-dom status has to be submitted by individuals by 31 March of each tax year. Furthermore, it will be possible to apply for revocation of the non-dom status in any tax year during the 15-year period.
## Non-dom regime for pensioners
The non-dom regime provides for an alternative way of taxing income, for individuals entitled to a pension that arises abroad. The application of this regime does not affect the validity of the applicable DTTs.
Every tax year, individuals will pay tax at a rate of 7% on their foreign-sourced income, with exhaustion of the tax liability for this income. The tax is paid each tax year in one instalment until the last working day of July and cannot be offset against other tax liabilities or any credit balances.
To be eligible for this new regime, individuals must, cumulatively:
The application for the tax residence transfer and submission to this regime is submitted by the pensioner until 31 March of the respective tax year.
Pensioners subject to this regime are required to declare their income earned both in Greece and abroad. Furthermore, non-payment of the entire amount of tax due in one tax year results in the application of the general provisions of the ITC for the taxation of their global income from the relevant tax year onwards.
## Alternative taxation regime for relocated employees
A new regime for the alternative way of taxing income from salaried employment, as well as from business activity arising in Greece, for individuals transferring their tax residence to Greece has been introduced as of the year 2020.
For inclusion in this regime, and exclusively for the filling of new jobs, the individual transferring their tax residence to Greece is subject to favourable taxation for the income from salaried employment obtained in Greece, if cumulatively:
A similar application is envisaged for individuals who transfer their tax residence to Greece in order to carry out individual business activity in Greece.
If the taxpayer's application is accepted, an exemption from income tax is provided for 50% of one's employment income / income from individual business activity earned in Greece during the tax year. Furthermore, for individuals subject to the alternative taxation provisions, the annual deemed income will not apply to the amount resulting from the residence or passenger car.
The application for the transfer of the tax residence and the inclusion in the new regime is filed to the Tax Administration by the individual as follows:
The provisions on alternative taxation shall apply to the income of the tax year for which the individual files one's application and expires after a total of seven tax years, with no possibility of further extension.
## Tax incentives to angel investors
Starting from the tax year 2025, new tax incentives are introduced for individuals (angel investors) investing capital in duly registered start-up companies or in Closed Ended Funds (AKES), with the maximum investment limit being raised from 300,000 euros to 900,000 euros, allocated to a maximum of three (3) different startups or Funds and up to the amount of EUR 300 000 per startup. To qualify as an angel investor, an individual must be tax resident of Greece or abroad and holds a Greek Tax Identification Number. The startups receiving the investment must be registered with the "Elevate Greece" platform.
The said incentive consists in the deduction from taxable income of up to 50% of the investment proportionally per income category for the tax year in which the investment was made.
The capital contribution is mandatorily executed though a bank deposit.
## New start-up investor residence permit
The new provisions enable citizens from non-EU countries to obtain a special residence permit by investing in Greek startup companies.
Starting January 1, 2025, individuals who invest a minimum of 250,000 euros in a startup listed in the National Startup Registry will be eligible for
this permit. The investment can be made through the acquisition of shares during a capital increase or bonds upon issue of a bond loan.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
The general rule considered for the determination of an individual’s tax residence status is one’s physical presence in Greece in any 12-month period.
Apart from the actual number of days the taxpayer and/or family spends in Greece, the other crucial factor that can be used for the determination of an individual's tax residence is the centre of one’s ‘vital interests’.
The provisions of a Circular issued by the Independent Authority for Public Revenues (AADE) in Greece, offers guidance on the interpretation of ‘vital interests’ concerning tax residency. The Circular clarifies that elements such as permanent residence, habitual abode, and the individual's overall personal and economic connections are considered when determining their tax residency status. Furthermore, it specifies that the 'centre of vital interests' is assessed by evaluating all personal and economic relationships that connect an individual to a particular location,considering the specific circumstances of each case comprehensively.
