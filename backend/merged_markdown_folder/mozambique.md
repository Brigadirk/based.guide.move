## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
Resident entities are subject to corporate income tax (CIT) based on their worldwide income.
Non-resident entities without a PE or whose income is not attributable to a PE in Mozambique are only subject to CIT on the income sourced from Mozambique.
Resident entities and non-resident entities with a PE in Mozambique are subject to CIT that is levied on taxable profits, defined as accounting profits adjusted to comply with tax law rules, at a tax rate of 32%.
Non-resident entities without a PE or whose income is not attributable to a PE in Mozambique are generally taxed through a final and definitive withholding tax (WHT) of 20% or 10% (applicable to certain income only) that is applied on the gross income earned. There are also instances (e.g. capital gains) where non-resident entities are required to register themselves as a non-resident taxpayer, appoint a tax representative in Mozambique, file the necessary tax return, and subject the income/gain to CIT at a rate of 32%.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is an indirect tax that is largely directed at the domestic consumption of goods and services and at goods imported into Mozambique. The tax is designed to be paid mainly by the ultimate consumer or purchaser in Mozambique. The standard rate is 16%. However, there are certain selected supplies that are subject to a reduced rate of 5% and a few cases where VAT is not due on the full taxable amount, leading to lower effective rates.
### Supplies of goods
Supplies of goods are considered to be the transfer of the right to dispose of tangible property generally against a consideration, which includes commercial transactions, hire purchases, sales in instalments with reservation of ownership, commissions, consignments, and applications of goods forming part of a business for private use or for non-business purposes when tax has been deducted on such goods, use of goods on which tax has been deducted for a purpose or in a sector where right of deduction is excluded.
Goods that have been acquired, produced, or imported that are not physically present at the establishments of the taxable person are presumed to have been disposed of for VAT purposes, and goods that are physically present at the establishments of the taxable person are presumed to have been acquired for VAT purposes.
Supplies of goods are subject to VAT in Mozambique if the goods are located in Mozambique at the moment their transport or dispatch to the customer begins or, if there is no transport or dispatch, if the goods are located in Mozambique at the moment on which they are put at the disposal of the customer. Transactions of goods transported or dispatched from overseas before being imported into Mozambique are also subject to VAT in Mozambique.
### Supplies of services
The meaning of 'services' is very broad as it includes all the transactions carried out that are not a supply of goods or an import of goods.
The general rule is that the taxable operation takes place at the place where the supplier’s business, PE from which the services are rendered, or its permanent address is situated.
However, the following exceptions should be taken into consideration:
| **Transaction** | Place o**f supply** |
| --- | --- |
| Services related to immovable property | Place in which the property is located, regardless of where the service provider is based. |
| Works on movable assets | Place where the actual service is totally or mainly rendered, regardless of where the service provider is based. |
| Services of artistic, scientific, sports, recreational, educational, and similar nature | Place where the actual service is performed. |
| Transportation services | Place in which the transport takes place, taking into account the actual distance covered. |
### VAT reverse-charge mechanism
Supplies of the following services by non-resident suppliers are subject to VAT in Mozambique through the application of the reverse-charge mechanism, provided the customer is a taxable person (the same supplies would not be subject to VAT in the case where the customer is a foreign entity):
In case the foreign supplier of the services above does not appoint a tax representative in Mozambique to comply with the inherent tax obligations, it is the customer (Mozambique tax resident entity and subject to VAT) that must report the VAT. The customer must add the VAT amount to both the output VAT and input VAT (if applicable) on the VAT return of the month in which the invoice from the non-resident supplier is received. This means that if the customer is entitled to claim input VAT, there will be no extra VAT payable to or claimable from the MTA (i.e. in normal circumstances the VAT reverse-charge mechanism is cash-flow neutral).
It is crucial to highlight that the input VAT may only be claimed if 90 days have not elapsed from the invoice issuance date to the reporting date (the timeframe for claiming input VAT). Failure to adhere to this timeframe may lead to the exclusion of the VAT amount from the input VAT. If included, it might be disallowed, potentially resulting in additional payable VAT.
### Import of goods
### Standard VAT regime
All taxpayers with a turnover or goods import operations higher than 2.5 million Mozambican metical (MZN) fall within the standard VAT regime. These taxpayers and those that choose to be framed in the standard regime normally pay VAT on expenses (input tax) and charge VAT on supplies made (output tax). This mechanism, therefore, ensures that only the so-called ‘added-value’ is taxed. Due to VAT being a self-assessment system, the output tax collected may be reduced by input tax paid. Thereafter, the net amount is payable to, or refundable by, the MTA. The self-assessment returns are due regularly within prescribed periods (tax periods).
### Zero-rated supplies (complete exemptions)
The VAT Act contains a list of the supplies of goods or services that are regarded as zero-rated supplies. Most of the items refer to exports and international transport, but other specified goods and services utilised for farming purposes, certain basic foodstuffs, mosquito nets, common bicycles and iron bicycles up to 4 speeds, condoms, and insecticides, among others, are also regarded as zero-rated supplies.
Under a zero-rated supply, a vendor does not charge VAT on the consideration for the supply and obtains a refund or credit for the VAT paid on taxable supplies utilised in the making of the zero-rated supplies.
### Exempt supplies
In addition to zero-rated supplies, the VAT Act contains a list of the supplies of goods or services that are exempt from VAT. Exempt supplies include, among others, banking and financial operation subject to stamp duty, insurance and reinsurance operations subject to stamp duty, residential rentals, medical and sanitary services, and educational services.
In the case of an exempt supply made by a vendor, the vendor does not charge VAT on the supply and is not entitled to a deduction or credit for the VAT paid on goods and services supplied for the making of the exempt supply. Accordingly, vendors treat the VAT paid by them, and for which they do not obtain a deduction or credit, as another cost and recover it in the consideration they charge for the making of the exempt supply.
### Reduced rate supplies
A reduced rate of 5% was recently introduced on the transmission of the following goods and services:
Note: Input VAT incurred on expenses subject to a reduced rate of 5% is not eligible for deduction.
## Customs duties
Customs duties are charged on importation of goods into Mozambique, and the applicable rates vary from 0% to 20% depending on the classification per the Custom Tariff Schedule (the Customs Tariff Schedule is based on the World Customs Organisation 2012 Harmonised System), unless the goods imported benefit from a specific exemption or fall under a special customs regime (e.g. temporary importation, bonded warehouse, SEZ, IFZ), in which case the payment is suspended while the goods remain in that regime.
Customs duties are levied on the customs value of the imported goods, which is determined in accordance with the definition of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) signed in 1994. In short, the following elements form part of the customs value: cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) of the goods imported. However, there are specific cases where other elements can be added to the customs value as long as they involve payments abroad. Such elements can comprise:
Import of goods from Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) countries and the European Union (EU) may enjoy preferential treatment under the applicable international trade agreements, provided that the origination of the goods in question is proved by means of certificates of origin.
## Excise taxes
Excise duties are charged on certain goods manufactured locally or imported, which are identified in a specific table that is an integral part of the Excise Duty Act and indicates the applicable rates. Amongst others, the said table includes goods such as tobacco, beer and other alcoholic beverages, vehicles, cosmetics, cloths, aircraft, boats, etc.
Examples of excise duty rates include the following:
| Goods | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Alcoholic beverages | Rates vary by year and depending on the nature of the beverage. |
| Tobacco | 75 |
| Air vehicles without engines | 30 |
| Boats and other recreational or sportive crafts | 25 |
| Clothes and respective accessories | 30 |
## Property transfer taxes (National SISA)
In Mozambique, a property transfer tax is charged on transfers of real estate, excluding the land, which is owned by the state. The rate of tax is 2% of the selling price of the building. When the beneficiaries live in a country with a privileged tax regime, the applicable rate is 10%. In areas not covered by municipalities, SISA is collected by the MTA (National SISA).
## Stamp duties (SD)
SD is borne by the person with economic interest in the realities subject to tax. In certain situations, the Stamp Duty Code clarifies who is deemed to have an economic interest in a particular transaction, eliminating eventual doubts.
## Payroll taxes
There are no payroll taxes other than social security contributions (*see below*).
## Social security contributions
Social security contributions are payable by employers and employees on monthly remuneration. The aggregate rate of contribution is 7%, with 4% paid by the employer and the remaining 3% by the employee. No ceiling is applicable.
## Industry-specific taxes
### Upstream petroleum industry: Petroleum Production Tax (PPT)
PPT is charged on oil and gas produced in each concession area and is due by the entities performing petroleum operations under a concession agreement in Mozambique.
PPT is charged at the following rates:
| Hydrocarbon | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Crude oil and condensate | 10 |
| Natural gas and liquified natural gas | 6 |
The basis to which the tax rate is applied is determined under specific rules, which are based on the average selling prices of oil and gas in the month the tax refers to. It should be noted that the tax must be paid in cash but may, in some circumstances, be demanded in kind.
### Mining industry: Mining Production Tax (MPT)
MPT is charged at the following rates:
| Mineral products | Rate (%) | Observations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Diamonds | 8 | May be reduced by 50% in cases where the production is to be used for the development of local industry. It is considered local industry if the sale is for the national hydrocarbon company (ENH, E.P.). |
| Precious metals, precious stone and semi-precious stone, and heavy sand | 6 |
| Base metals, coal, and others | 3 |
| Sand and stone | 1.5 |
### Mining industry: Surface Tax (ST)
| Mining title | # of years of activities | Rate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Exploration licence | 1st and 2nd | MZN 17.5/ha |
| 3rd | MZN 43.75/ha |
| 4th and 5th | MZN 91/ha |
| 6th | MZN 105/ha |
| 7th and 8th | MZN 210/ha |
| Mining concession | 1st to 5th | MZN 30/ha |
| 6th onwards | MZN 60/ha |
| Mining certificate | 1st to 5th | MZN 30/ha |
| 6th onwards | MZN 50/ha |
### Mining industry: Mining Resource Rent Tax (MRRT)
MRRT is a windfall tax that is charged to mining concession and mining certificate holders on the accumulated net cash flow earnings from the moment such cash flows give rise to internal rate of return (IRR) that is equal to or higher than 18% before CIT.
In particular, accumulated net cash flows should be calculated at the beginning of the fiscal year in which the mining concession / certificate is granted and for each fiscal year thereafter. The cash flow for each fiscal year will be calculated as follows:
| Formula for computation of MRRT cash flow: | |
| --- | --- |
|  | Taxable profit |
| (+) | Tax depreciation |
| (+) | Financial expenses (e.g. interest and other financial charges) |
| (-) | capital expenditures (CAPEX), excluding the mining title acquisition costs |
| (-) | Start-up costs for seven years before the mining concession was granted |
| (=) | **Yearly cash flow** |
It is expected that during the early years of the MRRT calculation that these yearly cash flows will produce negative results. These negative yearly cash flows should be accumulated from one year to another for purposes of the MRRT calculation. In other words, the cash flow closing balance in year 1 will be the opening cash flow balance in year 2, etc.
However, any negative net cash flow balance that is transferred from one year to another should be subjected to an 18% uplift rate (except in the case of non-production in a fiscal year during production phase). As soon as the net cash flow balance turns into a positive cash flow in a particular year, then that positive net cash flow will be subject to a 20% MRRT tax rate. Naturally, as soon as the positive cash flows are subject to MRRT, then no cash flows are transferred anymore from one year to another; in other words, the opening net cash flow balance in the following year will be zero.
### Gambling industry: Special Tax on Gambling
The Special Tax on Gambling is charged to gambling concession holders and is levied on the gross revenues derived from the gambling business net of the individual gains awarded to gamblers, pursuant to the terms defined in the concession agreement.
## Municipal taxes
Municipal taxes include the following:
### Municipal tax on real estate
The municipal tax on real estate is levied annually on the value of immovable assets situated within the municipality and owned or possessed by corporate entities. Effective tax rates range from 0.4% (for housing purposes) to 0.7% (for office purposes or mixed activities) of the building value, depending on the municipality.
### Municipal SISA
Municipal SISA is charged on the transfer for consideration of ownership rights or of other minor rights over real property that takes place within municipal areas. Other than the territoriality aspect and the nuances associated with it, the regime applicable to Municipal SISA and National SISA are the same.
### Municipal vehicles tax
The municipal vehicles tax is levied on the use of specific vehicles (e.g. light and heavy vehicles less than 25 years old, motorcycles less than 15 years old, aeroplanes, and boats for private use). This tax is due by the owners who are residents of a municipality, regardless of the place of registration of the vehicle owned.
The rate varies, depending on specific criteria, such as type of fuel, engine capacity, period of registration, and weight.
### Municipal Tax on Individuals
Municipal Tax on Individuals represents the minimum contribution of each citizen to the public expenses of the municipality and is due by all persons, national or foreign, between the ages of 18 and 60 who are residents in a certain municipality.
The applicable rates range from 1% to 4%, depending on the municipality, and are levied annually based on the highest minimum monthly salary as of 30 June of the preceding year. Employers are responsible for withholding the Municipal Tax on Individuals.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year is, as a general rule, the calendar year. A different tax year is allowed in the case of PEs of non-resident entities, which can adopt the tax period of the non-resident company. Resident persons that carry on activities that justify the adoption of a different taxation period or that are controlled by entities that already adopt a different taxation period may also adopt a different taxation period, provided they are duly authorised by the Minister of Economy and Finance. The different tax year should, however, coincide with the period to which the financial statements concern. If the option of a tax year different from the calendar year is taken, the new tax period must be maintained for a minimum of five years.
## Tax returns
CIT assessment must be prepared by the companies on annual returns, based on the accounting records and on adjustments prescribed by the tax regulations.
The submission of the annual tax return is due by the last working day of May for companies using the calendar year as their tax year. For companies with a tax year that is not coincident with the calendar year, the presentation of the tax return is due by the last day of the fifth month subsequent to the respective year-end.
## Payment of tax
Mozambican companies and non-resident companies with a PE in Mozambique must pay CIT as follows:
Final tax should be paid by the last working day of May or the fifth month after the tax year-end in cases where a different tax year is adopted.
## Tax audit process
The tax authorities may carry out an inspection whenever necessary. Normally, the inspection occurs after the taxpayer files a refund application or on a random basis.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations period is five years, but the company documents must be kept for ten years.
Based on our experience and through assistance provided to several clients during audit reviews, we noted that the Inspectors are focusing their attention on the following aspects:
## Anti-avoidance
Although the principle of 'substance over form' is generally applicable in tax affairs, there are no express General Anti-Avoidance Rules in Mozambique. Nevertheless, there are some specific anti-avoidance rules dealing with:
## Advance binding tax rulings (ATRs)
In order to promote and ensure clarity and certainty about the interpretation and application of the applicable taxation laws to a given arrangement or transaction, taxpayers are entitled to obtain an ATR from the MTA. An ATR binds the MTA to comply with the tax arrangements set out in the ruling, provided that the taxpayer has correctly supplied all relevant information and that the arrangement or transaction is formally and materially implemented in line with the terms of the application. The MTA can only cease to comply with an ATR if there is a judicial court decision that overthrows such ATR.
Although it is a prerogative of the taxpayer to seek and obtain an ATR, in practise, there are situations in which it is compulsory to obtain an ATR. This is the case, for example, of cross-border arrangements or transactions where a DTT is applicable.
## Tax clearance certificates (TCCs)
A TCC is documentary evidence issued by the MTA to confirm that the taxpayer is up to date with any tax payments and has met all applicable tax obligations at the date of issue. TCCs are required for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, submission of bids for any contracts awarded by the government and public entities and, in some cases, by private entities that have strict procurement policies in place; applications for work permits and resident permits, including renewals; payments to non-resident entities under many cross-borders transactions; and applications to obtain or renew certain business permits.
The procedures and requirements to obtain TCCs vary depending on the purpose for which the TCC is required. In certain cases where the taxpayers benefit from tax exemptions or where DTTs apply, TCCs are only issued on the basis of an ATR that confirms the exact tax treatment applicable to the case in hand. According to the law, TCCs must be issued within 15 days from the date of application. In practice, however, it is common to experience delays, which can be quite significant in a number of cases. TCCs are valid for a period of 90 days.

## Overview
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
Mozambique, a country in Southeast Africa with a coast on the Indian Ocean, is bordered by Tanzania to the north, Malawi and Zambia to the northwest, Zimbabwe to the west, and Swaziland and South Africa to the southwest. Mozambique existed for almost five centuries as a Portuguese colony until independence in 1975. It is divided into ten provinces and one city with provincial status, Maputo, which is the capital. Portuguese is the official language of Mozambique. The currency of Mozambique is the metical (MZN).
Mozambique showed strong economic growth at the start of the previous decade, with real gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaging 7.0% from 2010 to 2015. Rapid growth in the mining sector, along with the exploration and discovery of vast natural gas reserves, contributed towards this strong growth.
The country also saw a rapid increase in foreign direct investment (FDI), including investment in coal and natural gas, along with increased spending on major infrastructure projects.
Revelations of historical corruption were one of the main drivers of economic slowdown from 2016 onwards, with many donor agencies (including the World Bank) withholding much-needed financial aid from the country. Tropical cyclones have also caused large-scale destruction, particularly in the agricultural sector during 2019. Conflicts and terrorist attacks in the Cabo Delgado province have also continued to negatively affect the economy through various sectors. This includes the agriculture sector through displaced individuals, affecting subsistence farming, as well as the mining and oil and gas sectors through interrupted operations in the region. As a result, real GDP growth averaged only 3.3% from 2016 to 2019. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which started in early 2020, caused many disruptions along the supply and demand chains in the economy as various restrictions were put in place. These further pushed the country’s economic growth downwards, resulting in a contraction of 1.3% during 2020. However, Mozambique’s growing liquefied natural gas (LNG) sector is forecast to help accelerate economic growth to pre-2016 levels over the next few years, with real GDP growth forecast at 7.4% for 2024.

# Mozambique
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
As of 1 January 2014, the family unit is no longer taxed jointly for earned income. Each couple or single individual should declare their own incomes and file the respective annual income tax return.
Employers withhold earned income tax on a monthly basis for work carried out in Mozambique at the WHT rates approved by law, which currently vary from 0% to 32%.
Individual tax returns must be submitted from January to April of the year following the tax year.
If only employment income, paid by a Mozambican entity (and therefore subject to the income tax withholding at source) has been obtained in a tax year, the individual does not have an obligation to file an annual tax return for that tax year.
## Payment of tax
Employers are obligated to collect the amount of earned income tax payable from their employees each month and make payments to the Finance Department within the following month (up to the 20th day of the month).
Payment of any final balance due, after the issue of the tax assessment by the tax authorities, must be made by the end of May (if it refers to employment income) or by the end of June (for other types of income).

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
Any non-resident entity carrying out economic activities in Mozambique, without being registered as a taxpayer, is liable, in general, to a final and definitive 20% WHT that is applied on all income earned. An exception exists for (i) telecommunications and international transport, as well as the respective installation and assembly of equipment made by those same entities; (ii) construction and rehabilitation of production, transport, and distribution of electricity infrastructures in the rural zones under the public projects of rural electrification; and (iii) maritime vessels freight for fishing and coasting activities, all of which are subject to a 10% WHT rate.
In addition, per the recent amendments to the CIT Code, a temporary reduction of the WHT rate to 10% was introduced for income earned by non-residents, deriving from the provision of services to local agricultural companies, until the end of 2025. Further, a temporary WHT exemption was introduced on interest income earned by non-residents in connection with external loans destined to finance agricultural projects, until the end of 2025.
Not all gains sourced from Mozambique by non-resident corporate entities are subject to taxation through WHT. This is the case, for example, of:
In such cases, the non-resident entity is required to register itself as a non-resident taxpayer, appoint a tax representative in Mozambique, and subject the gain to 32% CIT. On disposal of immovable property (other than petroleum and mining assets), only 50% of the gain is taxable.
## Tax treaties
In accordance with Mozambique's DTTs, the following tax rates are applicable to dividends, interest, and royalties:
| Recipient | WHT (%) | | | CIT (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dividends | Interest | Royalties | Capital gains on shares |
| Non-treaty | 20 | 20 | 20 | 32 |
| Treaty: |  |  |  |  |
| Botswana | 0/12 (4, 5) | 10 | 10 | 0 |
| India | 7.5 | 10 | 10 | 32 (6) |
| Italy | 15 | 10 | 10 | 0 |
| Macau | 10 | 10 | 10 | 0 |
| Mauritius | 8/10/15 (1, 2, 3) | 8 | 5 | 0 |
| Portugal | 10 | 10 | 10 | 32 (6) |
| South Africa | 8/15 (1, 3) | 8 | 5 | 32 (6) |
| United Arab Emirates | 0 | 0 | 5 | 32 (6) |
| Vietnam | 10 | 10 | 10 | 32 (6) |
Notes
1. The 8% rate applies if the recipient of the dividends is a company that has more than 25% of the share capital in the company that distributes the dividends.
2. The 10% rate applies if the recipient of the dividends is a company that has less than 25% of the share capital in the company that distributes the dividends.
3. The 15% rate applies in all other cases.
4. The 0% rate applies if the recipient of the dividends is a company that has more than 25% of the share capital in the company that distributes the dividends.
5. The 12% rate applies in all other cases.
6. Gains are only taxed in the other state if assets of the entity sold are composed of more than 50% immovable assets. In the case of Vietnam, the threshold is 30%.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
The taxable profit of resident entities and PEs is determined by following the partial dependence model, which means that the taxable profit consists of the sum of net profit for the financial year and the net variations in equity not reflected in the net profit, as accrued and determined for accounting purposes, and subject to tax adjustments set forth in the CIT Code.
## Inventory valuation
The inventory valuation criteria accepted for tax purposes for the determination of the accounting profit / losses of the year are those that use:
### Effective acquisition and production costs
Companies that use this criterion can value their inventory based on the following methods:
The last in first out (LIFO) method is not allowed.
### Standard costs assessed according with adequate technical and accounting principles
Whenever there is significant deviation from the standard costs, the MTA may make the necessary corrections based on an investigation of the assumptions used, on the amount of the sales, and the final inventory turnover.
### Sale prices deducted from the normal profit margin
This criterion is only accepted in sectors of activity where the acquisition or production costs become excessively expensive or cannot be assessed with reasonable certainty. Whenever it is not easy to determine the normal profit margin, a maximum 20% deduction to the selling price is accepted.
### Special costing for basic or normal inventory
The adoption of this criterion is subject to the prior approval from the MTA on request basis.
### Costing based on market price quote
In the case of taxable persons that produce and sell agricultural products and other biological assets, whenever they have suitable register and control over the production cycle, the inventories should be valued on the basis of the market price quote, deducting the costs at the sales point.
## Capital gains
Capital gains less any capital losses derived from the sale or disposal of tangible fixed assets, including insurance indemnities received in case of accident, are taxed as part of normal income. If a taxpayer reinvests the sale proceeds within three tax years following the year of sale, the gain may be deferred until the end of the third year. A three-year reinvestment period may be accepted, provided a prior application is submitted to the Minister of Economy and Finance. However, if the taxpayer does not realise the reinvestment, the CIT that was not assessed during the three-year period will be assessed, along with compensatory interest.
Capital gains and capital losses are determined by the difference between the sales proceeds, net of related costs, and the acquisition value, net of tax-deductible depreciation or amortisation, adjusted by the inflation index.
## Dividend income
Dividends received from resident companies in Mozambique subject to and not exempt from CIT or subject to the Special Tax on Gambling may be deducted in full for purposes of determining the taxable profit of the companies that are the beneficiary of the dividends, provided that the following conditions are all met:
This deduction mechanism is also applied, irrespective of the percentage of shareholding and period during which the shares are held, to the following companies:
If participation exemption does not apply, a credit for domestic economic double taxation is applicable (*see Credit for domestic economic double taxation in the [Tax credits and incentives](mozambique/corporate/tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for more information*).
## Interest income
Interest income obtained by Mozambican taxpayers is taxed as part of normal income and taxed at the standard CIT rate. Any WHT incurred in interest income received is treated as a payment on account of the final CIT liability, refundable even if no CIT is due, in case of domestic interest income.
Interest on treasury bills, securities listed on the stock exchange, and on liquidity swaps between banks is taxed separately from normal income, being subject to WHT at rate of 20%.
## Royalty income
Royalty income obtained by Mozambican taxpayers is taxed as part of normal income and taxed at the standard CIT rate. Any WHT incurred in royalty income received is treated as a payment on account of the final CIT liability, refundable even if no CIT is due, in case of domestic royalty income.
## Foreign income
Mozambican resident companies are taxed on the total income earned on a worldwide basis. Taxes paid abroad can be offset against corresponding Mozambican tax (*see Foreign tax credit in the [Tax credits and incentives](mozambique/corporate/tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for more information*).
There are no provisions concerning tax deferral of income earned abroad.

## Tax filing and payments
As a response to the challenge of mitigating the spread of COVID-19, as well as with the objective of increasing revenue collection, reducing administrative costs inherent to revenue management, and reducing cash handling and payment fraud, while also improving revenue accounting, the Mozambican Tax Authority (MTA) launched online platforms (*<https://edeclaracao.at.gov.mz/>* and *<https://portaldocontribuinte.at.gov.mz/>*) to enable entities to file their tax returns online.
The former platform (i.e. *<https://edeclaracao.at.gov.mz/>)* serves for the online submission of income tax returns, personal income tax (PIT) on employment income payment returns (M/19), and corporate income tax (CIT) payment returns (M/39), and the latter platform (i.e. *<https://portaldocontribuinte.at.gov.mz/>)* is utilised for filing monthly value-added tax (VAT) returns.
As far as payment of taxes is concerned (i.e. VAT, PIT on employment income, and CIT), the taxpayers that are registered in the online platform must generate a specific reference number from the platform and use it when instructing its commercial bank to proceed with the payment of the applicable taxes. The payment slip issued by the commercial bank is sufficient proof that the taxes have been paid. The taxpayers that are not yet registered in the online platforms still need to physically submit proof of payment at the tax office in which it is domiciled and obtain the respective receipt issued by the MTA.
## VAT refunds for companies operating in the extractive industry
The government of Mozambique recently introduced changes to the chapter of the VAT Refund Regulations that deals with the special regularisation regime for companies operating in the extractive industry. The changes that were introduced aim to extend the special VAT regularisation regime to:

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
Corporate residence is determined on the basis of a company’s place of incorporation or effective management. Thus, all companies with headquarters or effective management in Mozambique are considered tax residents and are liable for CIT on their worldwide income.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Under the relevant Mozambican tax law, a non-resident entity is deemed to have a PE in Mozambique if it has any fixed place of business in Mozambique through which industrial, trading, agricultural, rendering of services, or similar activities are totally or partially carried out.
A fixed place of business comprises, among others, a place of management, a branch, an office, a factory, a workshop, a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry, or any other place of extraction of natural resources.
A non-resident entity is also deemed to have a PE in Mozambique if one of the following circumstances exists:
Generally, PE is not created as a result of preparatory or ancillary activities, such as:
Mozambique is among the few number of countries that is yet to accede to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS). Hence, the concept of PE is not aligned with BEPS Action 7 on Permanent Establishment Status.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
## Depreciation and amortisation
As a rule, all fixed assets subject to wear and tear and which repeatedly suffer loss of value resulting from their usage over time, technical progress, or any other causes can be depreciated or amortised for tax purposes.
The right to depreciate or amortise fixed assets belongs to the owner of the assets or the entity that bears the risk of loss or deterioration of the assets.
The acquisition or production cost of fixed assets is tax deductible in accordance with their expected useful life, from the moment that they are put in operation.
Depreciation of fixed assets should generally be charged to the profit and loss account, using the straight-line method, although taxpayers may elect to apply the reducing-balance method. The reducing-balance method cannot be applied to building properties, passenger vehicles for private use, or furniture and social equipment.
The depreciation rates are established by law, and deductions above such rates are not deductible for tax purposes.
Depreciation and amortisation made under the following circumstances are not accepted as costs and must be added back in the tax computation:
The main depreciation rates are:
| Assets | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Tangible assets: |  |
| Industrial buildings | 2.00 |
| Residential buildings | 10.00 |
| Office and administrative buildings | 2.00 |
| Machinery and installations, air conditioning, and telephone equipment | 12.50 |
| Lifts | 8.33 |
| Tools | 25.00 |
| Laboratory equipment | 12.50 |
| Telex and interior equipment | 10.00 |
| Furniture and filing systems | 10.00 |
| Typewriters and accounting machines | 16.66 |
| Computer servers | 20.00 |
| Warehouse and filing installations: |  |
| Of concrete | 5.00 |
| Of wood | 6.66 |
| Of steel | 8.33 |
| Trucks | 20.00 |
| Automobiles | 25.00 |
| Intangible assets: |  |
| Pre-operating expenses incurred prior to the commencement of business | 33.33 |
| Deferred expenses arising in connection with increases in share capital, changes in form of business enterprises, issuance of debentures, marketing and other studies, and financial expenses incurred for the acquisition or own production of fixed assets prior to completion | 33.33 |
| Patents | 10.00 |
| Manufacturing licences, concessionaire agreements, and similar rights | 5.00 (1) |
| Trademark or premium of taking over leases of real estate | (2) |
Notes
1. Subject to certain conditions set forth by the tax authorities.
2. Depreciation is only allowed in cases of effective reduction of value within the limits regarded as reasonable by the tax authorities.
### Accelerated depreciation
New immovable assets, used for the furtherance of the business, may be depreciated by increasing to 50% the normal depreciation rates approved by law. This benefit is also granted to rehabilitated immovable assets, machinery, and equipment used in agro-industrial activities, provided there is an investment project duly approved by the government.
## Goodwill
Although goodwill is considered for accounting purposes in Mozambique, there is no provision for goodwill in the tax legislation. Consequently, goodwill should be regarded as an intangible asset for tax amortisation purposes.
## Interest expenses
In respect to interest deductibility, taxpayers are allowed a tax deduction in respect of interest incurred on related-party debt. The following are, however, exceptions to the rule:
| Limitations | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| **Interest barrier rule** | The portion of interest on shareholders’ loans that exceeds the Prime Rate (which replaced the Maputo Interbank Offered Rate [MAIBOR - 12 months]) provided by the Bank of Mozambique (BoM) at the date of settlement, added by 2 percentage points, is not deductible for tax purposes. The Prime Rate currently stands at 23.50%; consequently, the interest limit referred to herein amounts to a rate of 25.50% *per annum*. |
| **Transfer pricing** | The interest rate charged on related-party transactions is not deductible if it is not within the arm’s-length parameters in terms of the Mozambican transfer pricing regime (*please see Transfer pricing in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section for further guidance*). |
## Provisions and impairment losses
In Mozambique, companies are able to create all the provisions necessary and relevant for the normal course of business. However, for tax purposes, only the provisions and impairment losses listed below can be deducted as a cost:
Any other provisions reflected in the company’s accounts will not be accepted as tax-deductible costs.
## Charitable contributions
Donations can be deducted as costs for tax purposes, provided specific requirements are met and the beneficiaries thereof are:
It is important to note that this deduction is not applicable automatically, as it is necessary to present proof that the donation was previously communicated to and approved by the Ministry of Finance.
## Other non-deductible items
Not all costs or losses that meet the aforesaid requirements are deductible for CIT purposes and must be added-back to the net accounting profit of the year for purposes of determining the taxable profit.
These include, amongst others, the costs or losses resulting from the following:
## Net operating losses
Carryback of losses is not allowed in Mozambique. On the other hand, losses may be carried forward for a period of five consecutive years.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Any payments to non-residents are allowed as deductible expenses, provided that the amount does not exceed normal rates and that the taxpayer is able to prove that a business transaction was carried out with the non-resident company. The tax authorities may redetermine taxable income if, due to a special relationship between the Mozambican and non-resident companies, certain conditions existed that allowed a calculation of profit that differed from the profit that would have been calculated without the existence of such relationship (i.e. the arm’s-length principle).

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
There are no group taxation provisions available in Mozambique. Each member of a group of companies preparing consolidated accounts for accounting purposes must file separate tax returns in order to be taxed on its profits on a stand-alone basis.
## Transfer pricing
The tax authorities may proceed with the necessary corrections for assessing the profits for tax purposes whenever:
The corrections above shall be equally applicable whenever the profits for accounts purposes regarding non-resident entities are different from those that should have resulted if the non-resident entity were a separate entity carrying out similar activities in similar conditions and with total independence.
The corrections referred to above will also be applicable to entities that carry out activities simultaneously subject and not subject to the CIT Code, provided that similar evasion regarding such activities is verified.
Whenever these corrections are applicable to one taxpayer of CIT (Taxpayer 1) by virtue of special relations with another taxpayer of CIT or of individual income tax (Taxpayer 2), the adjustments reflecting the corrections made in the calculation of the profits for tax purposes of Taxpayer 1 shall be applicable in the assessment of the profits for tax purposes of Taxpayer 2.
Although the definition of ‘special relation’ had been previously introduced into the transfer pricing regime foreseen in the CIT Code, the specific transfer pricing regulations were only recently approved and entered into force on 1 January 2018.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
In general, PEs are subject to the same rules for determination of taxable profit that tax resident companies are subject to. There are, however, certain adaptations that are required due to the nature of PEs and their relationship with the foreign parent entity. It follows, for example, that part of general administration and overhead costs incurred by the head office may be allocated to the PE and are tax deductible in the sphere of the PE, within reasonable limits and upon criteria disclosed and justified in the tax return, as well as consistently applied in the successive tax years (acceptable criteria include, but is not restricted to, the pro-rata of turnover, direct costs, and tangible fixed assets).
Branch profit remittance to the foreign head office is not subject to tax in Mozambique.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
## Foreign tax credit
Resident companies are allowed to deduct a credit correspondent to a tax paid abroad. The tax credit to be deducted should be equal to the lower of the amount of Mozambican CIT imputed to income obtained abroad or the amount of foreign tax effectively paid.
## Credit for domestic economic double taxation
When the taxpayer is not eligible for the participation exemption mechanism, they are required to include the profits distributed by resident entities in their taxable profits. In such cases and in order to mitigate the impact of economic double taxation, those taxpayers benefit from a tax credit to be deducted from the tax assessed, which corresponds to 60% of the CIT of the distributed profits that are included the taxable profits.
## General tax benefits and incentives
In addition to the guarantees of ownership and remittance of funds abroad, the Mozambican government also guarantees the concession of tax and customs incentives. The incentives vary depending on whether a company is starting a new venture or rehabilitating one and also on the nature of the project to be developed. The incentives discussed in this section are the generic benefits applicable to standard projects. Certain specific benefits also may be applicable depending on the activities of the industry for the investment project (e.g. agriculture, mining).
### Income taxes
#### Accelerated depreciation
Accelerated depreciation of new buildings used in the pursuit of the investment project, as well as rehabilitated buildings, machinery, and equipment intended for industrial or agro-industrial activities, by increasing the normal depreciation rates by 50%.
####
#### Tax deductible expenditures
####
#### Deductions to taxable income
Deductions to the taxable income of the amounts invested in (i) professional training of Mozambican employees and (ii) the modernisation and introduction of new technologies, up to a limit of 5% and 10%, respectively, during the first five years.
####
#### Investment tax credit
A carry-forwardable investment tax credit of 5% to 10% of the total investment realised on assets directly associated with the production activity of the operating company (depending on which location the project is implemented in), for a period of five years, to be offset against the gross income tax, up to its total amount.
### Taxes and duties on import of goods
An exemption from customs duties and VAT applies upon the importation of capital equipment listed in Section K of the Customs Tariff Schedule.
## Sector-specific tax benefits and incentives
### Processing industry
Exemption from payment of customs duties on imports of materials for the industrial production process.
### Agriculture and fisheries
### Upstream petroleum and mining
### Gambling
The gambling concession holders and their shareholders are exempt from CIT. The casino concession holders are also exempt of payment of customs duties, excise duties, and VAT on imports of equipment and materials for the implementation, rehabilitation, expansion, or modernisation and business start-up.
## Project-specific tax benefits and incentives
### Investment in Science and Technology Parks
The following benefits and incentives apply to investments in scientific investigation, development of information and communication technologies, and R&D:
### Investment in creation of basic infrastructure
The following benefits and incentives apply to investments that have as their exclusive purpose the establishment of basic public infrastructure that is essential for the promotion and attraction of investments, for the conduct of specific activities in sectors of the national economy, such as the construction and rehabilitation of roads, rail lines, airports, water supply, electricity, telecoms, and others:
### Large scale projects
The following benefits and incentives apply to investments that exceeds MZN 12.5 billion:

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
## Personal deductions
After assessment of gross tax, resident taxpayers are allowed to deduct the following amounts:
## Business deductions
Deductions from business income depend on the taxation regime adopted by each taxpayer.
For individuals that are obligated to maintain statutory accounts (turnover above MZN 2.5 million), the assessment of net income is obtained after deductions of various costs connected with the activity, which include, among others, staff costs, rents, depreciation of premises and equipment, fees paid to third parties for services, power and water consumption, travelling expenses of up to 10% of gross earnings, and expenses, in general, that are incurred in the normal course of the activity or business.
Under this limit of annual turnover (i.e. MZN 2.5 million), tax will be accessed according to the simplified taxation regime, under which no costs are deducted against income and the total turnover is taxed according to certain coefficients: 0.2 for sale of goods and the merchandise sector, 0.2 for the accommodation and food and beverage sector, and 0.3 on revenue from all other sectors of activities.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
## Employment income
The tax concept of employment income is very broad, including salary and any fringe benefits (in kind or in cash) paid or granted by the employer to its employees. In general, all economic advantages provided to the employee arising from the employment or equivalent relationship are considered remuneration and taxed as employment income under the PIT Code.
With the exception of housing allowances, use of company paid houses, private use of a company car (if a written agreement is signed) attributed on an uncertain and irregular basis, and the gratifications paid by an entity other than the employer, all employment income is subject to monthly withholding taxes (WHTs) on a definitive and final basis, through application of tax rates from 10% to 32%, depending on the gross monthly amounts received and number of dependants, as follows:
| Monthly gross income (MZN) | Number of dependants | | | | | Coefficient applicable to every additional amount to the lower amount of income |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4+ |
| Up to 20,249.99 | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| From 20,250.00 to 20,749.99 | - | - | - | - | - | 0.10 |
| From 20,750.00 to 20,999.99 | 50 | 0 | - | - | - | 0.10 |
| From 21,000.00 to 21,249.99 | 75 | 25 | 0 | - | - | 0.10 |
| From 21,250.00 to 21,749.99 | 100 | 50 | 25 | 0 | - | 0.10 |
| From 21,750.00 to 22,249.99 | 150 | 100 | 75 | 50 | 0 | 0.10 |
| From 22,250.00 to 32,749.99 | 200 | 150 | 125 | 100 | 50 | 0.15 |
| From 32,750.00 to 60,749.99 | 1,775 | 1,725 | 1,700 | 1,675 | 1,625 | 0.20 |
| From 60,750.00 to 144,749.99 | 7,375 | 7,325 | 7,300 | 7,275 | 7,225 | 0.25 |
| More than 144,750.00 | 28,375 | 28,325 | 28,300 | 28,275 | 28,225 | 0.32 |
The income tax withheld by the employer shall be delivered to the Mozambican Tax Authority (MTA) up to the 20th day of the following month.
Individuals that only earn employment income that is subject to Mozambique WHT on a definitive basis are not required to file an annual income tax return, meaning that there is no additional payment or reimbursement of PIT in respect to employment income (if paid by a Mozambique resident entity).
For individuals that earn employment income that is not subject to definitive WHT in Mozambique and/or another type of income (rental, freelance income, capital gains, etc.), PIT is assessed on a yearly basis through the completion of the annual tax return (Form 10) in respect to the income obtained in the previous civil year and based on the annual tax rates varying from 10% to 32%, depending of the level of their annual taxable income. The annual tax return must be filed from January to April of the year following the year that income relates to.
## Capital gains
Gains resulting from the following are considered capital gains:
Capital gains are taxed as follows:
Capital gains are taxed at the year end, jointly with other income, at the annual tax rates established, which vary from 10% to 32%.
## Capital investment income
The following income is considered as capital investment income:
Most capital investment income is taxed through withholding by the paying entity at 20% with exceptions for income from debit bonds and interests from bank deposits, which are taxed at 10%.
