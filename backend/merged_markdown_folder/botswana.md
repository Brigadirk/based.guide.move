## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 19 April 2024
Botswana has a source-based taxation system.
CIT is charged at a single flat rate of 22%. Manufacturing companies having the approval from the Minister of Finance for a special tax rate will be charged at the rate of 15%.
## International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) profits
IFSC companies are currently taxed at the rate of 15% on income arising from approved financial transactions with non-residents, IFSC companies, and Specified Collective Investment Undertakings. All other income is taxable at the rate of 22%. Companies must apply for a certificate to be classified as IFSC companies, which deal only in specified services with qualified persons.
## Mining profits
Mining profits, other than profits from diamond mining, are taxed according to the following formula:
Annual tax rate = 70 minus (1,500/x), where x is taxable income as a percentage of gross income.
The tax rate shall not be less than the flat CIT rate of 22%.
### Diamond mining
Diamond mining is usually taxed in terms of an agreement with the government of Botswana.
## Local income taxes
There are no local, state, or provincial government taxes on income in Botswana.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 19 April 2024
The Botswana tax system operates on a territorial basis, and income is taxable in Botswana if the source is within Botswana. Income for services performed outside Botswana is deemed to be from a Botswana source if the services are incidental to employment in Botswana.
A resident is taxable on all income from a Botswana source in accordance with the PIT rates.
A non-resident is taxable on earned income in accordance with the PIT rates, but pays withholding tax (WHT) only at the rate of 15% for interest, commercial royalties, and management and consultancy fees, 10% for dividends, and 10% for entertainment fees, where such income is of Botswana origin.

## Overview
Last reviewed - 19 April 2024
The Republic of Botswana, a landlocked country located in Southern Africa, is bordered by Namibia to the north and west, Zimbabwe to the east, and South Africa to the south. Botswana is divided into nine districts and five town councils, with Gaborone as the capital. Setswana and English are widely spoken throughout Botswana, with most official communications in English. The official currency of Botswana is the pula (BWP).
Formerly the British protectorate of Bechuanaland, Botswana adopted its new name upon independence in 1966. Five decades of uninterrupted civilian leadership, progressive social policies, and significant capital investment have created one of the most dynamic economies in Africa. Mineral extraction, principally diamond mining, dominates economic activity; however, tourism is a growing sector due to the country's conservation practices and extensive nature preserves.
Botswana has maintained one of the world's best economic growth rates since its independence. Through fiscal discipline and sound management, Botswana transformed itself from one of the least wealthy countries in the world to a prospering upper-income country with a *per capita* gross domestic product (GDP) of 7,738.9 United States dollars (USD) in 2022. Botswana has been ranked as one of the best credit risks in Africa. Diamond mining has fuelled much of the expansion and currently accounts for one-quarter of GDP, 85% of export earnings, and about one-third of the government's revenues. Tourism, financial services, and agriculture are other key sectors.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 19 April 2024
## Taxable period
Botswana has a fiscal year ending on 30 June. However, a business may select its own accounting year, which may end on a date other than 30 June. This accounting year is accepted for the computation of the company’s taxable income.
## Tax returns
Botswana requires self-assessment, which means that the return submitted constitutes the assessment. The system is one that requires all corporate taxpayers to file tax returns in standard format (providing information relating to taxable income earned) within four months after the financial year-end of the company.
## Payment of tax
Under the self-assessment tax procedures for corporates, if the tax payable for a tax year exceeds BWP 50,000, then estimated tax is required to be paid in equal quarterly instalments over the period of 12 months ending on the company’s financial year-end date. Accordingly, the first quarterly payment should be made within three months of the beginning of the financial year and the balance quarterly payments at three monthly intervals thereafter. The final (balance) payment, if any, is to be made within four months from the end of the financial year, when submitting the return.
Where the tax is less than BWP 50,000, then the tax is payable within four months from the company’s financial year-end date.
## Tax audit process
There is no prescribed audit process, and an audit can be initiated by any factor as determined by the BURS. The audit or inspection will commence with a request from the BURS for the taxpayer to make available any such records or information as may be required.
## Statute of limitations
The assessment should be made any time prior to the expiry of four years after the end of the tax year to which it relates to. Tax returns submitted that have been assessed may not be reopened after a period of four years from date of assessment by the BURS.
The BURS is focusing on encouraging electronic filing for all the taxpayers.

# Botswana
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 19 April 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is imposed on taxable supplies and the importation of goods and certain services into Botswana. The standard VAT rate of 14% applies to all supplies that do not qualify for an exemption or are not zero-rated.
The VAT registration threshold is 1 million Botswana pula (BWP).
## Vocational training levy (TRL)
TRL, although not an indirect tax *per se*, is a levy collected through the VAT system and is levied on all VAT-registered persons at a rate of 0.05% of annual turnover in excess of BWP 2 billion and 0.2% on annual turnover up to BWP 2 billion. There is an oil industry turnover rate of 0.05% on regulated petroleum products. However, quick-shop sales attract a 0.2% rate for such oil industry companies. The rate is applied to the turnover for the tax period.
## Customs and excise duties
Customs and excise duties are charged on importation of goods (including currencies) into or exported out of Botswana. The import duties may also include anti-dumping and countervailing duties. No customs duties and excise duties are charged on trade between Botswana and South Africa, Lesotho, Namibia, and eSwatini, as these five countries constitute the Southern African Customs Union. In terms of the Botswana/Zimbabwe Trade Agreement, goods originating from either of the trading partners are exempted from payment of customs duties under the condition that the goods meet a minimum of 25% local content. Excise duty and local taxes, such as VAT, are due and payable where applicable.
## Property taxes
Property taxes are levied by local authorities, generally based on property valuations.
## Capital transfer tax (CTT)
CTT is levied on the donee upon the transfer (by way of inheritance or gratuitous disposal) of tangible or intangible, movable or immovable, property, at up to 12.5% for individuals and at 12.5% for companies.
## Transfer duty (TD)
TD is levied on the purchaser of immovable property upon the transfer of such, whether by sale, gift, inheritance, or otherwise. TD is levied on all immovable freehold and leasehold property.
TD is levied at 5% of the value of immovable property for Botswana citizens on acquisitions over BWP 1.5 million. For non-citizens, the duty is payable on the purchase price or value of property up to BWP 2 million at the rate of 10% and on the purchase price or value of property in excess of BWP 2 million at the rate of 15%. Where VAT is payable on a transaction in respect of which duty is payable, the TD is waived.
## Stamp duty
There is no stamp duty in Botswana.
## Payroll taxes
An employer with resident employees earning income above the taxable threshold and non-resident employees must deduct tax by applying the relevant tax rate and remit to the Botswana Unified Revenue Services (BURS) on a monthly basis before the 15th day of the succeeding month. Every employer is required to submit an annual return within 31 days after the end of the tax year on 30 June.
## Social security contributions
There are no social security taxes or contributions in Botswana.

## Inventory valuation
Inventories are valued at cost less such amounts, if any, that the Commissioner General believes are reasonable as representing the amount by which the value of such stock has been diminished because of damage, deterioration, obsolescence, or other cause. Although not expressly excluded by legislation, last in first out (LIFO) has not been accepted in practice by the tax authorities.
## Capital gains
Gains from disposal of specified capital assets (immovable property and marketable securities, including shares in private companies) are included in taxable income in the hands of the corporate taxpayer. Acquisition costs of immovable property are subject to a 10% compound annual addition for inflation for the period from acquisition to 30 June 1982, and thereafter to an inflation addition based on the increase in the consumer price index to the date of sale. For other gains, no inflation allowances are granted, but the taxable gain is set at 75% of the total gain.
Currently, the sale of any shares, units, or debentures of a resident company is exempt from tax under any of the following circumstances:
This exemption only applies if the shares, units, or debentures were held by the taxpayer for a period of at least one year prior to the date of disposal.
The aggregate amount of capital losses is offset against the aggregate amount of capital gains in the same tax year. Any excess of loss is deducted from aggregate gains over losses accruing in the succeeding tax year only. Capital losses cannot, in any circumstances, be deducted against other income.
## Dividend income
Net dividend income from local sources is not subject to tax.
## Interest income
In the case of a resident company, interest income is included in gross income and taxed at the CIT rate. In the case of a non-resident company, interest income is subject to WHT, which constitutes a final tax.
## Royalty income
Royalty income is included in gross income and taxed at the CIT rate. In the case of a non-resident company, royalty income is subject to WHT, which constitutes a final tax.
## Partnership income
Partnership income is taxed in the hands of the partners, in proportion to their share in the partnership.
## Foreign income
Resident corporations are not generally taxed on a worldwide income basis. However, interest and dividend income from a foreign source is taxed in the hands of the resident company on an accrual basis. Relief is given for any WHT imposed on such income.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 19 April 2024
## Social security contributions
There are no social security taxes or contributions in Botswana.
## Capital gains taxes
Capital gains for individuals are considered to be from a separate source and are taxed on the basis of the table below.
Capital gains on the disposal of immovable property and marketable securities (including shares in private companies) are taxable in Botswana if the source is in Botswana. For capital gains purposes, the cost of immovable property is adjusted to take account of inflation. For other gains, no inflation allowances are granted, but the taxable gain is set at 75% of the total gain.
| Taxable income (BWP) | | Tax on column 1 (BWP) | Tax on excess (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 36,000 | - | 0 |
| 36,000 | 84,000 | - | 5.00 |
| 84,000 | 120,000 | 2,400 | 12.50 |
| 120,000 | 156,000 | 6,900 | 18.75 |
| 156,000 | And above | 13,650 | 25.00 |
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is imposed on taxable supplies and the importation of goods into Botswana. The standard VAT rate of 14% applies to all supplies that do not qualify for an exemption or are not zero-rated.
## Property taxes
There are no property taxes in Botswana.
## Capital transfer tax (CTT)
CTT is levied on the transfer (by way of inheritance or gratuitous disposal) of tangible or intangible, movable or immovable, property at 12.5%, subject to certain exemptions. The donee, or person to whom property is transferred by way of inheritance, is liable for CTT.
## Transfer duties on immovable property
Transfer duty is levied at 5% for citizens and 30% for non-citizens of the value of immovable freehold and leasehold property. The first BWP 1 million of such value is exempt from transfer duty in case of transfer to a Botswana citizen.

## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 19 April 2024
## Special Economic Zones (SEZs) Development Approval Order incentive
The Income Tax Act was amended through the SEZs Development Approval Order, 2021 to introduce concessionary corporate income tax (CIT) rates for approved business operating in the SEZ regions. Below are the key points of the Order:
### Concessionary CIT rates
The following concessionary CIT rates are applicable for approved business operations in the SEZs:
| Period of operation | CIT rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| For a new business: |  |
| First five years of operations | 5 |
| Thereafter | 10 |
| For an existing business: |  |
| First five years of operations as per Tax Relief Certificate | 5 |
| Thereafter | 10 |
### SEZs in Botswana
### Eligibility criteria
A new business or an existing business engaged in the following activities in the SEZs is eligible to apply for concessionary CIT rates:
### Application for tax relief
It is required to submit an application in the prescribed form to the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development in order to obtain approval under this Order.
## Withholding tax (WHT) on director's fees
The Income Tax Act is amended by inserting the following:
Every person who, being a resident company, makes any payment of director’s fees or similar fees to any person in the person’s capacity as a member of the board of directors of the company shall deduct WHT at following rates:
## Tax amnesty
Tax Amnesty, covering CIT and value-added tax (VAT), was granted to all taxpayers covering the tax periods prior to 1 July 2021. The period to apply for amnesty was from 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022. This tax amnesty provided taxpayers an opportunity to settle outstanding principal tax debt under CIT and VAT assessments due for periods prior to 1 July 2021, with a reciprocal remission of outstanding penalties and interest relating to such amounts. This provided taxpayers a once-off opportunity to regularise CIT and VAT affairs for such historical periods.
### Taxes covered under the tax amnesty
### Tax periods covered
In respect of CIT, all tax periods prior to and including the 2020/2021 tax year (i.e. to 30 June 2021) are covered. In respect of VAT, tax liabilities for all tax periods prior to 1 July 2021 are covered.
### The tax amnesty period
The tax amnesty is available from 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022.
### Penalties and interest eligible for remission
All interest and penalties charged under the VAT Act are eligible for remission.
All interest and penalties charged under the Income Tax Act are eligible for remission, with the exception of:
No fines (charged under Part XIV of the Income Tax Act) will be waived.
### Persons eligible for the tax amnesty
A person shall be eligible for the tax amnesty where such person:
### Persons not eligible for the tax amnesty
A person shall not be eligible for the tax amnesty where such person:
### Amounts not eligible for remission
No interest or penalties paid prior to 30 June 2021 will be remitted.
## VAT
The VAT rate was initially changed from 12% to 14% on 1 April 2021; however, in an effort to reduce the impact of increasing inflation on the Botswana economy, the Botswana government introduced a temporary measure to alleviate the pressure by reducing the rate from 14% to 12% from 3 August 2022 up to 31 March 2023. The VAT rate reverted to 14% from 1 April 2023.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 19 April 2024
If a company's registered office or place of incorporation is in Botswana or if the company is managed and controlled in Botswana, then the company is considered a resident of Botswana.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
PE has been defined in the Income Tax Act only in the limited context of interest, commercial royalty, and management or consultancy fee. However, PE is defined in all the double taxation agreements (DTAs) that Botswana has entered into with other contracting states. The definition of PE in the DTA follows the definition in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 19 April 2024
## Depreciation and depletion
Annual and capital allowances available are as follows.
### Companies other than mining companies
Annual taxation allowances for expenditures incurred on machinery and equipment before 30 June 1982 can be claimed up to 100%. This allowance may be for any proportion of previously unclaimed expenditures. For expenditures incurred on machinery and equipment after 30 June 1982, annual allowances are granted, calculated on cost by the straight-line method on the basis of the expected useful lives of the individual assets. Guidelines are provided for expected useful lives of different categories of assets, which vary from four to ten years. Book depreciation is not required to conform to tax depreciation. The capital allowance claimable on a company motorcar is restricted to a maximum of BWP 175,000.
An initial allowance of 25% of cost is granted on certain industrial buildings. All industrial and commercial buildings (excluding residential properties) are granted a 2.5% annual allowance based on cost or, in the case of an industrial building on which an initial allowance has been claimed, the original cost less the initial allowance.
Balancing allowances and charges are brought to account on the disposal of assets on which allowances have been claimed. Where disposal value of an item of machinery or equipment exceeds the difference between expenditures incurred on the asset and allowances granted, the whole amount is taxable as corporate income or the balancing charge can be offset against further additions of new equipment, thus providing rollover relief. However, there is no rollover relief on motorcars except where the cars are used in a car rental or taxi service business.
### Mining companies
In ascertaining the business income for any tax year from a mining business, there shall be deducted from business income an allowance, to be known as a mining capital allowance, computed in accordance with 100% of the mining capital expenditure made in the year in which such expenditure was incurred, with unlimited carryforward of losses.
## Goodwill
Amortisation of goodwill is not allowed as a tax-deductible expense.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses are not specified in the law. However, pre-incorporation expenses might be disallowed since, generally, expenses incurred when there is no income are not allowed.
## Interest expenses
The maximum net interest expense claimable by a company (except for a variable rate loan stock company; a micro, small, or medium enterprise; or a bank and an insurance company) is 30% of the taxable income or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA).
Disallowed interest, if any, is to be carried forward and claimed in three years. In respect of mining companies, such denied interest is to be carried forward and claimed in ten years.
In addition to the above restriction, interest paid to a non-resident will be allowed as a deduction in the year where the relevant WHT on interest has been remitted to the BURS.
## Bad debt
Bad debts written off and specific provisions for bad debt are allowed as a deduction when computing taxable income. General provisions are not allowed as a deduction.
## Charitable contributions
Donations made to (i) any educational institution recommended by the Ministry of Education, (ii) any sports clubs or sports associations recommended by the Ministry responsible for sports, (iii) the government, in respect of the provision of health facilities, or to any health institution recommended by the Minister responsible for Health and Wellness, or (iv) any other eligible beneficiary as may be prescribed by the Minister, and approved by the Commissioner General, shall be deducted when arriving at taxable income, limited to 20% of the chargeable income.
## Fines and penalties
Penalties and associated interest are not allowed as a deduction.
## Taxes
Any taxes paid are specifically disallowed in computing a company’s taxable income.
## Other significant items
An allowance is granted for dwelling houses erected for employees by a business other than a mining business. The amount of the allowance is the lower of cost or BWP 25,000 for each dwelling house constructed.
A deduction of 200% of the cost of an approved training expenditure is allowed, provided such expenses do not include any expenses that the taxpayer is entitled to reimbursement from under the Vocational Training (Structured Training) Regulations (TRL).
Companies with shareholders having 5% or more of equity, either directly or indirectly, are classified as close companies, and there are additional tax regulations in respect of these shareholders.
Small companies, that is resident private companies whose gross income does not exceed BWP 300,000, may elect that the company be taxed as a partnership.
Expenses incurred by the company for having its shares listed on the Botswana Stock Exchange are deductible in determining the chargeable income of the company.
## Net operating losses
Losses may be carried forward for five years, with the exception of mining and prospecting operations, for which there is no time limit. There is no allowance for carrybacks.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Royalties, interest, and service fees paid to foreign affiliates are generally deductible, provided such amounts are at arm’s length and WHT is paid.
In the case of a mining company, head office expenses allowed as a deduction in ascertaining gross revenue from mineral licence shall be limited to 1.5% of gross income for the year of assessment, and any excess of such expense above the limit shall be treated and taxed as a dividend.
Where the interest rate on a loan made by a foreign-based mining company to an affiliate mining company resident in Botswana is considered by the commissioner to be in excess of the market rate, such excess will be disallowed as a deduction and taxed as a dividend.

# Botswana
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 19 April 2024
There are no concessions for group taxation, other than for wholly owned subsidiary companies of the Botswana Development Corporation Limited (BDC).
BDC was established in 1970 to be the country's main agency for commercial and industrial development. The government of Botswana owns 100% of the issued share capital of the Corporation.
Where in any tax year a wholly owned subsidiary of BDC has incurred any assessed loss, such member may, during the current tax year, by notice in writing to the Commissioner General, elect that the whole or part of such assessed loss shall be deducted in ascertaining the chargeable income of one or more of the other wholly owned subsidiaries.
## Transfer pricing
Botswana introduced transfer pricing (TP) regulations with effect from 1 July 2019. Such regulations are applicable on transactions with non-resident connected persons. TP regulations shall not apply where a person resident in Botswana engages directly or indirectly in any transaction, operation, or scheme with a connected person resident in Botswana, except where one or both of such companies are International Financial Service Centre (IFSC) companies.
All the transactions between related parties are to be recorded at arm's length. The Minister is to prescribe whether the conditions of a transaction are consistent with the arm's-length principle, and required documentation is to be kept by the parties in respect of such transaction.
Non-compliance shall have severe penalties. The penalties will be the greater of 200% of the amount of tax that would have been avoided/payable or a fine of BWP 10,000.
Further, a penalty not exceeding BWP 500,000 will be imposed on failure to furnish the Commissioner with the TP documentation.
## Interest restriction
Rules relating to claiming of interest were amended with effect from 1 July 2019. The maximum net interest expense claimable by a company (except for a variable rate loan stock company, a micro, small, or medium enterprise, or a bank and an insurance company) is 30% of the taxable income or EBITDA.
Disallowed interest, if any, is to be carried forward and claimed in three years. In respect of mining companies, such denied interest is to be carried forward and claimed in ten years.
In addition to the above, in case of an IFSC company, where an amount of foreign debt interest due to a foreign controller or a connected person of a foreign controller is allowable as a deduction in a particular tax year and, at any time during that tax year, the total foreign debt exceeds the foreign equity product for that year, then the amount of foreign debt interest ascertained in accordance with the following formula will be disallowed:
I x (A/B) x (C/365)
A = Amount of the excess of the total foreign debt over the foreign equity product.
B = The total foreign debt.
C = The number of days in that tax year during which the total foreign debt exceeded the foreign equity product by that amount.
I = The foreign debt interest.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no CFC rules in Botswana.

## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 19 April 2024
## Foreign tax relief
A tax credit is granted unilaterally where amounts received by a Botswana resident have been subject to taxation in a foreign country and in cases where a double taxation agreement (DTA) has been concluded. A tax credit is also granted where income from a source within Botswana has been subject to a WHT. The amount of the relief is limited to the lesser of the tax paid by deduction and that normally paid in Botswana on such income.
## Tax treaties
Botswana has DTAs with Barbados, Belgium, China, Czech Republic, eSwatini, France, India, Ireland, Kenya, Lesotho, Luxembourg, Malawi, Malta, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Russia, Seychelles, South Africa, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 19 April 2024
The following developments are effective from 1 July 2021:
## Revised filing obligations for individuals for tax year 2021 and 2022
The Commissioner General of the Botswana Unified Revenue Service (BURS) has confirmed that tax returns are not required to be submitted by individuals:
The above shall remain in place until the Commissioner General advises otherwise.
The BURS has expanded e-services to personal income tax (PIT) for individuals.
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The VAT rate was initially changed from 12% to 14% on 1 April 2021; however, in an effort to reduce the impact of increasing inflation on the Botswana economy, the Botswana government introduced a temporary measure to alleviate the pressure by reducing the rate from 14% to 12% from 3 August 2022 up to 31 March 2023. The VAT rate reverted to 14% with effect from 1 April 2023.

An employee who is employed on a commission basis could be in this position.
Where a gratuity is not provided to the employee, deductions for contributions to an approved retirement benefit scheme are allowable up to a maximum of 15% of earned income.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 19 April 2024
## Employment income
Expatriate employees are taxable on salary and on any overseas allowances, wherever payment is made. Living and housing allowances, tax reimbursements, and the value of benefits, such as free accommodation and the use of motor vehicles, are included in taxable income. All employment income is subject to PAYE. However, airfares and medical costs borne by the employer for the employee, spouse, and dependent children, and provided in the terms of the employee's contract, are not taxable.
For individuals' contracts of employment signed on or after 1 July 1999, any gratuities paid are taxable to the extent of two-thirds of such gratuity. The remaining one-third is tax free. The percentage parameters are still 25% of gross salary for the first contract, 27.5% for the second contract, and 30% for the third and subsequent contracts. Contracts normally run two to three years.
## Capital gains
## Dividend income
The gross income of a resident citizen individual includes any dividend income from an investment made outside Botswana. Dividend income from a foreign source is taxed at 10%.
Dividends payable by a Botswana resident to a non-resident is subject to 10% WHT.
## Interest income
The gross income of a resident citizen individual includes any interest income from an investment made outside Botswana. Interest income in such cases is included in the individuals' gross income and taxed accordingly.
Interest income for any resident individual accruing from any banking institution or building society in Botswana is exempt from tax up to a limit of BWP 7,800. Interest payments to residents are subject to 10% WHT. Where a resident individual has paid WHT on interest that accrued from a bank or building society, this shall be the final charge to tax, and the interest shall not form part of the assessable income of that resident individual.
Interest payable by a Botswana resident to a non-resident is subject to 15% WHT.
## Royalty income
Commercial royalties payable by a Botswana resident to a non-resident are subject to 15% WHT.
## Fee income
Management and consultancy fees payable by a Botswana resident to a non-resident are subject to 15% WHT. Similarly, entertainment fees are subject to 10% WHT.
