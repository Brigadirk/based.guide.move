## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 29 November 2024
Since no corporate income, capital gains, payroll, or other direct taxes are currently imposed on corporations in the Cayman Islands, corporate residency is not relevant in the context of Cayman Islands taxation.
Entities engaged in 'scheduled' trade and business in the Cayman Islands (as defined in the Trade & Business Licensing Law) are required to have a trade and business licence. Effecting and concluding contracts in the Cayman Islands and exercising, in the Cayman Islands, powers necessary for the carrying on of a business outside the Cayman Islands is generally not considered to be engaging in trade and business in the Cayman Islands.

# Cayman Islands
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 29 November 2024
Since no corporate income, capital gains, or other taxes are imposed on corporations in the Cayman Islands, tax incentives are not relevant in the context of Cayman Islands taxation. However, Cayman entities carrying on business outside the Cayman Islands can register as 'exempted companies' (i.e. a company formed primarily to do business outside of the Cayman Islands and subject to certain requirements) and can apply under the Tax Concessions Law for an undertaking to be issued by the Governor-in-Council (i.e. the Cayman Islands government) exempting such company from any tax on profits, income, gains, or appreciation that might be introduced in the period of 20 years following the grant of such concessions. The concession is extendable for a further ten years after expiry. 'Exempted limited liability partnerships' (i.e. certain partnerships formed primarily to do business outside of the Cayman Islands) can apply under the Exempted Limited Partnership Law for a similar concession that is for 50 years (rather than 20 years).

# Cayman Islands
## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 29 November 2024
## Tax information reporting
The Cayman Islands currently has 36 signed Bilateral Agreements, of which 29 are in force. Please refer to the Tax Information Authority’s website (*[www.ditc.ky/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/International\_Exchange\_of\_Information\_Instruments.pdf](https://www.ditc.ky/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/International_Exchange_of_Information_Instruments.pdf)*) for the latest list of Bilateral Agreements.
The Cayman Islands agreed with the United Kingdom (UK) government to implement the Savings Directive, and so the Reporting of Savings Income Information (European Union or EU) Law (2007 Revision) came into force, setting out a reporting regime whereby Cayman paying agents making interest payments to individuals who are tax resident in an EU member state may have to report interest paid. The Cayman Tax Information Authority receives or facilitates submission of such information reporting.
The Cayman Islands will comply with the regulations set forth under the Common Reporting Standard (CRS). The country recognises that the regulations are a key component of the Cayman Islands’ implementation of automatic exchange of financial account information in accordance with the internationally agreed standard. The Cayman Islands Tax Information Authority updated guidance on CRS in Q1 of 2017, including updated Cayman Islands entity and individual self-certification forms and other information, which took effect as of 1 January 2016. The Cayman Islands took a similar approach to CRS as with the UK and United States (US) Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) (*see below*), including certain due diligence and reporting obligations.
## Intergovernmental agreements (IGAs)
The Cayman Islands and the United States signed their Agreement to Improve International Tax Compliance and to Implement the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act based on the Model 1 IGA in 2013. To accommodate the non-direct tax system of the Cayman Islands, the IGA is a model 1B (non-reciprocal) IGA. The Cayman Islands and the United Kingdom also signed their Agreement to Improve International Tax Compliance, which is based on the US Model 1 IGA in 2013. Under these Agreements, Cayman Islands financial institutions must provide the Cayman Islands competent authority with the required information. The Cayman Islands competent authority forwards that information to the competent authority in the relevant jurisdiction. Please refer to the Tax Information Authority’s website for access to the Agreements and related Guidance Notes ([www.ditc.ky/fatca/](https://www.ditc.ky/fatca/)).
## Country-by-country reporting (CbCR)
The Cayman Islands has entered into CbCR as part of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan set forth by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). With the goal of promoting transparency and accuracy in reporting, CbCR requires multinational enterprises to include detailed financial and tax information relating to the global allocation of their income and taxes, among other indicators of economic activity.
The Cayman Islands’ competent authority will annually exchange, on an automatic basis, the CbC report received from each reporting entity that is resident for tax purposes in the Cayman Islands with all such other competent authorities of jurisdictions with respect to which the Cayman Islands has an agreement in effect and in which, on the basis of the information in the CbC report, one or more constituent entities of the multinational group of the reporting entity are either resident for tax purposes or are subject to tax with respect to the business carried out through a Cayman Islands permanent establishment (PE).
CbCR is in effect for fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2016. The due date for reporting is 12 months after the fiscal year-end and notification is required no later than the last day of the reporting fiscal year.
