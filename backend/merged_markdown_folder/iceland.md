## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
Resident corporations pay tax on their worldwide income less operating expenses. Deductible operating expenses are comprised of all the expenses and costs needed to provide, insure, and maintain income.
Corporate income tax (CIT) for limited liability companies (LLCs) and limited partnership companies is assessed at a rate of 21%. CIT for other types of legal entities (e.g. partnerships) is assessed at a rate of 37.6%.
Non-resident corporations receiving payments for services or business operations carried out in Iceland, as well as corporations operating a permanent establishment (PE) in Iceland or receiving a profit from such establishments, are subject to CIT for their Icelandic income at the same rate as applies to resident corporations.

## Taxable period
The tax year is the calendar year. However, in certain circumstances and upon application, the Internal Revenue Directorate can allow a different fiscal year from the calendar year.
## Tax returns
The final assessment must be completed no later than ten months after the end of the income year. Tax assessments for corporations will be available at the end of October.
## Payment of tax
Advance tax payments are due on the first day of every month, except January and October. Corporations pay income tax in advance, which is in turn deducted from the final tax assessment in October each year. The advance tax is collected in the months of February to September and amounts to 8.5% of the income tax on each due date. In total, the advance tax payments amount to 68% of the income tax. Any deficit remaining when final tax is assessed must be paid in equal instalments by 1 November and 1 December.
Income tax payments on dividends and interest income are due every quarter. Due dates are 20 January, 20 April, 20 July, and 20 October, and the final deadline for payment is 15 days later.
## Tax audit process
The Icelandic tax authorities select returns for examination using a variety of methods. Some returns are selected based on electronic selection; some are selected based on a formal supervisory plan. A tax audit can also be traced to information obtained by the tax authorities through efforts to identify participants of tax avoidance transactions.
The examination generally takes place by formal, written communication. The rules of the procedure are very strict, and the process can take from a few weeks to a year/years.
Appeal rights involve two administrative levels and also two judiciary levels.
## Statute of limitations
Tax authorities in Iceland have the right to reassess tax returns for CIT six years prior to the year of the assessment (i.e. the statutory period of limitation is six years). The statutory period only reaches a maximum of two years in time if tax returns have been filled out properly and all necessary information presented for tax authorities to establish a correct assessment. This means that in the year 2024, tax authorities can, in theory, reassess the company's tax back to income year 2018.
However, the limitation has been prolonged to ten years in case of income and assets in low-tax jurisdictions.

## Pension fund contributions
Every employee from 16 to 70 years of age and every employer must contribute to a pension fund. The minimum contribution is 15.5% (4% for employees and 11.5% for employers) of all employees’ and self-employed persons’ remunerations. The employee’s contribution (4%) is deducted from their taxable income.
In addition to the minimum contribution, an employee can contribute and deduct up to an additional 4% from one's taxable income, as long as the contribution is used to increase one's pension rights. This additional contribution can be paid into a private pension fund.
Should the employer’s contribution to the pension fund exceed 12.5% of the employee’s remuneration, and also exceed ISK 2 million per year, the excess shall be calculated as taxable income.
By supplying a completed A1 (former E-101) certificate, individuals from European Economic Area (EEA) member countries are not bound to contribute to an Icelandic pension fund. An employer of an individual supplying an A1 certificate is subject to a lower rate of social security contribution. Those exemptions are dependent on equivalent payments being made in the individual’s country of residence.
## Contribution to the elderly fund
Iceland maintains a special fund for the elderly, aside from pension contributions. Every taxable individual from the age of 16 to 69 must make a contribution to the elderly fund. The payment for the assessment year 2024 is ISK 13,749.
## Consumption taxes
### Valued-added tax (VAT)
VAT is a consumption tax levied on all stages of domestic business transactions. VAT is levied on all goods and services, as well as on the imports of goods and services, unless specific exemptions apply.
The general VAT rate is 24%.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are currently no net wealth/worth taxes in Iceland.
## Inheritance tax
Inheritance tax is 10%.
No inheritance tax is levied on the first ISK 6,203,409 of an inheritance. If the inheritance is paid out before death, a flat rate of 10% is levied on the total amount without any minimum allowance.
The tax base is the net value of all financial assets and properties owned by the deceased at the time of death (after debts and expenses have been deducted). The value is decided by the market value of the asset in question. Property value is based on the official Property Register price.
If assets are left to a surviving spouse or cohabitant, no inheritance tax is levied. The same applies to any pension that the inheritors receive.
## Property taxes
A municipal property tax is applied on real estate in Iceland.
## Customs duties
Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland are members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). The EFTA Convention established a free trade area among its member states. In addition, the EFTA states have jointly concluded free trade agreements with a number of countries in Central and Eastern Europe as well as in the Mediterranean region, Mexico, and Singapore. Also, three of the EFTA states (Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway) entered into the Agreement on the European Economic Area in 1992. The current contracting parties are, in addition to the three EFTA states, the European Community (EC) and the 25 EC member states. Iceland also has a bilateral agreement with its two neighbouring countries, Greenland and Faeroe Islands.
When individuals move to Iceland, household inventory, as defined in regulation 630/2008, is duty free.
Travellers can bring clothing and other travel gear for personal use and up to 10 kg of food not exceeding the value of ISK 25,000. Those who intend to dwell in this country for a year or a shorter period for employment, study, or travel may import a vehicle registered abroad without having to pay duty or import charges. At the end of this period, the importer of a vehicle must either have completed its customs clearance or exported the vehicle.
Among goods that are subject to import restrictions are the following types of products:
## Stamp taxes
Stamp duty is levied on documents regarding change of ownership of real estate and land registered in Iceland.
The stamp duty rate is 0.8% if the rightful owner is an individual.
When issuing deeds and purchase agreements of real estate and land, a 0.8% stamp duty is levied on the officially registered value of the real estate. The stamp duty rate for individuals buying their first real estate is 0.4%.
All other documents bear no stamp duty.
## Contribution to the National Broadcasting Service
Every taxable individual from the age of 16 to 69 must pay a contribution to the National Broadcasting Service. The payment for the assessment year 2024 is ISK 20,900.

## Overview
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
Iceland, a European island, is a country located in the North Atlantic Ocean. The Icelandic population is about 360,000, and the capital city is Reykjavík. The currency is the Icelandic króna (ISK), and the official language is Icelandic.
Althingi, Iceland’s present-day parliament, is one of the world’s oldest existing national assemblies. Founded at Thingvellir in 930 AD, the country’s democratic system of government was completely unique in its day. In 1262, Iceland came under the Norwegian king and, later, at the end of the 14th century, Iceland was brought under Danish rule. Throughout the next two centuries, Iceland was crippled by rampant foreign profiteering, beset by international pirates, and subject to an increasing number of natural disasters. The 18th century marked the most tragic age in Iceland's history. The population sank to about 35,000. The 19th and 20th centuries are marked as stepping stones towards independence, and by 1918 Denmark had recognised Iceland as a fully sovereign state united with Denmark under a common king. Finally, Iceland became an independent republic on 17 June 1944 and has remained as such to this day. Its sovereign is the president, who is voted in general election every four years. The parliament, Althingi, is comprised of 63 individuals voted in general election every four years.
The fish industry (fishing and processing) and the tourism industry are the main economic activities in Iceland. Other important activities include aluminium smelting and agriculture.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is a consumption tax levied on all stages of domestic business transactions. VAT is levied on all goods and services, as well as on the imports of goods and services, unless specific exemptions apply.
### VAT rates
The general VAT rate is 24%.
The following goods and services are subject to a reduced VAT rate of 11%:
Certain services and goods are zero-rated, which means that there is, in fact, no VAT charge. Zero-rated VAT mainly applies to exported goods and services provided abroad.
### VAT entities
Businesses engaged in the trade of taxable goods and services for business purposes must register and collect VAT.
### Services exempt from VAT
The VAT Act details certain services that are exempt from the tax, such as healthcare services, social services, the operation of schools, various education services, cultural activities, athletic activities, public transportation, postal services, sale of real estate (not including the rental of hotel and guest accommodation), rental of car parking lot, insurance activities, services of financial banks (as well as securities trading), lotteries and betting pools, artistic activities, funeral services, and all services of ministers of the church.
Those selling taxable goods and services totalling less than 2 million Icelandic króna (ISK) per 12-month period are also exempt from collecting and remitting VAT.
### Agent for non-resident parties
Non-residents who are engaged in taxable transactions in Iceland but are neither domiciled nor have permanent residence in Iceland must appoint a VAT agent with residence in Iceland to report on their behalf. Both parties are liable for the VAT payments (responsible for ensuring remittance of VAT). If a non-resident does not appoint a VAT agent, the purchaser of the services/goods is responsible for paying the VAT (reverse charge).
If the non-resident is only providing e-services, one can apply for an Icelandic ID number to report/pay the VAT oneself (i.e. without a VAT agent).
### VAT accounting periods and due dates
VAT is generally filed and paid on a bimonthly basis. The due date for payment of VAT is one month and five days after the end of the settlement period. For example, the due date for the January and February payments is 5 April.
If the VAT is not paid on the due date, a 1% penalty charge is added for every day up to a total of 10%. Late penalty interests also apply as of one month after the due date.
A special fee for late filing, ISK 5,000, applies if the tax authorities have estimated the VAT due to non-filing.
### VAT reimbursement
Foreign enterprises, which are neither residents of Iceland nor have a PE, may obtain reimbursement of VAT paid on goods and taxable services that have been purchased or imported for the commercial purposes of such enterprises in Iceland.
Such reimbursement can be effected to foreign enterprises that would be subject to registration in Iceland according to Article 5 and Article 6 of the VAT Act if the enterprises in question were engaged in such business in Iceland. This means that such enterprises as travel agencies, insurance companies, banks, and other financial institutions cannot obtain such reimbursement.
Another prerequisite is that the enterprise shall neither have sold goods nor taxable services in Iceland during the period to which the application refers.
Parties domiciled abroad can get partial VAT reimbursement on goods they have bought in Iceland if they take them abroad with them within three months from the date of purchase. They then must provide the goods, along with any necessary documents, to the appropriate reimbursement company or to the customs authorities on the date of departure, and the purchase price must amount to at least ISK 4,000.
## Customs duties
The Directorate of Customs controls import, transit, and export and also collects duties, taxes, and various state revenue. The general rule is that import duties (customs, excise duties, VAT, and various other charges) are to be paid on imported goods unless otherwise stated in the law. For import of some products, other conditions, such as an import licence, may need to be submitted.
Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland are members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). The EFTA Convention established a free trade area among its member states. In addition, the EFTA states have jointly concluded free trade agreements with a number of countries in Central and Eastern Europe as well as in the Mediterranean region, Mexico, and Singapore. Also, three of the EFTA states (Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway) entered into the Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA) in 1992. The current contracting parties are, in addition to the three EFTA states, the European Community (EC) and the 25 EC member states. Iceland also has a bilateral agreement with its two neighbouring countries, Greenland and Faeroe Islands.
## Excise tax
There is no excise tax in Iceland.
## Property taxes
A municipal property tax is applied annually on the assessed value of real estate in Iceland.
## Stamp taxes
Stamp duty is levied on documents regarding change of ownership of real estate and land. However, stamp duty is not applicable when the change of ownership is related to a merger or division of a company.
The stamp duty rate is 0.8% and 1.6%, depending on whether the rightful owner is an individual or a legal entity.
When issuing deeds and purchase agreements of real estate and land, the stamp duty is levied on the officially registered value of the real estate and land.
All other documents bear no stamp duty.
## Turnover taxes
There was an agricultural charge of 1.2% of agricultural turnover, but it was abolished as of tax assessment 2017 (i.e. for turnover in 2016).
## Payroll taxes
There are no payroll taxes applicable other than those that apply for social security contributions, pension contributions, and rehabilitation fund (*see below*).
## Social security contributions
Employers are responsible for social security contribution. The general rate is 6.35%. An additional social security contribution for fishermen is 0.65%. The social security contribution for taxpayers who have submitted the A1 form is 0.425%.
## Pension contributions
The minimum mandatory contribution to a pension fund is 15.5% of total wages from age 16 to 70.
Wage agreements cover payments into pension funds. The general rule is that the wage earner pays 4% of one's total wages and the matching contribution of the wage payer is 11.5%, making the total contribution 15.5%.
An employer’s additional contribution into private pension funds is 2% against a maximum 4% contribution from the employee.
## Rehabilitation fund
Employers must pay 0.1% of all salaries to VIRK, The Icelandic Rehabilitation Fund.
## Taxes on natural resources
### Excise duties on fuel
An excise duty for liquid fossil fuels is paid to the treasury. In this context, liquid fossil fuels are oils and petrol.
The duty is levied as ISK per litre, as follows:
| Excise duty | ISK per litre for the year 2023 | ISK per litre for the year 2024 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| General excise duty on petrol | 32.55 | 33.70 |
| Specific excise duty on petrol | 52.45 | 54.30 |
| Excise duty on oils | 72.85 | 75.40 |
### Tax on electricity/hot water
A special tax is collected from parties selling electricity and/or hot water at the last stage of trading (i.e. sales to users). Parties are exempted from the tax if the sale amount is less than ISK 500,000 per year.
### Carbohydrate tax
The tax is levied as ISK per litre or kg, as follows:
| Carbohydrate tax | ISK per litre or kg for the year 2023 | ISK per litre or kg for the year 2024 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gas and diesel oil | 13.00/litre | 13.45/litre |
| Petrol | 11.50/litre | 11.70/litre |
| Fuel oil | 15.95/kg | 16.50/kg |
| Petroleum gas | 14.15/kg | 14.65/kg |
## Bank taxes
Bank tax was abolished as of 1 April 2020.
## Financial Activities Tax (FAT)
A 5.5% tax is levied on all salary payments made by financial institutions, including insurance companies. The tax is collected monthly.
### Additional FAT
An additional 6% is levied and collected on total salary payments in excess of ISK 1 billion. This tax is paid by the same entities that are subject to the general FAT.
## Accommodation tax
Those who sell accommodation that is subject to VAT are liable to collect and return a tax for each sold night, as follows:
## National Broadcasting Fee
There is a National Broadcasting Fee of ISK 20,900 per year. The fee shall be paid by all taxable individuals from the age of 16 to 70 years old. Additionally, all domestic parties are required to pay the tax.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year for individuals equals the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Individuals must file their tax returns before the end of 14 March in the consecutive year after the tax year. Extensions may be granted for up to five days.
## Payment of tax
Individual income taxes are withheld at source each month. Any difference between income tax withheld and the assessed income tax (national and municipal) is refunded, increased by 2.5% of the difference; any deficit is collected, increased by 2.5%, on five due dates each year. The due dates are the first day of July to December. Payments must be made within 30 days from the due date.
### Withholding requirements for sale of property, dividends, interest, and royalties
Gains from sale of property and royalties are not subject to WHT in Iceland.
Dividends and interest income are subject to WHT withheld at source and filed/returned on due date. The payment periods are three months, January to March, April to June, July to September, and October to December. Due dates are 20 April, 20 July, 20 October, and 20 January. Payments must be made within 15 days from the due dates.
## Tax audit process
Individuals receive a pre-drafted tax return from the tax authorities to be confirmed or corrected.
Dividends and interest income are capital gains and liable to WHT. Rental income, capital gains, and other income from assets are not liable to WHT.
When the tax return deadline has expired, the Internal Revenue Directorate calculates a taxpayer’s income tax according to the tax return submitted. WHT on salary and capital income is deducted from the final tax assessment. If these items are higher than the final tax assessment, the difference is used towards tax debt repayment and/or the taxpayer is refunded.
The final tax assessment for each year should be completed no later than ten months after the end of the income year, but, in general, the assessment will be finalised on 31 May.
Most of the filing process is electronic. The assessment notice is also electronic in most cases, but individuals can also file in paper. Tax authorities place a general notice of the assessment in the local gazette.
A complaint regarding the assessment can be sent to the Internal Revenue Directorate within 60 days, and the final ruling of that authority can be appealed to the State Internal Revenue Board within three months.
## Statute of limitations
Tax authorities in Iceland have the right to reassess tax returns for six years prior to the year of the assessment, i.e. the statutory period of limitation is six years. The statutory period only reaches a maximum of two years in time if tax returns have been filled out properly and all necessary information presented for tax authorities to establish a correct assessment. This means that in the year 2024, tax authorities can, in theory, reassess the tax of individuals back to income year 2018.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income

Resident individuals are fully liable for tax payments in Iceland on their worldwide income.
Non-resident individuals staying temporarily in Iceland, who derive income from employment during their stay, are subject to national income tax on such income. They are also subject to municipal income tax in the same manner as residents. Other non-resident individuals are subject to national income tax and municipal income tax on their income from Iceland. Non-residents are allowed the same deductions for expenses as residents.
## Personal income tax rates
Personal income is a net income tax base with a progressive state income tax rate and municipal tax.
| Step | Monthly income (ISK\*) | Income tax (%) | Municipal tax\*\* (%) | Total tax (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | On the first ISK 446,136 (ISK 5,353,634 per year) | 16.55 | 14.93 | 31.48 |
| 2 | On the next ISK 806,364 (ISK 9,676,368 per year) | 23.05 | 14.93 | 37.98 |
| 3 | On any income over ISK 1,252,501 (ISK 15,030,014 per year) | 31.35 | 14.93 | 46.28 |
\* Icelandic króna
\*\* The municipal income tax withheld at source is 14.93% but varies from 12.44% to 14.93% in the final assessment, based on the decision of each municipality.
Icelandic-source income in the form of remuneration to non-resident directors and committee members, grants, or remuneration for independent personal services and art performances is taxed by assessment at a rate of 20% plus the average municipal income tax rate, which is 14.93% in 2023.
## Capital income tax
The tax rate on an individual’s capital income is 22%.
As of 1 January 2020, payments to authors from rightholder's associations are considered capital income and taxed at 22% after they have been made available to the public.
As of 1 July 2020, individuals with limited tax liability are not required to withhold tax of capital gains from the sale of shares.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
Dividends paid to a resident company are subject to 22% WHT. Dividends paid to a non-resident company are subject to 20% WHT. The final taxation of dividends paid to a company within the EEA is nil, as WHT will be reimbursed in the year following payment upon filing a tax return.
Interest paid to a resident company is subject to 22% WHT, and interest paid to a non-resident company is subject to 12% WHT.
Gross royalties paid to a non-resident are taxable at the standard 22% CIT rate and subject to withholding.
Iceland has signed a draft of a treaty with both Andorra and Australia that are expected to be ratified in coming years.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Inventory valuation
The valuation method of raw materials and finished goods is on a first in first out (FIFO) basis or via the average cost method. When computing the value of produced goods, both direct and indirect production cost must be taken into account. For tax purposes, inventories can be further written down at a rate of 5% of calculated value.
Last in first out (LIFO) is not permitted.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are treated as taxable income in the year that transfer of ownership occurs and, as such, taxed as part of the general corporate income. Capital gains are generally not subject to withholding tax (WHT). There are rules that allow full deduction of net capital gains from the sale of shares, so, in general, corporations are not subject to taxation on capital gains from sale of shares.
## Dividend income
Dividend income is treated as taxable income and taxed as a part of corporate income. There are extensive rules that allow full deduction of the dividend, so, in general, corporations are not subject to taxation on dividends. Dividends are subject to WHT (currently 21%), which is a temporary payment towards the final tax assessment. However, dividends paid between resident limited liability corporations are not subject to WHT.
## Interest income
Interest income derived from bank deposits, mutual and investment funds, bonds, or other financial deeds; any kind of exchange rate profit; and any other income from monetary assets are subject to 22% tax.
Interest income of foreign parties is subject to 13% WHT in Iceland.
## Royalty income
Royalties paid to residents are taxed at the standard CIT rate. Gross royalties paid to a non-resident are taxable at the standard 22% CIT rate and subject to withholding.
## Profit from derivatives
Profits from derivatives are treated as profits/losses from sales and are subject to 22% tax. Losses from derivatives can be used against profits from derivatives within the calendar year.
## Foreign income
Income earned abroad is generally taxed as a part of corporate income since a resident company is subject to CIT on its worldwide income.
Controlled foreign company (CFC) rules stipulate that profits of companies in low-tax jurisdictions must pay income tax of such a profit in direct proportion to shares, regardless of distribution. A low-tax jurisdiction is defined as a jurisdiction where the CIT rate is less than two-thirds of Iceland’s CIT rate (i.e. 14%, being two-thirds of 21%). *See Controlled foreign companies (CFCs) in the [Group taxation](iceland/corporate/group-taxation.html) section for more information*.
Double taxation of foreign income is avoided either through tax treaties or domestic tax provisions.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Pension fund contributions
Every employee from 16 to 70 years of age and every employer must contribute to a pension fund. The minimum contribution is 15.5% (4% for employees and 11.5% for employers) of all employees’ and self-employed persons’ remunerations. The employee’s contribution (4%) is deducted from their taxable income.
In addition to the minimum contribution, an employee can contribute and deduct up to an additional 4% from one's taxable income, as long as the contribution is used to increase one's pension rights. This additional contribution can be paid into a private pension fund.
Should the employer’s contribution to the pension fund exceed 12.5% of the employee’s remuneration, and also exceed ISK 2 million per year, the excess shall be calculated as taxable income.
By supplying a completed A1 (former E-101) certificate, individuals from European Economic Area (EEA) member countries are not bound to contribute to an Icelandic pension fund. An employer of an individual supplying an A1 certificate is subject to a lower rate of social security contribution. Those exemptions are dependent on equivalent payments being made in the individual’s country of residence.
## Contribution to the elderly fund
Iceland maintains a special fund for the elderly, aside from pension contributions. Every taxable individual from the age of 16 to 69 must make a contribution to the elderly fund. The payment for the assessment year 2024 is ISK 13,749.
## Consumption taxes
### Valued-added tax (VAT)
VAT is a consumption tax levied on all stages of domestic business transactions. VAT is levied on all goods and services, as well as on the imports of goods and services, unless specific exemptions apply.
The general VAT rate is 24%.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are currently no net wealth/worth taxes in Iceland.
## Inheritance tax
Inheritance tax is 10%.
No inheritance tax is levied on the first ISK 6,203,409 of an inheritance. If the inheritance is paid out before death, a flat rate of 10% is levied on the total amount without any minimum allowance.
The tax base is the net value of all financial assets and properties owned by the deceased at the time of death (after debts and expenses have been deducted). The value is decided by the market value of the asset in question. Property value is based on the official Property Register price.
If assets are left to a surviving spouse or cohabitant, no inheritance tax is levied. The same applies to any pension that the inheritors receive.
## Property taxes
A municipal property tax is applied on real estate in Iceland.
## Customs duties
Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland are members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). The EFTA Convention established a free trade area among its member states. In addition, the EFTA states have jointly concluded free trade agreements with a number of countries in Central and Eastern Europe as well as in the Mediterranean region, Mexico, and Singapore. Also, three of the EFTA states (Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway) entered into the Agreement on the European Economic Area in 1992. The current contracting parties are, in addition to the three EFTA states, the European Community (EC) and the 25 EC member states. Iceland also has a bilateral agreement with its two neighbouring countries, Greenland and Faeroe Islands.
When individuals move to Iceland, household inventory, as defined in regulation 630/2008, is duty free.
Travellers can bring clothing and other travel gear for personal use and up to 10 kg of food not exceeding the value of ISK 25,000. Those who intend to dwell in this country for a year or a shorter period for employment, study, or travel may import a vehicle registered abroad without having to pay duty or import charges. At the end of this period, the importer of a vehicle must either have completed its customs clearance or exported the vehicle.
Among goods that are subject to import restrictions are the following types of products:
## Stamp taxes
Stamp duty is levied on documents regarding change of ownership of real estate and land registered in Iceland.
The stamp duty rate is 0.8% if the rightful owner is an individual.
When issuing deeds and purchase agreements of real estate and land, a 0.8% stamp duty is levied on the officially registered value of the real estate. The stamp duty rate for individuals buying their first real estate is 0.4%.
All other documents bear no stamp duty.
## Contribution to the National Broadcasting Service
Every taxable individual from the age of 16 to 69 must pay a contribution to the National Broadcasting Service. The payment for the assessment year 2024 is ISK 20,900.

## Thin capitalisation rules
An amendment has been made to the Icelandic Income Tax Act no. 90/2003. The rules, which are applicable from the income year 2019, state that interest deduction limitation rules do not apply when the whole company group bears full and unlimited tax liability in Iceland and the companies meet the requirements for joint taxation in Iceland.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
Deductible operating expenses are comprised of all the expenses and costs needed to provide, insure, and maintain income (e.g. interest expense, employee expense, travel expense, insurance expense).
## Depreciation
| Assets | Depreciation rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Ships, ship equipment, and personal vehicles | 10 to 20\* |
| Aircraft and accessories | 10 to 20\* |
| Heavy machinery, industrial machinery, and equipment | 10 to 30\* |
| Office equipment | 20 to 35\* |
| Machinery, equipment, and vehicles that are not covered in the above categories | 20 to 35\* |
| Residential, commercial, and office accommodation | 1 to 3 |
| Factory buildings, garages, warehouses, etc. | 3 to 6 |
| Greenhouses, piers, and lots connected to these assets | 6 to 8 |
| Boreholes, powerlines, and temporary work camps | 7.5 to 10 |
| Purchased proprietary rights for ideas and trademarks, such as copyrights, publishing rights, information rights, patents, and logos | 15 to 20 |
| Purchased goodwill | 10 to 20 |
\* The depreciation base for these assets is their purchase value less earlier depreciations (book value).
The method used to calculate depreciation is the straight-line method.
## Goodwill
Purchased goodwill can be written down at 10% to 20% per year.
## Start-up expenses
Purchased fishing rights (quotas) cannot be depreciated.
Start-up costs for agricultural production rights can be depreciated without revaluation over five consecutive years. The following assets can be depreciated in full in the year they are initiated or paid with steady payments over five years:
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are deductible, provided that the loan was taken for business purposes. It shall be kept in mind that interest limitation rules apply between related parties if certain conditions are fulfilled. *See Thin capitalisation in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section for more information*.
## Bad debt
As a general rule, 5% of bad debt can be written off. Certain conditions must be met in order to write off a higher percentage of bad debts.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions at up to 1.5% of total income are deductible.
## Pension expenses
Payments to obligatory pension funds for employees at a minimum of 11.5% of wages (or according to the minimum contribution in a collective agreement) are deductible.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are not deductible.
## Taxes
Taxes levied on business profit are not considered to be deductible; consequently, CIT is not deductible. However, social security contributions and other labour taxes are deductible.
## Net operating losses
Operating losses may be deducted from income from business and independent economic activity. Tax losses can be carried forward for ten years and utilised over ten years from the year that the loss was incurred.
No carryback of losses is allowed.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
An Icelandic corporation can claim a deduction for royalties, management fees, and similar payments made to foreign affiliates, provided that such amounts are made on an arm’s-length basis and reflect services received. Interest at normal commercial rates paid to foreign affiliates generally will be allowed as a deduction on the condition that the loan terms are comparable to those that would have been agreed upon by unrelated parties.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
Companies may opt for consolidated taxation if a company owns at least a 90% share in another company. Consolidated taxation means, among other things, that losses of one company can be offset against profits of other companies. Consolidated taxation cannot be extended to non-resident companies or PEs of foreign companies.
## Transfer pricing
When pricing or terms of business or financial arrangements between related parties are different from what might be expected to be in similar transactions between unrelated parties, tax authorities have the power to evaluate what the correct pricing should be and reassess taxes of the party in question. This applies to the general purchase and sale of goods and services, tangible and intangible assets, and any financial instruments. Tax authorities can reassess taxes for up to six years prior to the year in which the reassessment takes place.
Legal entities are considered related when they are part of a group, when they are under the direct and/or indirect majority ownership or management control of two or more legal entities within the group, when majority ownership of one legal entity over another is present in a direct or indirect manner, or when they are entities directly or indirectly majority owned or under the administrative control of individuals who have family ties (e.g. individuals in a marriage or registered partnership, siblings and persons related to each other in a direct line).
If a legal entity’s operating revenues in one fiscal year, or total assets at the beginning or at the end of the fiscal year, exceeds ISK 1 billion, it is bound to documentation duties from the next fiscal year regarding transactions with related legal entities abroad. The legal entity in question must then record information about the nature and extent of transactions with the related legal entity and information on what the price is based on.
The legal entity is obligated to keep data regarding transactions with related legal entities for seven years. If the tax authorities request access to documentation, the legal entity has 45 days to respond.
In addition to specific rules regarding transfer pricing in domestic law, it should be noted that there are also certain provisions in domestic law that contain the so-called ‘arm's-length principle’, which states that when a deal or transaction between the parties significantly differs from the norm in such transactions, the tax base can be determined and reassessed according to what the tax authorities consider to be normal in such circumstances.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting regime
A parent company registered in Iceland that owns subsidiaries abroad, thereby forming a multinational enterprise (MNE), is required to submit to the tax authorities a CbC report. A CbC report need only be provided if the MNEs revenue exceeds 750 million euros (EUR). If applicable, CbC reports have to be filed no less than 12 months after the end of the company’s fiscal year.
## Thin capitalisation
Thin capitalisation rules are included in the Income Tax Act. The rules limit interest deduction to 30% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA). The rules apply in excess of ISK 100 million of interest expenses.
The rules do not apply if:
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Any individual who either directly or indirectly owns a share in any kind of a company, fund, or organisation domiciled in a low-tax jurisdiction must pay income tax on the profit of such corporations in direct proportion to one's own share, regardless of distribution.
The same applies to taxpayers chairing companies, funds, organisations, or associations in a low-tax jurisdiction from which they receive direct or indirect benefits. In order for the above to apply, the foreign party must be domiciled in the low-tax jurisdiction, half the ownership of the foreign party must be directly or indirectly in the hands of Icelandic taxpayers, or they must have effective management and executive control within the income year.
CFC regulations do not apply if a fund or an organisation is protected by a double tax treaty (DTT) between Iceland and the low-tax country or if such entities are registered in another EEA member country where they have legitimate business operations and the countries have assigned a DTT between them.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
A branch is treated as an extension of a trading activity of the overseas parent company incorporated in another jurisdiction and is not a separate legal entity.
Due to the fact that a branch acts in the name of the overseas parent company, a branch's income is taxable in accordance with the parent company (i.e. if the parent company is an LLC, the branch is subject to a CIT rate of 21%; otherwise, it is subject to tax at 38.4%).
Tax treaties may allow Icelandic CIT as a credit against foreign income tax imposed on the parent company.
There is no branch profits remittance tax on the repatriation of profits to the parent company.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Foreign tax credit
The Income Tax Act offers a foreign tax credit to mitigate the potential for double taxation. The credit applies only to taxes of a nature similar to the tax being reduced by the credit (i.e. taxes based on income). This credit is limited to the amount of tax attributable to foreign-source income.
## Temporary reimbursements in respect of filmmaking in Iceland
On account of Act No. 43/1999 on Temporary Reimbursement in Respect of Filmmaking in Iceland, it is possible to have 25% of production expenses incurred in the production of films or television material in Iceland reimbursed. When more than 80% of the total production cost of a motion picture or television programme is incurred in Iceland, the reimbursement shall be calculated from the total production cost incurred within the EEA. Production costs refer to all costs incurred in Iceland deductible from the revenues of enterprises pursuant to the provisions of the Income Tax Act. Payments pertaining to employees and contractors are only to be included in production costs if they are verifiably taxable in Iceland.
Act No. 43/1999 on Temporary Reimbursements in Respect of Filmmaking in Iceland expires at year-end 2025. All projects approved by that date will be reimbursed in accordance with the law.
## Temporary reimbursements in respect of music recording in Iceland
On account of Act No. 110/2016 on Temporary Reimbursement of Recorded Music, it is possible to have 25% of cost incurred reimbursed when recording music in Iceland that has been released and made accessible to the general public. When more than 80% of the total recording cost is incurred in Iceland, the reimbursement shall be calculated from the total production cost incurred within the EEA. Reimbursable cost refers to all costs that may be used for calculating the refund amount, cf. Article 6 of Act No. 110/2016.
Act No. 110/2016 on Temporary Reimbursements of Recorded Music expires at year-end 2027. All applications received by the Ministry prior to that time shall be processed.
Innovative companies are entitled to a special deduction from CIT amounting to 35% of expenses incurred on the projects, provided certain conditions are met (25% for large companies).
## Act on incentives for initial investments in Iceland
Incentives are offered to companies that are investing in commercial operations in Iceland. The investment projects need to meet requirements, such as being beneficial for the Icelandic economy and society, in terms of job creation, rural development, exports, and tax revenues and knowledge.
Approved investment projects will receive benefits in return, including derogations from taxes and charges. In addition, authorisation to fix the rate of income tax, in line with the current rate of income tax, for ten years can be granted, as well as exemption from customs and excise duties on importation or domestic purchase of construction materials, machinery, and equipment for the building and operation of the investment project.
Act. No. 41/2015 on incentives for initial investments in Iceland expired at the end of June 2020. Incentives granted prior to that time shall remain in force for the period according to the agreement in question.

## Foreign currency financial statements/Accounting in foreign currencies
Companies can apply to the Registry of Annual Accounts for an authorisation to keep their books and prepare their annual accounts in a foreign currency. An application must be filed no later than two months before the beginning of the company’s fiscal year. The authorisation is valid for five years, and the Registry of Annual Accounts is responsible for ensuring that the authorised companies continue to fulfil one or more of the following necessary conditions:
If the company deems that it no longer fulfils the conditions, it must notify the Registry of Annual Accounts. The Registry can postpone its decision of the authorisation’s discontinuance for two fiscal years if the situation that is causing the fact that the company does not continue to fulfil the necessary conditions is deemed to be temporary.
The average exchange rate for the fiscal year must be used when converting income and expenses, depreciations included, into Icelandic króna. The exchange rate at the end of the fiscal year must be used when converting assets, debts, and capital. Exchange rate differences that may arise do not affect income on profit and loss accounts.
## Rules of Foreign Exchange
In 2008, the Central Bank of Iceland issued rules on foreign exchange in order to restrict or temporarily prevent certain types of cross-border capital movements or foreign exchange transactions related thereto, which, according to the Central Bank of Iceland, can cause serious and considerable instabilities in exchange rates and financial matters. These rules were later added to Act No. 87/1992 on Foreign Exchange.
The Act on Foreign Exchange defines capital movements as:
With new rules, which entered into effect on 14 March 2017, the restrictions on foreign exchange transactions and cross-border movement of domestic and foreign currency have largely been lifted. Restrictions on the following will remain in place, however: (i) derivatives trading for purposes other than hedging, (ii) foreign exchange transactions carried out between residents and non-residents without the intermediation of a financial undertaking, and (iii) in certain instances, foreign-denominated lending by residents to non-residents.
## Cross-border mergers
Rules regarding taxation in relation to cross-border divisions and cross-border mergers between Icelandic LLCs and LLCs from EEA and EFTA countries are now in the Icelandic Tax Act. Tax will be levied on uncapitalised profit, which can be postponed for five years.
## Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)
The Icelandic government participated in full in formulating and approving the G20/OECD BEPS Action Plan.
The government has implemented Action 4 on interest limitation, Action 7 on definition of permanent establishment, and Action 13 on transfer pricing documentation and CbC reporting. Additionally, Iceland participated in the creation of the multilateral instrument (MLI) as represented in Action 15, and the MLI was been signed by the Icelandic government on 7 June 2017.
Although Iceland is not a European Union (EU) member state, it is a member of the European Economic Area, so its legislation must comply with EEA rules and avoid infringement of the four freedom principles as provided in the EEA Agreement.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
Icelandic authorities have implemented the CRS in its domestic legislation. The Standard is in accordance to The Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information as developed by the G20/OECD in the year 2014.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
Certain deductions, authorised by law, can be deducted from individual’s income. In some cases, work-related expenses may be deducted if substantiated with the appropriate documents.
## Employment expenses
Employees’ verifiable operating costs of their car used in the service of their employment are deductible from the car allowance provided by their employers. To qualify for the deduction, the employee needs to keep a daily driving log and detail total costs and usage.
The maximum available deduction from the car allowance is ISK 83 to ISK 141 per km. Please note that this amount may vary during the year.
## Personal deductions
The Internal Revenue Directorate can also, in other circumstances, reduce an individual’s income and municipal tax base. Those special circumstances are:
## Personal allowances
In Iceland, personal allowances take the form of personal tax credits (*see the [Other tax credits and incentives](other-tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for more information*).

## Individuals with limited tax liability
Limited tax liability applies to individuals who are not domiciled in Iceland but are liable to pay income tax derived from income earned in Iceland, irrespective of any income they may be earning elsewhere at the same time or within the same calendar year. Double taxation treaties (DTTs) incorporate various clauses that allow for the exemption of income tax on such income, which, without such treaties, would be taxable in Iceland.
### Tax rates/tax collection
Non-residents who stay in Iceland temporarily and earn an income are subject to local income tax on those earnings. The income tax rate is the same as for local taxpayers, which is 16.55% to 31.35%, depending on income. In addition to income tax, a municipal tax of 14.93% is levied. These individuals are entitled to personal allowance in direct proportion to the days they reside in Iceland.
Individuals in Iceland involved in operating a permanent business or receive a share from the profit of operating such a business pay 16.55% to 31.35% income tax on the income tax base. Municipal tax is paid to the municipality where the majority of the earnings were earned. No personal tax credits are available.
A 22% capital income tax is levied on capital gains from real estate, capital gains from shares, and dividends.
A 12% capital income tax is levied on interest income. No tax is levied on the first ISK 300,000.
Rental income from residential properties and liquid assets is subject to a 22% tax rate. However, no tax is levied on 50% of an individual’s income deriving from renting a residential property.
### Directors’ fees
There is a 20% income tax, as well as municipal tax, levied on remuneration for directors, remuneration for financial advisors acting in a management position or other committee work, severance pay, funding, or equivalent payments for services or business in Iceland.
Pensions and payments from the national insurance fund are taxed as income (i.e. 16.55% to 31.35%) plus municipal tax. Personal tax credits may be used for income tax on pensions and insurance payments. If the personal tax credits are not used in full, the unused part can be used against municipal tax levied on the same income. Any personal tax credits remain unused become invalid and cannot be transferred between spouses unless both of them are receiving pensions or social insurance payments.
### Entertainment income
Individuals who receive payments for entertainment or sporting activities as profit shares pay a 15% income tax on gross payment, plus municipal tax.
### Tax release on grounds of a DTT
To apply for exemption from tax liability in Iceland on grounds of provisions in a DTT, form RSK 5.42 must be completed and returned to the Internal Revenue Directorate.
In cases where taxes have already been withheld in spite of grounds for exemption, an application under DTTs for a refund of taxes paid in Iceland can be made by completing and submitting application form RSK 5.43 to the Internal Revenue Directorate.
### Withholding tax collection
Income tax for individuals is divided into state income tax and municipal tax. Both state income tax and municipal tax are withheld at source monthly. Dividends, interest, and capital gains are also subject to WHT at source.
### Assessment and payment of tax
Individuals working in Iceland as employees subject to limited tax liability must file a tax return when leaving the country and are subject to a tax assessment.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
In the Icelandic tax system, individuals are subject to tax on all personal income and capital income. Taxable income is divided into three main categories:
The concept of taxable income includes all kinds of payments made in cash and by other means where the monetary value can be ascertained.
## Capital gains
Gains from the sale of privately owned property are subject to 22% capital income tax.
Gains from sales of private residential property are tax-exempt if the property has been in the taxpayer’s ownership for over two years.
In general, an individual’s capital gains from the sale of privately owned liquid assets are tax-exempt.
## Dividend income
Dividends are subject to capital income tax. In the event of share decrease or the liquidation of the company, payments to shareholders exceeding the purchase price are treated as dividends and, as such, are subject to 22% tax.
## Interest income
Interest income derived from bank deposits, mutual and investment funds, bonds or other financial deeds, any kind of exchange rate profit, and any other income from monetary assets are subject to 22% capital income tax. No tax is calculated on the total interest revenue up to ISK 300,000 per year for an individual. This personal allowance is not applicable for withholding tax (WHT) but applies in the final tax assessment.
## Rental income
Rental income from residential properties and liquid assets is subject to 22% capital income tax. Note that only 50% of rental income is subject to taxation. Individuals renting out residential property for a limited period of time can deduct the rental cost of the property by netting the cost they incur for personal housing against the income generated.
## Exempt income
No significant items of compensation are tax exempt in Iceland.

## Personal tax credits
Every taxpayer of 16 years and older is entitled to personal tax credits of ISK 779,112 for the year 2024 (ISK 64,926 per month). Should a person move to or from Iceland, one will receive personal tax credits for the period they resided in Iceland. The period is calculated in days.
Unused personal tax credits are transferable in full between married couples and cohabitants within the calendar year.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
Any individual who stays in Iceland for more than 183 days during any 12-month period is considered a resident from the date of arrival.
Non-residents are individuals who stay temporarily in Iceland for 183 days or less.
## Discontinuance of tax residency
Tax liability ends as soon as the individual leaves Iceland. However, former domiciles remain fully tax liable in Iceland for three years after leaving the country, unless they prove that they have become subject to taxation in another country.
