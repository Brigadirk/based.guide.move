## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Inventory valuation
For tax purposes, taxpayers are authorised to use any one of the following inventory methods, provided they are technically appropriate for the particular business, consistently applied, and easily audited:
Other than the methods enumerated above, taxpayers are not permitted to use other methods for valuing their inventories except with prior authorisation of the tax office, provided that in the latter’s judgement the method in question contains clear determination and *bona fide* elements available to the office. Once an inventory valuation method is adopted, the taxpayer may not change it without the tax office’s prior authorisation.
## Capital gains
## Dividend income
Cash profits or dividends remitted or credited to shareholders are subject to a 5% WHT (25% if paid to a tax haven as considered by the Salvadoran tax administration).
## Interest income
Interest income is taxable in El Salvador when the entity paying the interest is resident in El Salvador and when the capital is invested in the country.
## Partnership income
Partnership income is taxable if it is Salvadorian-source income; nevertheless, no specific provisions exist in El Salvador regarding partnership income.
## Rent/royalties income
Rent and royalties income is taxable if it is Salvadorian-source income; nevertheless, no specific provisions exist in El Salvador regarding rent and royalties income.
## Condoned debts
Condoned debts are considered taxable income and must be included as part of the income generated in that fiscal period.
## Foreign income
Under the territoriality source of income principle, extraterritorial income is not taxable in El Salvador. In this case, interest arising from loans granted to a resident of El Salvador is considered as taxable income, and the person or entity making the payment should withhold 10% of the interest. If financial services are rendered between related parties, the withholding must be at 20%.

Payments to resident individuals with respect to services rendered, other than under a labour relationship, are subject to a 10% WHT.
Income received from securities listed on the Salvadoran stock exchange by entities not resident in El Salvador is subject to a reduced WHT rate of 3%.
The acquisition of intangible goods among resident entities in the country is subject to a 5% WHT.
Certain transactions are subject to a reduced WHT rate of 5%, such as the following:
Moreover, a treaty to avoid double taxation exists between El Salvador and Spain, this treaty established reduced WHT, such as the following:

# El Salvador
## Overview
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
El Salvador, the smallest and most densely populated country in Central America, is the former site of the ancient Pipil civilisation. It was conquered by Spain in 1524, under whose rule the capital city of San Salvador was founded by Diego de Holguin and Gonzalo de Alvarado in 1525. El Salvador declared its independence from Spain on 15 September 1821 as the Central American Federation, which was dissolved in 1839. El Salvador is a democratic republic governed by a president, and Spanish is the official language. Its currency is the United States dollar (USD); additionally, on 8 June 2021, the Legislative Assembly approved bitcoin as a legal tender, effective on 7 September 2021.
In general, El Salvador has always adopted an open attitude towards foreign direct investment, and the country is basing its development strategy on a policy of openness to trade, investment, and international competitive pressures.

# El Salvador
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
The corporate income tax (CIT) rate is 30%, and this rate is applicable on the total amount of the company’s revenues. There is a reduced CIT rate of 25% for companies that obtain taxable income equal to or less than 150,000 United States dollars (USD) in the fiscal year.
CIT is based on the principle of territoriality, and, by general rule, taxes are paid on goods located, activities realised, and capital invested in El Salvador as well as on services rendered or utilised in the country. Nevertheless, there is a special rule regarding securities and financial instruments, since such income is considered to be obtained in El Salvador if the issuing entity is domiciled in El Salvador.
Taxable income is equal to gross income net of costs and expenses considered necessary for generating and maintaining the related source of income and other deductions allowed by law. Gross income is comprised of income or profits collected or accrued, either in cash or in kind, from any sources in El Salvador.
Corporations are required to follow the accrual method of accounting.
## Income tax advance payment
A 1.75% tax is applied to gross revenues accrued. This tax is paid monthly as an advance payment that is applied against the CIT at the end of the year.
## Local income taxes
There is a municipal tax related to taxpayers' income. This tax depends on the location of the operations where the taxpayer performs its activity.

# El Salvador
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
National taxes, fees, and other contributions on all types of goods, services, and income in El Salvador are levied by the National Congress. Local governments (municipalities) may suggest contribution rates and propose their approval to the National Congress by way of a specific law.
The Ministry of Finance (*Ministerio de Hacienda*) controls the state’s finances and defines and guides the government’s financial policy. It also harmonises, directs, and implements its policies on taxation through its agencies.
## Taxable period
In El Salvador, the fiscal year is from 1 January to 31 December.
## Tax returns
CIT annual returns must be filed each year no later than 30 April, following the end of the year under taxation.
## Payment of tax
Taxes are due on the date established for filing the tax returns. In El Salvador, tax payments are made together with the filing of tax returns, and payments must be made at the banks of the local financial system.
In addition, public and private legal entities resident in the country for tax purposes, other than farm and cattle concerns, are required to make advance income tax payments at 1.75% of gross revenues. These advance payments are due, together with the corresponding return, within ten working days following the corresponding calendar month and are ultimately applied against the CIT at the end of the year.
## Tax audit process
In El Salvador, the audit cycle is constituted by the following steps:
## Statute of limitations
In El Salvador, the statute of limitations for the compliance of the payment of tax debts is ten years.
The tax administration's power to perform a tax audit is for three years in the case of tax returns presented on time by the taxpayer; five years in the case of tax returns presented in a delayed way, but this time is going to start from the day after the extemporary presentation; and five years in cases where the taxpayer has not presented the tax return.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
All business expenses considered necessary to produce taxable income and/or maintain income sources (e.g. freight, marketing, power, telecommunications, water, salaries, lease contracts, merchandise and transport insurance, fuel, and interest paid on loans used by income generating sources) are deductible for income tax purposes.
## Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, which results in the following maximum annual rates for determining depreciation deductions.
| Assets | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Buildings | 5 |
| Machinery | 20 |
| Vehicles | 25 |
| Other movable assets | 50 |
Depreciation of new software is permitted at a rate of 25% of purchase or production costs.
Amortisation of goodwill, trademarks, and other similar intangible assets are not deductible for income tax purposes.
## Start-up expenses
In El Salvador, there is not a special regulation for expenses related to the starting up of a company.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are deductible if the amount of the loan is invested in a source that generates taxable income.
## Bad debt
In El Salvador, bad debt is deductible if the following requirements are presented:
## Charitable contributions
The deductibility of charitable donations is limited to 20% of the donor's net income after deducting the donation amount.
## Fines and penalties
In general, penalties, late payment charges, and fines of that type are not deductible.
## Taxes
Taxes paid are not deductible.
## Net operating losses
Operating losses cannot be carried forward to future years or carried back. Capital losses, however, may be carried forward to offset capital gains for five years.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Remittance of royalties, interest income, and service fees to foreign affiliates are deductible, provided proper contracts are in place, the corresponding withholdings are applied (i.e. 20% WHT for non-domiciled entities, 25% for entities domiciled in tax havens), and there is sufficient evidence that these services have actually been received.

# El Salvador
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
There are no grouping rules in El Salvador between independent entities. Each entity, even if related, is treated separately and must report and pay their taxes independently.
## Transfer pricing
In El Salvador, it is mandatory for entities that have operations with related parties or with entities resident in tax havens to undertake these operations in compliance with the arm's-length principle.
Local tax authorities can establish the value of the operations according to market prices rules if, according to their point of view, these operations have not been undertaken according to the arm’s-length principle.
## Thin capitalisation
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no CFC rules in El Salvador.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
In El Salvador, tax rates on branch profits are the same as for domestic corporations. Dividends and profits paid or credited by headquarter (HQ) representatives, affiliates, branches, subsidiaries, agencies, and others not domiciled in El Salvador are subject to 5% withholding tax (WHT) (25% if paid to a tax haven as considered by the Salvadoran tax administration).
The law does not provide separate treatment for administrative offices located in El Salvador.
The general regulations indicate that branches, agencies, and/or establishments permanently operating in the country, with owned or leased installed infrastructure, employing domestic staff, and performing their economic activities in a material and perceptible manner in the country are subject to the same taxes as companies duly incorporated.

# El Salvador
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
El Salvador offers a wide range of incentives to attract foreign investment and drive new commercial and industrial developments. There are also no restrictions on foreign ownership or on mergers, acquisitions, or joint ventures.
There are five specific laws in El Salvador that seek to encourage foreign investment by improving the country’s competitiveness in all areas involving the granting of tax incentives. These laws are the Industrial and Commercial Free Zone Law, the Law of International Services, the Renewable Energy Incentives Law, the Tourism Law, and the Law for the promotion of Manufacturing and Technological Innovation.
### The Industrial and Commercial Free Zone Law
The Industrial and Commercial Free Zone Law No. 405, dated 3 September 1998, grants companies the following incentives:
Any foreign company may establish and function in a free zone or bonded warehouse and benefit from these incentives if they are engaged in production, assembly, manufacturing, processing, transformation, or commercialisation of goods and services and/or rendering of services linked to international or regional trade, such as gathering, packaging and repackaging, cargo consolidation, distribution of merchandise, and other activities connected or complementary to them.
### The Law of International Services
The Law of International Services No. 431, dated 11 October 2007, grants the same benefits as the Free Zone Law, but the beneficiaries are companies operating in Service Centres specially created according to this law and dedicated to international services as defined therein.
### The Renewable Energy Incentives Law
The Renewable Energy Incentives Law provides customs duties exemption on imports of machinery, equipment, and materials for up to ten years, income tax exemption for a period of five to ten years, and total tax exemption on revenues from the sale of Certified Emission Reductions, when certain requirements are met.
### The Law for the Promotion of Technological and Manufacturing Innovation
The Law for the Promotion of Technological and Manufacturing Innovation was recently approved and entered into force on 5 June 2023. This Law grants benefits of exemption from income tax and municipal taxes to income obtained from certain activities, which include:
The beneficiaries of this Law may opt for the following tax incentives for a period of 15 years:
## Foreign tax credit
There is no foreign tax credit available in El Salvador.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Standard deductions
Individuals whose income comes from salaries not exceeding USD 9,100 a year are not required to file a tax return, and are allowed a single deduction of USD 1,600, which is embodied into the withholding rates their income is subject to.
## Personal deductions
Salaried individuals whose earned income does exceed USD 9,100 a year may not deduct the single deduction of USD 1,600, but may deduct medical and educational expenses up to USD 800 per item.
Also, these taxpayers may deduct any donations provided to not-for-profit entities, up to 20% of the sum remaining after deducting from their net income of the respective tax period the value of such donations.
Other deductions that may be considered for the taxpayers are the voluntary contributions to the pension fund, which is additional and separate from the one established in the law as obligatory; this would be deductible at up to 10% of monthly income reported to pension fund.
Non-business expenses or costs are not deductible for tax purposes.
## Personal allowances
Family allowances are not recognised as deductible expenses for income tax purposes.

# El Salvador
## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Income is understood to cover the taxpayer's overall income collected during the tax period in question, either in cash or in-kind, from sources such as labour, business activities, capital, and generally all types of income, gains, benefits, or profits, whatever their origin might be, as well as condoned debt.
## Employment income
Taxable compensation of employees, resident or non-resident, covers all types of income whether in cash or in-kind (e.g. salaries, bonuses, overtime, paid vacations, housing and car allowances, reimbursement for tax and children's educational expenses, benefits-in-kind).
Non-resident aliens are taxed on salary earned for work done in El Salvador, regardless of where payment is made and regardless of whether it is remitted. No separate treatment is afforded to foreigners.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are taxed at a flat 10% rate, except when the asset is realised within the 12 months following the date of acquisition, in which case capital gains are taxed as ordinary income. Capital losses can be offset by capital gains only. Whenever capital losses exceed capital gains, the balance may be offset against future capital gains for up to five years.
## Exempt income
Non-taxable income includes:
