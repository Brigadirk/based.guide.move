## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
Under Israeli domestic tax law, WHT on payments of Israeli-source income is generally deducted at the corporate tax rate from all income remittances abroad, unless a tax certificate is obtained from the ITA authorising withholding-exempt remittances or a reduced rate of tax pursuant to an applicable tax treaty.
Set out below is a listing of WHT rates for dividends, interest, and royalties under domestic tax law and pursuant to tax treaties in force. Detailed rules apply under certain tax treaties for eligibility to the treaty-reduced rates (e.g. beneficial ownership, having no PE in Israel). The applicable tax treaty should be consulted to determine the relevant WHT rate and to examine detailed conditions that may apply for the specific circumstance.
Israel has adopted the Multilateral Instrument (MLI) amendments to tax treaties. The changes to the DTTs provided for in the MLI will generally apply for those Israeli treaties when the country treaty partner has also ratified the MLI in their respective country and for those provisions on which both countries have not submitted reservations to the OECD. Therefore, in examining treaty eligibility for reduced WHT rates, it is important to examine the relevant treaty together with its MLI amendments as applicable (e.g. amended provisions regarding residency).

## Overview
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
Israel, a parliamentary republic, is located on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea. It is bordered by Lebanon and Syria to the north, Jordan to the east, and Egypt to the southwest. The capital of Israel is Jerusalem, and its currency is the shekel (ILS). Currently, there are two official languages in Israel: Hebrew and Arabic.
Israel has a technologically advanced market economy that depends on imports of crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military equipment. Recent natural gas discoveries off the coast of Israel have been a positive development for Israel, which otherwise has limited natural resources. Israel also has intensively developed its agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years. Cut diamonds, high-technology equipment, and agricultural products (fruits and vegetables) are the leading exports. The Bank of Israel expects gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the Israeli economy to increase in 2022 by 5.5%.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
In general, the annual results (i.e. the excess of income over expenses or *vice versa*) of an Israeli company or branch, as detailed in the taxpayer’s financial statements, form the basis for computing the taxable income of the business.
The base amount is then adjusted pursuant to the provisions of the tax law to arrive at ‘taxable income’.
## Inventory valuation
Inventories are generally valued at the lower of cost or market value (i.e. net realisable value). Conformity is required between book and tax reporting of inventory. The first in first out (FIFO) or weighted-average basis of valuation is acceptable; the last in first out (LIFO) method is not accepted.
## Capital gains
Capital gains tax is generally payable on capital gains by residents of Israel on the sale of assets (irrespective of the location of the assets) and by non-residents on the sale of the following:
The cashless transfer of rights and assets arising from certain mergers, spin-offs, and asset transfers may be exempt from tax upon meeting various requirements.
### Determination of the capital gain
Corporate tax on capital gains is imposed on the disposal of fixed and intangible assets where the disposal price is in excess of the depreciated cost.
### Computation of real gain and inflationary components
For tax purposes, the capital gain is generally calculated in local currency, and there are provisions for segregating the taxable gain into its real and inflationary components. The inflationary amount is the original cost of the asset, less depreciation (where applicable), multiplied by the percentage increase in the Israeli consumer price index (CPI) from the date of acquisition of the asset to the date of its sale. The inflationary amount component is exempt to the extent it accrued after 1 January 1994 and is generally subject to tax at the rate of 10% if it accrued before that date.
The real gain component, if any, is taxed at the rates set out further below.
A non-resident that invests in capital assets with foreign currency may elect to calculate the inflationary amount in that foreign currency. Under this option, in the event of a sale of shares in an Israeli company, the inflationary amount attributable to exchange differences on the investment is always exempt from Israeli tax.
### Sale of assets (including publicly and non-publicly traded shares)
The real gain is generally subject to tax at the corporate tax rate applicable in the year of the gain (23% in 2025). Special exemptions may apply for non-residents (*see further below*).
### Special rule for retained profits upon sale of shares
Special provisions apply to part of the real gain that is attributed to the seller’s share of retained profits in the case of a sale of (i) non-traded shares that were acquired prior to 1 January 2003 or (ii) publicly traded shares where the seller was a 10% or more shareholder.
In the case of a disposal by corporations of (i) non-traded shares and (ii) traded shares when the seller generally directly or indirectly holds at least 10% of the sold Israeli company during the 12-month period preceding the sale, special provisions apply to such part of the real gain that is attributed to the seller’s share of retained profits. The share of retained profits is the amount of gain equal to the proportional part of the retained profits of the company that the seller of the shares would have rights to by virtue of those shares. Detailed rules apply in determining this profit component.
Generally, the seller’s proportionate part of the company’s retained profits is taxed as if this amount had been received as dividends immediately before the sale (i.e. at a tax rate of 0% in the case of an Israeli-resident corporate shareholder or at a tax rate of 30% when the seller is a non-Israeli resident corporate shareholder that generally holds 10% or more in the rights of the Israeli company [it is unclear if this 30% rate may be reduced by an applicable tax treaty]). The part of the retained profits that is attributed to the period ending on 31 December 2002 is subject to tax at the rate of 10%.
### Special exemptions for non-residents
#### Publicly traded Israeli shares
Non-residents corporations not having a PE in Israel are exempt from tax on capital gains from the sale of shares of an Israeli company traded on the Israeli stock exchange or on a foreign stock exchange. Certain exceptions apply.
Where the shares were purchased by the non-resident prior to being publicly traded, *subject to the availability of exemptions detailed below*, capital gains tax might apply for the portion of the gain that was generated up to the day of the share’s public listing but not to exceed the capital gain actually arising upon the sale of the share and provided that the value on the day of public listing was more than their value on the date of purchase and that the proceeds upon sale exceeded the value on the date of purchase.
#### Non-publicly traded shares
For purchases after 1 January 2009, an exemption exists under domestic law for non-residents, regardless of their percentage holding in an Israeli company, from gains derived from the sale of securities not traded on a stock exchange, provided the following conditions are met:
A non-resident company shall not be eligible for this exemption if Israeli residents are controlling shareholders or benefit or are entitled to 25% or more of the income or profits of the non-resident company, either directly or indirectly.
For shares purchased between 1 July 2005 and 1 January 2009, more restrictive conditions apply in order to be eligible for the exemption. Detailed rules apply.
#### Treaty exemption
Non-residents may qualify for a tax treaty capital gain exemption, depending upon the particular circumstances and the provisions of the applicable tax treaty (e.g. in some tax treaties, no capital gains exemption is allowed where the holding in the sold Israeli company exceeds a certain percentage).
When assets are attributable to an Israeli PE or are real estate rights (including rights in a real estate association), a treaty exemption will generally not be available.
The ITA is very sensitive to treaty shopping, and it will be necessary to demonstrate to the ITA that the foreign holding entity has business substance in its country of residence and that the structuring of the holding through that entity was not implemented for tax treaty benefit purposes.
## Capital losses
Capital losses may offset all capital gains (including gains from Israeli or foreign securities) and gains from the sale of property (whether Israeli or foreign source).
Where the capital loss is from a non-Israeli asset (including when carried forward into future years), the loss must first be offset against foreign-source capital gains.
Capital losses derived from the sale of securities may also be offset against interest and dividend income generated from the sold security and also against interest and dividend income received from other securities (where the income was not subject to tax of more than 25%).
Capital losses from the sale of shares are generally reduced by any dividends received by the selling corporation during the 24 months preceding the sale, unless tax on the dividends of at least 15% was paid.
Capital losses can generally be carried forward indefinitely and set-off only against capital gains.
## Exit tax
When an Israeli tax resident, including a company, ceases to be an Israeli resident for tax purposes, its assets are deemed to have been sold one day before it ceased being an Israeli resident. Although exit tax is primarily applicable to individuals, this might also apply to corporations incorporated outside of Israel whose management and control is transferred from Israel to another jurisdiction at a particular time.
Any gain attributable to the deemed sale of assets may be paid on the day the residency ceased or it may be postponed until the date the assets are actually realised. When the tax event is deferred to the sale date of the assets, the amount of the Israeli capital gain portion is determined by taking the real capital gain at the time of realisation, multiplied by the period of ownership from the day on which it acquired the asset until the day it ceased being an Israeli resident, divided by the entire period from the day of the asset’s acquisition until the day of realisation. The exit tax provisions do not apply for those Israeli assets that in any event are subject to tax in Israel upon their sale. The Minister of Finance is authorised to prescribe provisions for the implementation of the exit tax, including provisions for the prevention of double taxation and the submission of tax reports, but no provisions have yet been issued.
## Dividend income
### Received by an Israeli-resident company
Dividends received by an Israeli-resident company from another Israeli-resident company that originate from income accrued or derived in Israel are exempt from corporate tax, except for dividends paid from income of an AE (*see the [Tax credits and incentives](israel/corporate/tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section*). This affords the opportunity to transfer after tax profits within an Israeli group of companies for further investment.
Dividends received by an Israeli-resident company from a non-resident company, as well as dividends received from an Israeli company that arise from foreign-source income of the distributing company, are generally taxable for the receiving company at the rate of 23%. Under certain circumstances, the receiving company may elect to be taxed on such dividends at the corporate tax rate, in which case it will also be entitled to a foreign tax credit with respect to corporate taxes paid by the company distributing the dividend (i.e. an ‘underlying’ tax credit).
### Received by a non-resident shareholder
Dividends received by a non-resident shareholder from an Israeli company are generally subject to tax at the rate of 25% (30% if paid to a 10% or more shareholder), subject to a reduced rate of tax under an applicable tax treaty.
## Interest income
### Received by an Israeli-resident company
Interest income received by an Israeli-resident company is subject to the regular corporate tax rate (23% in 2025).
### Received by a non-resident
Interest income received by a non-resident company is generally subject to tax at the rate of 23% or subject to a reduced rate of tax under an applicable tax treaty.
Interest received by a non-resident from deposits of foreign currency with an Israeli bank is exempt from tax, subject to certain conditions.
## Rent/royalties income
Rent and royalty income, less allowable deductions for tax purposes, is subject to tax at the regular corporate tax rate (23% in 2025).
## Partnership income
From an Israeli tax perspective, a partnership is, in principle, a fiscally transparent vehicle. Accordingly, Israeli tax law does not tax partnerships as such; however, generally, each partner is taxed in respect of its share of the partnership income, with the taxable income allocated to a corporate partner taxed at the regular corporate tax rate. Consequently, the actual distribution of partnership income to a partner is a non-taxable event.
## Foreign income
An Israeli-resident company is liable for tax on its worldwide income. Double taxation is avoided by way of a foreign tax credit mechanism that also applies unilaterally in the absence of an applicable double taxation treaty (DTT) (*see the [Tax credits and incentives](israel/corporate/tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section*).
Under the controlled foreign company (CFC) regime in Israeli tax law, an Israeli company or individual may be taxed on a proportion of the undistributed profits of certain Israeli-controlled, non-resident companies in which the Israeli shareholder has a controlling interest (10% or more of any of the CFC’s ‘means of control’). *See Controlled foreign companies (CFCs) in the [Group taxation](israel/corporate/group-taxation.html) section for more information*.

## National insurance contributions
### Resident employees
Employees’ national insurance contribution for resident employees is 1.04% on the first ILS 7,522 of income per month and 7% on the difference between ILS 7,522 and the maximum monthly compensation amount of ILS 50,695.
Employers' national insurance contribution for resident employees is 4.51% on the first ILS 7,522 of income per month and 7.6% on the difference between ILS 7,522 and the maximum monthly compensation amount of ILS 50,695.
### Non-resident employees
Employees’ national insurance contribution for non-resident employees is 0.1% on the first ILS 7,522 of income per month and 0.87% on the difference between ILS 7,522 and the maximum monthly compensation amount of ILS 50,695.
Employers' national insurance contribution for non-resident employees is 0.75% on the first ILS 7,522 of income per month and 2.65% on the difference between ILS 7,522 and the maximum monthly compensation amount of ILS 50,695.
### Special rules and rates
Special detailed rules and rates regarding national insurance contributions apply to irregular salary payments, the self-employed, and to other sources of income generated by an Israeli resident (i.e. rent, interest, dividends, pension, etc.). Capital gains are not subject to national insurance contributions.
## Health insurance tax
Health insurance tax is levied at 3.23% on the first ILS 7,522 and at 5.16% on the difference between ILS 7,522 and the maximum monthly compensation amount of ILS 50,695. Non-residents are not subject to health insurance tax.
Special detailed rules and rates regarding health insurance tax apply to irregular salary payments, the self-employed, and to other sources of income generated by an Israeli resident (i.e. rent, interest, dividends, pension, etc.). Capital gains are not subject to health insurance tax.
## Land appreciation tax (LAT)
LAT is imposed on gains from the sale of Israeli real estate. LAT is also imposed on the sale of an interest in a non-traded real estate association (REA), defined as a company or partnership whose principal assets consist of Israeli real estate. However, the tax liability arising from the sale of such an association will be determined based on the capital gains tax provisions of the Israeli ITO. For LAT purposes, a sale includes most types of dispositions, as well as the grant of a lease capable of lasting for 25 years or more.
In measuring the lease period, an option to lease is considered as if exercised. Detailed expenditure deduction rules are prescribed for LAT purposes.
The resulting taxable capital gain is divided into real and inflationary elements.
The real capital gain is taxable as follows (these guidelines do not apply with respect to the sale of residential apartments in Israel - detailed rules apply):
### Assets purchased from 1 January 2012 and thereafter
The tax rate applicable to real capital gains derived from the sale of an interest in real estate for individuals is 25%. The tax rate applicable to real capital gains derived from the sale of an interest in an REA is 25%, or 30% in the case of a 10% or more shareholder.
### Assets purchased prior to 1 January 2012
### Surtaxes
As of 2025, the portion of an individual's taxable annual income from capital sources (e.g., capital gains, real estate appreciation, dividends, interest, CPI linkage differentials, rental income, passive royalties, etc.) exceeding a certain threshold (NIS 721,560 in 2025) is subject to an additional surtax of 2%. This is in addition to 3% surtax on an individual's annual taxable income from all sources exceeding a certain threshold (NIS 721,560 in 2025).
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
## Net wealth/worth taxes
Israel does not have a net wealth/worth tax.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Israel does not have any estate or inheritance taxation.
Israel does not impose a special gift tax on the gifting of assets.
## Property taxes
Property taxes are generally imposed on the occupier of commercial and residential property. Unoccupied property is generally taxed on the property's owner. The tax is imposed at the municipality level.
## Luxury and excise taxes
Israel imposes an additional 3% on personal income at the highest marginal rate (which increases the highest tax marginal rate from 47% to 50%).
A luxury tax is also imposed on the purchase of certain yachts and luxury cars.
Israel imposes excise taxes on a variety of goods (e.g. gasoline and diesel fuel used for transportation, tobacco, alcohol). The excise taxes are levied item-by-item, and the rates vary.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
Israel-incorporated companies and foreign companies that have a branch presence in Israel are both subject to Israeli corporate tax. An Israeli-resident entity is subject to Israeli corporate tax on worldwide income while a non-resident entity is subject to Israeli corporate tax only on income accrued or derived in Israel. Income sourcing rules determine when income is to be considered from an Israeli source.
The corporate tax rate is 23% in 2025 (same rate as in 2024).
Business operations qualifying under the Encouragement of Capital Investments Law are entitled to reduced rates of tax depending upon their location and other conditions (*see the [Tax credits and incentives](israel/corporate/tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section*).
## Closely held companies - tax on current income
A provision in Israeli tax law effectively lifts the corporate tax veil of a closely held company that provides services to another company (the ‘other company’) in certain circumstances. A closely held company is generally defined as a company that is directly or indirectly held or controlled by no more than five individuals (taking into account certain relatives). This provision is generally intended for situations when an individual controlling shareholder in the closely held company (‘individual’) is providing officer or management type services to the other company or services that are of the type that are generally performed by an employee for his employer. In such a case, the income shall not be taxed to the closely held company but, rather, shall be taxed to the individual as employment income, business income, or other income, depending upon the circumstances. The employment income classification shall apply if 70% or more of the total income or taxable income of the closely held company in the tax year is sourced from the services performed by the individual or the individual's relatives for a single entity during a period of at least 22 months during a three-year period. Certain exclusions apply.
## Closely held companies - excess profitability
As of 2025, when the profitability of a closely held company (defined as taxable income divided by gross income) from active business activity (i.e. income from any source other than interest, dividends, rent, consideration for the sale of assets, income from securities that constitute business inventory, consideration from the sale of real estate in Israel or abroad or the shares of real estate companies) exceeds 25%, an active shareholder's (defined as a shareholder holding 30% or more of at least one of the means of control of the closely held company or a shareholder holding less than 30% thereof who is involved in generating the active business income of the closely held company or involved in the management of the closely held company) pro-rata share of the income constituting the excess profitability (i.e. exceeding 25%) is included in the active shareholder's taxable income and subject to tax at the active shareholder's marginal tax rate.
Another new provision applicable as of 2025 applies with respect to a closely held company that holds a stake in a partnership. In this respect, to the extent that the closely held company holds at least 10% in the partnership, the company's pro-rata share of the partnership's income and expenses is taken into account for purposes of the company's calculation of whether its profitability exceeds 25%. If, however, the closely held company holds less than 10% in the partnership, 55% of the closely held company's pro-rata share of the profits of the partnership is included in each controlling shareholder's taxable income and subject to tax at the controlling shareholder's marginal tax rate.
## Closely held companies - tax on accumulated profits
As of 2025, closely held companies are generally required to pay an annual tax of 2% on certain accumulated profits.  A closely held company is generally defined as a company that is directly or indirectly held or controlled by no more than five individuals (with certain relatives or partners in a partnership viewed as a single individual). The tax on undistributed profits may be avoided if the company distributes a dividend equal to: (i) at least 6% (5% in 2025 – so long as the tax is paid during 2025) of its accumulated profits as of the end of the prior tax year; or (ii) more than 50% of its accumulated profits less certain deductions. Detailed rules apply.
## Closely held companies - winding up the structures
In light of the reduced attractiveness, for Israeli tax purposes, of the utilization of closely held companies, and in order to incentivize the liquidation of such companies, a temporary provision has been enacted which provides certain tax relief with respect to the liquidation of closely held companies or the non-liquidation transfer of assets (be they real estate assets or non-real estate assets) therefrom. This temporary provision is in force through November 30, 2025, with the tax relief offered thereby contingent upon the tax liabilities arising from the transaction being paid by December 31, 2025.
## Local income taxes
Israel does not impose district or local taxes on corporate income.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The 2025 current rate of VAT is 18%.
Exports of goods and certain services and various other transactions are zero-rated, and certain transactions are exempt.
Banks and other financial institutions pay VAT-equivalent taxes at the rate of 18% based on their total payroll and on profits (scheduled to be increased to 18% effective 1 January 2025).
Not-for-profit organisations pay VAT-equivalent tax (wage tax) at the rate of 7.5% of their total payroll.
## Customs duties
Customs duty is imposed on certain products imported into Israel. The rates of duty depend upon their classification according to the Harmonised Customs Tariff and the country of origin. Israel has concluded free-trade agreements with the United States (US), Canada, Mexico, the European Union (EU), and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA).
## Excise taxes
Israel imposes excise taxes on a variety of goods (e.g. gasoline and diesel fuel used for transportation, tobacco, alcohol). The excise taxes are levied item-by-item, and the rates vary.
## Municipal tax
Municipal tax is levied annually on buildings by local municipalities based on the size, location, and purpose of the property.
## Property taxes
Property taxes are generally imposed on the occupier of commercial and residential real property. Unoccupied property is generally taxed on the property's owner. The tax is imposed at the municipality level.
## Real estate capital gains
The tax rate on the real gain is the applicable corporate tax rate (23% in 2025).
A special tax rate may apply with respect to real estate acquired prior to 1960.
## Transfer tax
The purchaser of real estate is generally subject to acquisition tax at rates up to a maximum of 10% (the highest rate applies when the purchase price exceeds 20,183,565 Israeli shekels [ILS]).
## Stamp taxes
There are no stamp taxes imposed in Israel.
## Payroll taxes
There are no payroll taxes other than employer’s national insurance contributions (*see below*).
## Employer’s national insurance contributions
Employers are obligated to pay national insurance contributions based on a percentage of each employee’s income on a monthly basis. Employers are responsible for withholding employees’ contributions from wages and remitting these together with the employer’s own contributions. The employer’s contribution rates (current as of January 2025) for Israeli-resident employees are 4.51%, up to monthly income of ILS 7,522, and 7.6% on the difference between ILS 7,522 and the maximum monthly income of ILS 50,695.
For non-resident employees, the employer rates are significantly lower and are 0.75%, up to monthly income of ILS 7,522, and 2.65% on the difference between ILS 7,522 and the maximum monthly income of ILS 50,695. The minimal national insurance payments for non-resident employees do not provide any retirement benefit for the non-resident but generally provides a certain element of work accident coverage.
When an irregular salary payment in excess of one quarter of the usual salary is made, special provisions apply to the computation of social charges by which the application of this payment is equally attributed to the current month and to the past 11 months.
Israel has social security totalisation agreements with 19 countries that may allow for an exemption from Israeli national insurance throughout the employment period of the employee in Israel.

# Israel
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year is generally the calendar year. Certain entities may apply to have their tax year-end on different dates, specifically mutual funds, government companies, quoted companies, and subsidiaries of foreign publicly listed companies.
## Tax returns
The Israeli system is based on a combined form of assessment and self-assessment.
The statutory filing date is five months following the end of the tax year, which for a calendar year taxpayer would be 31 May. It is possible, however, to secure extensions of the filing date.
## Payment of tax
Generally, 12 monthly advance payments are levied at a fixed ratio of the company’s turnover. Alternatively, a company may be required to make ten monthly payments beginning in the second month of its tax year, each payment being a fixed percentage of the previous year’s tax assessment.
### Penalties
Penalties are imposed on overdue advance payments and on delays in the submission of tax returns. For any tax due for a certain year that has not been paid by the end of that tax year, the taxpayer shall be charged interest at a rate of 4% and linkage differentials for the period from the end of the tax year until the date of payment. If the balance due is paid by the end of the first month following the end of the tax year, the taxpayer should receive a full exemption from any interest and linkage differentials.
When the ITA determines that a taxpayer has a tax deficiency exceeding 50% of the total tax due and the taxpayer has not proven to the satisfaction of the ITA that it was not negligent in its tax reports filed (or where there was a failure to file reports), a penalty equal to 15% of the tax deficiency shall be imposed.
A penalty equal to 30% of the tax deficiency may be imposed when an additional tax liability exceeding ILS 500,000 is issued by the ITA further to a tax assessment and the tax deficiency is more than 50% of the total tax due (additional conditions apply).
## Tax audit process
A tax return, once filed, constitutes a self-assessment that remains open to review by the ITA generally for four years from the end of the tax year in which the tax return is filed. If no return is filed and a tax officer believes a taxpayer owes tax, the tax officer may issue a ‘best judgement’ assessment without time limit.
An assessment issued by an Assessing Officer may be challenged by the taxpayer in writing within 30 days stating in the objection the reasons why the assessment is not correct. A different Assessing Officer will then review the facts of the case. If following the filing of the objection the taxpayer reaches an agreement with the Assessing Officer, the tax assessment shall be amended and a notice of tax served on the taxpayer. If no agreement is reached, the Assessing Officer may determine the tax by issuing a Written Order, which may confirm, increase, or reduce the original tax assessment. If following the conclusion of the statute of limitation period or within one year after the appeal was submitted, whichever is later, no agreement is reached and no Written Order was issued, then the taxpayer's objection shall be deemed to have been accepted.
An appeal of a Written Order may be made by the taxpayer directly to the Israeli district courts. There is no special tax court system in Israel. A decision of the district court may be appealed to the Supreme Court as a court of civil appeals.
Detailed rules apply to the procedural appeal process.
Some key tax issues that the ITA has focused on recently include:

## National insurance contributions
### Resident employees
Employees’ national insurance contribution for resident employees is 1.04% on the first ILS 7,522 of income per month and 7% on the difference between ILS 7,522 and the maximum monthly compensation amount of ILS 50,695.
Employers' national insurance contribution for resident employees is 4.51% on the first ILS 7,522 of income per month and 7.6% on the difference between ILS 7,522 and the maximum monthly compensation amount of ILS 50,695.
### Non-resident employees
Employees’ national insurance contribution for non-resident employees is 0.1% on the first ILS 7,522 of income per month and 0.87% on the difference between ILS 7,522 and the maximum monthly compensation amount of ILS 50,695.
Employers' national insurance contribution for non-resident employees is 0.75% on the first ILS 7,522 of income per month and 2.65% on the difference between ILS 7,522 and the maximum monthly compensation amount of ILS 50,695.
### Special rules and rates
Special detailed rules and rates regarding national insurance contributions apply to irregular salary payments, the self-employed, and to other sources of income generated by an Israeli resident (i.e. rent, interest, dividends, pension, etc.). Capital gains are not subject to national insurance contributions.
## Health insurance tax
Health insurance tax is levied at 3.23% on the first ILS 7,522 and at 5.16% on the difference between ILS 7,522 and the maximum monthly compensation amount of ILS 50,695. Non-residents are not subject to health insurance tax.
Special detailed rules and rates regarding health insurance tax apply to irregular salary payments, the self-employed, and to other sources of income generated by an Israeli resident (i.e. rent, interest, dividends, pension, etc.). Capital gains are not subject to health insurance tax.
## Land appreciation tax (LAT)
LAT is imposed on gains from the sale of Israeli real estate. LAT is also imposed on the sale of an interest in a non-traded real estate association (REA), defined as a company or partnership whose principal assets consist of Israeli real estate. However, the tax liability arising from the sale of such an association will be determined based on the capital gains tax provisions of the Israeli ITO. For LAT purposes, a sale includes most types of dispositions, as well as the grant of a lease capable of lasting for 25 years or more.
In measuring the lease period, an option to lease is considered as if exercised. Detailed expenditure deduction rules are prescribed for LAT purposes.
The resulting taxable capital gain is divided into real and inflationary elements.
The real capital gain is taxable as follows (these guidelines do not apply with respect to the sale of residential apartments in Israel - detailed rules apply):
### Assets purchased from 1 January 2012 and thereafter
The tax rate applicable to real capital gains derived from the sale of an interest in real estate for individuals is 25%. The tax rate applicable to real capital gains derived from the sale of an interest in an REA is 25%, or 30% in the case of a 10% or more shareholder.
### Assets purchased prior to 1 January 2012
### Surtaxes
As of 2025, the portion of an individual's taxable annual income from capital sources (e.g., capital gains, real estate appreciation, dividends, interest, CPI linkage differentials, rental income, passive royalties, etc.) exceeding a certain threshold (NIS 721,560 in 2025) is subject to an additional surtax of 2%. This is in addition to 3% surtax on an individual's annual taxable income from all sources exceeding a certain threshold (NIS 721,560 in 2025).
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
## Net wealth/worth taxes
Israel does not have a net wealth/worth tax.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Israel does not have any estate or inheritance taxation.
Israel does not impose a special gift tax on the gifting of assets.
## Property taxes
Property taxes are generally imposed on the occupier of commercial and residential property. Unoccupied property is generally taxed on the property's owner. The tax is imposed at the municipality level.
## Luxury and excise taxes
Israel imposes an additional 3% on personal income at the highest marginal rate (which increases the highest tax marginal rate from 47% to 50%).
A luxury tax is also imposed on the purchase of certain yachts and luxury cars.
Israel imposes excise taxes on a variety of goods (e.g. gasoline and diesel fuel used for transportation, tobacco, alcohol). The excise taxes are levied item-by-item, and the rates vary.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
Israeli tax residents are taxable on their worldwide income.
Non-resident individuals are subject to income tax on Israeli-source income and to capital gains tax on capital gains from assets situated in Israel (subject to special exemptions for non-residents; *see Capital gains in the [Income determination](israel/individual/income-determination.html) section for more information*). Sourcing rules determine when income is to be regarded as being from an Israeli source.
## Personal income tax rates
Taxation of individuals is imposed in graduated rates ranging up to 47%. Additionally, a 3% surtax applies on annual taxable income exceeding 721,560 Israeli shekels (ILS), resulting in a 50% maximum income tax rate. Non-residents are taxed at the same rates as Israeli residents. The annual tax brackets are an aggregation of the monthly brackets in force during the year, which are periodically updated for inflation. The annual bracket amounts for 2025, expressed in Israeli shekels, are as follows:
| Annual taxable income (ILS) | | Tax on column 1 (ILS) | Tax on excess (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over (column 1) | Not over |
| 0 | 84,120 | 0 | 10 |
| 84,120 | 120,720 | 8,412 | 14 |
| 120,720 | 193,800 | 13,536 | 20 |
| 193,800 | 269,280 | 28,152 | 31 |
| 269,280 | 560,280 | 51,551 | 35 |
| 560,280 | 721,560 | 153,401 | 47 |
| 721,560 |  | 229,203 | 50 |
A minimum tax rate of 31% generally applies to certain classes of passive income not derived from business or employment earned by a taxpayer under age 60.
Most types of interest, dividends, and capital gains have varying, fixed rates of tax set in the Income Tax Ordinance (ITO) (*see the [Income determination](israel/individual/income-determination.html) section for more information*). In this respect, it should be noted that, in addition to such fixed rates, as of 2025, the portion of an individual's annual income from capital sources (e.g., capital gains, real estate appreciation, dividends, interest, CPI linkage differentials, rental income, passive royalties, etc.) exceeding a certain threshold (NIS 721,560 in 2025) is subject to an additional surtax of 2%.
## Local income taxes
There are no local taxes on income in Israel.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
## Taxable period
Tax returns are filed on a calendar-year basis.
## Tax returns
Subject to certain exceptions, *as detailed below*, an individual who is a resident of Israel is required to file an annual tax return. Should a tax return be required, 30 April is the prescribed filing due date, subject to extensions.
A resident taxpayer may not be required to file a tax return for 2025 where tax is withheld at source from one’s wages and at the prescribed levels from other specified sources (e.g. rent, dividends, interest, and capital gains) unless one of the following exceptions apply, in which case the individual would be required to file a tax return (detailed rules apply; certain further exceptions may also be applicable):
These amounts are periodically updated.
Married couples are permitted to file separate or joint returns. In the latter case, a separate calculation may still be obtained for tax on income from personal exertion in any business or vocation or from employment, provided the income is from independent sources.
A non-Israeli tax resident employee will generally not be required to file an Israeli income tax return for 2025 if proper withholdings were remitted to the tax authorities, the employee's 2025 annual income did not exceed ILS 721,560, and the employee had no other Israeli-source income.
## Payment of tax
Payroll withholding of income and social tax is statutory, irrespective of the residence of the employer or employee. In general, withholding taxes in respect of salary payments effected from the 14th day of one month to the 13th day of the following month are payable on the 15th day of that following month.
Tax advances are required to be paid by an individual for interest, dividends, capital gains, and rental income in amounts and according to specific deadlines set out in detailed Israeli tax rules.
Self-employed individuals are generally required to make monthly or bimonthly advance tax payments, usually based on a percentage of turnover.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitation period for taxation of individuals is generally four years from the end of the tax year in which the relevant tax return is filed.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
The following are considered to be resident in Israel:
In the absence of a definition of the term ‘management and control’ either in Israeli legislation or a direct discussion of this term by the Israeli courts, it may be difficult to determine whether a company that is incorporated outside of Israel shall be viewed as managed and controlled from Israel. This is a complex subject that needs to be addressed on a case-by-case basis. When an entity is both an Israeli tax resident and a resident of a foreign jurisdiction that is party to an income tax treaty with Israel, most treaties provide a tiebreaker test in the determination of an entity’s tax residency.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Foreign resident entities might be exempt from corporate tax to the extent that its activities do not constitute a PE under the tax treaty applicable between Israel and the foreign resident’s country of residency.
Whether a non-resident has a taxable presence under Israeli domestic tax law is far less clear than the definition of PE under a relevant tax treaty. There is no detailed legislation or Israeli court decisions that directly address this issue. In general, where there is no tax treaty protection, a non-resident is subject to tax on income accrued or derived in Israel, which is a taxation threshold lower than the PE criterion.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
Costs incurred by a branch or a company are deductible as a business expense for tax purposes where they are incurred ‘wholly and exclusively in the production of income’. The amount of the deduction may be limited or disallowed further to other ITO provisions and income tax regulations.
## Depreciation
The ITO and tax regulations prescribe standard annual rates of tax depreciation for assets serving in the production of taxable income. Depreciation is generally on a straight-line basis for industrial and other enterprises based on the specific asset types as set out in the tax regulations.
Accelerated rates of depreciation may be available in regard to certain activities (such as industrial) where there is unusual wear and tear due to additional shifts of equipment use. Detailed rules apply.
Depreciation is not permitted on land.
## Goodwill
In general, under Israeli tax regulations, goodwill purchased may be amortisable by the purchaser over a ten-year period (10% annually).
## Organisational and start-up expenses
Organisational and start-up expenses are generally not immediately deductible but, rather, are to be capitalised for tax purposes.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses incurred in the production of taxable income are generally deductible. Since there are no thin capitalisation rules in Israel, there are no specific debt-to-equity ratio requirements and there is no limit to the amount of debt that may be used in establishing a branch or local company operation in Israel. Interest and linkage payments arising from late tax payments are generally not deductible for tax purposes. Interest charges between related parties must be set based on transfer pricing principles. Detailed rules apply.
## Bad debt
Provisions for bad debts are deductible in the year in which it is evident that the debt has become irrecoverable. Detailed rules apply for making this determination.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions do not constitute a regular business expense. However, a tax credit may be available (*see Tax credit for donations in the [Tax credits and incentives](tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section*).
Special tax relief is provided under the ITO for R&D costs incurred (*see the [Tax credits and incentives](tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section*).
## Pension expense
Pension fund contributions made to recognised funds are generally deductible for the employer, provided, *inter alia*, the contributions do not exceed a prescribed level and are effected on a regular basis.
## Directors’ fees
Payments for commercially justifiable director fees should generally be deductible.
## Accrued expenses
Payments are generally deductible on an accrual basis for commercially justifiable expenses representing arm’s-length consideration. However, when payments made to foreign residents attract WHT, the deduction will generally be allowed, provided the payment is effected within the tax year. Alternatively, such payments may be deductible in a tax year if the applicable WHT is deducted within three months after the tax year-end and remitted to the tax authorities within seven days of the deduction, together with index linkage differences and interest accrued since the year-end.
However, accrued expenses for severance pay, vacation pay, recreation pay, holiday allowances, and sick pay are not deductible, even if there is an obligation to make these payments. They are only deductible in the year in which they are actually paid to the beneficiary or to a recognised fund.
## Contingent liabilities
Based on Israeli court decisions, contingent liabilities may be deductible for tax purposes upon satisfying the following criterion: (i) according to accepted accounting principles, the taxpayer must include in its balance sheet a suitable provision for the potential liability; otherwise, its income will be considered to have been incorrectly reported; (ii) the circumstances of the case and the technical means according to accepted accounting practice must be provided, enabling a determination of the amount of the liability; and (iii) there is a high probability that the potential debt with respect to which the provision was made will become an absolute debt.
## Excess (disallowed) expenses
Israeli tax law disallows the partial deduction of certain employee-related expenses incurred by a company doing business in Israel. These include so-called ‘excess expenses’. Examples of these are (i) payments for business, travel, and meals that exceed allowable deductions; (ii) expenses incurred in respect of a benefit granted by an employer to its employees but that cannot be attributed to a particular employee; and (iii) certain vehicle maintenance expenses (all expenses relating to a company-owned vehicle that was also designated for use of an employee are generally tax deductible as the employee is taxed in this regard upon an imputed amount).
A company is obligated to pay a monthly advance on excess expenses in the amount of 45% of the excess expense. The amount paid as an advance in respect of excess expenses is deemed a payment on account of the regular tax advances and payments that the company must pay for corporate tax and is offset against them, but it is not refundable (i.e. when a taxpayer’s tax liability in a given year is lower than the excess expense advances paid, the unutilised amount shall be carried forward to future tax years). Detailed rules apply.
## Fines and penalties
Payment of fines and penalties are generally not deductible.
## Taxes
Municipality taxes incurred in the production of taxable income are generally deductible.
## Net operating losses
Business losses can be offset against income from any source in the same year. Loss carrybacks are not allowed. Losses may be carried forward and set-off without time limit against income from any trade or business or capital gains arising in the business, but not against income from any other source.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments of interest, royalties, and management fees to foreign affiliates are deductible if based on normal commercial terms and practices and evidenced by an inter-company agreement and transfer pricing documentation. Where such payments attract WHT, the deduction will only be allowed where such tax has been withheld and paid in accordance with certain requirements. All cross-border payments to foreign affiliates for goods and services have to comply with arm’s-length pricing standards (*see Transfer pricing in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*).

As a general rule, a parent company and its subsidiaries may not submit consolidated tax returns. Only groups of industrial companies in the same line of business, as well as parent companies that control industrial companies in the same line of business and have at least 80% of their assets invested in industrial companies, are eligible to file consolidated tax returns.

A taxpayer is required to include in its annual corporate tax return a special form entitled ‘Declaration of International Transactions’ providing details for every cross-border transaction conducted with related parties. In December 2022, the ITA updated the transfer pricing form that is submitted annually within the tax return of an Israeli taxpayer reporting each inter-company transaction. This form includes requirements to disclose whether or not the company is following local safe harbour rules relevant to certain activities, and a new disclosure as to whether the company has local compliant transfer pricing documentation for the reported related-party transaction.  As each form needs to be signed by the taxpayer, companies will need to carefully consider their local Israeli documentation compliance in respect to this increased disclosure within the corporate tax return.
In 2022, Israeli transfer pricing legislation has been amended to include two new sections adding the requirement for a Country-by-Country (CBC) Report and setting the legal foundation for a Master File requirement. With both of these amendments, Israel has now joined the many countries that have formally adopted requirements aligned with Action 13 of the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative and as detailed within Chapter V of the OECD Guidelines.
Since transfer pricing is a subject that receives considerable attention from the ITA in its examination of related inter-company transactions, transfer pricing principles and documentation requirements should be carefully adhered to.
## Thin capitalisation
Israel has no statutory or regulatory provisions or other rules concerning thin capitalisation for tax purposes as exist in certain other jurisdictions. Since there are no thin capitalisation rules and Israel has no specific debt-to-equity ratio requirements, a company may be financed with minimum capital, and there is no limit to the amount of debt that may be used. Transfer pricing principles shall generally apply with regards to interest charges.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Under the CFC regime in Israeli tax law, an Israeli company or individual may be taxed on a proportion of certain undistributed profits of certain Israeli-controlled, non-resident companies in which the Israeli shareholder has a controlling interest (10% or more of any of the CFC’s ‘means of control’). A CFC is a company to which a number of cumulative conditions apply, including that most of its income or profits in the tax year were derived from passive sources (e.g. capital gains, interest, rental, dividend, royalties) and such passive income has been subject to an effective tax rate that does not exceed 15%.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
A branch is liable for tax at the standard corporate rate on Israel-source income. No tax is withheld on transfers of after-tax profits to the foreign head office upon receiving a withholding tax (WHT) clearance from the Israel Tax Authority (ITA).

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
## Foreign tax credit
Double taxation is avoided by way of a foreign tax credit mechanism that also applies unilaterally in the absence of an applicable DTT. The foreign tax credit is limited to the Israeli corporate tax payable with respect to the same income. Foreign-sourced income is divided into 'baskets' (i.e. categories) on the basis of the income source (e.g. dividends, business income), and a particular credit limitation applies to each basket. Excess uncredited foreign income can be carried forward for the subsequent five tax years.
## Preferred Enterprise (PFE) regime
PFE status, which provides for tax benefits, may be granted under the Law of Encouragement of Capital Investments (‘the Law’) to enterprises that meet relevant criteria. In general, the Law provides that projects are considered ‘preferred’ if the enterprise will contribute to the development of the productive capacity of the economy, absorption of immigrants, creation of employment opportunities, or improvement in the balance of payments.
### Eligible income (qualifying PFE income)
In order to qualify as a PFE, a company must, *inter alia*, generate ‘preferred income’, as defined in Section 51 of the Law, which is income that was produced or arose in the course of the enterprise's ordinary activity in Israel, excluding income from an intangible asset, which is not attributed to manufacturing (specific rules apply), and if it was produced by a Preferred Technology Enterprise (*as described below*) it was not considered as Qualifying Preferred Technology Enterprise income. To qualify it must be from one or more of the below types of income:
1. Income from the sale of products manufactured in that factory.
2. Income from the sales of products that are semiconductors produced in another factory, which is not owned by a relative of the owner of the factory, according to know-how developed by the factory.
3. Income from granting permission to use know-how or computer software developed by the enterprise, as well as income from royalties received for the said use that the Director of the Israeli Tax Authority approved is connected to the productive activities of the enterprise in Israel.
4. Income from services connected to sales as stated in (i) and (ii) above, and also from services connected to the right to use know-how or computer software or to the royalties stated in (iii).
5. Income from industrial R&D for a foreign resident, provided there has been given an approval from the Israeli Innovation Authority.
### Marketing and economic qualifying factors
In order to qualify for tax benefits under the Law, the Law requires that the enterprise will be considered as an industrial enterprise (i.e. an enterprise whose main activity in the tax year is a productive activity) and will meet one of the following conditions each year:
### Corporate tax rates
The PFE corporate tax rate is 7.5% for operations in ‘development area A’ and 16% for operations outside development area A.
R&D centres will not be entitled to any reduced corporate tax rate if the direct or indirect controlling shareholders or the direct or indirect beneficiaries (entitled to 25% or more of the income or profits of the R&D centre) are Israeli residents.
### Dividend WHT rate
The WHT rate applicable to dividends from PFE profits is 20%, which may be reduced under certain tax treaties.
## Special Preferred Enterprise (SPFE) regime
### Key eligibility conditions
The SPFE regime is intended for very large companies with material investments in productive assets, R&D, or in providing new employment opportunities. A company must demonstrate that it will greatly contribute to the Israeli economy to qualify for the SPFE regime.
To qualify, an Israeli company must meet certain conditions, such as having SPFE annual revenue greater than or equal to ILS 1 billion and being part of a group of companies that generates annual revenues greater than or equal to ILS 10 billion in the same industrial sector in which the Israeli company operates.
### Corporate tax rates
The SPFE corporate tax rate is 5% for operations in development area A and 8% for operations outside of development area A for ten years. After ten years, the PFE tax rates shall apply unless the company has a new investment program that requalifies the company again for SPFE status.
### Dividend WHT rate
The WHT rate applicable to dividends from SPFE profits continues to be 20%, which may be reduced under certain tax treaties.
## Preferred Technology Enterprise (PTE) regime
### Key eligibility conditions
To be eligible for the PTE regime, a company must engage in the technology sector and be part of a group of companies with aggregate annual revenues less than ILS 10 billion and meet one of the following two tests:
Qualifying PTE income is such income that is derived by the enterprise in the ordinary course of its business from preferred intangible assets that are wholly or partially owned by the enterprise or that the enterprise has a right to use and includes, *inter alia*, income from the following sources:
Income that is not treated as qualifying income includes, *inter alia*, the following:
Detailed definitional rules apply.
### Corporate tax rates
Under the PTE regime, reduced corporate tax rates of 7.5% for operations in development area A or 12% for operations outside of development area A shall apply on qualifying income, subject to detailed rules. These corporate tax rates shall apply only with respect to the portion of intellectual property (IP) developed in Israel, based on a nexus approach.
### Capital gain on sale of IP
Companies that sell IP to a related foreign company may qualify for a reduced 12% capital gains tax rate, provided that the company acquired the IP from a foreign company after 1 January 2017 for at least ILS 200 million, subject to the approval of the Israeli Innovation Authority.
### Dividend WHT rate
A reduced 4% WHT rate may apply to dividends paid to a foreign company, provided that at least 90% of the payer's shares are held by foreign resident companies.
For other dividend distributions, the WHT rate shall be 20%, which may be reduced under certain tax treaties.
## Special Preferred Technology Enterprise (SPTE) regime
### Key eligibility conditions
To be eligible for the SPTE regime, a company must meet the eligibility conditions of a PTE above and be part of a group of companies with aggregate annual revenues of at least ILS 10 billion.
### Corporate tax rates
Under the SPTE regime, a reduced corporate tax rate of 6% shall apply on qualifying income, subject to detailed qualifying rules. The reduced tax rate shall apply only with respect to the portion of IP developed in Israel based on a nexus approach.
### Capital gain on sale of IP
Companies that sell IP to a related foreign company may qualify for a reduced 6% capital gains tax rate, provided that the company developed or acquired the IP from a foreign company after 1 January 2017, subject to the approval of the Israeli Innovation Authority.
### Dividend WHT rate
The dividend WHT rates are the same as under the PTE regime, *discussed above*.
## Approved Enterprise (AE) grants
Under the Law, an AE operating in ’development area A‘ may be eligible for grants on investments in fixed assets from the Israeli Investments centre, at a rate of 20% of the approved investment. An AE operating in some areas in the North of Israel, in Gaza strip, and in the Negev area may be eligible for an additional grant of up to 10% of the approved investment. Detailed rules apply.
## Approved Enterprise (AE) and Benefitted Enterprise (BE) regimes (for companies established prior to 2011)
Prior to the enactment of the incentive regimes addressed above, there were other incentive regimes that allowed for a variety of tax benefits.
The AE and BE regimes discussed below were tax incentive programs granted to operations qualifying under the Law prior to the Law's amendments in 2005 and 2011. The AE and BE regimes included, in some cases, a temporary tax benefit that income generated was tax exempt from corporate tax until such time that the income was distributed from the enterprise, which triggered, at that time, a claw-back of corporate tax.
As some companies may still have income subject to the rules of prior regimes, we set out below certain key tax highlights.
### Reduced tax rates
In addition to financial incentives for the establishment or expansion of an AE/BE, various tax incentives apply when a new AE/BE or expansion thereof is operational.
The reduced tax rates generally apply for a seven-year benefit period (or a ten-year period in certain cases of local companies established in development area A or in the case of a foreign investor company, *see below*), commencing with the year in which the AE/BE first generated taxable income.
Generally, this seven or ten-year period of benefits is limited to 12 years from the year of implementation. For AE plans governed prior to the 2005 amendment to the Law, the period of benefits cannot extend beyond 12 years from the year the enterprise commenced its operations or beyond 14 years from the year in which approval of status as an AE was granted, whichever is earlier.
### Locally owned companies
Income derived by a company from an AE/BE during the maximum seven-year period of benefits is generally subject to corporate tax at a rate of 25%.
A WHT rate of 15% (subject to a possible reduction under a tax treaty) applies to dividends paid from profits of an AE/BE earned during the benefits period if distributed either during the benefits period or during the subsequent 12 years.
### Foreign investors’ companies (FICs)
A company that qualifies as an FIC is entitled to enhanced tax benefits on AE/BE income. In general, an FIC is a company having more than 25% of its share capital (in terms of rights to shares, profits, voting, and the appointment of directors) and its combined share capital and investor loan capital owned by foreign residents. To qualify for FIC status, a foreign investor must make an investment in the company of at least ILS 5 million.
An FIC benefits from reduced corporate tax on the profits of an AE/BE for a period of ten years (instead of seven years) commencing with the first year in which taxable income is generated. The total period of benefits is restricted as discussed above. The reduced corporate tax rate depends on the level of foreign ownership as shown below:
| Percentage of foreign ownership | Corporate tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Over 25% but less than 49% | 25 |
| 49% or more but less than 74% | 20 |
| 74% or more but less than 90% | 15 |
| 90% or more | 10 |
Dividends paid by an FIC out of the profits of its AE/BE are subject to tax in the hands of the recipient at the rate of 15% (subject to a reduced tax rate under an applicable tax treaty), without limitation as to their distribution date, provided the dividends are distributed out of AE/BE profits derived during the benefits period.
### Alternative system of tax benefits (tax holiday)
Companies with new or expanding AEs/BEs were entitled to elect to forego all government cash grants and receive, instead, a total exemption (i.e. tax holiday) from corporate tax on undistributed profits of the AE/BE for ten years in development area A, for six years in development area B, and for two years in development area C. The area of incentive is the area in which the company’s facilities are located.
The tax holiday provides an Israeli tax exemption so long as the AE/BE profits generated in the exemption period are retained within the company. Should a subsequent distribution of such profits occur, corporate tax and dividend WHT is imposed on the income distributed, at the rates which would have been applicable if the tax holiday had not been elected (i.e. 25% or at a lower rate if the company is an FIC with a foreign ownership percentage of 49% or more during those years).
Israeli companies who distribute tax-exempt profits generated in their Approved and Benefitted Enterprise regimes of the Encouragement Law ('trapped profits') are generally subject to a claw-back of the corporate tax deferred on those profits at rates of 10% to 25% upon distribution. In order to encourage companies to release their 'trapped profits' accumulated until 31 December 2020, the Budget Law passed in November 2021 included special legislation (the Trapped Profits Law) that allows 'trapped profits' upon distribution to be entitled to a reduction of up to 40% of the corporate tax rate but not less than a 6% corporate tax rate. This applies for distributions made during a one-year period starting from 15 November 2021.
The Trapped Profits Law, however, eliminated the ability of companies upon distribution of profits to determine that the pool of profits being distributed should not be attributed to tax exempted profits, which had prevented the triggering of the claw-back of tax on the distribution. Under the new legislation, effective for profits distributed from 15 August 2021, all dividends distributed by a company that have 'trapped profits' shall be required to recognise a portion of the dividend as being sourced from the 'trapped profits', which shall trigger the claw-back of corporate tax. The determined amount shall be based on the proportion of 'trapped profits' to all company profits available for distribution.
The Trapped Profits Law has not been renewed but should be monitored for developments.
Under certain anti-avoidance provisions applicable to tax holidays, amounts directly or indirectly paid or credited by an AE to a relative, a major shareholder, or to a related entity controlled by either a relative or a major shareholder may be treated as a deemed taxable distribution of profits by the AE.
### Ireland track and strategic investment track
For companies having an AE/BE in development area A that seeks to distribute dividends while maintaining a low company and dividend tax burden, there was an ‘Ireland track’ under which the aggregate Israeli corporate and dividend WHT for a foreign resident shareholder is 15% and for an Israeli resident shareholder is 24.8%. This track is in contrast to the standard alternative benefit track discussed above, which provides a tax holiday, provided that profits remain undistributed.
Furthermore, a ‘strategic investment track’ allowed for an exemption during the benefit period from corporate tax and dividend WHT for a company having (depending on its location within area A of the country) very significant investment and revenue levels. This means that during the benefits period, a company eligible for benefits from income accrued under this track will have no tax liability whatsoever for its productive activity arising from such investment and for the distribution of profits. Detailed rules apply to these tracks.
## Incentives for investments in technological companies
The Law for the Encouragement of Knowledge-Intensive Industry (‘**the New Angel's Law**‘) entered into force on 25 July 2023 and is a special law that encourages investment in the Israeli high-tech industry. The New Angel's Law provides different tracks for private investors and for technological companies investing in other technological companies, Israeli or foreign, under certain conditions. The main benefit tracks in the New Angels Law are the following:
### Benefits for private investors
Under the New Angel's Law, private investors (including partnerships established for the purpose of investing in a specific company and some minimal-shareholder companies [detailed rules apply]) can be eligible for a tax credit equal to the capital gains tax rate relevant to the investor multiplied by the investment amount in an Israeli ’R&D Company‘. The maximum investment amount in a specific ’R&D Company‘ is ILS 4 million. Additional detailed rules apply.
An ‘R&D company’ is an Israeli Company, which is not traded, that meets certain conditions, including, among others:
Alternatively, such private investors can be eligible for a postponement in payment of capital gains tax in selling shares of a ’Qualifying Company‘ (a ’Preferred Company‘ with a PTE) in the event of performing an alternative investment in one or more ’R&D Company‘ in the period of 12 months from the sale or in the four months before it. The amount that the investor can deduct in the capital gain tax calculation is the least from the real capital gain from the sale / the investment amount in the ’R&D company‘ / ILS 5.5 million.
Both tracks are subject to receiving auditor's approvals for meeting the conditions of an ’R&D Company’.
### Benefits for technological companies investing in other technological companies
Under the New Angel's Law, technological companies (a ‘Preferred Company’ with a PTE) investing in other technological companies, Israeli or foreign, can be entitled to deduct their investment, over five years, starting the year after gaining ’control‘ (at least 80%) of the purchased technological company.
In the event that the purchased company is an Israeli technological company, it needs to be a ’Preferred Company‘ with a PTE that owns a ’preferred intangible asset‘ and that was not related to the purchasing company in the year before the year of the investment.
In the event that the purchased company is a foreign company, (i) it needs to own a ’preferred intangible asset‘, (ii) its R&D expenses must exceed  7% of its income (if the percentage is between 5% and 7%, an approval can be received from the Israeli Innovation Authority), (iii) its R&D expenses must  be at least ILS 20 million;  (iv) the foreign company must not be related to the purchasing company from the day it incorporated; and (v) the IP and activity of the purchased company must be transferred to Israel in a period of 12 months from the investment as part of a ’business combination‘ (as defined in the regulations to the Law).
In addition, when the purchased company is a foreign company, an approval from the Israeli Innovation Authority is needed and the investment amount needs to be at least 20 million United States dollars (USD). Additional detailed rules apply.
### Exemption on interest paid to a qualifying Israeli high-tech company to a foreign financial institution
An exemption for interest, as well as income from discount on a loan (and foreign exchange gains), is available in qualifying cases further to the New Angel's Law.
There are detailed qualifying rules, including, *inter alia*, the following:
### Deduction of R&D costs
Under special relief provided under the ITO, which was enacted for the purpose of encouraging taxpayers to invest in R&D activities, R&D costs can generally be deductible for tax purposes even when they represent capital costs.
The ITO provision generally distinguishes between two types of investors in R&D projects:
In regard to the first group of taxpayers, the R&D expenses shall be deducted in the tax year incurred when such expense has been approved as an R&D expense by the relevant government department (the approval in regard to industrial related projects is generally granted by the Israeli Innovation Authority [previously called the Office of the Chief Scientist]). When such approval is not obtained, the expense shall be deducted over three tax years.
The R&D expenses incurred by the second group of taxpayers shall generally be deducted over two tax years. The deductible expenses allowed to a participant in R&D costs of another developer generally may not exceed 40% of the taxable income of the investor in the year in which the expenses had been incurred.
## Tax credit for donations
A tax credit is granted in respect of donations to approved state and charitable institutions aggregating at least ILS 207 (for 2025) in a tax year. The donor is allowed a tax credit equal to the amount of the contribution times the corporate tax rate applicable during the year, provided the amount eligible for the credit does not exceed the lower of the following: (i) 30% of the corporation’s taxable income in that year or (ii) ILS 10,354,816 (in 2025). The above figures are adjusted each year according to the CPI. Excess unused tax credits may be carried forward for three years, subject to detailed rules.
## Incentive to promote foreign investment in Israeli corporate bonds
In order to promote foreign investment in the Israeli corporate bonds market, there is an exemption from tax with respect to interest income received by foreign investors on their commercial investments in Israeli corporate bonds traded on the Tel Aviv stock exchange (TASE). The exemption is not granted to a foreign investor that has a PE in Israel or is related to, or holds 10% more of the means of control in, the investee company. In addition, in order for the exemption to apply to a foreign investor that has ‘special relations’ with the investee company, regularly sells products to or provides services to the investee company, or is employed by the investee company, the investor must prove that the interest rate on the corporate bond was determined in good faith.

## Choice of business entities
Investments and business operations in Israel may be structured in a variety of ways. The following are the common types of business entities in Israel: (i) Israeli public or private company; (ii) foreign company in Israel (i.e. a branch); (iii) Israeli general or limited partnership; (iv) foreign general or limited partnership; (v) other entities such as cooperative societies; and (vi) other arrangements (e.g. contractual joint ventures).
## Mergers and acquisitions
Israeli tax law allows for non-taxable reorganisations in situations in which the ownership and business enterprise of the original parties is continued after the reorganisation takes place, allowing for the deferral of the tax liability until the shares or assets transferred in such reorganisations are actually sold. Different qualifying requirements and conditions apply (e.g. obtaining a ruling from the ITA in certain cases), depending upon the tax residency of the parties and the type of transfer.
## US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) in Israel
A Model Reciprocal Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) was signed by Israel and the United States on 30 June 2014 and was ratified on 12 July 2016. The IGA took effect on 4 August 2016, once the Ministry of Finance published the relevant tax code regulations.
The IGA provides clarity around the implementation of FATCA for the financial institutions and investment entities resident in Israel.
In addition, the ITA released FATCA Guidance in May 2017.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS) in Israel
Israel has been implementing the CRS since 2019. The FATCA law that was passed by the Knesset (Israeli Parliament) on 12 July 2016 also serves as the primary legislation for purposes of the CRS. The secondary legislation (Israeli Tax Code CRS Regulations) was approved by the Finance Committee of the Knesset on 1 January 2019. Israeli financial institutions submitted their first CRS returns in 2019, covering both 2017 and 2018 years.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
## Employment expenses
Employees are entitled to relatively few deductions. However, subsistence expenses if required to travel out of town and subsistence expenses abroad may be deducted in accordance with detailed rules.
Contributions to an approved provident fund and a training fund are deductible up to predetermined limits for the self-employed and certain employees.
## Personal deductions
Mortgage interest and medical expenses are not deductible. Charitable contributions are not deductible, but a tax credit may be allowed (*see the [Other tax credits and incentives](other-tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for more information*).
Tax credits and deductions are granted for certain payments for life insurance premiums and payments to provident and pension funds.
## Personal allowances
In Israel, personal allowances take the form of tax credits (*see the [Other tax credits and incentives](other-tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for more information*).
## Business deductions
Business expenses deductible from business-source income must be incurred wholly and exclusively during the tax year for the purposes of producing this income.
Self-employed individuals are subject to special rules for determining the deductibility of expenditure on the maintenance of private and small commercial vehicles, as well as other expenditures, such as telephone costs when the business is conducted from the taxpayer's house.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
## Employment income
Under Israeli sourcing rules, employment income is regarded as being sourced at the place where the related work is performed. Accordingly, employment income derived by a foreign resident relating to the employee's performance of services in Israel would be subject to Israeli taxation, unless a tax treaty exemption is available in accordance with the relevant double tax treaty (DTT).
The definition of taxable employment income is broadly defined in the ITO and covers salary, bonuses, cost of living allowances, tax equalisation payments, and virtually all types of fringe benefits (including benefits from stock-based compensation plans). The value of the use of an employer provided car as set in Israeli tax regulations is also included as employment income.
Israeli taxation of security-based compensation for employees who relocate to or from Israel is a complex subject matter whose taxation depends upon the specific facts and circumstances of the benefit plan and the person's period of residency in Israel.
Employer contributions to approved pension and benefit schemes and to further education funds are exempt from income tax (subject to certain requirements and maximum levels of contribution).
## Capital gains
Capital gains tax is generally payable on capital gains by residents of Israel on the sale of assets (irrespective of the location of the assets) and by non-residents on the sale of the following:
The cashless transfer of rights and assets arising from certain mergers, spin-offs, and asset transfers may be exempt from tax upon meeting various requirements.
### Determination of the capital gain
Tax on capital gains is imposed on the disposal of fixed and intangible assets where the disposal price is in excess of the depreciated cost.
### Computation of real gain and inflationary components
For tax purposes, the capital gain is generally calculated in local currency, and there are provisions for segregating the taxable gain into its real and inflationary components. The inflationary amount is the original cost of the asset, less depreciation (where applicable), multiplied by the percentage increase in the Israeli consumer price index (CPI) from the date of acquisition of the asset to the date of its sale. The inflationary amount component is exempt to the extent it accrued after 1 January 1994 and is generally subject to tax at the rate of 10% if it accrued before that date.
The real gain component, if any, will be taxed at the rates set out further below, plus the 3% surtax, if applicable.
A non-resident who invests in capital assets with foreign currency may elect to calculate the inflationary amount in that foreign currency. Under this option, in the event of a sale of shares in an Israeli company, the inflationary amount attributable to exchange differences on the investment is always exempt from Israeli tax. In respect of a security held by an individual that is denominated in foreign currency or value-linked to a foreign currency, the currency exchange rate shall be deemed the index rate.
### Traded and non-traded securities acquired from 1 January 2003 and thereafter
The real gain, if any, realised upon the sale of shares purchased on or after 1 January 2003 is generally taxed at a rate of 25% for individuals. This rate is increased to 30% where the seller was a 10% or more shareholder at the date of sale or during any of the 12 months preceding the sale; detailed definitional rules apply (hereinafter ‘10% or more shareholder’).
### Traded and non-traded securities acquired before 2003
A blended tax rate shall apply, as follows:
### Special rule for retained profits upon sale of shares
Special provisions apply to part of the real gain that is attributed to the seller’s share of retained profits in the case of a sale of (i) non-traded shares that were acquired prior to 1 January 2003 or (ii) publicly traded shares where the seller was a 10% or more shareholder.
The share of ‘retained profits’ is the amount of gain equal to the proportional part of the retained profits of the company that the seller of the shares would have rights to by virtue of those shares. Detailed rules apply in determining this profit component.
### Special exemptions for non-residents
Non-resident are exempt from tax on capital gains from a sale of shares of an Israeli company traded on the Israeli stock exchange or on a foreign stock exchange.
For non-traded shares of an Israeli company acquired from 1 January 2009 and thereafter, a non-resident shall be exempt from tax on capital gains, provided that the following conditions are met:
For non-traded shares acquired in the period 2005 to 2008, the exemption is also conditioned on the seller having been a resident of a tax treaty country for at least ten years prior to the sale, the seller filing a tax report in their local country of residency reporting the sale, and that notice of the purchase of the shares was given by the person to the ITA within 30 days of the purchase of the security, and subject to additional conditions. Detailed rules apply.
A foreign resident may also be exempt from Israeli capital gains tax under the provisions of an applicable tax treaty.
### Surtaxes
As of 2025, the portion of an individual's taxable annual income from capital sources (e.g., capital gains, real estate appreciation, dividends, interest, CPI linkage differentials, rental income, passive royalties, etc.) exceeding a certain threshold (NIS 721,560 in 2025) is subject to an additional surtax of 2%. This is in addition to 3% surtax on an individual's annual taxable income from all sources exceeding a certain threshold (NIS 721,560 in 2025).
## Capital losses
Capital losses may offset all capital gains (including gains from Israeli or foreign securities) and gains from the sale of property (whether Israeli or foreign source).
Where the capital loss is from a non-Israeli asset, the loss must first be offset against foreign-source capital gains.
Capital losses derived from the sale of securities may also be offset against interest and dividend income generated from the sold security and also against interest and dividend income received from other securities (where the income was not subject to tax of more than 25%).
Capital losses can generally be carried forward indefinitely and set off only against capital gains. Capital losses carried forward from the sale of a foreign asset should first be offset against foreign-source capital gains arising in the carryforward year.
## Exit tax
When an Israeli tax resident ceases to be an Israeli resident for tax purposes, the individual's assets shall be deemed to have been sold one day before the individual ceased being an Israeli resident.
Any gain attributable to the deemed sale of assets may be paid on the day the residency ceased or it may be postponed until the date the assets are actually realised. The amount of the Israeli capital gain portion shall be determined by taking the real capital gain at the time of realisation, multiplied by the period of ownership from the day on which it acquired the asset until the day it ceased being an Israeli resident, divided by the entire period from the day of the asset's acquisition until the day or realisation. The Minister of Finance has been authorised to prescribe provisions for the implementation of the exit tax, including provisions for the prevention of double taxation and the submission of tax reports, but no provisions have yet been issued.
## Dividend income
Dividends shall generally be subject to tax at the rate of 25% (or 30% in the case of a 10% or more shareholder).
For a non-resident, the tax rate may be reduced by an applicable tax treaty.
A 15% to 20% rate generally applies for dividends distributed from certain enterprises qualifying under The Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments. A lower rate for non-residents may be available for distributions from certain types of qualifying enterprises and also under a relevant tax treaty.
Under the controlled foreign corporation (CFC) regime in Israeli tax law, an Israeli individual may be taxed on a proportion of the undistributed profits of certain Israeli-controlled non-resident companies in which the Israeli shareholder has a controlling interest (10% or more of any of the CFC’s ‘means of control’). A CFC is a company to which a number of cumulative conditions apply. These include the fact that most of its income or profits in the tax year derive from passive sources (e.g. capital gains, interest, rental, dividend, royalties) and such passive income has been subject to an effective tax rate that does not exceed 15%.
As of 2025, the portion of an individual's taxable annual income from capital sources (e.g., capital gains, real estate appreciation, dividends, interest, CPI linkage differentials, rental income, passive royalties, etc.) exceeding a certain threshold (NIS 721,560 in 2025) is subject to an additional surtax of 2%. This is in addition to 3% surtax on an individual's annual taxable income from all sources exceeding a certain threshold (NIS 721,560 in 2025).
## Cash withdrawals or personal use of company assets
Withdrawals from a company by a 10% or more shareholder of (i) cash whose accumulated balance during any year exceeds ILS 100,000 (including certain shareholder loans and guarantees) or (ii) the personal use by such shareholder of an apartment, art, jewellery, airplanes, or boats owned by the company (or of other company assets as will be published by the Finance Ministry) shall be taxed to the shareholder as a dividend, as salary in the case where the company has no retained earnings and there is an employer-relationship, or as other taxable income. These rules also apply when the recipient is a relative of the 10% or more shareholder as defined in the tax law.
For cash withdrawals, the tax event will arise if the withdrawn money has not been repaid to the company by the end of the tax year following the tax year in which the withdrawal was made. When there is a use of other company assets, the tax event shall be at the end of each tax year in which the asset was used for personal use until the asset is returned to the company.
Detailed rules apply.
## Interest income
Interest income shall generally be subject to tax at a rate of 25%.
Interest from investments in financial institutions or in traded securities that are not linked to the CPI may be eligible for a 15% rate.
For a non-resident, the tax rate may be reduced under an applicable tax treaty.
Interest paid to a non-resident from deposits of foreign currency with an Israel bank is exempt from tax, subject to certain conditions.
In order to promote foreign investment in the Israeli corporate bonds market, an exemption from tax is provided with respect to interest income received by foreign investors on or after 1 January 2009 on their commercial investments in Israeli corporate bonds traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE), subject to certain conditions.
As of 2025, the portion of an individual's taxable annual income from capital sources (e.g., capital gains, real estate appreciation, dividends, interest, CPI linkage differentials, rental income, passive royalties, etc.) exceeding a certain threshold (NIS 721,560 in 2025) is subject to an additional surtax of 2%. This is in addition to 3% surtax on an individual's annual taxable income from all sources exceeding a certain threshold (NIS 721,560 in 2025).
## Rental income
For rental income from residential property abroad, the rate is 15%.
Depreciation is generally allowable on a straight-line basis for expenditures on buildings, but not on land. Detailed rules apply.
Passive losses from leasing a building may only be used to offset rental income from the same building in future years, or land appreciation realised upon disposal of that building. Detailed rules apply.
Losses from an active property rental business operation may be used to offset other taxable income in the same year from any source, or against future active business income and certain capital gains.
As of 2025, the portion of an individual's taxable annual income from capital sources (e.g., capital gains, real estate appreciation, dividends, interest, CPI linkage differentials, rental income, passive royalties, etc.) exceeding a certain threshold (NIS 721,560 in 2025) is subject to an additional surtax of 2%. This is in addition to 3% surtax on an individual's annual taxable income from all sources exceeding a certain threshold (NIS 721,560 in 2025).

## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
## Personal tax credits
Residents are entitled to personal tax credits against their tax liabilities according to their status. Each point is worth ILS 242 per month, with resident individuals being entitled to a minimum of 2.25 points. Additional points are granted for, among other items, dependent children, new immigrants, and single-parent families.
Foreign residents are not entitled to personal tax credits.
## Charitable contributions
Donations to recognised public institutions entitle the taxpayer to a tax credit of 35% from donations that in aggregate are not less than ILS 207, provided the donations do not exceed 30% of annual taxable income or ILS 10,354,816, whichever is less. Excess donation amounts can be carried forward for three years under certain circumstances.
## Tax benefits for new immigrants and returning residents
New immigrants and returning residents (who were foreign residents for a continuous period of at least ten years and returned to Israel to become an Israeli tax resident after such period) may enjoy the following tax benefits upon becoming tax resident in Israel (returning residents from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2009 may enjoy these benefits where they were foreign resident for at least five years):
Pursuant to certain transition provisions, an individual will qualify for the above benefits if one has returned to Israeli tax resident status in 2007, 2008, or 2009 after having been a foreign resident for a continuous period of at least five years (rather than requiring the above mentioned ten-year period).
A returning resident, who was a foreign resident for only six years before returning to Israeli residency status, shall enjoy the following:
Detailed rules apply to the above provisions. This subject matter is complex and requires review of each person's specific facts and circumstances.
## Special deductions for qualifying expatriates
'Foreign expert’ status is granted to a non-resident who, while abroad, has been invited by an Israeli individual or by an Israeli resident entity (not being a manpower company or temporary agency) to perform services in their area of expertise for the inviting party and meets the following conditions:
Additional qualifying conditions apply.
A non-resident who is granted ‘foreign expert’ status is entitled to deduct from Israeli taxable income the following items for a period not exceeding 12 months of employment in Israel:
'Approved specialists’ (non-residents approved by the director of the Investment Centre at the Ministry of Industry and Trade), provided they are experts who possess skills not readily available locally, are taxed at a maximum rate of 25% on their earnings for a period of three years, with a possible extension of up to a further five years. They are also entitled to the benefits available to foreign experts in the first 12 months. Approval is generally given on income up to 75,000 United States dollars (USD) *per annum*.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
The ITO defines an Israeli resident as a person whose ‘centre of life’ is in Israel. Various factors are analysed in determining where the individual’s centre of life is located.
In addition, the following are refutable (by either the tax officer or the taxpayer) presumptions regarding the determination of an individual’s ‘centre of life’:
It should be emphasised that the main defining test under the ITO remains the ‘centre of life’ test. The presumptions mentioned above (regarding the length of stay in Israel) will merely assist in reaching a conclusion. Even if the ‘days tests’ provided by these presumptions are not met, it may still be concluded that the individual is an Israeli tax resident.
A ‘foreign tax resident’ is generally defined in the ITO as anyone who is not considered an Israeli tax resident and also includes an individual who has met the following tests:
Therefore, when an individual will meet the 183 days test for the first two years (without necessarily meeting the centre of life test during the first two years) and the centre of life test during the next two years, the person would be regarded as a foreign tax resident for this entire period.
In order to allow individuals moving to Israel to reach an informed decision about where they wish to live, a new immigrant and a returning resident (following ten years of foreign residency) are entitled to a one-year acclimation period from the date of their arrival. During this year, these individuals can request not to be considered a resident of Israel for income tax purposes. This election request requires the person to notify the Israel Tax Authority (ITA) within 90 days of arriving in Israel. Detailed rules apply.
When an Israeli tax resident ceases to be an Israeli resident for tax purposes, exit tax provisions apply (*see Exit tax in the [Income determination](income-determination.html) section for further information*).
