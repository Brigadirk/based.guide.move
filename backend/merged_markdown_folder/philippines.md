The VAT is based on the gross sales representing the contract price, compensation, service fee, rental, or royalty, including the amount charged for materials supplied with the services and deposits and advanced payments actually or constructively received during the taxable period/quarter for the services performed or to be performed for another person, excluding VAT.

## Inventory valuation
Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Last in first out (LIFO) is not allowed for tax purposes. Generally, the inventory valuation method for tax purposes must conform to that used for financial reporting purposes.
## Capital gains
## Dividend income
Dividends received by a domestic or resident foreign corporation from another domestic corporation are not subject to tax. These dividends are excluded from the taxable income of the recipient.
### Stock dividends
A Philippine corporation can distribute stock dividends tax-free, proportionately to all shareholders. The subsequent cancellation or redemption of such stocks, however, shall be taxable to the extent that it represents a distribution of earnings.
## Interest income
Interest on bank savings, time deposits, deposit substitutes, and money market placements received by domestic or resident foreign corporations from a domestic corporation are subject to a final tax of 20%, while interest income derived from FCDU deposits is subject to a final tax of 15%. Such income is excluded from gross income reportable in CIT returns.
Interest income of FCDUs from foreign currency loans granted by depository banks to residents other than OBUs or other FCDUs of depository banks shall be subject to 10% tax. The preferential tax for OBUs is repealed under the CREATE Law.
## Royalty income
Royalties received by domestic or resident foreign corporations from a domestic corporation are subject to a final tax of 20%.
## Other significant items
Other items exempt from CIT include the following:
## Foreign income
A Philippine (domestic) corporation is taxed on its worldwide income. A domestic corporation is taxed on income from foreign sources when earned or received, depending on the accounting method used by the taxpayer.
Income earned through a foreign subsidiary is taxed only when paid to a Philippine resident shareholder as a dividend. Under the CREATE Law, such dividend may be exempt from Philippine tax, subject to the following conditions:
Meanwhile, income earned through a foreign branch is taxed as it accrues. The losses incurred by the foreign branch are deductible against other income earned by the Philippine corporation.
For Filipino citizens and domestic corporations, foreign taxes may either be credited against income tax due or claimed as a deduction against gross income for income tax purposes.

Notes
1. The lower rate generally applies if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a company with a substantial ownership in the dividend paying company.
4. Entitlement to the lower rate depends on how the dividend will be taxed in Australia.
5. The 10% rate applies to interest paid in respect of the public issues of bonds, debentures, or similar obligations.
6. The lower rate applies to royalties paid by an enterprise registered with the Philippine BOI and engaged in preferred areas of activity.
7. The threshold for substantial ownership is 10%.
8. The 10% rate also applies to interest paid by a company registered with the BOI and engaged in preferred pioneer areas of investment in the Philippines.
9. The treaty also contains a most-favoured-nation rule, limiting the Philippine tax on royalties to the lowest rate of Philippine tax that may be imposed on royalties of the same kind paid in similar circumstances to a resident of a third state.

Strictly, application of the rate is generally at the discretion of the Philippine Competent Authorities, but the BIR has never raised this as an issue.
14. The 10% rate applies to royalties arising from the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic, or scientific work (other than copyright of cinematograph films), any patent, trademark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or from the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment, or for information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific experience.
15. The 15% rate applies to royalties paid by an enterprise registered and engaged in preferred areas of activities, and to royalties in respect of cinematographic films or tapes for television or broadcasting, and for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright. The 25% rate applies to other royalties.
16. The 10% rate also applies to interest paid in connection with the sale on credit of any industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment.
17. The 10% rate also applies to interest paid on any loans granted by a bank.
18. The 15% rate also applies to royalties in respect of cinematographic films or tapes for television or broadcasting.

24. The threshold for substantial ownership is 70% for the 5% rate to apply.
25. The 15% rate applies if the recipient is a company, including a partnership.
26. The 15% rate applies if the recipient is a company.

# Philippines
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 12 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December.
## Tax returns
Unless impracticable, a husband and wife must file one consolidated income tax return, but the tax is computed separately. Income that cannot be definitely attributed or identified as exclusive income of either spouse is divided equally between them. Generally, this results in lower combined tax liability than when the tax is jointly computed.
Substituted filing is available for qualified employees. In such case, the Certificate of Compensation Payment/Tax Withheld (BIR Form 2316) filed by the employer and duly stamped 'received' by the BIR shall be tantamount to substituted filing of the Annual Income Tax Return of the employees.
Substituted filing shall apply only to employees who meet all of the following conditions:
Substituted filing, however, will not apply to non-resident aliens engaged in trade or business in the Philippines.
All individual taxpayers who do not qualify for substituted filing are required to file their returns on a calendar-year basis. The return must be filed on or before 15 April of the succeeding year.
## Payment of tax
Generally, the income tax withheld from the salaries or compensation of aliens, resident or not, should equal their final tax liability on such compensation. If not, the balance must be paid at the time the annual return is filed. However, if the tax due exceeds PHP 2,000, income tax liability may be paid in two equal instalments. The first instalment is due on 15 April while the second and final instalment is due on 15 October.
Any payment of the remaining tax liability beyond the due date shall be subject to certain penalties.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 12 January 2025
The Philippines taxes its resident citizens on their worldwide income. Non-resident citizens and aliens, whether or not resident in the Philippines, are taxed only on income from sources within the Philippines.
Rates of tax on income of aliens, resident or not, depend on the nature of their income (i.e. compensation income, income subject to final tax, or other income).
## Compensation tax rates
For resident aliens and non-resident aliens doing business and receiving compensation income, the tax rates are as follows:
Beginning 1 January 2023:
| Taxable income (PHP) | | Tax on column 1 (PHP) | Tax on excess (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 250,000 | - | 0 |
| 250,000 | 400,000 | - | 15 |
| 400,000 | 800,000 | 22,500 | 20 |
| 800,000 | 2,000,000 | 102,500 | 25 |
| 2,000,000 | 8,000,000 | 402,500 | 30 |
| 8,000,000 |  | 2,202,500 | 35 |
### Fringe benefits tax (FBT)
Fringe benefits furnished to managerial and supervisory-level employees by the employer are subject to a final FBT of 35%\* (in general) on the grossed-up monetary value of the benefits. Managerial employees are those who may mandate and execute management policies to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, discharge, assign, or discipline employees. Supervisory employees are those who effectively recommend such managerial actions if the exercise of authority on behalf of the employer is not merely routine or clerical in nature but requires the use of independent judgement. The FBT is a final tax payable on a calendar quarterly basis by the employer and deductible as part of fringe benefit expense. Benefits subjected to FBT are no longer included in the employees’ taxable income. *See the [Income determination](philippines/individual/income-determination.html) section for a description of fringe benefits for FBT purposes*.
\* 25% for non-resident alien not engaged in trade or business.
## Tax rates for income subject to final tax
For resident and non-resident aliens engaged in trade or business in the Philippines, the maximum rate on income subject to final tax (usually passive investment income) is 20%. For non-resident aliens not engaged in trade or business in the Philippines, the rate is a flat 25%. *See Capital gains and investment income in the [Income determination](philippines/individual/income-determination.html) section for more information*.
## Tax rates for business income
An individual, whether citizen or resident alien, who is self-employed or practices a profession, is also subject to the graduated income tax rates above.
However, an individual who has gross sales/receipts and other non-operating income not exceeding the VAT threshold (which is currently pegged at PHP 3 million) may opt to be taxed either at:
Business income subjected to graduated tax rates shall also be subject to business tax (i.e. 12% VAT or 3% percentage tax, as applicable).
\* Only applicable if the individual is not VAT-registered. If VAT-registered, graduated rates shall apply regardless of the gross sales/receipts.

# Philippines
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 01 August 2024
## Taxable period
The accounting period must follow a 12-month fiscal period but may or may not follow the calendar year. Most Philippine companies have a fiscal year that ends in December or March.
## Tax returns
Corporations should file their returns and compute their income on the basis of an accounting period of 12 months.
Corporate taxpayers file self-assessed returns. Electronic filing and payment of taxes are available under the Electronic Filing and Payment System (eFPS) of the BIR.
The following corporate taxpayers who are not covered by eFPS are required to use Electronic BIR Forms (eBIRForms) in filing their tax returns:
Taxpayers who are required to file their returns using eFPS or eBIRForms but fail to do so shall be subject to a penalty of PHP 1,000 per return and civil penalties equivalent to 25% of the tax due.
A domestic or resident foreign corporation is required to file cumulative income tax returns on a quarterly basis. Within 60 days from the close of each of the first three quarters of its taxable year, the corporation must file a return summarising its gross income and deductions for the year to date. A final annual income tax return must be filed on or before the 15th day of the fourth month following the close of the taxable year.
Corporate taxpayers must file their income tax returns using one of three different forms, depending on their tax regime (i.e. subject only to the regular income tax, tax exempt, or with mixed income subject to multiple tax rates or special/preferential rates).
## Payment of tax
The Philippines follows a pay-as-you-file system for income tax, so the quarterly and annual income tax payments would fall due on the same filing deadlines discussed above. The balance of the tax due after deducting the quarterly payments must be paid, while the excess may be claimed as a refund or tax credit. Excess estimated quarterly income taxes paid may be carried over and credited against estimated quarterly income tax liabilities for succeeding taxable years. Once the option to carry over has been made, such option is irrevocable, and no cash refund or tax credit certificate (TCC) is allowed, except upon liquidation of the company.
Since additional modes of payment of taxes are now available through credit, debit, and prepaid cards under recently issued Revenue Regulations, taxpayers may choose from the available online payment facilities provided by the Electronic Payment Service Provider (EPSP) to process tax payments. However, only accredited Authorised Agent Banks (AABs) may accept such payments, and accreditation of AABs is subject to compliance with certain conditions under existing Regulations.
Payment of taxes through the Card Payment Facility shall be deemed made on the date and time appearing in the system-generated payment confirmation receipt issued to the taxpayer-cardholder by the AAB-acquirer, provided that the payment was actually received by the BIR. The taxpayer is not relieved of, and has a continuing liability for, such taxes until the payment is actually received by the BIR.
## Annual statutory audit
An annual statutory audit is required for all corporations with authorised capital stock or paid-up capital exceeding PHP 50,000, including branches of foreign corporations. It is also required for any corporation whose gross annual sales or earnings exceed PHP 3,000,000.
## Statute of limitations
There is no statutory obligation on the Tax Commissioner to make an assessment for internal revenue taxes, and most taxes are collected based on the taxpayer’s self-calculation. If an assessment is to be issued, however, it must be done within three years from the deadline or the date of actual filing of the return, whichever is later. The taxpayer and the Commissioner can, however, agree in writing to extend this period.
In the case of a false or fraudulent return or of failure to file a return, the tax may be assessed or a proceeding in court for collection may be commenced without assessment at any time within ten years from the discovery of the falsity, fraud, or omission.
Any internal revenue tax that has been assessed within the period of limitation may be collected by distraint or levy or by a proceeding in court within five years following the assessment of the tax.
The prescription periods are suspended in certain circumstances, such as when the offender is absent from the Philippines, when the Commissioner grants a taxpayer’s request for a reinvestigation, or when the taxpayer and the BIR agree to extend the prescriptive period for assessment through a written waiver.
The BIR has a period of 180 days to decide on a refund claim for overpaid taxes. In case of denial of the claim for tax refund, or the failure on the part of the CIR to act on the application within the 180-day period, the taxpayer may appeal the decision with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) within 30 days.
During audits, the BIR generally covers all applicable internal revenue taxes. In recent years, the BIR has been separately auditing VAT in certain cases in an effort to collect more. A bit more attention and scrutiny is placed on taxation of cross-border transactions, particularly in terms of VAT and WHT implications.

# Philippines
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 01 August 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT applies to practically all sales of services and imports, as well as to the sale, barter, exchange, or lease of goods or properties (tangible or intangible). The tax is equivalent to a uniform rate of 12%, based on the gross selling price of goods or properties sold, or gross receipts from the sale of services. On importation of goods, the basis of the tax is the value used by the Bureau of Customs (BOC) in determining tariff and customs duties plus customs duties, excise taxes, if any, and other charges. Where the valuation used by the BOC is by volume or quantity, the VAT basis is the landed cost plus excise taxes, if any.
Certain transactions are zero-rated or exempt from VAT. Export sales by VAT-registered persons are zero-rated.
Certain sales of services exempt from VAT, including services provided by financial intermediaries, are subject to percentage taxes based on gross sales, receipts, or income.
Certain VAT provisions have been amended by the EOPT Act. Salient provisions are the following:
- Issuer shall be liable for non-compliance.
- Purchaser shall still be allowed to claim the input tax if the invoice contains the sales amount, VAT amount, name and TIN of both parties, description of the goods or service, and transaction date.
Taxpayers are given six months from the effectivity of implementing regulations that will be issued to comply with the VAT amendments.
## Customs duties
Applicable customs duties are determined based on the tariff classification of the import product. As with the rest of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, tariff classification in the Philippines is based on the ASEAN Harmonised Tariff Nomenclature (AHTN), which is patterned after the Harmonised Commodity Classification and Coding System (HS) Convention and its 2002 revisions, and the latest edition is HS Code 2017 under the Customs Modernization and Tariff Act.
The Philippines adopts the World Trade Organization (WTO) Valuation Agreement, where the declared invoice price is used as the basis for determining customs duties.
As a protective measure, the Philippines retains higher tariff rates (20% to 50%) on certain sensitive agricultural products, such as livestock and meat products, sugar, vegetables, and coffee. A few agricultural commodities are subject to minimum access volumes, but these represent less than 1% of all tariff lines.
In view of the existing free trade agreements in the region, such as the ASEAN-China Free Trade Area (ACFTA), the ASEAN-Korea Free Trade Area (AKFTA), the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area (AANZFTA), the ASEAN-Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (AJCEPA), the ASEAN-INDIA Free Trade Area (AIFTA), the Philippine-European Free Trade Association (PH-EFTA), the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA), the ASEAN Hong Kong China Free Trade Area (AHKFTA), the Philippine-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement (PJEPA), and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the Philippines has taken steps to progressively eliminate tariffs. Tariff reductions for the Philippines range from 10% to 35% for most products included in the Normal Track list.

## Capital gains tax
Capital gains arise from the sale or exchange of ‘capital assets’. Capital assets are property held by the taxpayer (whether or not connected with its trade), other than the following:
Capital losses are deductible only to the extent of capital gains.
There are no holding period requirements for capital assets of corporations.
A 6% final tax is imposed on the higher of the gross selling price or fair market value upon the sale, exchange, or disposition of land or buildings not actually used in the business of a corporation.
Net capital gains derived by domestic and foreign corporations from the sale, exchange, transfer, or similar transactions of Philippine shares of stock not traded through a local stock exchange are taxed at a flat 15% rate.
Sales of shares of stock listed and traded on a local stock exchange, other than the sale by a dealer in securities, are subject to a stock transaction tax of 0.6% based on the gross selling price, provided the listed corporation observes a minimum public ownership of at least 10% based on the company’s issued and outstanding shares, exclusive of any treasury shares or such percentage as may be prescribed by the SEC or Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE), whichever is higher. Otherwise, the 15% capital gains tax shall apply.
Capital gains from the sale of bonds, debentures, or other certificates of indebtedness with a maturity of more than five years are exempt from tax.
## Payroll taxes
The compensation and benefits of employees of employers are subject to WHT based on graduated rates. The employer shall be the designated withholding agent of the government.
## Social security contributions
Employee contributions for social security are deducted from the employee’s salary payments. The maximum monthly deductions are PHP 900 for SSS plus a maximum of PHP 450 mandatory provident fund under the Workers’ Investment and Savings Program (WISP), PHP 200 for HDMF, and PHP 1,000 for PHIC.
Employers are also required to make contributions. Employers’ maximum contribution for each employee is PHP 1,900 per month for SSS plus PHP 950 mandatory provident fund and PHP 30 for Employees' Compensation Program. Employer contributions for HDMF and PHIC are generally of the same amount as the employee contributions.
## Fringe benefits tax
A final tax of 35%, payable by the employer, is imposed on the grossed-up monetary value of fringe benefits (e.g. housing, expense accounts, vehicles of any kind, household personnel, interest on loans at lower than market rates [the current benchmark rate is 12%], membership dues for social and athletic clubs, foreign travel expenses, holiday and vacation expenses, educational assistance, insurance) furnished or granted to managerial or supervisory personnel by the employer. An exception is for fringe benefits required by the nature of or necessary to the trade, business, or profession of the employer, or when the fringe benefit is for the convenience or advantage of the employer.
The following fringe benefits are not subject to the tax:
The fringe benefits tax is payable on a calendar quarter basis and is an additional deductible expense for the employer. Fringe benefits already subjected to fringe benefits tax will no longer form part of the employee’s taxable income.
The grossed-up monetary value of the fringe benefit is generally computed by dividing the actual monetary value of the benefit by 65%.
## Donor’s taxes
Donor’s tax is a tax on a donation or gift and is imposed on the gratuitous transfer of property. It shall apply whether the transfer is in trust or otherwise, whether the gift is direct or indirect, and whether the property is real or personal, tangible or intangible.
The donor’s tax rate is fixed at 6% based on total gifts in excess of PHP 250,000 made during the calendar year. However, a sale, exchange, or other transfer made in the ordinary course of business (i.e. *bona fide* transaction, at arm’s-length, and free from donative intent) shall be considered as made for an adequate and full consideration and is exempt from donor’s tax.
## Local government taxes
Local government units impose local business taxes, which are generally based on the gross sales or gross receipts of the prior year, and real property taxes, which are levied annually on the basis of a fixed proportion of the value of the real property (taxable value). The local business tax rate varies depending on the location of the business, but generally shall not exceed 3%. Real property located in a province may be subject to real property tax of not more than 1% of its taxable value, while real property in a city (or municipality in Metro Manila) may be subject to real property tax of not more than 2% of its taxable value. In addition, an annual tax of 1% of the taxable value of real property shall accrue to the special education fund.

## Overview
Last reviewed - 01 August 2024
The Philippines is strategically located off the southeastern coast of mainland Asia, with a flying time of four hours or less to most major Asian countries. Its strategic location allowed it to bridge Eastern and Western cultures, producing a rich history of Asian, European, and American influences. The Philippines has been counted as the third-largest English-speaking country in the world. The capital of the Philippines is Manila, and the currency is the Philippine peso (PHP).
The Philippine gross domestic product (GDP) posted a growth rate of 5.6% in 2023. The main contributors to the growth, with their corresponding increases, were: wholesale and retail trade, as well as repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles, at 5.5%; financial and insurance activities at 8.9%; and construction at 8.8%. Major economic sectors, namely: agriculture, forestry, and fishing (AFF); industry; and services, all posted positive growths of 1.2%, 3.6%, and 7.2%, respectively.

## Ease of Paying Taxes (EOPT) Act
On 5 January 2024, the Republic Act No. 11976 or the EOPT Act was signed into law. The EOPT Act introduced significant amendments to the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 (‘Philippine Tax Code‘) that are intended to protect and safeguard taxpayer rights and welfare, to modernise tax administration by providing mechanisms that encourage easy compliance at the least cost and resources, and to update the Philippine tax system and adopt best practices. The EOPT Act became effective on 22 January 2024.
The salient amendments include the following, among others:
## Real Property Assessment and Valuation Reform Act
On 13 June 2024, the Republic Act No. 12001 or the Real Property Assessment and Valuation Reform Act (RPVARA) was signed into law and took effect on 3 July 2024. The RPVARA institutes reforms in real property valuations, reorganises the Bureau of Local Government Finance (BLGF), and grants tax amnesty (including special levies) on real property.
The law aims to achieve the following goals, among others:
To achieve the above goals, the RPVARA will require the BLGF to update the Schedule of Market Values (SMVs) every three years by establishing the Real Property Valuation Service (RPVS) and Real Property Valuation Unit (RPVU) under the Office of the Local Assessors.
A Real Property Information System (RPIS) will be created by the BLGF to ensure that everyone will have access to accurate property valuations.
In order to transition to this new regime, taxpayers are given a chance to avail a real property tax amnesty (one-time or instalment payment).

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 01 August 2024
Corporate taxpayers can avail themselves of the optional standard deduction computed at 40% of gross income. The optional standard deduction is *in lieu* of the itemised operating expenses.
## Depreciation and depletion
Depreciation is generally computed on a straight-line basis, although there are a variety of acceptable depreciation methods. Management should select the method regarded as most appropriate, based on the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits, so as to allocate depreciation on a systematic basis over the asset's useful life. Gain on the sale of depreciated property is taxable as ordinary income. Generally, tax depreciation should conform to book depreciation, unless the former includes incentives.
Properties used in petroleum operations may be depreciated over a period of ten years using the straight-line or declining-balance method, at the option of the service contractor. Properties used in mining operations with expected life of more than ten years may be depreciated over any number of years between five years and their expected life.
A cost depletion allowance is available as follows:
## Goodwill
Amortisation of goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses are deductible when incurred.
## Interest expenses
The allowable deduction for interest expense shall be reduced by an amount equal to 20% of interest income that is subject to final tax, if any.
## Bad debts
Bad debts are deductible expenses when written-off, subject to certain requirements.
## Charitable contributions
The deduction for charitable contributions ordinarily may not exceed 5% of taxable income. However, contributions to certain institutions are 100% deductible, subject to certain conditions.
## Entertainment expenses
Entertainment, amusement, and recreation expenses should not exceed 0.5% of net sales for taxpayers engaged in the sale of goods or properties, or 1% of net revenue for taxpayers engaged in the sale of services, including professionals and lessors of properties.
## Special deductions
Special deductions are allowed for certain businesses (e.g. insurance, mining, petroleum, and real estate investment trust).
Labour training expenses incurred for skills development of enterprise-based trainees enrolled in public senior high schools, public higher education institutions, or public technical and vocational institutions are subject to additional deduction of 50% of such expense, subject to certain conditions.
## Fines and penalties
Interest penalties are deductible. Surcharge and compromise penalties imposed for non-payment or late payment of taxes are not deductible for tax purposes.
## Taxes
Corporate taxpayers can claim a deduction for all taxes paid or accrued within the taxable year in connection with their trade or business, except for the following:
In the case of a foreign corporation, deductions for taxes are allowed only if they are connected with income from sources within the Philippines.
## Net operating losses
A net operating loss for any taxable year immediately preceding the current taxable year, which had not been previously offset as a deduction from gross income, may be carried over as a deduction from gross income for the next three consecutive taxable years immediately following the year of this loss (except losses during the period when the taxpayer was tax-exempt), provided there has been no substantial change in the ownership of the business or enterprise where 75% of the paid up capital or nominal value of the shares are held by the same persons.
Under Republic Act No. 11494 or the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act, net operating loss for the taxable year 2020 and 2021 may be carried over for the next five consecutive taxable years following such loss.
For mines, other than oil and gas wells, a net operating loss calculated without the benefit of incentives provided for under EO No. 226, or the Omnibus Investments Code of 1987, as amended, incurred in any of the first ten years of operation may be carried over as a deduction from taxable income for the next five years immediately following the year of such loss.
Loss carrybacks are not allowed.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
A Philippine corporation can claim a deduction for royalties, management service fees, and interest charges paid to foreign affiliates, under arm's-length terms, where the appropriate WHTs are withheld and remitted.
## Head office expense allocations
A resident foreign corporation is allowed to claim allocated head office expenses as a deduction, subject to certain requirements.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 01 August 2024
There is no group taxation in the Philippines.
## Transfer pricing
Transfer Pricing Regulations govern the cross-border and domestic transactions between associated enterprises. The Regulations state that the 'arm’s-length principle' shall be adopted in determining the transfer price in related-party transactions. The application of the arm's-length principle may follow a 'three-step' approach prescribed by the BIR under the Regulations, which are: (i) the conduct of a comparability analysis, (ii) the identification of the tested party and the appropriate transfer pricing method, and (iii) the determination of the arm's-length results.
The BIR has issued a Revenue Audit Memorandum Order that provides guidelines to BIR examiners in relation to the audit of transfer pricing of related-party transactions.
These guidelines apply to, but are not limited to, controlled transactions between related parties/associated enterprises, where at least one party is assessable or chargeable to tax in the Philippines on transactions between a PE and its head office or other branches. Based on this, the PE will be treated as a separate and distinct enterprise from its head office or other related branches/subsidiaries for tax purposes.
Under BIR Regulations, a taxpayer should file BIR Form No. 1709 (Related Party Transactions Form) if it is required to file an Annual Income Tax Return (AITR), it has transactions with a domestic or foreign related party during the concerned taxable year, and it falls under any of the following categories: (i) large taxpayers, (ii) taxpayers enjoying tax incentives, (iii) taxpayers reporting net operating losses for the current taxable year and immediately preceding two consecutive taxable years, or (iv) a related party that has transactions with either (i), (ii), or (iii).
Those required to file the Related Party Transactions Form are required to prepare Transfer Pricing Documentation should they breach any of the following materiality thresholds namely: (i) annual gross revenue for the taxable year exceeding PHP 150 million and the total amount of related party transactions exceeds PHP 90 million, (ii) sale of tangible goods involving the same related party exceeding PHP 60 million within the taxable year, (iii) service transactions, interest payments, utilisation of intangible goods, or other related party transactions involving the same related party exceeding PHP 15 million within the taxable year, and (iv) if Transfer Pricing Documentation was required to be prepared during the immediately preceding taxable year for exceeding (i), (ii), or (iii).
## Thin capitalisation
There are generally no thin capitalisation rules in the Philippines.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no CFC rules in the Philippines.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 01 August 2024
The income tax rate on branch profits is the same as on corporate profits. In general, profits remitted abroad by a branch office are subject to a 15% tax rate, based on the total profits applied or earmarked for remittance, without any deduction for the tax component thereof. A lower rate may apply under certain tax treaties. Profits from qualified activities remitted by a branch registered with the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) are tax exempt.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 01 August 2024
## Foreign tax credit
Domestic corporations are allowed to claim a credit for any income taxes paid to a foreign country, provided that the taxes are not claimed as deductions. Foreign corporations are not allowed foreign tax credits.
Credits for foreign taxes are determined on a country-by-country basis. The amount of foreign tax credit in respect of the tax paid in a country shall not exceed the same proportion of the tax against which the tax credit is taken, which the taxpayer’s income from the country bears to its entire taxable income. There is, however, a further limitation based on the total amount of foreign-sourced income that the taxpayer earns. The total amount of foreign tax credits shall not exceed the same proportion of the tax against which the tax credit is taken that the taxpayer’s foreign-sourced income bears to its entire taxable income.
## Incentives under CREATE
Export-oriented enterprises and domestic enterprises engaged in strategic activities as defined under the Strategic Investment Priority Plan (SIPP) have the following incentives under the CREATE Law:
The period of availment shall commence from the actual start of commercial operations, with the registered business enterprise availing of the tax incentives within three years from the date of registration, unless otherwise provided in the SIPP.
Qualified expansion or entirely new project or activity may qualify to avail of incentives, subject to the qualifications in the SIPP and performance review by the Fiscal Incentives Review Board.
Entities that are registered with the investment promotion agencies (IPAs) that are still enjoying incentives prior to the effectivity of the CREATE Law will be allowed to continue the said enjoyment, subject to the following rules:

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 12 January 2025
## Social taxes
Social taxes in the Philippines consist of contributions to the following government agencies:
SSS issued Circular 2024-06 on 19 December 19 2024 mandating a 1% increase in the contribution rate starting January 2025. This change increased the contribution rate from 14% to 15% in accordance with Republic Act No. 11199, also known as the Social Security Act of 2018. The new minimum Monthly Salary Credit (MSC) is set at PHP 5,000, while the maximum MSC is 35,000 Philippine Peso (PHP). With the increase in contribution, the minimum employee and employer share is PHP 250 and PHP 510 per month, respectively.  The employer’s share includes a PHP 10 Employees' Compensation (EC) contribution. Meanwhile, the maximum monthly employee contribution is PHP 1,750, and the employer’s share is PHP 3,530, which includes an EC contribution of PHP 30.
HDMF has issued Circular No. 460 on 15 January 2024 prescribing the increase in contribution effective February 2024. Based on the circular, the Maximum Fund Salary (MFS) increased from 5,000 to 10,000 Philippine pesos (PHP). The rate for MFS of PHP 1,500 and below shall be 1% for the employee and 2% for the employer. For MFS over PHP 5,000, the rate shall be 2% for both the employer and the employee. The maximum HDMF contribution for both employers and employees will be PHP 200.
In addition, PhilHealth’s premium rate is retained at 5% and the income ceiling is PHP 100,000, which is in accordance with Section 10 of the Universal Health Care (UHC) Law, as implemented by PhilHealth Circular 2019-009.
In line with this, the minimum and maximum PhilHealth contribution for both employers and employees will be PHP 500 and PHP 2,500, respectively, effective January 2024.
## Tax filing and payment
Following the enactment of Republic Act No. 11976 (Ease of Payment Taxes or EOPT Act) on 5 January 2024, which took effect on 22 January 2024, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) provided the file-and-pay anywhere mechanism. This mechanism was further clarified by the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of the Act, which took effect on 27 April 2024. Under the IRR, the filing of tax returns shall be done electronically in any of the available electronic platforms of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). However, in case of unavailability of the electronic platforms, manual filing may be allowed.
Moreover, for tax payments, the same shall be made either electronically in any of the available electronic platforms or manually to any Authorised Agent Bank (AAB) and Revenue Collection Office (RCO). The RCO can accept check payments regardless of amounts but only up to a maximum amount of PHP 20,000 for cash payments. AABs and RCOs shall only accept payments after the taxpayers have already electronically filed their tax returns, unless an advisory is issued allowing manual filing.
Meanwhile, in case of filing of an income tax return by married individuals, the husband and the wife, whether citizens or aliens, who are both self-employed, either engaged in business or practice of profession, shall file their return jointly. However, if it is impracticable to file one return, each spouse shall file separate income tax returns.
Further, a Filipino citizen who is an Overseas Contract Worker (OCW) or an Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) working and deriving income solely from abroad shall not be required to file an income tax return.
## Business tax
Pursuant to Republic Act (RA) 11534, also known as the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises Act (CREATE), any person whose sales or receipts are exempt from the payment of value-added tax (VAT) and who is a non-VAT registered person shall pay a percentage tax equivalent to 1% of one's gross sales or receipts (previously 3%) for the period beginning 1 July 2020 until 30 June 2023. Starting 1 July 2023, the rate shall revert to 3%.

## Individual - Sample personal income tax calculation
Last reviewed - 12 January 2025
## Typical tax computation for 2024
### **Assumptions**
| Tax computation | Husband (PHP) | Wife (PHP) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gross income: |  |  |
| Salary (1) | 652,000 | 68,000 |
| Living allowances | 100,000 |  |
| Total taxable income | 752,000 | 68,000 |
|  |  |  |
| Tax due: |  |  |
| On first 400,000 | 22,500 |  |
| On remainder of 352,000 at 20% | 70,400 |  |
| On first 250,000 |  | 0 |
| Total tax | 92,900 | 0 |
|  |  |  |
| Less: |  |  |
| Tax withheld by employer per Form 2316 (2) | (92,900) | 0 |
|  |  |  |
| Net tax due | 0 | 0 |
Notes
The following items were not included in the income tax return because they are subject to final tax:
| Interest on peso bank account | 20,000 |
| --- | --- |
| Capital gain on sale of shares | 5,000 |
| Dividend income | 10,000 |
| Housing benefit (3) | 300,000 |
1. Philippine social tax contributions, if any, made by the resident alien and/or his wife to the Philippine social security agencies shall be allowed as deductions from gross income in calculating their tax liabilities for the year.
2. For individuals receiving salary and other allowances from one employer only, the tax due is usually equal to tax withheld since the employer is required to compute and withhold the total tax due on the employee's compensation earned during the year, using the annual graduated income tax table, before paying the last payroll for the year.
3. As a managerial employee, the housing benefit provided to the husband shall be subject to FBT rather than income tax.
The above individual tax calculation also applies to non-resident aliens engaged in trade or business in the Philippines for their Philippine-source income.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 12 January 2025
## Employment income
An alien, whether resident or not, is taxed on compensation income earned from services rendered in the Philippines regardless of where payment is made and whether it is remitted into the Philippines. A non-resident alien is not taxed on compensation income for services performed outside the Philippines. Employment income, from the point of view of a non-resident alien engaged in trade or business in the Philippines, includes all payments for services rendered in the Philippines, such as salaries and bonuses, regardless of where payment was made.
Social security contributions, up to the prescribed amount of maximum mandatory contributions, and union dues paid by employees are not included in gross income and are exempt from taxation.
### Fringe benefits
‘Fringe benefits’ are defined as any goods, services, or other benefits furnished or granted in cash or in kind by an employer to an individual employee, except rank and file employees, such as, but not limited to, the following:
The monetary value of benefits in the form of housing and motor vehicles used for both personal and business purposes is equal to 50% of the lease payment or the depreciation value of the property, whichever is applicable. However, if the housing unit is situated in or adjacent (within 50 metres) to the business premises, the benefit is not taxable. Likewise, a motor vehicle used normally for business purposes is not taxable.
The following fringe benefits are not taxable:
In general, if a fringe benefit is granted in money or directly paid for by the employer, the value of the fringe benefit is the amount granted or paid for. If furnished in property and ownership thereof is transferred to the employee, the value of the fringe benefit is the fair market value of the property as determined by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, pursuant to the Commissioner’s power to prescribe real property values. If the fringe benefit is granted or furnished by the employer in the form of a property but ownership is not transferred to the employee, the value of the fringe benefit is equal to the depreciation value of the property.
## Capital gains and investment income
Non-resident aliens are taxed on Philippine-source capital gains, irrespective of their period of stay in the Philippines. The rates are 0.6% of the gross selling price for shares of stocks listed and traded in the stock exchange; 15% of the net capital gains for unlisted shares of stock, including shares of publicly listed companies that failed to comply with the minimum public ownership (MPO) requirement; and 6% of the higher of the gross sales price or fair market value of real property sold, withheld at the time of sale. Capital losses are deductible only from capital gains. In computing net capital gains or losses from other capital assets, only 50% of the gain or loss is to be taken into account if the capital asset has been held for more than 12 months; otherwise, 100% of the gain or loss is to be considered.
A non-resident alien is also taxed on Philippine-source investment income, such as interest, dividends, and royalties, at the rate of 20% (for those engaged in trade or business in the Philippines) or 25% (for those not engaged in trade or business in the Philippines) as a final tax (or a lower treaty rate). The tax is withheld at source, and the income is not subject to the graduated rates.
Resident aliens are taxed on their Philippine-source income at graduated rates. However, Philippine-source interest and royalties are taxed at 20%. Interest on residents’ deposits under the expanded foreign currency deposit system (FCDU) accounts is taxed at 15%, while interest on long-term deposits or investment in the form of savings, common or individual trust funds, and other investments evidenced by certificates, and so on, is exempt from tax, subject to certain conditions. Interest income on FCDU accounts of non-residents is exempt from tax. Royalties on literary works and musical compositions are subject to a final tax of 10%. Dividend income received from a domestic corporation is taxed at 10% for resident aliens. Tax rates for capital gains from shares of stock and real property are the same as those for non-resident aliens.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 12 January 2025
A resident alien is an individual who is stateless or is a national of another country and who lives in the Philippines with no definite intention as to length of stay, but who is not a mere transient or sojourner. An expatriate working in the Philippines on a contract for an indefinite period potentially falls into this category.
Most expatriates will be classified as non-resident aliens because their contract will be for a specified period of engagement. A non-resident alien individual who comes to the Philippines and stays for more than 180 days during any calendar year will be deemed a non-resident alien engaged in trade or business in the Philippines. If the aggregate stay in the Philippines during any calendar year covered by the assignment period does not exceed 180 days, the individual may be deemed a non-resident alien not engaged in trade or business in the Philippines.
Expatriates assigned in the Philippines for a definite period are generally regarded as non-residents engaged in trade or business in the Philippines.
