## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
## Social security and health insurance contributions
Social security taxes are obligatory for an individual employed by a Czech company. Most foreign secondees working in a Czech company are obligated to pay Czech social security and health insurance unless the European Union (EU) regulation or social security treaty states otherwise. The rules on participation in the Czech social security and health insurance system are complex, and each secondee's situation should be reviewed individually.
Social security contributions provide funding for three separate funds: pensions, unemployment benefits, and sickness (together with other benefits). Entrepreneurs can choose whether to contribute to the sickness fund.
Health insurance covers medical care. An individual can choose the licensed insurance company to which one will pay health insurance contributions.
Mandatory contributions are calculated from the individual's gross remuneration. Income that is subject to income tax is generally subject to contributions into the social security and health insurance system.
The contribution rates calculated from the gross salary are as follows:
The maximum annual cap for the assessment base for calculation of contributions into the social security system is 48 times the average monthly wage per year (i.e. CZK 2,234,736 for 2025). This cap applies to both employees and entrepreneurs.
There is no cap for contribution for the health insurance.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is generally charged at 21% on supplies of goods and services within the Czech Republic.
Certain supplies (e.g. groceries [excluding most drinks], medicaments, drinking tap water, construction works related to social housing, hotel accommodation, admission to cultural, sport, theatre, or similar facilities, catering services, heat, and cold) are taxed at a rate of 12% starting 1 January 2024.
Exports are generally exempt from VAT with a credit. Some supplies are exempt without a credit, including the lease of real estate (with certain exceptions), financial and insurance services, education, health, and welfare.
VAT deduction on personal cars is limited to CZK 420,000.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in the Czech Republic.
## Inheritance and gift tax
There is no inheritance tax.
Gifts are not taxed by a special gift tax, but rather they are included in the recipient's PIT. A tax exemption applies to gifts received from close relatives.
## Property tax
Property tax is paid each year from real estate owned by the taxpayer as at 1 January of the respective year. The amount is based on the type and size of the real estate, the purpose of usage, and the location.
## Tax on real estate acquisition
There is no real estate acquisition tax, transfer tax, or similar tax.

# Czech Republic
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
## CIT base calculation
The starting point for the calculation of the CIT base is the accounting result as per the Czech accounting standards in the currency used for accounting purposes. If the company uses International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), which is obligatory for some companies (such as those that issued publicly traded securities), the IFRS accounting results need to be recalculated for CIT purposes to what they would have been under Czech accounting standards.
The tax non-deductible costs are then added and non-taxable revenues deducted from the accounting result.
## Capital gains
No separate capital gains tax is levied in the Czech Republic. Capital gains (i.e. gains from sale of shares and other assets) are included in the CIT base and taxed as ordinary income in the year in which they arise, unless they are exempt under the participation exemption (*see below*).
## Dividend income
Dividends received by Czech tax resident corporations from non-resident entities are subject to a special tax rate of 15%, unless exempt under the participation exemption regime (*see* *below)*.
Dividends paid by Czech tax resident corporations to Czech resident entities are subject to 15% final withholding tax (WHT), unless exempt under the participation exemption regime.
Dividends paid by Czech tax resident corporations to Czech non-resident entities are subject to 15% final WHT, unless exempt under the participation exemption regime or unless the WHT rate is decreased under the relevant DTT. An increased WHT rate of 35% applies to dividends paid to entities that are not tax residents in any EU or European Economic Area (EEA) member state or in a country with which the Czech Republic concluded a DTT or tax information exchange agreement (TIEA).
## Participation exemption regime
Dividend income or income from the sale of shares in a subsidiary may be exempt from Czech taxation (i.e. WHT when a Czech company is paying dividends, CIT when a company is receiving dividends or generates the capital gain) if all of the following conditions are met:
Regarding dividends paid by a Czech subsidiary, provided that the conditions above are met, the exemption also applies when dividends are paid to a parent in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, or Switzerland.
Regarding dividends received or capital gains generated by a Czech parent company, the participation exemption may also be applied if the subsidiary is a tax resident of a country where a DTT with the Czech Republic is in place, the subsidiary has a legal form similar to a limited liability company or a joint stock company, it is subject to CIT at the nominal rate of at least 12% in a year when dividends are paid, and the time test of holding at least 10% share for at least 12 consecutive calendar months in that subsidiary is met.
## Interest and royalty income
Interest and royalties received by Czech tax residents are included in the standard tax base subject to the 21% CIT rate in tax periods starting in 2024 (previously 19%).
Czech-source interest and royalty income received by Czech tax non-residents is subject to 15% WHT, unless subject to domestic exemption or a DTT stipulates otherwise. An increased WHT rate of 35% applies to interest and royalties paid by Czech tax residents to entities that are not tax residents in any EU or EEA member state or in a country with which the Czech Republic concluded a DTT or TIEA.
Under domestic law (in line with the EU Interest and Royalty Directive), interest and/or royalty income is exempt if it is paid by a Czech resident to an EU resident recipient who is a beneficial owner of the interest and/or royalty income, provided that for at least 24 months before the payment:
The exemption is applicable subject to approval by the tax authorities.
## Exchange gains and losses
Realised foreign exchange (FX) gains and losses are accounted for in profit and loss accounts and represent taxable revenues or tax-deductible costs, respectively. The same treatment applies to unrealised foreign exchange differences.
From 2024, as an option and subject to notification to the tax administrator, taxpayers may choose to exclude the unrealised FX differences (i.e. FX differences resulting from revaluation of balance sheet assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency to CZK using the exchange rate as of the last day of the accounting period) from the CIT base. These excluded FX differences are then added back to the CIT base when realised.
The default functional currency for accounting and CIT purposes is CZK. From 2024, taxpayers may decide to keep their statutory accounting books in EUR, USD, or GBP, provided it is the actual functional currency of their economic environment. The accounting currency is then also used for CIT base calculation purposes. For other taxes, including VAT, CZK still has to be used.
## Controlled foreign company (CFC) rules
The CIT base of the company can also be increased by income generated by foreign direct or indirect subsidiary of the company under the CFC rules. *See the [Group taxation](czech-republic/corporate/group-taxation.html) section for more information*.

Notes
General note: The WHT rates stipulated by the relevant DTT can, in most cases, be applied by the Czech tax-resident corporation without the need to seek for a pre-approval or similar procedure with the Czech tax authorities. The Czech corporation must be prepared the prove to Czech tax authorities that the DTT provisions were applied correctly; usually the minimum requirement for the Czech corporation is to have available the tax residency certificate of the non-resident recipient of the income and confirmation that the recipient is the beneficial owner of the respective income.
1. The general WHT rate for dividends is 15% (35% for dividends paid to residents of non-EU and non-EEA countries with which the Czech Republic does not have an enforceable DTT or TIEA in place). If the DTT provides for two rates, the lower rate usually applies if the recipient of the dividends is a company that directly owns at least a certain amount of the capital or a certain amount of the voting shares of the company paying the dividend.
2. The general WHT rate for interest paid to non-residents is 15% (35% for interest paid to residents of non-EU and non-EEA countries with which the Czech Republic does not have an enforceable DTT or TIEA in place). Domestic law provides for exemption of interest based on the rules of EU Interest-Royalty Directive as incorporated into Czech law - see section Corporate - Income determination for details. Also, under domestic law, interest income from Czech governmental bonds is exempt. Furthermore, interest from bonds issued by Czech companies abroad (i.e. issued under foreign law) is also exempt from the WHT, provided that the bondholder is not a related party of the issuer. If the DTT provides for two rates, the lower rate applies mostly in situations when the interest is received by the government, the central bank, or a state-owned institution.
3. The general WHT rate for royalties paid to non-residents is 15% (35% for royalties paid to residents of non-EU and non-EEA countries with which the Czech Republic does not have an enforceable DTT or TIEA in place). Domestic law provides for exemption of royalties based on the rules of EU Interest-Royalty Directive as incorporated into Czech law - see section Corporate - Income determination for details. If the DTT provides for two rates, the lower rate applies mostly to cultural royalties.
4. In case that Switzerland (based on the Swiss law) does not levy any WHT on royalties paid to the Czech tax resident (not only Swiss tax residents), then the Czech Republic is allowed to reduce 10% WHT (as stated in Article 12 of the CZ-CHE DTT) to 5% WHT rate as a reciprocity provision with regard to 0% WHT in Switzerland.
5. There is no DTT in place with Taiwan. A special law was introduced by the Czech government (instead of a DTT) to implement the WHT rates with respect to Taiwan.
6. On 11 August 2023, Russia suspended application of Articles 5-22 and 24 of the Czech-Russian DTT. The Czech Republic took reciprocal measures as of 29 September 2023.
7. In 2024, Belarus suspended application of Articles 10, 11 and 13 for the period of 1 June 2024-31 December 2026. The Czech Republic took reciprocal measures for the period of 1 June 2024-31 December 2026.
Apart from dividends, interest, and royalties, Czech tax residents or Czech PEs are obligated to withhold tax from Czech-source income of non-residents, among others, in the following cases:
This treatment has to be applied unless an applicable DTT stipulates otherwise.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax period is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
The basic filing and payment deadline is 1 April of the year following the tax period. As of 2021, an automatic extension to 1 May is possible for taxpayers filing electronically. The deadline of 1 July applies if a Czech registered tax advisor files the tax return, as long as a power of attorney authorising the registered tax advisor to prepare the return is filed by this deadline (i.e. before or together with the tax return at the latest). Further extension might be granted by the Czech tax authorities upon properly substantiated request. The same deadlines also apply to the payment of any outstanding annual tax liability (i.e. for taxpayers filing personally, it is 1 April or 1 May depending on the filing form; for tax advisors filing on behalf of taxpayers, it is either 1 April or 1 July). The deadline for tax refund is 30 days following the tax filing deadline (as detailed above) provided that the tax authorities approve the tax return.
## Payment of tax
Income tax is withheld monthly at source from income from employment for employees of a Czech company or branch and for employees of a foreign company assigned to work in the Czech branch of that foreign company. Czech law also contains a deemed employer rule whereby an employee of a foreign company who performs work for, and takes orders from, a Czech individual or company may be seen as an employee for payroll withholding purposes irrespective of the legal employment arrangements. Unless the relevant DTT provides otherwise, non-resident individuals working in the Czech Republic (e.g. consultants) who are not employees will be subject to 15% withholding by the Czech entity/person paying for the services.
For all sources of income that have not been liable to Czech tax at source, individuals are responsible for making payments of tax in advance on the basis of prior-year liability. This usually applies to the employment income of foreigners assigned to the Czech Republic by an employer, regardless of whether the employer has a PE in the Czech Republic.

# Czech Republic
## Overview
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
The Czech Republic, a landlocked country in Central Europe, is bordered by Poland to the north, Germany to the west, Austria to the south, and Slovakia to the east. It is divided into 14 regions, with Prague as the capital. The official language of the Czech Republic is Czech, and the currency is the Czech koruna (CZK).
The Czech Republic split from Slovakia on 1 January 1993 and is now one of the most stable and prosperous countries in Central and Eastern Europe. The Czech Republic is a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (from 1995), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) (from 1999), and the European Union (EU) (from 2004).
Maintaining an open investment climate has been a key element of the Czech Republic's transition to a functioning market economy. As a member of the European Union, with an advantageous location in the centre of Europe, a relatively low-cost structure, and a well-qualified labour force, the Czech Republic is an attractive destination for foreign investment.
The Czech economy was growing six years in a row prior to 2020. However, in 2020, due to the impact of global COVID-19 pandemic, the gross domestic product (GDP) declined by -5.6%. In 2021, the GDP increased by 3.3%, and in 2022, there was an increase by 2.4%. In 2023, the GDP declined by -0.4%.

# Czech Republic
## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
Czech tax residents are generally subject to Czech income tax on their worldwide income. Tax non-residents are generally taxed only on income considered Czech-source income.
## Personal income tax rates
The Czech Republic applies progressive taxation on income of tax residents as follows:
The above rates apply to all types of income, except for income that has already been taxed by the final Czech withholding tax (WHT) at source (such as dividends or interest from bonds distributed by Czech companies) and except for certain types of foreign income included in the separate tax base (*see below*).
## Separate tax base
A special tax base with the rate of 15% applies to selected types of non-Czech investment income (e.g. dividends and interest from bonds from abroad).
Individuals can choose to include capital income from abroad in this separate tax base to which a flat 15% tax rate applies. However, tax allowances or tax-deductible items cannot be applied to reduce this tax base. The individual can thus decide whether to leave the capital income from abroad in the general tax base, which is subject to the progressive 15% and 23% rates but which can be reduced by tax allowances and deductible items, or to include this income in the separate tax base, which is subject to the flat 15% tax rate but cannot be reduced by tax allowances and deductible items.
## Local income taxes
There are no local taxes on income in the Czech Republic.

# Czech Republic
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
## Taxable period
A corporation may choose either a calendar year or an accounting year as its tax year for CIT purposes.
## Tax returns
CIT returns must be filed within three months of the end of the tax period. If filed electronically, the deadline is postponed by one calendar month (e.g. if the company is not subject to a mandatory accounting audit and has the calendar year as its CIT period, then the standard deadline for filing of the CIT return is 1 April of the following year, or 1 May of the following year if the CIT return is filed electronically).
If the CIT tax return of the taxpayer is prepared and filed by a registered tax advisor, or if the taxpayer is subject to a mandatory accounting audit, the CIT return filing deadline is extended to six months after the end of the tax period (e.g. if a company that is subject to a mandatory accounting audit has the calendar year as its CIT period, then the deadline for filing of the CIT return is 1 July of the following year).
In some special cases, a filing deadline of less than three months may apply (e.g. upon merger or liquidation). This shorter deadline may, however, be extended if approved by the tax office.
## Payment of tax
Tax payments are due on the same day as the filing deadline.
A company is obligated to make CIT advances based on its last known tax liability. The tax advances are paid semi-annually or quarterly, depending on the amount of the last known tax liability.
Upon filing a tax return, tax advances paid during the year for which the tax return is filed will offset the tax liability declared in the tax return. Any outstanding amount must be paid on the date the tax return is due. Any overpayment will be refunded upon request or may be credited against future tax liabilities.
## Tax audit process
There is no statutory tax audit cycle. Entities are picked by the tax authorities based on selected criteria (e.g. tax loss position, huge marketing costs) or randomly.
## Statute of limitations
The tax may be assessed within three years after the deadline for regular tax return filing. In certain cases (e.g. filing of supplementary tax return), such assessment period may be prolonged by one year, maximally up to ten years. If the company is in a tax loss position, the standard three-year period for tax assessment is extended by the period for which the carried-forward tax loss can be utilised in the future tax periods (i.e. it is extended by five years). Similar extension affect arises if the company utilises tax relief under the investment incentives.

# Czech Republic
## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
## Social security and health insurance contributions
Social security taxes are obligatory for an individual employed by a Czech company. Most foreign secondees working in a Czech company are obligated to pay Czech social security and health insurance unless the European Union (EU) regulation or social security treaty states otherwise. The rules on participation in the Czech social security and health insurance system are complex, and each secondee's situation should be reviewed individually.
Social security contributions provide funding for three separate funds: pensions, unemployment benefits, and sickness (together with other benefits). Entrepreneurs can choose whether to contribute to the sickness fund.
Health insurance covers medical care. An individual can choose the licensed insurance company to which one will pay health insurance contributions.
Mandatory contributions are calculated from the individual's gross remuneration. Income that is subject to income tax is generally subject to contributions into the social security and health insurance system.
The contribution rates calculated from the gross salary are as follows:
The maximum annual cap for the assessment base for calculation of contributions into the social security system is 48 times the average monthly wage per year (i.e. CZK 2,234,736 for 2025). This cap applies to both employees and entrepreneurs.
There is no cap for contribution for the health insurance.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is generally charged at 21% on supplies of goods and services within the Czech Republic.
Certain supplies (e.g. groceries [excluding most drinks], medicaments, drinking tap water, construction works related to social housing, hotel accommodation, admission to cultural, sport, theatre, or similar facilities, catering services, heat, and cold) are taxed at a rate of 12% starting 1 January 2024.
Exports are generally exempt from VAT with a credit. Some supplies are exempt without a credit, including the lease of real estate (with certain exceptions), financial and insurance services, education, health, and welfare.
VAT deduction on personal cars is limited to CZK 420,000.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in the Czech Republic.
## Inheritance and gift tax
There is no inheritance tax.
Gifts are not taxed by a special gift tax, but rather they are included in the recipient's PIT. A tax exemption applies to gifts received from close relatives.
## Property tax
Property tax is paid each year from real estate owned by the taxpayer as at 1 January of the respective year. The amount is based on the type and size of the real estate, the purpose of usage, and the location.
## Tax on real estate acquisition
There is no real estate acquisition tax, transfer tax, or similar tax.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is generally charged at 21% on supplies of goods and services within the Czech Republic.
Certain supplies (e.g. groceries [excluding most drinks], medicaments, drinking tap water, construction works related to social housing, hotel accommodation, admission to cultural, sport, theatre, or similar facilities, catering services, heat, and cold) are taxed at a rate of 12% starting 1 January 2024.
Exports are generally exempt from VAT with a credit. Some supplies are exempt without a credit, including the lease of real estate (with certain exceptions), financial and insurance services, education, health, and welfare.
VAT deduction on personal cars is limited to CZK 420,000.
### VAT registration
Companies seated in the Czech Republic whose turnover exceeds CZK 2 million in a calendar year must register as a VAT payer with the tax authorities. If the turnover exceeds CZK 2,536,500, they become a VAT payer immediately.
For non-resident companies, there is no registration threshold, but they must register as a VAT payer (unless they opt-in for a SME scheme for the Czech Republic in the EU country of their establishment) if they:
A company can register as a VAT payer voluntarily even if its turnover does not reach the threshold if it renders or is going to render taxable supplies or VAT exempt supplies with credit in the Czech Republic.
Under certain circumstances, companies not registered for VAT to whom VAT liability arises due to acquired goods or services become persons identified for VAT. A person identified for VAT only pays VAT from received supplies without being entitled to recover related input VAT in its VAT return.
### VAT returns and payments
The VAT return must be filed and tax paid within 25 days after the end of the taxable period. The taxable period is a calendar month (or calendar quarter under certain circumstances). All VAT payers registered in the Czech Republic have to submit a report, a so-called ‘control statement’. In the control statement, the VAT payers have to give detailed evidence of data from invoices that have been issued and received, so that the Czech Financial Administration can compare and check transactions with business partners. The control statement does not substitute for a VAT return. Legal entities have to file the report every calendar month, and the deadline for submission of the control statement is no later than 25 days after the taxable period. VAT payers have to submit all VAT reports to the Czech tax authorities electronically.
## Customs duties
The Czech Republic is an EU member state; consequently, the EU customs code applies.
## Excise taxes
Excise tax is charged on the production or import of certain products, such as tobacco, and tobacco products and heated tobacco products, wines, semi-products, spirits and pure ethanol, beer, fuel, and mineral oils.
## Energy taxes
Energy tax is charged on natural gas and certain other gases, solid fuels, and on electricity sold to final customers in the Czech Republic.
## Real estate tax
Real estate tax is payable annually by the owner of land or buildings. The amount of the tax is dependent on area, location, and usage of the land or buildings. Paved areas used for business purposes (such as concrete areas in logistics centres) are taxable, with taxpayers obligated to self-assess the tax. However, some areas (e.g. publicly accessible parking lands in shopping malls) are not taxable. Effectively from 2025, the calculation of tax will be affected by an inflation coefficient.
## Real estate transfer tax
The real estate transfer tax was abolished in 2020.
## Stamp duties
There are no stamp duties in the Czech Republic. Certain business operations in which a notary has to be involved by operation of law are subject to notarial fee.
## Payroll taxes
Employers (including economic employers and certain types of PEs) in the Czech Republic are obligated to submit monthly withholdings and an annual reconciliation in respect of their employees. The withholdings include personal income tax (PIT) and statutory social security and health insurance.
## Social security and health insurance contributions
Employers contribute 33.8% of the employee's gross salary to the state health and social security funds (9% for health insurance and 24.8% for social security). A cap on only the social security contributions applies, while the health insurance contribution is uncapped.
## Road tax
Road tax is payable annually with respect to vehicles (including private vehicles) used for commercial purposes. Rates vary depending on engine capacity and vehicle size. From 2022, the road tax was effectively abolished for cars, buses, and trucks up to 12 tons. Road tax for vehicles exceeding this limit remains in place.
## Exit tax
There is no separate exit tax as such. The exit taxation (implemented in line with the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive [ATAD]) is part of the CIT. The rate is thus the same as for the standard CIT, i.e. 19%. The tax is imposed upon the relocation of assets without a change of ownership (i) between the Czech company and its foreign PE whose income is exempt from Czech taxation based on a double tax treaty (DTT), (ii) between a Czech PE and the foreign headquarters if subsequent sales of such assets were not taxable in the Czech Republic, or (iii) when a Czech tax resident changes its tax residence if subsequent sales of such assets were not taxable in the Czech Republic.
A taxpayer shall be subject to the tax on the amount equal to the market value of the transferred assets, at the time of exit of the assets, less their values for tax purposes. The instalments may further defer the tax payment over the next five years.
The only exceptions are asset transfers related to financing of securities, assets posted as collateral, etc. if the assets are set to revert to the member state of the transferor within 12 months.
## Gambling tax
The tax rate for technical gambling (land-based and on the web) is 35% and for other gambling games (e.g. dice, cards, roulette, bingo, odds betting, horse race betting, raffles, or poker) is 30%. The tax base is the gross gaming revenue (bets less pay-outs).

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
Corporate income tax (CIT) applies to the profits generated by all companies, including branches of foreign companies. Corporate partners in general partnerships (i.e. unlimited) and corporate general partners (i.e. unlimited) in a limited partnership are subject to CIT on their share of the profits in the partnership.
Czech resident companies are required to pay CIT on income derived from worldwide sources. Non-resident companies are required to pay CIT on income sourced in the Czech Republic.
The CIT rate is 21% for tax periods starting in 2024 (19% for the previous tax periods) and applies to all business profits, including capital gains from the sale of shares (if not exempt under the participation exemption regime)
In 2023 through 2025, a ’windfall tax‘ (60% CIT surcharge) applies to excess profits of large banks and companies within the energy sector. The excess profits are calculated on the basis of the average CIT base declared by the company in years 2018 through 2021, and this average CIT base is then increased by 20%. The part of the annual CIT base generated by the company in years 2023 through 2025 that exceeds this increased average CIT base for years 2018 through 2021 is subject not only to the standard CIT of 19% (21% in 2024 and 2025) but also to the additional CIT surcharge of 60% (therefore, the total CIT applying to these excessive profits is 79% [81% in 2024 and 2025]).
There is a special CIT rate of 15% levied on dividend income of Czech tax resident entities received from non-resident entities (unless subject to participation exemption).
A 5% CIT rate applies to income of certain investment funds, and a 0% CIT rate applies to pension funds.
## Pillar 2 minimum tax
The Pillar 2 rules apply to multinational groups with presence in the Czech Republic. The groups are in scope if the revenue in their Consolidated Financial Statements as prepared in accordance with an acceptable Financial Accounting Standard of the ultimate parent entity (UPE) exceeds EUR 750 million based on at least two of the four fiscal years immediately preceding the fiscal year.
## Local income taxes
There are no regional or local income taxes in the Czech Republic.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
## General tax-deductibility rules
General requirements for an expense to be treated as tax deductible are:
There are special rules regarding tax deductibility of special types of expenses (e.g. tax depreciation and amortisation, interest expenses).
## Depreciation and amortisation
Methods of tax depreciation are prescribed by tax legislation and are independent from depreciation methods for accounting purposes. Tax depreciation is calculated on an asset-by-asset basis, applying the straight-line or accelerated basis methods of depreciation at statutory rates. Under both methods, depreciation expense in the first year is lower than for subsequent years. The company may choose which method to apply to a new asset, but once the choice is made, it cannot be altered. All assets are classified into six groups, which determine the number of years over which the asset will be written off, as follows:
| Depreciation group | Assets | Minimum depreciation period (years) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Office machines and computers, tools | 3 |
| 2 | Engines, motor vehicles, machines, audio-visual equipment, electric vehicle chargers | 5 |
| 3 | Elevators, escalators, turbines, air conditioning equipment, electric motors, and generators | 10 |
| 4 | Buildings made of wood and plastic, long-distance lines, and pipes | 20 |
| 5 | Buildings (except for those listed in groups 4 and 6), roads, bridges, tunnels | 30 |
| 6 | Administrative buildings, department stores, historical buildings, and hotels | 50 |
### Tangible assets
‘Tangible assets’ (i.e. assets that are subject to tax depreciation) are defined by tax legislation generally as assets with economic useful lives greater than one year and acquisition prices higher than CZK 80,000 for assets acquired after 31 December 2020 (up to the end of 2019 the threshold was set at CZK 40,000; in 2020, taxpayers have a choice between CZK 40,000 and CZK 80,000 for assets acquired in that year). Certain assets, such as buildings, are always considered tangible assets.
Taxpayers are generally not obligated to depreciate a tangible asset for tax purposes every year. Depreciation may be interrupted in any year and continued in a later year without a loss of depreciation potential.
Tangible assets are generally depreciated by the taxpayer with ownership title. Certain exceptions apply, for instance, technical appreciation of a rented asset carried out by a tenant or a subtenant may be depreciated by that tenant/subtenant, subject to certain conditions.
Depreciation can start only once the assets are put into use and comply with the requirements of specific laws.
Certain assets have special depreciation methods (e.g. moulds are depreciated based on expected life or number of products).
The value to be used as the basis for tax depreciation depends on how the asset is acquired, for example:
For passenger transport vehicle (i.e. basically personal automobiles of category M1) acquired from 1 January 2024 onwards, the maximum acquisition price from which tax depreciation can be claimed is limited to CZK 2 million.
### Intangible assets
Pre-2020 intangible assets are amortised for tax purposes based on the number of years that the taxpayer has a licence for the assets if the licence is for a limited number of years. Otherwise, amortisation for tax purposes will vary depending on the type asset acquired prior to 2020 (e.g. audio-visual work is amortised over at least 18 months, results of R&D and software are amortised over at least 36 months).
For intangible assets acquired in 2020, the taxpayers have a choice of following the old or new tax treatment.
## Goodwill and revaluation difference
Czech accounting regulations recognise two valuation options for allocating the purchase price for the purchase of the business (or its part) as a going concern: (i) revaluation difference (assets/liabilities are individually revaluated to fair market values) and (ii) goodwill (net book value of the assets/liabilities are taken over to the opening balance sheet). Both the revaluation difference and goodwill must be depreciated equally over 180 calendar months for tax purposes. Any other goodwill/revaluation difference (e.g. arisen within a merger) is disregarded for tax purposes.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses are directly deductible.
## Interest expenses
Interest as accrued and duly accounted for under Czech GAAP is generally tax deductible, with the following exceptions:
## Bad debt
Doubtful or bad receivables that have not yet become statute-barred may be provisioned for under special rules. Generally, provisions may be created for trade receivables overdue for more than 18 months. Provisions of 100% may be created for debts overdue for 30 months. For receivables, banks, insurance companies, and defined financial institutions have their specific system for provisioning.
## Charitable donations
Certain charitable donations are deductible. The minimum deductible donation is CZK 2,000, and the maximum deductible donation is 10% of the CIT base (for donations in the tax periods ending from March 2020 up to February 2024, the cap is increased to 30% of the tax base - the period for application is expected to be prolonged).
## Travel expenses and meal allowances
Payments for travel expenses and meal allowances that are made to employees may generally be tax-deductible.
## Fines and penalties
Contractual fines and penalties are generally tax deductible on a cash basis. Non-contractual fines are not tax deductible.
## Taxes
Road tax, real estate tax, and most other taxes, with the exception of income taxes, are deductible, as are social security contributions paid by an employer with respect to employees.
## Other significant items
Fees paid to members of other statutory bodies of companies (i.e. board of directors of joint stock companies and cooperatives) for their services are deductible for tax purposes.
## Net operating losses
Losses incurred in a tax year may be carried forward to offset taxable profits generated in the following five tax years. There is no limitation as to the amount of the tax losses that can be carried forward. From 2020, tax losses may also be carried back for two years. The maximum amount of the loss that can be carried back is CZK 30 million.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Generally, deductions may be claimed for royalties, management service fees, and interest charges paid to foreign affiliates, provided such amounts are at arm’s length and the Czech company is able to prove that these payments meet the general rules for tax deductibility.

# Czech Republic
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
Currently, the Czech Republic does not permit group taxation. Each company in a group is taxed individually. Consolidated tax base applies only for the general partners and their shares in profit of their general partnership.
## Transfer pricing
For tax purposes, prices agreed between related parties have to meet the definition of the arm's-length principle, and these prices are often subject to tax audits by tax authorities. The consequences of incorrect transfer pricing and subsequent adjustments are tax exposure and penalties. In the case of companies receiving investment incentives, incorrect transfer pricing can result in additional penalties. Generally, pricing methods as described in OECD guidelines should be followed.
Although there is no legal requirement to keep transfer pricing documentation, in practice it is strongly recommended to keep it as the taxpayer bears the burden of proof upon challenge of prices by tax authorities.
Taxpayers may request the tax administrators to issue an advance pricing agreement (APA) regarding progressing or future transactions between related parties, as well as the determination of the tax base of PEs.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
The CbC report is an outcome of the Action Plan for Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) by the OECD that was implemented to the Czech legislation based on the EU Directive DAC IV. The CbC report is a transparent report disclosing the income, earnings, taxes paid, and other information on the economic activity of multinational groups reporting consolidated revenues of over EUR 750 million.
Czech entities that are part of a multinational group reporting annual consolidated revenues of over EUR 750 million were obligated to submit a one-off Notification. The Czech ultimate parents submitted the CbC report by 31 December 2017 for the first time. The report must be submitted every year within 12 months after the close of the relevant fiscal year.
From 2024, entities that are part of a group with a foreign element will be required to publish a tax report summarising the tax position of the group.
## Thin capitalisation
Thin capitalisation rules apply in the Czech Republic and may limit the tax deductibility of interest payments on debt financing from related parties as well as in certain cases from third parties (e.g. back-to-back financing with a bank interposed between two related parties).
Below is a brief summary of the thin capitalisation rules:
## ATAD interest stripping rules
Based on these rules, any 'net borrowing costs', defined as the excess of tax deductible borrowing costs over related taxable borrowing income, is only tax deductible up to:
whichever is higher.
The borrowing costs include various types of interest-like expenses, such as actual interest expenses, expenses that are similar to interest, deemed interest expenses included in hedging instruments, interest element included in the financial leasing costs, interest capitalised in the value of assets and subsequently included in tax depreciation, and foreign exchange costs related to interest.
Any interest costs treated as tax non-deductible due to these rules may be carried forward for an indefinite period of time and used as a deduction in the years where the threshold has not been reached (it does not pass to the legal successor).
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
The EU ATAD rules regarding a CFC have been implemented in Czech domestic tax legislation. A CFC is defined as a Czech non-resident company in which the Czech company participates (alone or together with its related parties) by more than 50% on voting rights or profits.
If such a CFC does not carry out a 'genuine business activity', and the actual CIT that the CFC paid in the country of its residence is lower than one half of the CIT that the CFC would have paid if it had been a Czech tax resident company, or is located in a country included on the EU black-list of non-cooperating jurisdictions as at the end of the tax period reviewed, then the following types of income of the CFC must be included in the CIT base of the Czech controlling company in the proportion of the share of the Czech company in the capital of the CFC:
This means that the above income must be taxed in the Czech Republic within the tax base of the Czech controlling company as if it the income was generated by this company.
## Hybrid mismatches
The EU ATAD rules aimed at preventing the effects of hybrid mismatch arrangements in relations between associated companies have also been implemented. These arrangements occur in situations where, for example, expenses are deducted twice in different countries, gains are not taxed, or a combination of both.
The aim is to prevent these mismatches. 'Non-taxation' occurring as a result of hybrid mismatches is preferentially addressed by applying the primary defensive rule (e.g. by not allowing a tax deduction if the income is tax-exempt in the other country).
If the rule is not enforced, the other country should apply the secondary defensive rule (to tax the income the given case). The hybrid mismatch rules are effective from 1 January 2020.

# Czech Republic
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
A foreign company can trade in the Czech Republic through a Czech branch. A branch usually creates a Czech PE of the foreign entity for CIT purposes (depending on the character of the activities carried out through the branch). The basis of taxation is the same as for corporations (i.e. tax base is calculated as taxable revenues less tax-deductible costs).
A branch is liable for tax on its attributable profits at the standard CIT rate. PEs of foreign companies may request for a binding ruling on the tax base determination.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
Up to 100% of specific R&D expenses (or costs) incurred in a given tax year may be deducted from the tax base as a special tax allowance. These costs are therefore deducted twice for tax purposes: once as a normal tax-deductible cost and then again as a special tax allowance. An additional 10% may be applied as an allowance from the difference by which the current year qualifying costs exceed those of the prior period.
The following costs can be included in the R&D tax allowance:
The taxpayer needs to inform the tax authorities about the intention to claim the R&D allowance, and by the date for filing of the CIT return for the year in which the allowance started to be claimed for a specific project the taxpayer must prepare a written project documentation in a format defined by the tax legislation.
Any non-utilised R&D allowance may be carried forward for three subsequent years.
A taxpayer may request a binding ruling with respect to R&D costs from the respective tax office in the event that the taxpayer is unsure of whether certain R&D costs are eligible for the allowance.

## International agreements
In 2014, the United States and the Czech Republic signed an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) implementing the tax reporting and withholding procedures associated with the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). The deadline for the annual reporting is 30 June for the preceding calendar year.
The Common Reporting Standard (CRS), whereby financial institutions report certain information on the accounts they keep, was implemented into Czech legislation in 2017. The deadline for the annual reporting is 30 June for the preceding calendar year.
The Czech Republic has an effective bilateral TIEA with the following countries: Andorra, Aruba, Bahamas, Belize, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Cook Islands, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey, Monaco, and San Marino.
The Czech Republic is also a party to the multilateral OECD Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters.
In 2020, the Czech Republic ratified the Multilateral Instrument whereby it implemented into its DTTs a principal purpose test provision, a new wording of preamble, and a Mutual Agreement Procedure.

## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
## Foreign tax relief
Based on Czech domestic tax legislation, when eliminating double taxation of income from abroad, the provisions of DTTs concluded by the Czech Republic are to be followed. Alternatively, in some cases, income from abroad can be exempt from taxation in the Czech Republic based on the local Czech legislation. If no applicable treaty exists, the income can be reduced by the tax paid on the income abroad.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
The Czech Republic has progressive personal income tax (PIT) rates (with two tax brackets applicable to almost all types of income) as follows:
Certain types of capital income (such as dividends and interest income from bonds) are subject to the 15% tax rate.
An important change that will come into effect from 1 January 2025 is limitation for tax exemption of capital gains from sale of shares in companies. Until the end of 2024, a full tax exemption of capital gains from sale of shares is available to individuals if the individual owned the shares for a period exceeding three years for shares having the form of securities and five years for shares in other companies. From 2025, the maximum annual amount of income (i.e. the sales price of the shares) that can be tax exempt will be limited to CZK 40 million.
Extensive VAT Act amendment was adopted. A registration threshold CZK 2,000,000 is newly calculated for calendar year. If the turnover exceeds CZK 2,536,500, the entity becomes a VAT payer immediately. A time limit for input VAT recovery was shortened and rules for its adjustment in case of overdue debts were modified. Small Business Scheme was extended. A number of other changes come info effect.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
Generally, with the exception of employment income, necessary expenses incurred in earning income are deductible from income. Normally, deductions will be based on the actual expenditure incurred; however, for certain categories of income, a fixed percentage of gross income may be claimed as a deduction (e.g. lump-sum deductions of 80% for agricultural income or craft activities, 60% for a limited number of trading and entrepreneurial activities, 40% for activities pursuant to the special statutory provision, 30% for renting a property). However, the lump-sum expense deductions are applicable only up to the maximum amount of the respective percentage out of CZK 2 million (i.e. maximum CZK 1,600,000, CZK 1,200,000, CZK 800,000, or CZK 600,000, respectively).
Tax-deductible expenses are broadly defined in Czech tax law as expenses incurred to ‘attain, secure, and/or maintain’ taxable income, though specific restrictions are placed on certain costs.
## Employment expenses
No deductions are provided for expenditures incurred in connection with taxable income from employment. However, sums received by way of reimbursement for travel expenses are exempt from tax, provided they do not exceed statutory limits.
## Personal deductions
Personal tax base and tax deductions are generally available for Czech tax residents. Tax non-residents should have at least 90% of worldwide income from Czech sources to utilise them.
### Charitable contributions
Donations provided to certain organisations or individuals for the purpose of financing science, education, culture, etc. are deductible for an individual up to a maximum of 15% of the tax base\*, provided the total value of the donations exceeds 2% of the tax base or is at least CZK 1,000. Blood donation is also considered a form of charitable donation, which is valued at CZK 3,000 per one blood collection.
\* For the years 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025 the maximum limit was temporarily increased up to 30% of the tax base.
### Mortgage interest deduction
For interest paid on a mortgage, a deduction is applicable under several strict conditions up to:
### Old age savings products
As of 2024, there is a new tax deduction available for old age savings products. This deduction includes private pension insurance, life insurance premiums, and long-term investments products. This deduction is applicable up to CZK 48,000 per year under certain conditions.
## Personal allowances
Unlike other countries that permit personal exemptions and allowances in determining taxable income, the Czech Republic has adopted a system of tax credits (*see the [Other tax credits and incentives](other-tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for more information*).
## Business deductions
Deductible expenses for an entrepreneur are generally the same as those permitted under the corporate income tax system (*see the [Deductions](../corporate/deductions.html) section in the Corporate tax summary*). For example, fixed assets can be depreciated in accordance with statutory rates.
## Losses
Losses arising from a source of income are offset against other sources of income in the year in which such income arises, with the exception of employment income. If an overall loss is realised, it can be carried forward and offset against taxable income (other than employment income) arising in the following five years. From 2020, tax losses may be carried back for two years.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
## Taxation on cash basis
Individuals are taxed in the Czech Republic on a cash basis (with certain exceptions). That means that, in general, income becomes taxable for the individual only after the income has actually been received by the individual.
## Employment income
Non-resident directors’ fees and fees payable to non-resident members of other statutory bodies of Czech companies are subject to a WHT of:
No further tax is payable on this income.
When paid to tax residents, directors’ fees and fees to members of other statutory bodies of Czech companies are taxed under the payroll administration rule. All resident and non-resident directors from EU member states and other countries from the European Economic Area may, however, file the tax return when they utilise their personal tax deduction(s).
## Capital gains
There is no separate capital gains tax in the Czech Republic. Capital gains constitute part of the aggregate individual income tax base subject to progressive PIT rates depending on the overall level of gross income.
Gains on the sale of property are exempt if the individual has owned the property for longer than the specified time limit.
The main time limits are as follows:
Note that the above applies to gains on property that do not form part of the individual's business property. Gains on business property are taxed based on principles similar to those that apply to companies.
Note that gross proceeds from the sale of shares below the limit of CZK 100,000 per taxable period are exempt from taxation.
## Dividend and interest income
Income from capital (i.e. dividends and other yields from securities, limited liability companies or limited partnerships, and interest and profit shares from silent partnerships) is taxable income and is generally treated as a part of the total annual tax base.
Dividends and other yields from securities or partnerships from limited liability companies or limited partnerships, profit shares from silent partnerships, and interest from deposit certificates and bonds paid by a Czech resident entity to a Czech tax resident are all subject to WHT of 15%. A WHT rate of 15% applies to income received by resident individuals from interest and other yields from savings on deposit accounts.
The rate of 15% also applies to income paid to Czech tax non-residents residing in EU/EEA states or in a state having concluded a DTT or an agreement on exchange of tax information with the Czech Republic. In other cases, the tax rate for this type of income is 35%.
WHT may be reduced under the applicable DTT. Several of these treaties further reduce the rate of WHT. Reduced WHT rates are only applicable if the individual remains tax resident in another jurisdiction (i.e. the other party to the DTT) and is not treated as a Czech tax resident as defined under the treaty.
## Rental income
Income from the lease of real estate or the lease/rental of movable property represents another subgroup of taxable income. Deductible expenditures can be determined either as actual expenses or as a lump-sum percentage of taxable income (30%). Annual lump-sum expenses are limited to CZK 600,000.
