# Congo, Republic of
## Overview
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
The Republic of Congo, a country located in Central Africa, is bordered by Gabon to the west, Cameroon and the Central African Republic to the north, the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the south and east, and Cabinda (Angola) and the Atlantic Ocean to the southwest. In 1960, the Republic of Congo declared its independence. The Republic of Congo is divided into 12 regions, with Brazzaville as the capital. The currency is the CFA franc (*Coopération financière en Afrique centrale* franc or XAF), and the official language is French. However, several regional languages are also recognised.
In the early 1980s, rapidly rising oil revenues pushed the Republic of Congo's gross domestic product (GDP) growth to a 5% annual average, one of the highest rates in Africa. Subsequent trends in oil prices have continued to affect economic progress.
In 2016, the petroleum industry accounted for an estimated 60% of the state budget, and, despite a decade of modest reforms initiated by the government of President Sassou Nguesso, the Republic of Congo remains heavily dependent on oil revenues to finance its development.
The oil and gas downturn has significantly impacted the economic environment. With the severe strain of continued low oil prices, the Congolese government has initiated political and economic actions to diversify its revenue stream to reduce its dependence on hydrocarbon and increase the contribution of tax-based revenue. In this respect, incentives are available for the development of other sectors, such as agriculture, forestry, tourism, etc.
Our tax practice is developed around functions such as corporate income tax (CIT), indirect taxes (value-added tax [VAT] and customs), personal income tax (PIT), and withholding tax (WHT) management. Our tax practice has teams that provide varied tax advisory services to clients operating in all the major sectors of the Congolese economy. We advise clients on a wide range of tax and business issues, including restructuring of transactions for maximum tax advantage.

# Congo, Republic of
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The Congolese VAT rate is 18%. In addition to VAT, a surtax calculated at the rate of 5% applies to the amount of VAT, which must be invoiced and paid at the same time as the VAT. Therefore, the VAT rate is globally 18.9%. The surtax is not deductible (final cost).
A reduced VAT at the rate of 5% is levied on some listed products, gas oil products, and lubricants imported from border countries by forestry companies registered in the Congo. Since the publication of the Finance Act for 2024, sales and acquisitions of goods and services by developers of special economic zones are also subject to the reduced VAT rate of 5%.
Under the provisions of the VAT Law, all economic activities (including services provided in the Congo via e-commerce platforms established in the Congo or abroad, the same applies to commissions received by the operators of these platforms) conducted in the Republic of Congo are subject to VAT, regardless of their purpose, profitability, or the legal status of the business performing them, and irrespective of whether these activities are habitual, occasional, or originate in the Republic of Congo or from a foreign country. Therefore, any person, natural or legal, engaged in an industrial, commercial, or professional activity is subject to VAT unless specifically exempt by law.
Service is considered as provided in the Republic of Congo when the service is used, exploited, or materially locatable in the Republic of Congo or, for the provision of intangible services, when the recipient is established in the Republic of Congo.
In principle, an entrepreneur is entitled to credit the VAT paid on purchases of goods, equipment, and services for use in business (input VAT) against the total of the tax charges to one's customers for deliveries made and services rendered (output VAT).
Taxpayers not exclusively carrying out transactions giving rise to a VAT deduction shall deduct VAT proportionally on the portion of the income pertaining to taxable transactions.
VAT payers carrying structural VAT credit have the obligation to do inventories in the presence of tax administration representatives for companies in October, failure to which the VAT credit shall be cancelled.
VAT paid on behalf of foreign suppliers is not deductible, provided that the related services have not been subject to income tax in the Republic of Congo.
VAT payers have the obligation to provide an excerpt of their VAT trial balance of each account on VAT in accordance with the accounting system used by the company, failure to which all VAT deductions shall be added back.
Taxpayers without a Tax Identification Number (NIU) and a receipt issued in their name by the collection service, indicating the amount of VAT paid, will lose the right to deduct the VAT on custom clearance duties on goods.
Exporters subject to VAT who realise more than 80% of their sale transactions abroad are obligated to withhold VAT paid on the purchases of goods and services (the list of exporters entitled to withhold VAT will be published by the tax authorities).
VAT resulting from tax assessment is not deductible.
VAT paid in cash in connection with invoices exceeding XAF 200,000 is not deductible.
A VAT return must be filed on a monthly basis before the 20th day of every month.
## Customs duties
When applicable, import duties are payable at rates ranging from 5% to 30% on the customs value of imported goods. Customs value is calculated on the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) level.
### Customs duties rates
| Group | Rates (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Basic necessities | 5 |
| Raw materials and capital goods | 10 |
| Intermediate and miscellaneous goods | 20 |
| Consumer goods | 30 |
### Additional entry taxes
Additional entry taxes apply on the importation of goods, such as:
### Reduced rate and exemption incentives
Imports of agricultural, horticultural, forestry, or fishery equipment and machinery, as well as fertilizers and other agricultural inputs, are exempt from VAT and customs duties. Vegetable oil and maize, as well as butane gas and mineral water, produced and packaged in the Congo are exempt from VAT.
A reduced rate of VAT at 5% is applicable to the customs border on imports of oil and gas products and lubricants imported from boarder-sharing countries by forestry companies established in the Republic of Congo.
Imports of wheat flour or of products similarly referenced for custom duties purposes are now subject to customs duties at the standard rate of 30%.
Cement produced in Congo is exempt from export duty.
The forestry tax now applies to exports of resin and other exudates extracted from trees in natural forests and plantations, as follows:
| Products | Units | XAF |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pine resin | Kg | 2.765 |
| Rubber latex | Kg | 5.700 |
| Other exudates | Kg | 1.700 |
Resin exports from natural forests and plantation trees are now subject to a 4% customs duty upon their export, on the free on board (FOB) value declared.
## Computer royalty
Computer royalty at a varying rate from 0.5% to 2% to cover expenses incurred by the Customs Administration on computer data processing is applicable without exception or exemption to all importation and exportation of goods. The royalty applies on the customs taxable value of any imported or exported goods in the Republic of Congo.  Computer royalty at 0% is applicable to transactions relating to donations, projects, and other imports carried out by embassies, international organisations, non-governmental organisations covered by a headquarters agreement, and on the export of crude oil.
Imports of agricultural, horticultural, forestry, or fishery equipment and machinery, as well as fertilizers and other agricultural inputs, are subject to the computer royalty and the community taxes.
The Finance Law for 2020 has abolished the reduced rates and exemptions from computer royalty granted to all sector of activities.
The 2021 revised Finance Law increased the computer rate for the import and export of goods under the common law from 1% to 2%. The subscription and regularisation of suspensive arrangements, other than community and international transit, is subject to computer royalty at the rate of 1%.
## Excise taxes
The Finance Law for 2020 establishes the list of products that are compulsorily subject to excise duties and therefore without possible exemption.
Excise duties are exclusive of other taxes assimilated to them.
The rates of excise duty shall be fixed as follows:
## Land tax on built properties
Land tax is payable annually on built properties and is due from the owner. However, properties built for the purpose of accommodation are exempt for ten years, and properties built for business purposes are exempt for five years.
The effective rate for properties built for business purposes is determined every year by the local council. In this circumstance, the land tax is levied on the rental value after a deduction of 75% (decline, maintenance, and repair expenses).
Regarding properties built for accommodation purposes, the effective rate of the tax is determined based on the cadastral value, which is equal to the price per square metre multiplied by the land area. The price per square metre for these properties, which is halved for each floor, in the case of level buildings, is determined as follows:
## Land tax on non-built properties
Land tax is payable annually on non-built properties and is due from the owner. However, properties intended for plantations and breeding are temporarily exempt for a three-to-ten-year range. The effective rate of the tax is determined based on the cadastral value, which is equal to the price per square metre multiplied by the land area.
Land tax on built properties is equal to the cadastral value after 75% deduction, while, for un-built properties, the tax is equal to 50% of the cadastral value. The land tax rate for built properties is at 18% in Pointe-Noire and 20% in Brazzaville, while the rate is at 40% for un-built properties.
The price per square metre for these properties is determined as follows:
## Rent tax
Rent tax is at the rate of 1/12 of the annual rent, paid no later than 20 February each year or annually.
For new lease agreements, the rent tax is due within three months following the date of entry into possession, at the rate of the 1/12 of the total rents due on 31 December of the said year.
The rent tax is imposed on the occupant of the premises (whether the occupant is the owner, a tenant, or a subtenant).
The rent tax is paid by the tenant on behalf of the owner, or by the subtenant on behalf of the tenant. The tenant/subtenant has the legal obligation to pay this tax on behalf of the lessor. Tenant and subtenants can deduct the tax paid between 1 January and 10 April of the same year from the rents due to the owner.
A 50% fine, assessed on the amount of the tax, is due for any late payment of the rent tax.
## Tax on occupancy of buildings
The tax on occupancy of buildings for professional use owed by oil companies is an amount of XAF 5 million per permit.
For residential premises, the tax if XAF 60,000 for houses located downtown and XAF 12,000 for houses located on the outskirts.
For business premises, the tax is:
## Registration fees and stamp duties
Lease agreement registration fees amount to 3% of the value of the annual rent paid during the tax year, including premises charges if any. ‘Additional centimes’ also apply at a 5% rate of the registration fees. Stamp duties and registration fees should be paid for the total duration of the lease agreement. In the case where the lease agreement is renewed, stamp duties and registration fees should be paid for the renewable period.
Stamp duty ranges from XAF 200 to XAF 20,000 on certain documents.
Examples of documents that are subject to stamp duty include:
The following fees for the registration of contracts are due within three months from date of signature:
Private contracts signed abroad are subject to registration within one month from their date.
Insurance contracts shall be registered and tax on insurance paid on the 20th day of the month following the insurance subscription. All importers have an obligation to insure imported equipment with local insurance companies.
Transfer of company shares are subject to a 5% registration fee.
Assignments of claims between legal entities governed by private law are subject to a registration fee of 4% based on the capital gain resulting from the assignment.
Deeds materialising the transfer of participating interests (rights and obligations) in oil contracts are subject to a proportional registration fee of 5%, with a minimum collection of XAF 1 million.
The direct or indirect transfer of assets or social rights of Congolese companies is also subject to a registration duty of 5% calculated on the value of the assets transferred and social rights of these companies. This registration duty is also due in the event of change of control of the company by a change of at least 60% shareholding.
Real state properties for the period from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2020 are subject to registration based on the flat-rate zone fees, summarised as follows:
## Single business licence
A single business licence has been introduced as an administrative reference file for companies. It is issued by the Congolese Agency for Business Creation (ACPCE) in exchange for the payment of the single tax and is valid for three years. Its renewal requires the presentation of a tax good standing certificate and a payment whose amount depends on the company’s corporate form and varies between XAF 20,000 and XAF 60,000.
## Payroll taxes
### Single tax on remuneration
A single tax, at the rate of 7.5% on the gross salary of resident employees and non-resident seafarers’ employees, shall be borne by the employer. The tax is 6% on the gross salary of non-resident, non-seafarers’ employees. The rate of the single tax on salaries due by oil companies is fixed at 2.5% of the gross salary. This tax is payable on the 20th day of the following month after the remunerations were due.
## Social contributions
The employer shall be liable for the following social contributions:
## Oil and gas
Specific rules and caps apply for the upstream (production) oil and gas industry.
Generally, oil and gas companies are now subject to taxation as under the common law.
### Royalties in the energy and hydraulic sector
For the energy sector, the royalty rate is as follows:
For the hydraulic sector, the fee ranges to XAF 400 per cubic metre of water withdrawn, depending on the usage (i.e. mining, industrial, agropastoral, etc.).
Any delay in the payment of the royalty is subject to 10% penalty, and omission to pay is subject to penalty at 100%.
## Business tax
The business tax ('*patente*', in French) is a tax collected for local communities.
Legal entities that carry out, in the Republic of Congo, a commercial activity, industrial activity, or any other activity not included in the statutory exemptions are subject to business tax.
The taxable basis of the business tax is:
Newly registered companies in their first calendar year are subject to business tax based on the forecast turnover that they declare.
Oil companies are subject to the contribution business tax under the conditions of ordinary law but would be liable to 50% of the tax due.
Foreign companies subject to the deemed profit tax regime are taxed for the entire year from the start of operations in the Republic of Congo on the basis of the estimated contract value of their services.
The business tax is payable on the basis of graduated rates as follows:
| Annual turnover (XAF) | Rate |
| --- | --- |
| Below 1,000,000 | XAF 10,000 |
| 1,000,001 to 20,000,000 | 0.75% |
| 20,000,001 to 40,000,000 | 0.65% |
| 40,000,001 to 100,000,000 | 0.45% |
| 100,000,001 to 300,000,000 | 0.20% |
| 300,000,001 to 500,000,000 | 0.15% |
| 500,000,001 to 1,000,000,000 | 0.14% |
| 1,000,000,001 to 3,000,000,000 | 0.135% |
| 3,000,000,001 to 20,000,000,000 | 0.125% |
| Above 20,000,000,000 | 0.045% |
Business tax is due for the 12-month period from 1 January to 31 December of the taxation year and must be paid in full by the taxpayer, not later than 20 April of each year. Beyond this date, the taxpayer is liable to a penalty of 100% of the amount in excess of the principal amount.
Business tax due by foreign companies subject to the deemed profit tax is payable within 15 days after the beginning of activities. Otherwise, a penalty of 100% is applied.
Until now, the situation of taxpayers having no turnover or operating expense in the Republic of Congo was not dealt with. With the Finance Act 2018, taxpayers having no commercial contract or operating expense in the Republic of Congo will be subject to a 25% business tax, applied on the amount of the last business tax paid normally.
Business tax paid to the Inland Revenue is not refundable.
## Solidarity contribution for universal health insurance coverage
The solidarity contribution for universal health insurance coverage is payable by legal entities, individual farmers, and holders of high incomes for the fraction of income exceeding XAF 500,000.
This contribution, liquidated at the rate of 0.5%, is based on the amount of the contribution for business tax during the financial year. The contribution due by companies is spontaneously declared and paid by the taxpayer to their tax residences, within the same deadlines as for the business tax, and late filing and payment are fined in the same manner as for business tax.
## Tax on company-owned cars
The tax on company-owned cars applies to the previous fiscal year company-owned cars and is due on 20 March at the latest.
With the exception of estate cars, private cars of companies falling into the category of own use cars for the issuance of vehicle registration documents are subject to tax.
The tax rates vary from XAF 200,000 for engine ratings not over nine horsepower, to XAF 500,000 for the rest.
Cars registered more than ten years ago are exempt from tax.

# Congo, Republic of
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
## Taxable period
The taxable period is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Companies subject to the actual tax regime are required to file their tax returns and pay their taxes and duties online. Failure to comply with this obligation is subject to a penalty equal to 10% of the amount to be declared. The year-end tax returns for these companies must be attested and certified by a chartered accountant in the absence of a statutory auditor, failure to which these filings will not be received by the tax authorities.
The annual CIT return is a specific form (*Déclaration Statistique et Fiscale* or DSF) that should be prepared in accordance with OHADA accounting principles. The form cannot be completed electronically.
Companies have to use the CEMAC CIT return form, which has been modified to be compliant with Congolese tax law (new form for the determination of the CIT basis and new tax balances for debts and liabilities).
The books must be maintained in French and in CFA francs. This accounting system must follow the OHADA chart of accounts. All entries have to be booked under OHADA standards throughout the year.
The annual CIT return must be filed on 20 May at the latest (due to COVID-19, the annual CIT return related to FY 2019 can be filed on 25 August at the latest).
## Payment of tax and penalties
Resident companies are required to pay quarterly instalments of tax (20 February, 20 May, 25 August, and 20 November), and these quarterly instalments are generally calculated with reference to the most recent CIT return. Special calculations of instalments apply to new taxpayers.
Based on the self-assessment system, when submitting annual tax returns due by 20 May every year, taxpayers must pay the amount of tax calculated in the annual tax return to the extent this amount exceeds tax instalments paid during the year.
Non-resident companies and individuals shall appoint tax representatives in the Republic of Congo. The Congolese resident shall be considered as tax representative if the non-resident person fails to appoint a tax representative.
Penalties, surcharges, and interest for late payment claimed by the tax authorities shall be paid separately from the relevant principal duties via bank transfer or bank cheques.
Payment of penalties, surcharges, and interest for late payment shall be made in cash for amounts less than XAF 200,000 into the current account of the Public Treasury.
## Tax audit process
Tax audits are usually announced by a letter from the tax authorities to the entity concerned of their intention to audit, while stating the period to be audited and the taxes that will be covered by the audit.
During an audit of accounts or tax review, taxpayers shall, within eight days from receipt of a request list from the tax auditors, make available all requested information.
Taxpayers whose annual turnover, excluding taxes, exceeds XAF 100 million, shall, from the first day of a general audit, share all internal and external audit reports with the tax auditors. The tax auditors may request any internal or external audit report relating to periods not covered by the accounting audit.
The tax authorities may organise meetings with the taxpayer to inform the taxpayer of the preliminary outcomes of the audit, and the taxpayer has the possibility to make counter remarks.
Thereafter, the tax authorities notify the taxpayer, in writing, of their proposed tax adjustments, and the taxpayer makes counter remarks in writing within 30 days from date of receipt of the tax adjustment notice.
Based on whether the tax authorities find the counter remarks from the taxpayer grounded or not, a letter confirming the tax adjustments or renouncing the proposed tax adjustments shall be sent to the taxpayer, who has the choice to either pay the taxes claimed, negotiate for a reduction of fines, or open up a tax litigation process.
The taxpayer may negotiate the taxes, fines, and the mode of payment of the tax claimed by the tax authorities thereby renouncing one’s right to open up tax litigation.
The taxpayer has the right to request from the Director General of Taxation and Real Estate a transactional mode of payment of fines or payment of tax by friendly settlement. If the taxpayer opts for the transaction, the taxpayer loses the right to object to the outcome of the transaction and is obligated to immediately pay the taxes due (principal and penalties) according to the agreement.
To open up a tax litigation process, the taxpayer will pay a prior deposit of 10% of the sum contested as guarantee (or a banking guarantee as security for litigation) and 5‰ (5 per thousand) of the sum contested for the treatment of the tax claim file and will submit the tax claim file to the Tax Head Office if the amount of the claim does not exceed XAF 1 billion and to the Director of Tax Department if the amount claimed is less than XAF 50 million.
When the amounts challenged by a taxpayer, in the context of a contentious claim, exceed XAF 1 billion, the said taxpayer must file a copy of one’s claim with the Minister in charge of Finance.
The Minister of Finance must be sent a copy of all contentious claims where the amount of taxes contested, in principal and penalties, exceeds XAF 1 billion.
The tax authorities will respond to the tax counter claim of the taxpayer, who, if not satisfied, could open a court claim.
## Statute of limitations
Generally, the statute of limitations period for CIT is four years following the year in which the tax was due. However, this rule does not apply in the case of fraudulent acts reported by the tax administration.
The recovery of tax debts from the Public Treasury is time-barred at the end of the tenth year following the year of collection if no act has interrupted the limitation period.
The collection of 3rd party taxes from their legal debtors will not be statute barred.
The tax authorities particularly focus on aspects such as:

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
The Republic of Congo taxes its residents on their worldwide income and taxes non-residents on their Congolese income.
An individual domiciled in the Republic of Congo, whether of Congolese or foreign nationality, is liable for personal income tax (PIT) on one’s worldwide income. Tax treaties may exempt specific types of foreign-source income from Congolese PIT, but the exempt income is still taken into account in determining the effective rate of Congolese tax payable on the individual's taxable income. Tax is also levied on some capital gains.
An individual who is not domiciled in the Republic of Congo is liable for Congolese tax only on income from Congolese sources (including income attributed to the Republic of Congo by a tax treaty) and on capital gains from the disposal of certain assets.
In the case of dividends, interests, and royalties from Congolese sources, a non-domiciled individual's tax liability is usually settled by withholding taxes (WHTs).
On other income, such as salaries for work performed in the Republic of Congo, profits of a business operating there, and income from Congolese real estate, a non-domiciled individual is liable for PIT at the same graduated rates as a domiciled individual. The non-domiciled individual is regarded as married with no dependent if of French nationality and single with no dependent in other cases.
A non-domiciled individual who is not resident in a country that has a tax treaty with the Republic of Congo may be liable for PIT at the graduated rates on five times the annual rental value of any residence available in the Republic of Congo if this figure exceeds Congolese-source income that would otherwise be taxed at the graduated rates.
Specific rules apply for salaries for duties performed in the Republic of Congo received by foreign employees seconded to work in the Republic of Congo for limited periods.
## Personal income tax rates
PIT rates are fixed at the end of the year to which they relate. The rates are applied progressively in that they increase with the taxpayer's taxable income. The rates for the tax year as reformed in the Finance Act of 2014 are as follows:
| Taxable income (XAF\*) | | Rate applicable to income band (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 464,000 | 1 |
| 464,000 | 1,000,000 | 10 |
| 1,000,000 | 3,000,000 | 25 |
| 3,000,000 |  | 40 |
\* CFA francs
Generally, the PIT rates are the same for domiciled and non-domiciled individuals. However, a tax rate of 20% is imposed on non-commercial income of a non-domiciled individual.
A tax rate of 20% is also imposed on salaries for duties performed in the Republic of Congo by foreign employees seconded to work in the Republic of Congo for limited periods.
## Global flat taxation
The global flat tax is at the rate of 5% (on annual turnover) or 8% (on annual margin). This taxation regime is applicable to persons with an annual income of not more than 152,449 euros (EUR) who keep minimal cash accounts.

Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
## Taxable period
PIT is assessed on the income earned during a calendar year, except that income derived from carrying on a business is assessed on the results for the accounting year ending within that calendar year.
## Tax returns
Every individual liable for income tax is required to complete a tax return based on the year's income and file it by 1 March following the end of that year.
## Payment of tax
Income tax is generally withheld from salaries under the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system. Income from most other Congolese sources is received after the savings-rate tax has been deducted.

# Congo, Republic of
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
Congolese-registered companies are taxed on the territoriality principle. As a result, Congolese companies engaged in business outside of the Republic of Congo are not taxed in the Republic of Congo on the related profits.
In the absence of a tax treaty stating otherwise, a non-resident company is liable for corporate income tax (CIT) on income realised in the Republic of Congo or derived from or resulting from work/services of any nature supplied or used in the Republic of Congo.
The standard CIT rate in the Republic of Congo is 28%, with certain exceptions.
## Minimum tax
The minimum tax payable is 1% of the annual turnover and cannot be less than XAF 1 million (XAF 500,000 if annual turnover is less than XAF 10 million).
The 1% rate is applied to the sum of gross turnovers, products, and benefits realised by the company in the most recent year in which it earned a profit. The 1% tax is not deductible for CIT purposes. However, in a company's first profit-making year after incurring the losses, half of the 1% tax is deductible.
The minimum tax is 1% of the taxable base, with a minimum amount payable of XAF 1 million, for companies that are totally exempt from CIT during the extension of their Convention of Establishment and/or any specific agreement.
The minimum tax is levied at a rate of 2% for taxpayers whose income has remained in deficit for two consecutive years. The minimum tax must now be paid between 10 March and 20 March of each year.
## Industry specific rates
Companies in the following sectors are exempt from CIT:
A CIT rate of 25% applies for microfinance companies and private schools organised as a company.
A CIT rate of 28% applies for mining companies and real estate companies.
A CIT rate of 33% is applied on a deemed profit equal to 22% of the total gross remuneration (i.e. an effective tax rate of 7.26% of the taxable turnover made in the Republic of Congo) derived from services rendered by:
Note that these companies revert to the general taxation regime the second year after the turnover realised with oil and gas sector companies becomes less than 70% of their annual turnover.
A substantiated request shall be made to the Director General of Taxation between 10 October and 20 October of the second year, who shall reply, at the latest, by 15 December of the same year.
## Headquarters operations of foreign companies
The headquarters operations of foreign enterprises taxation regime is subject to prior approval by the tax authorities.
If enacted, headquarters operations of foreign enterprises and international groups will be granted a favourable tax status in the Republic of Congo. For those that qualify, CIT is charged on a deemed profit equivalent to a prescribed percentage of headquarters expenses, the percentage of which is currently unknown.
To qualify, the headquarters must be registered under the form of a public limited company or branch and must act solely for the benefit of the group in the area of management, control, or coordination.
## Global flat taxation
The global flat tax is at 5% (of the annual turnover) or 8% (of the annual margin) and applies in lieu of the standard CIT rate. It is calculated on the annual turnover of enterprises taxable under the flat rate regime, whose turnover does not exceed XAF 100 million.
## Local income taxes

## Social security contributions
The employee share for pensions is 4% of gross salary with an annual ceiling of EUR 21,952.65.
Foreign employees seconded to work in the Republic of Congo for limited periods are, in some circumstances, liable for national insurance contributions.
Employers are also liable for additional social security contributions and payroll taxes.
### Unique tax on salaries
A unique tax on salaries at the rate of 7.5% on the gross salary replaces the lump sum tax on salaries, apprenticeship tax, National Housing Fund contribution, and National Employment Office contribution.
## Solidarity contribution for universal health insurance coverage
The solidarity contribution for universal health insurance coverage is payable by legal entities, individual farmers, and holders of high incomes for the fraction of income exceeding XAF 500,000.
This contribution, liquidated at the rate of 0.5%, is based on the amount of the contribution for business tax during the financial year. The contribution due by companies is spontaneously declared and paid by the taxpayer to their tax residences, within the same deadlines as for the business tax, and late filing and payment are fined in the same manner as for business tax.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
## Local taxes
There are no local taxes in the Republic of Congo. Local authorities are financed by the imposition of a departmental tax at an annual flat rate of XAF 2,000 per individual.

# Congo, Republic of
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
## Services, dividends, and attendance fees
### Services
Services rendered by foreign suppliers are subject to a WHT. There are four WHT rates, which include the following:
In addition, companies that have no tax residence in the Republic of Congo are subject to a 20% WHT if they earn revenues realised in the Republic of Congo or coming from the Republic of Congo, and which come from works or services of any nature performed or used in the Republic of Congo. This 20% WHT also includes premiums transferred abroad in reinsurance above the ceiling of 50% and collected by companies not domiciled in the CIMA member states (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Republic of Congo, Cote d’Ivoire, Gabon, Guinea Bissau, Equatorial Guinea, Mali, Niger, Central Africa Republic, Senegal, and Togo).
WHT does not apply to resident suppliers of a country that has signed an international tax treaty with the Republic of Congo, provided certain conditions are met.
The 2023 Finance Law introduces a 10% WHT on sums paid by a Congolese resident to a resident in any CEMAC member country for services rendered.
Following the double tax treaty (DTT) signed with China, the following rates are applicable:
### Payments made by building and public work companies to their sub-contractors
WHT is applicable on payments made by building and public work companies to their sub-contractors, including to engineering offices, at the following rates:
Non-observances, omissions, or underpayments are sanctioned by an XAF 5 million fine and by the non-deductibility of the amounts so paid. Late payments are sanctioned by a 2% penalty per month or portion of month, with a maximum penalty of 100%.
For the considered sub-contractors, said withholding is considered as an instalment of tax.
### Dividends
Dividends distributed by a Congolese company are subject to a 15% WHT unless a different rate applies under an international tax treaty (e.g. China, France, Italy, Mauritius, CEMAC). The same rate applies for dividends distributed to a resident shareholder.
The Congo-China treaty provides a 5% WHT if the beneficial owner is a company directly holding at least 25% of the paying company's capital; otherwise, 10%.
Under the tax treaties between France and the Republic of Congo and between Italy and the Republic of Congo, the applicable WHT rate is 15%.
Under the tax treaty between Mauritius and the Republic of Congo, the applicable WHT rate is 5%.
There is no specific rate defined in the CEMAC tax treaty.
### Attendance fees
Attendance fees are subject to a 17% WHT.
## Payments to local independent contractors
Payments to local independent contractors (self-employed contractors, i.e. those not registered with the Congolese Trade Registry) are subject to a WHT at the rate of 10% from such payments, to be remitted to the Public Treasury.
Late remittance of the WHT is subject to a late payment penalty of 50% within the first two months and 100% if the late payment exceeds two months.
The application of the 10% WHT also applies to companies regrouping professionals and increases penalties in case of non-payment (200% penalty).
Revenues of legal entities subject to CIT are excluded from the application of the WHT of 10%.
## WHT rates summary
| Recipient | WHT (%) | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dividends | Interest | Royalties |
| Resident corporations | 15 | 0 | 0 |
| Resident individuals | 15 | 0 | 0 |
| Non-resident corporations and individuals (Non-treaty) | 15 | 20 | 20 |
| Treaty with: |  |  |  |
| China | 5/10 | 10 | 5 |
| France | 15 | 0 | 15 |
| Italy | 15 | 0 | 10 |
| Mauritius | 5 | 5 | 0 |
| CEMAC | 15 | 10 | 0 |

# Congo, Republic of
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
Taxable income is based on financial statements prepared according to standard statements of the OHADA treaty.
Business expenses are generally deductible, unless specifically excluded by law.
## Inventory valuation
Stocks are valued at cost price. However, if the market price is lower than the cost price, the undertaking shall make provisions for depreciation of inventory.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are treated as ordinary business income and are taxed at the standard CIT rate of 28%. However, a capital gain realised on the disposal of a fixed asset in the course of trading is excluded from income for a period of three years if the taxpayer reinvests the gain in new fixed assets for the business.
If the business is totally or partially transferred or discontinued, only half of the net capital gain is taxed if the event occurs less than five years after the start-up or purchase of the business and only one-third of the gain is taxed if the event occurs five years or more after the business is started or purchased. However, the total gain is taxed if the business is not carried on in any form.
Capital gains realised by non-residents on transfers of shares of Congolese companies are subject to taxation at the rate of 20%. This tax shall be paid upon registration of the deed of transfer of the considered shares. Under such sale transactions, the seller, the buyer, and the company whose shares are transferred are jointly and severally liable for the levied tax.
Net capital gains realised as part of a direct or indirect transfer of social assets and/or rights resulting in a change of control of a Congolese company become subject to CIT.
Capital gains realised on the sale of rights and obligations arising from oil contracts are subject to a flat tax of 10%.
## Dividend income
Dividends are treated as ordinary business income and are taxed at the standard CIT rate (after 15% WHT tax).
### Inter-company dividends
Dividends received from a Congolese company (DivCo) by a commercial company incorporated in the Republic of Congo (HoldCo) are exempt from CIT and subject to a final 15% WHT if the following conditions are met:
However, 10% of dividends that are deemed to represent the share of cost and expenses are included in the taxable profits of HoldCo and liable for the CIT.
If the above conditions are not met, dividends received from a Congolese company by another Congolese company are subject to a 15% WHT.
## Interest income
Interest received constitutes taxable income subject to CIT at the rate of 28%.
Subject to any specific provisions, interest paid or deemed to be paid is subject to a WHT at the rate of 20% of the interest paid.
The interest paid is deductible for CIT purposes for the Congolese company to the limit of 20% of the taxable profit before deduction of the expenses in question. For interest paid to non-CEMAC residents, the deduction is subject to the respect of CEMAC foreign exchange provisions.
## Royalty income
Royalties received constitute taxable income subject to CIT at the rate of 28%.
Subject to any specific provisions, royalties paid or deemed to be paid are subject to a WHT at the rate of 20% of the royalties paid.
The royalties paid are deductible for CIT purposes for the Congolese company to the limit of 20% of the taxable profit before deduction of the expenses in question.
The average WHT rate of 10% is applicable to remuneration for one-off services paid to companies not domiciled or not resident in the Republic of Congo. This reduced rate is applicable to remuneration paid for the use of concession, the publishing of television channels, television and radio programme offers, or the provision of access to audio-visual services with digital content.
## Foreign income
Resident companies are taxed only on income (except for dividends received abroad) derived from their activities carried out in the Republic of Congo.

A company is considered resident in the Republic of Congo if it has its registered office or principal office for all its activities in the Republic of Congo.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The 2020 Finance Act has introduced a definition to the notion of PE, to mean: an economic activity shall be deemed to be carried on in the Congo when such activity is habitually exercised either through a PE or through representatives without independent professional personality or when such activity results in operations that form a complete commercial cycle.

# Congo, Republic of
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
## Depreciation and depletion
In general, all types of fixed assets, except land, are depreciable for tax purposes as long as they can be shown to have been acquired for business purposes of the corporation. Depreciation must be calculated on the original purchase price. The straight-line method is used, and the Congolese General Tax Code sets forth maximum rates of depreciation. Goods costing less than XAF 500,000 per item may be written-off at purchase as expenses.
Depreciation recorded when the company is in a loss position may be carried forward without limitation and deducted from the first available taxable profits, provided it was appropriately disclosed in the annual CIT return.
Recoverable and identifiable packaging is regarded as a fixed asset and is recorded in a fixed asset account at the time of purchase. This packaging is regarded as returnable packaging when the supplier intends to act as the sole owner of the packaging.
Unrecoverable packaging is recorded as an expense and is deductible for tax purposes.
Exceptional accelerated depreciation may be authorised in certain circumstances for heavy equipment with a value of more than XAF 40 million. This special accelerated depreciation does not apply to private vehicles owned by the enterprises.
The following list contains maximum rates of depreciation as set forth in the General Tax Code:
| Assets | Rates per year (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Construction | 5 to 20 |
| Fixed devices and equipment | 5 to 25 |
| Movable equipment | 10 to 100 |
| Transport materials | 5 to 33.33 |
| Furniture, fittings, and other equipment | 10 to 33.33 |
| Fishing equipment | 10 to 20 |
| Hotels, bars, and restaurants | 10 to 50 |
| Plastic equipment (moulding) | 10 to 33.33 |
| Equipment subject to chemical action | 20 |
### Exceptional depreciation method
The exceptional depreciation method is an accelerated depreciation method.
Companies may elect the accelerated depreciation method for heavy materials and equipment that:
The application for the accelerated depreciation method must be submitted to the head office of taxes within three months of the purchase of the assets to be depreciated. The option is granted upon approval of the Ministry of Finances. If the administration fails to respond to the application for accelerated depreciation within three months, the application is tacitly granted.
Under the exceptional depreciation method, a 40% deduction may be taken in the year of acquisition of the previously mentioned assets, increased by the normal rate calculated on the residual value after application of the accelerated depreciation. These assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis thereafter.
## Goodwill
There is no specific provision relating to amortisation of goodwill in the Republic of Congo.
## Start-up expenses
There is no specific provision in the Congolese General Tax Code on the deduction of start-up expenses. Start-up expenses that occurred in the first year of incorporation (N) are deductible in the second year of operation (N+1).
According to the OHADA Uniform Act relating to Accounting Systems and Accountancy, start-up expenses can be amortised either in one year (in such a case, they are booked in the deductible expenses during the first fiscal year) or in two years (50% during the first fiscal year and 50% during the second fiscal year).
## Interest expenses
Interest is deductible, subject to the following conditions:
## Charitable contributions
Total tax exemptions are granted for donations made to the state within the framework of the COVID-19 Solidarity Fund aimed to fight against COVID-19.
## Fines and penalties
Penalties relating to violation of regulations are not deductible.
## Taxes
Taxes, other than income taxes, are usually deductible. Examples of deductible taxes include customs duties, excise duties, payroll taxes, business tax and accessory taxes, registration taxes, and unrecoverable VAT.
CIT itself is not deductible, nor is the special tax on company-owned cars.
Taxes withheld on remuneration, paid to third parties (third parties taxes), and remitted to the tax office by a Congolese enterprise are not deductible.
## Net operating losses
For tax purposes, losses may be carried forward to offset profits earned in the three succeeding fiscal years. Carryback losses are not permissible.
As mentioned above, depreciation recorded when the company is in a loss position may be carried forward without limitation.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Allowable deductions include sums paid abroad to foreign companies for:
Subject to the provisions of tax treaties (France, Italy, Mauritius, and CEMAC), the deduction is allowed within a limit of 20% of taxable profits before deduction of the expenses in question. For specific activities, such as, namely, public works business, the limitation of deductibility is capped at 2% of turnover.
Deduction made to non-CEMAC residents for interest paid on interest is subject to respecting the provisions of the CEMAC foreign exchange control regulations.
Any payments made from a foreign bank currency account within or outside the CEMAC would be deductible if prior authorisation was obtained.
In the event of losses, the rate is applied on the results of the last profit period that is not statutory limited. In the absence of profits during the period out of statutory limitation, the sums paid are not allowed as tax deductions.
When the sums are not allowed, as a whole or in part, in the deductible expenses, they are deemed to be paid benefits and are subject to tax on the dividends at the rate of 15%.
Royalties for the transfer or concession of patents, trademarks, drawings, and other similar titles are deductible to the extent the payer proves they are still valid. When these royalties benefit an enterprise contributing in the management or share capital of an enterprise in the Republic of Congo, they are deemed to be paid benefits and are subject to tax on the dividends at the rate of 15%.
Commission or brokerages relating to goods purchased on behalf of enterprises based in the Republic of Congo are allowable tax deductions at up to 5% of the purchase amount made by the central purchasing office, the head office, or the intermediaries. The reductions shall benefit enterprises based in the Republic of Congo. An original supplier's invoice must be attached to the intermediary's invoice.
The payer shall prove that:
In the event of an audit, amounts invoiced by foreign companies that do not respect the arm's-length principle are added back to the taxable basis for the Congolese company.

# Congo, Republic of
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
There is specific group taxation within the CEMAC area.
Where a joint stock company and a private limited company own either registered stock in a joint stock company or shares in a private limited company, the net proceeds of the share in the second company paid to the first during the financial year shall be deducted from the total net profit of the latter, less a percentage for costs and charges. This percentage is fixed at 10% of the total amount of the proceeds. This system shall apply when all of the following conditions are met:
Another group taxation regime is also available upon option and under certain conditions, wherein the taxable profits of the group’s companies can be consolidated at the level of the holding company, which will pay the tax due.
## Transfer pricing
Companies registered in the Republic of Congo with gross annual turnover net of taxes equal to or exceeding XAF 500 million must keep transfer pricing documentation at the reach of the tax administration so as to justify the transfer pricing policy used in all transactions with legally related entities outside the Republic of Congo.
Targeted companies are required to spontaneously and annually provide to the tax administration a transfer pricing documentation, a light transfer pricing declaration, and a country-by-country (CbC) report within six months from filing their summary financial statements. Companies that fail to comply with this requirement will be fined at XAF 5 million prior to an eight-day formal notice.
The sums invoiced by a foreign company that are considered as not reflecting arm’s-length conditions must be reintegrated in the Congolese company’s financial year’s result, for a third of their amount.
To justify transfer pricing policy, companies shall ensure that the prices of the transactions are in conformity with the five different methods to set up the arm's-length principle (derived from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] recommendations).
During a tax audit, if the amounts invoiced by a foreign company do not reflect the arm's-length principle, these amounts would be completely added back to the tax base of the Congolese company.
The conclusion of advance transfer pricing agreements with the tax authorities is subject to the payment of XAF 10 million.
## Thin capitalisation
There are no specific thin capitalisation rules in the Republic of Congo.
## Holding companies
A taxation regime applies to incorporated holding companies complying with certain conditions.
Within this regime, capital gains on shares are:
In addition, these companies benefit from other tax advantages, such as a WHT exemption on certain types of interest as well as a reduced WHT on dividends paid (i.e. 50% of applicable rate).
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There is no provision under Congolese tax law related to CFCs.

# Congo, Republic of
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
The current investment regime in the Republic of Congo was set out by Law No. 6-2003 of 18 January 2003, which established the investment charter. The charter's application, Decree No. 2004-30 of 18 February 2004, established modes of business registration.
The goods eligible for the customs incentives from the investment charter are those that have a direct link with the fiscal year of the approved activity.
Any company admitted to one of the authorised derogatory regimes (i.e. the production sharing contract regime or the establishment agreement regime) may no longer, as of 1 January 2021, benefit from another privileged regime.
## Privileged regimes
The charter sets out three privileged regimes:
### General regime (G)
The general regime applies to businesses that fulfil the aforementioned general requirements and carry out investments greater than or equal to XAF 100 million.
Special advantages are conferred according to the period of activity of the registered business.
During the set-up period and the first three exploitation tax years, the company receives several benefits, as follows:
For the three first exploitation tax years and from the first year of sale or first service, the following fiscal benefits are added with the aforementioned reduction of registration duties:
### Special regime (S)
The special regime applies to businesses that fulfil the aforementioned general requirements and carry out investments between XAF 30 million and XAF 100 million.
In addition to the advantages of the aforementioned (G) regime, businesses registered under the (S) regime benefit during the set-up period and the first three exploitation tax years from the moderation of registration duties for the incorporation of the business, increases in capital, company mergers, and transfer of company stocks and shares.
This moderation of registration duties is granted exclusively by decree of the Minister in charge of the Economy and Finances upon a decision of the National Investment Commission.
### Preferential development zone regime
All exporting businesses registered under the investment charter are eligible for the preferential development zone system, including free-trade zones.
The institution, organisation, and function of the preferential development zone are fixed by a specific text.
## Incentives to set up in remote areas
All new businesses registered under (G) or (S) regimes that are located in a remote area benefit from a reduction of 50% on the tax on company earnings in the fourth and fifth year following the first three tax years for which the business benefited from total exemption from the tax on earnings or PIT.
The business is considered as belonging to a remote area from the moment its production units are set-up and 90% of the production unit workforce is working in the remote location.
The appraisal of a zone's location results from the exclusive competency of the National Investment Commission.
## Incentives for social and cultural investment
All new businesses registered under (G) or (S) regimes carrying out investments of a social and cultural character may benefit from a fiscal reduction by ministerial decree of the Minister in charge of Finance and the Economy, upon the decision of the National Investment Commission.
These benefits may not, however, be added to those mentioned above and allocated to remote areas, even if the business concerned is set-up in such a location.
## General measures
For the duration of the privileged regime, and subject to current texts, the company shall enjoy fiscal stability in terms of local and state taxes.
Privileged regimes (G) and (S) are allocated only once and are not renewable. The business may receive fiscal and customs advantages pertaining to the set-up period.
Fiscal advantages concerning the exploitation period are applicable only after the set-up period.
The end of the set-up period is certified by decision of the Minister in charge of Finance and the Economy after the adoption of the verification report by the National Investment Commission.
Respect of the aforementioned general requirements set out by the charter is a prerequisite for benefiting from these motivation measures.
## Export incentives
A measure is reserved for businesses that export at least 20% of their production.
The benefits are as follows:
Non-manufactured goods remain subject to the common law export system.
## Incentive to reinvest earnings
A measure is reserved for businesses that carry out new investments of at least one-third of existing assets.
The benefit conferred consists of a 50% reduction of the tax on company earnings for the three years following the realisation of the investment.
Notwithstanding, this benefit is granted upon the following conditions:
## Institution of preferential tax regime for special economic and industrial zones and health free zones
The 2014 Finance Act provides for incentives in special economic zones as follows:
The 2014 Finance Act provides for incentives in industrial zones as follows:
The 2014 Finance Act provides for incentives in health free zones, as follows:
It should be noted that eligibility requirements for the preferential regimes described above have not been set yet.
## Foreign tax credit
There are no specific rules relating to foreign tax credits in the Republic of Congo.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
## Employment expenses
The following items are deductible in computing taxable income from employment:
## Personal deductions
### Alimony
Alimony payments are allowed as deductions from taxable income.
### Interest expenses
Interest on loans contracted for the construction and purchase of real estate where the owner reserves the possession for one’s self (principal residence of the taxpayer) is deductible. The deduction is limited to the six first annual repayments, up to XAF 1 million *per annum*.
### Annuities
Mandatory and free annuities in arrears are deductible from taxable income.
### Healthcare expenses
Medical fees incurred by the taxpayer and dependants are deductible, with the exception of medical care expenses, prostheses, hospitalisation, and pharmaceutical expenses, at up to 10% of net income and up to XAF 200,000 maximum.
## Income splitting system
Tax relief is given to families by means of the income splitting or unit system rather than by personal deductions or allowances. Under this system, the total taxable income of the family group is divided into a number of units, and the tax applicable to a single unit is multiplied by the total number of units to give the total amount of tax payable.
An unmarried person is counted for one unit, a married couple is counted as two units, and each dependent child is a half unit. A supplementary half is given for the third and each subsequent child, up to 6.5 units.
Since tax rates are progressive, a family normally suffers less tax under the income splitting system than if tax were charged at the rate applicable to its total income. This is because the more units into which the family's total income divides, the lower the percentage rate applicable to each unit will be.
Children cease to be considered dependent when they reach the age of 21. However, they may elect to be treated as dependant up to the age of 25 if full time students. If a taxpayer is a widow or widower with one or more dependent children, the number of units is calculated as if the other spouse were still alive.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
Total taxable income, for the purposes of PIT, is the aggregate of net income (i.e. profits arising from an occupation or business, non-commercial activities, agriculture, securities, real estate, and from capital gains) reduced by various deductions.
## Basis of assessment
PIT is assessed on family groups. Thus, a father's return must normally include any income earned by his wife and dependent children, although a father may elect for the children's income to be taxed separately if this is advantageous. A wife may be taxed separately if she is separated from her husband or if divorce proceedings have begun.
## Employment income
In addition to wages and salaries, employment income includes cost-of-living, housing, education, other allowances, and benefits in kind.
## Business income
In general, business profits for individuals are computed as those for companies.
Non-commercial income comprises income from professional activities and income not falling within any of the other categories.
## Dividend income
Dividends from Congolese resident companies are included in taxable income. However, at the time the dividends are paid, tax is withheld at the rate of 15% by the resident company.
## Interest income
Interest from most sources is taxable and is included in taxable income.
Interest from Congolese resident companies is included in taxable income. However, at the time the interests are paid, tax is withheld at the rate of 20% by the resident company.
## Rents from real estate
Rents received, less related expenses, must be included in taxable income. Expenses allowed include interest for maintenance, construction, repair, and improvements, plus a notional deduction to cover management, insurance, and depreciation of 30% of gross rents.
A tax equal to one-twelfth of the rents due within the year (or in proportion of the rents due till the end of the year for new lease agreements) is deducted by the tenant on behalf of the owner.
