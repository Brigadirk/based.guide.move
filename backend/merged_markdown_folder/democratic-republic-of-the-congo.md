## Overview
Last reviewed - 15 October 2024
The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), located in Central Africa, is bordered by nine countries, including the Central African Republic and Southern Republic of Sudan to the north; Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and Tanzania to the east; Zambia and Angola to the south; and the Republic of Congo and Atlantic Ocean to the west. The Democratic Republic of the Congo attained independence in 1960 and was known as Zaïre prior to 1997. It is the second largest country in Africa and is divided into 26 provinces, with Kinshasa as its capital. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is a presidential democratic republic, and the official language is French. The currency is the Congolese franc (CDF).
Ever increasing activity in the mining sector, the source of most export income, has boosted the DRC's fiscal receipts and gross domestic product (GDP) growth.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 15 October 2024
Taxable income consists of profits from any industrial, commercial, agricultural, or real estate operations entered into by a taxpayer in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as any increases in the net assets as a result of such activities and any increases derived from capital gains, either realised or not, of any nature and origin.
## Inventory valuation
Since adhesion of the Democratic Republic of the Congo into the Organisation for the Harmonisation of Business Law in Africa (OHADA) law treaty effective from 12 September 2012, or as from 1 January 2015 as far as accounting matters are involved, the inventory valuation methods permitted are as follows:
## Capital gains
There is no specific tax regime applicable to capital gains in DRC Tax Law.
Capital gains are included in the corporate taxable basis of the local entity benefitting from the capital gain and, as such, subject to the 30% CIT.
However, new rules have been enacted by the updated Mining Code as regards capital gain realised by non-resident entities when selling shares. Indeed, capital gain recognised at the level of the legal entity that sold shares and is deemed to be of Congolese origin to the extent that the assets of the legal person whose shares were sold are located in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The tax is deducted at source by the assignee legal person who pays it according to the terms of payment of taxes due to the Treasury.
## Dividend income
Local-sourced dividends received by a local company are subject to a 20% income tax rate under standard law. Of the gross dividends received by resident companies, 90% are excluded from the CIT base, provided that such dividends have been subject to the 20% WHT.
## Interest income
Local-sourced interest received by local companies is subject to the standard CIT regime.
## Royalty income
The DRC Tax Law defines royalties as any kind of remuneration paid for the use, or for the concession, of a copyright on art works, scientific works, film works, brands, charts, any design or formula, or any secret process or recipe, as well as for the use of industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment and for intellectual property (IP) in any industrial, commercial, or scientific field.
The net amount of royalties is subject to WHT at the rate of 20%.
The tax base of royalties is calculated by deducting 30% from the royalties invoiced (i.e. the taxable basis will be 70% of the royalties invoiced).
## Foreign income
If an income is considered as foreign-sourced, by application of the territoriality principle, it is not taxable in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

# Congo, Democratic Republic of the
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 15 October 2024
The following DRC-sourced payments are subject to a WHT in the Democratic Republic of the Congo:
## WHT rate and payments
The standard rate of WHT on dividends, royalties, interest, and directorship fees is 20%, which is based on the gross amount of sums paid.
If the payee does not withhold the tax from the amount invoiced and pays the tax of 20% directly, then the tax authorities consider that the basis of the 20% tax is composed of the amount invoiced plus the amount of the tax.
Consequently, in the case that the DRC company takes in charge the corresponding WHT, the WHT rate will be 25% (20/80) and the amount of tax will not be tax-deductible.
For royalties, the WHT is charged on the net amount of the royalties paid. The tax authorities consider that the net amount of royalties is calculated by deducting 30% from the royalties invoiced (i.e. the taxable basis will be 70% of the royalties invoiced).
The rate of WHT on amounts paid as compensation for services provided by foreign individuals/entities is 14%, which is based on the gross amount of sums paid.
The tax treaties for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on incomes between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Africa, and between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Belgium, have been effectively implemented.
These treaties provide for reduced rates for dividends, interest, and royalties. It is also generally agreed that, by application of treaty, services furnished by providers being tax resident of those countries and being not established in the Democratic Republic of the Congo should not be subject to the 14% services fees WHT.
The table below provides a summary of different WHT rates:
| Recipient | WHT (%) | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dividends (1) | Interest | Royalties | Services |
| Resident | 10/20 | N/A | 20 | N/A |
| Non-resident (not established) | 10/20 | 0/20 (3) | 20 | 14 |
| Treaty: | | | | |
| Belgium | 10/15 | 0/10 (5) | 10 | N/A |
| South Africa | 5/15 (2) | 0/10 | 10 | 0/14 (4) |
Notes
1. A reduced 10% WHT rate for dividends is applied in the mining sector.
2. The WHT charged shall not exceed 5% of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) that directly holds at least 25% of the capital of the company paying the dividends; 15% of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.
3. Interest paid by mining companies for loans borrowed in foreign currency abroad are exempt from WHT.
4. The term ‘permanent establishment’ likewise encompasses: the furnishing of services, including consultancy services, by an enterprise through employees or other personnel engaged by an enterprise for such purpose, but only where activities of that nature continue (for the same or a connected project) within the contracting state for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any 12-month period commencing or ending in the fiscal year concerned.
5. As for the Treaty with Belgium, it is provided that interests shall be exempted from tax in the state of origin in the case of interests on commercial receivables, as well as interest on receivables or loans not represented by bearer securities.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 15 October 2024
## Personal income tax rates
The personal income tax (IPR) is calculated according to the following annual progressive tax table:
| Bracket number | Taxable bracket (CDF) | | Gap (CDF) | Rates (%) | Tax due as per bracket (CDF) | Cumulative tax (CDF) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| From | To |
| 1 | 0 | 1,944,000 | 1,944,000 | 3 | 58,320.00 | 58,320.00 |
| 2 | 1,944,001 | 21,600,000 | 19,655,999 | 15 | 2,948,399.85 | 3,006,719.85 |
| 3 | 21,600,001 | 43,200,000 | 21,599,999 | 30 | 6,479,999.70 | 9,486,716.55 |
| 4 | 43,200,001 | And more |  | 40 | - | - |
IPR cannot exceed 30% of the taxable salary.
The indemnities and allowances paid to an employee in relation with the termination of one’s contract of employment are taxed to IPR at the specific rate of 10%.
Moreover, the sums paid to casual employees (employees hired on a day-to-day basis) are subject to IPR, but at a preferential rate of 15%.
Incomes other than salaries are not subject, in practice, to IPR.
Moreover, foreign-sourced profits are not taxable in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
## Exceptional tax on expatriates’ salaries (IERE)
Where a company hires expatriates, it has to pay an exceptional tax called *Impôt Exceptionnel sur la Rémunération des Expatriés* (IERE).
We draw your attention to the fact that this tax is not withheld at source on the expatriates’ salaries, but taken in charge by the employer.
This tax is not deductible from a corporate tax point of view (except for mining companies as well as their subcontractors).
The IERE is calculated on the IPR basis.
The substantive tax rate is 25%.
However, 12.5% applies for mining companies during the first ten years of their activities. Afterwards, mining companies will apply the common rate. The IERE for mining companies is still deductible for CIT purposes.
The IERE is payable according to the same modalities as IPR.

Last reviewed - 15 October 2024
## Tax returns
IPR is withheld at source by the employer via the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system only.
There is neither obligation nor possibility for employees to file an individual tax return and to pay IPR directly.
In May 2015, a single tax return was instituted for declaration and payment of taxes, social contributions, and employer contributions on salaries. In practise, the single tax return entered into force on 31 August 2015.
Natural persons remunerated by a third party under public or private law, without being bound by a company contract, will each have to submit, by 30 March at the latest, an annual recapitulative return of the personal income tax relating to the remuneration paid by their employer during the previous year. Note that the implementation modalities and the appropriate form will have to be communicated by regulation.
## Payment of tax
IPR is paid monthly by the employer by the 15th day of the month following the month of payment of the salary.

# Congo, Democratic Republic of the
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 15 October 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
### VAT rates
The VAT base includes whatever sums, amounts, goods, or services that are received as compensation for an operation; this involves subsidies as well as any other costs, taxes, rights, or any related levies, whatever their nature, excluding the VAT itself. For imports, VAT is normally charged on the customs value of the goods concerned, plus the customs duty and import-related expenses. There are three rates:
### VAT exemptions
The main exempted activities include some banking and financial services, education, medical services, charitable and social activities, and transactions that are subject to a specific taxation.
The import of wheat flour, corn, and corn flour; the local sale of bread, wheat flour, corn, and corn flour; the domestic sales of animals; and the import and sale of inputs for agriculture are also VAT-exempt.
### Application to non-residents
A non-resident having no PE in the Democratic Republic of the Congo but who raises an invoice on a DRC resident is required to appoint a VAT representative who is based in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and who will be accountable for the payments and collections that rest with the non-resident supplier. Failing to appoint a representative will result in the authorities holding the DRC resident customer liable for the payment of VAT that is due by application of a reverse-charge mechanism.
### Mechanisms of VAT
An entrepreneur is entitled to offset VAT paid on purchase of goods and services used for business purposes against VAT charged on sales of goods and/or services. Businesses exempted from VAT on part of their sales are, in principle, entitled to deduct VAT paid on a *pro rata* basis (i.e. the ratio between the turnover related to VATable activities and the global turnover).
No VAT credit is allowed for expenditures not necessary for business purposes, nor on some specific expenditure (e.g. except in some specific circumstances, fuel, accommodation or entertainment for directors and employees, gifts, company cars).
VAT returns must be filed by the 15th day of each month in respect of transactions made the previous month. The net amount of VAT payable must be remitted to the tax authorities together with the return. If VAT paid exceeds VAT charged, the resulting VAT credit can be carried forward.
Refund of VAT can only be requested in some very specific circumstances.
## Customs duties
### Customs duty on imports
Customs duty on imports is calculated on the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) value of the goods. The customs tariff on imports is the following:
| Example of goods | Customs tariff rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Chemical products | 5 |
| Machine tools |
| Material for transport of merchandise |
| Flour | 10 |
| Aggregate |
| Petrol, diesel, kerosene |
| Clothing | 20 |
| Furniture |
| Cigarettes |
Imported goods are also subject to the following levies at the time of border crossing:
Customs regulation also allows for certain suspensive rates, such as temporary admission.
### Customs duty on exports
Customs duty on exports applies to certain categories of products produced locally, which are:
The bond value on exports of the said goods is fixed either by ministerial decree upon suggestion of the customs administration, or in the absence of a decree, by reference to the value of the goods when they leave the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The rates of customs duties on exports are the following:
| Example of goods | Customs duty rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Coffee | 1.0 |
| Electrical energy |
| Diamond (small-scale mining) | 1.5 |
| Gold (small-scale mining) |
| Diamond (industrial mining) | 3.0 |
| Gold (industrial mining) |
| Minerals (copper, nickel, lead, etc.) | 5.0 |
| Timber | 6.0 |
| Silver | 10.0 |
| Platinum |
## Consumption and excise duties
### Scope
The following goods are affected by consumption and excise duties:
### Applicability and tax base
Consumption and excise duty is applicable to:
Consumption and excise duties accrue on imports, as do customs duties and VAT.
On imports, the tax base on consumption and excise duties is the raised CIF value of the customs duties, except for mineral oils, for which the tax base is the average fiscal threshold price.
### Rates
The rates of consumption and excise duties vary from 5% to 80%.
## Para-fiscal taxes
Various para-fiscal taxes shall be collected at the time of the import and/or export of goods in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The main applicable levies include the following:
## Property tax (IF)
### Scope
IF is applicable to constructions (i.e. villas, apartments, and other buildings) and land located in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The person subject to this tax is the owner (bearer of title deed, holding, long leasehold, mining) of the construction on 1 January of the tax year.
The following types of property are exempt from IF:
Some constructions and land are, notwithstanding, exempt from IF, notably depending on the status of their owner. From this perspective, the following are exempt from the property tax on goods:
### Tax base
The tax rates vary according to the nature of the goods (villas, buildings of more than one floor, flats, and other buildings) and locality ranks.
For villas, rates are fixed per square metre of area (between USD 0.3 and USD 1.5), while for other taxable items the contribution is determined on an inclusive basis (by floor, by flat, by unused land - in Kinshasa, the rate for one floor is USD 75).
## Transfer tax
The transfer of a building in the Democratic Republic of the Congo gives rise to the payment, by the purchaser, of a registration duty amounting to 3% of the building's value for a normal sale.
## Stamp taxes
There are no stamp taxes in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
## Payroll taxes
The tax on wages is withheld at source by the employer.
### Professional salaries tax (Impôt professionnel sur les remunerations or IPR)
Any remuneration paid by a third party, whether public or private, provided it is not part of a service contract, and remuneration paid to executive shareholders, other than those involved in joint stock companies, are subject to payroll taxes and social contributions.
These remunerations includes salaries, wages, fees, benefits that do not represent reimbursement of professional expenses, gratuities, bonuses, and all other payments, fixed or variable, whatever their qualification.
All benefits, except for housing, transport, family allowances, and medical expenses, to the extent that they are legal or reasonable, are added to remunerations.
The IPR is computed by applying a progressive tax scale. The overall tax shall not exceed, in any case, 30% of the taxable income.
It should be noted that there are other applicable rates depending on the activity or the nature of the compensations paid as remuneration:
A rebate of 2% applies on the tax amount in terms of the number of the dependants.
### Exceptional salaries tax (Impôt exceptionnel sur les rémunérations or IER)
Employers of expatriate employees are subject to a tax of 25% on the expatriates’ remuneration (10% for mining companies). This amount is not deductible for corporate tax purposes, except for mining companies. This tax was established to discourage employers from hiring expatriate staff. Expatriate staff are comprised of employees from countries other than those bordering the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Filing and payment obligations for IER are identical as for IPR. Employers are required to file a return for payroll taxes on the 15th day of the month following the payment of the salaries. An annual payroll tax return also needs to be submitted on the 15th day of the year following the year of the payment of the salaries.
Failure or default or delay in paying due taxes gives rise to:
## Social and employment contributions
Social and employment contributions are as follows:
The deadline to file and pay INSS, INPP, and ONEM return is the 15th day of the month following the month where the salary has been paid. In this regard, a single return is filed.
## Business tax on pension capital
The Finance Act 2016 has introduced a business tax of 10% based on pension capital. This tax applies to companies that implement a supplementary pension scheme in favour of employees of a certain category. The tax is triggered by the actual payment of the pension to the retired person and not at the time of their constitution (administrative position).

## Taxable period
The taxable period is 1 January to 31 December. This duration can be less than 12 months for the first accounting period beginning in the course of the first half of the calendar year. The same duration can also be more than 12 months for the first accounting period beginning in the course of the second half of the calendar year.
## Tax returns
The yearly CIT return is due by 30 April of the following year.
## Payment of tax
Final payment of CIT is required when submitting the yearly tax return, which is due by 30 April of the following year.
CIT is payable in local currency through a DRC bank account by a wire transfer to the bank account of the Public Treasury. Consequently, in order to operate in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the opening of a bank account in a DRC bank is mandatory. Moreover, the tax authorities require the bank account number of the applicant in order to grant a taxpayer number.
The collection of CIT is performed on an instalment basis. Collection by way of prepayment has been abrogated.
### Instalments of corporate tax
Instalments, in respect of CIT, apply to taxpayers who come under the supervision of two specific kinds of tax departments: the Directorate General (DGE), the department of the tax authorities in charge of the most important taxpayers, and the *Centre des Impôts* (CDI), tax centres.
As of 1 January 2024, these taxpayers have to pay three instalments as follows:
Prior to 1 January 2024, these taxpayers had to pay four instalments each representing 20% of the CIT paid during the previous fiscal year (including the amounts assessed by the tax authorities). The instalments must have been paid as follows:
This, therefore, totals 80% of the CIT actually paid in the previous year. The payments are offset against the final CIT due for the fiscal year. The balance is paid when the tax return is submitted.
Small-sized companies shall make an advance payment amounting to 60% no later than on 31 January of the year following the one of the realisation of the concerned income. The balance payment is henceforth to be made no later than on 30 April. As a reminder, the rate of the CIT applicable to small-sized companies is:
Micro-sized companies shall pay an annual lump-sum tax amounting to CDF 50,000, no later than on 30 April of the year following the one of the realisation of the income.
## Tax audit process
In practice, there is a tax audit every year.
Also, it happens that a taxpayer is subject to several controls (punctual, general, counter-verification).
## Statute of limitations
A company may get audited up to four years after submission of a tax return.
There is no general statutory system of advance rulings.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 15 October 2024
Corporate income tax (CIT) is paid on profits realised by a company or an individual that carries out any operational activity in the country.
The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) levies taxes on resident companies and individuals on a territorial basis (or source basis) of taxation. Foreign-sourced profits (e.g. dividends received from a foreign subsidiary) are thus exempt from CIT.
Non-resident companies or individuals that carry out an activity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are taxable on profits they realise through permanent establishments (PEs) or fixed establishments that are located in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The CIT rate is 30% (including mining companies).
## Minimum income tax
There is a minimum tax of 1% of the yearly turnover for companies other than micro-sized and small-sized companies (*see below for the rates for micro-sized and small-sized companies*).
The minimum tax applies to loss-making companies as well as companies with CIT of less than 1% of turnover. Companies that carry on business but realise no turnover in a concerned year are also subject to the minimum income tax as follows:
Note that turnover includes, *inter alia*, all profits and interest received, as well as exceptional profits, in essence, any credits on the income statement that have the nature of income or gain, as well as capital gain.
## Micro-sized and small-sized companies
Micro-sized companies are those whose annual turnover is less than CDF 10 million, and small-sized companies are those whose annual turnover is between CDF 10 million and CDF 80 million.
Micro-sized companies are subject to an annual lump-sum tax amounting to CDF 50,000.
Small-sized companies are subject to CIT at the following rates:
## Termination of activity without deregistration
In the event of business termination, companies pay a lump-sum amount as follows:
## Tax on rental income
Rental income related to buildings, houses, offices, premises, warehouses, etc. is administered at the level of every provincial tax authority. Gross rental income is subject to tax at a flat rate of 12% in the province of Kinshasa.
In order to secure the payment of this tax, the Tax Code has put into practice a withholding tax (WHT) system. In the province of Kinshasa, the tenant is liable to withhold 10% of the rentals paid and to remit this tax to the authority. The tax authority may challenge rentals that are not at arm's length by referring to the rental prices of similar houses.
The rent of buildings and land owned by real estate companies is subject to CIT.
## Local income taxes
There are no local or provincial government direct taxes on income (except for the tax on rental income that is administered at the level of provinces).

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 15 October 2024
To arrive at taxable income, a taxpayer may deduct all costs actually incurred and which have served in the production of income of the company during the year.
## Depreciation
Depreciation of fixed assets used in the company’s operations may be deducted. Depreciation rates are as follows:
| Nature of the good | Depreciation rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Buildings | 2 to 5 (depending on the materials used) |
| Machinery and equipment | 10 |
| Vehicles | 20 to 25 (depending on its use) |
| Fixtures, facilities | 10 |
| Item's nature | Useful lives adopted (years) |
| --- | --- |
| Building - general purpose or heavy equipment | 20 to 25 |
| Building - specific purpose | 8 |
| Computer equipment | 3 to 5 |
| Software | 3 to 5 |
| Motor vehicles | 4 or 5 |
| Furniture and fittings | 8 or 10 |
| Office equipment | 10 |
As per the OHADA accounting law, however, assets should be depreciated as per the practice of the specific industry so as to depreciate each category of asset over the related normal expected useful life.
## Goodwill
There is no specific provision relating to depreciation of goodwill in DRC Tax Law.
However, it is generally agreed that taxpayers can amortise goodwill in accordance with the linear system. The amortisation of goodwill rate is at the discretion of the taxpayer, but with the risk that the tax authorities can assess the rate otherwise.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses are deductible, provided they are staggered over three or four years.
## Interest expenses
Interest costs on funds borrowed from third parties and invested in the company’s operations are, in principle, deductible. Further to the tax authorities, the deduction, in principle, requires an effective payment.
Please note that if the borrower is a private limited company and the lender is one of its shareholders, the interests on loans paid are not deductible from the CIT basis.
Moreover, assuming the terms of the loan are at arm’s length, the interest expense will be tax deductible in the Democratic Republic of the Congo provided that (i) the interest rate applied is less than the average international interbank market rate in the month the payment of the principal is made and (ii) the repayment of the principal takes place within five years from when it has been made available.
## Bad debt
As a general rule, any kind of provisions (e.g. for bad debts) may not be deducted to arrive at taxable income.
However, provisions constituted by credit institutions in respect of doubtful debts can be deducted from CIT under certain conditions
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions or donations are not deductible.
## Fines and penalties
Legal or administrative fines of any nature are not deductible.
## Taxes
Income taxes are not deductible.
## Other significant items
The following are examples of other expenses that may be deducted to arrive at taxable income:
The following are examples of other expenses that may not be deducted to arrive at taxable income:
## Net operating losses
The Finance Act for 2016 significantly amended the rules applicable to the offsetting and carryover of business losses. Henceforth, the new wording of Article 42-1° of the legislative-order n° 69/009, dated 10 February 1969, pertaining to the scheduled income taxes:
There is no carryback loss regime in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
As a general rule, payments to foreign affiliates should be at arm’s length and transfer pricing documentation must be provided.
In respect of payments made by a local company to a foreign company for services (e.g. management services, technical assistance services), such expenses are deductible, provided that:
Under the notion of abnormal acts of management, in addition to expenses, any form of benefits or aid granted to third parties without equivalent consideration for the company will be taxable, such as:
Benefits or aids granted to companies within the same group may be deemed as normal acts of management, provided that the company shows the existence of its own interest in granting such benefits or aids. The sole general interest of the group is not sufficient to justify such practices.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 15 October 2024
There is no group taxation regime per the DRC tax legislation.
## Transfer pricing
The following specific transfer pricing requirements are provided by the Tax Code:
Finance Law 2015 imposes an obligation for companies established in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to have transfer pricing documentation on operating transactions with their affiliated companies located abroad. However, Finance Law 2015 only provides general guidelines for the information to be provided (i.e. structure of the group, selection of the most appropriate transfer pricing method).
Companies established in the Democratic Republic of the Congo that are dependent, in law or in fact, on companies or groups of companies established outside the Democratic Republic of the Congo and whose annual turnover, excluding tax, is equal to or exceeds USD 1 million shall submit either a paper or an electronic declaration containing a simplified documentation on the transfer pricing in accordance with the tax administration's template. Such declaration has to be made within two months from the deadline to file the CIT return.
Furthermore, the Finance Law for FY 2020 has introduced the possibility of concluding an advance pricing agreement (APA) with the tax administration on the method of determining intra-group prices for a maximum duration of four years.
## Thin capitalisation
There are no thin capitalisation rules in the DRC tax legislation. However, it is provided in the Mining Code, from a general perspective, that, for the holder of a mining licence, the ratio of the funds borrowed against the amount of own funds should not exceed 75/25.
Moreover, the OHADA Treaty provides that shareholders’ equity should be above half of the company’s authorised share capital.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
No specific provision relating to CFCs are provided for in DRC law.

## Investment Code
The Investments Code allows for a certain number of tax, customs, and general order measures designed to favour direct investments (notably a CIT holiday during a defined investment period that would differ depending on the location of the investments). The preferential tax treatment measures of the Investments Code apply to direct investments and/or to entities that carry them out.
The regime of the Investments Code does not apply to numerous sectors, notably:
In order to take advantage of the provisions of the Investments Code, the following conditions must be fulfilled by the investor:
The application file is examined by the National Agency for the Promotion of Investments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (ANAPI) and then sent to the Minister of Finance, who decides on the grant of the advantages foreseen in the Investments Code to the applicant, by the way of a Ministerial Order.
## Mining
The Mining Code, completed by the Mining Regulations, sets out a preferential customs and fiscal regime that deviates on some important points from the standard regime.
The tax rules set up by the Mining Code are supposed to be exhaustive, exclusive (it provides for all the taxes and customs duties owed to the Treasury by eligible entities, to the exclusion of any other form of taxation), and stable. This regime applies to all holders of a mining title or career, or for which a mining title or career is established, as well as to (i) affiliated companies carrying out mining activities and (ii) sub-contractors carrying out mining activities resulting exclusively from contracts concluded with the bearer of the mining title.
Among other tax preferential features of the Mining Code, the following apply:
The holder of a mining licence is also liable to mining royalties, computed on the basis of the amount of sales minus the cost of transport, analysis in relation to the quality control of the commercial product for sale, insurance, and cost relating to the sale transaction.
## Hydrocarbons
The tax regime of oil companies is mainly provided in the production-sharing contracts as well as in the Ordinance-Law 081-013 of 2 April 1981 bearing general regulations regarding Mining and Hydrocarbon.
The tax regime of oil companies is defined by the Law 15/012, dated 1 August 2015, pertaining to the general regime of Hydrocarbon.
## Foreign tax credit
No specific provision relating to foreign tax credits is provided for in DRC law.
The tax treaties for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on incomes between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Africa, and between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Belgium, have been effectively implemented.

Incomes other than salaries are not subject, in practise, to IPR.
Moreover, foreign-sourced profits are not taxable in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
## Employment income
The different taxable elements of remuneration are:
According to the tax doctrine, the indemnities paid in relation to professional expenses (e.g. entertainment allowance, assignment allowance) are exempt from IPR, provided they:
As the position of the tax authorities is very strict on these conditions, it appears that it is quite difficult to allow to the employees a ‘professional’ indemnity, which is mainly due to the fact that the employee must prove that a certain amount of expenses is linked to the payment of that indemnity.
Expatriate employees, like local ones, are liable for IPR on the total amount of salary received in connection with their activity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Please note that the minimum salary to be paid to an expatriate employee (and which will be considered as the basis of IPR) is the legal minimum salary payable in one’s country of origin.

The tax authorities shall examine whether the foreigner:
If these elements proved to be ascertained by the tax authorities, the individual shall be considered as resident in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since their entry in the country and therefore subject to IPR in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on their income since this date.
