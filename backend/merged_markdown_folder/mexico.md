## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Taxable period
The Mexican tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December. For non-residents who pay income tax on Mexican-source compensation income, the tax year is the 12-month period that starts with the first month the non-resident is subject to tax.
## Tax returns
All residents receiving income during the calendar year are required to file an annual tax return no later than 30 April of the succeeding year, except in certain cases. When an individual earns Mexican bank interest only, and it is less than MXN 206,368 per year, no tax return filing is required. Residents receiving only compensation income will be required to file an annual income tax return only if total compensation for the year exceeds MXN 400,000, and certain other conditions are met.
Although joint returns are not allowed, miscellaneous rules allow a married couple to have the highest income earner report all investment income. Since income splitting is not allowed, personal service income should be declared by the spouse earning it.
Under the current rules, most taxpayers must file the annual tax return electronically and will need to have previously registered an advanced electronic signature, which will be used in the return filing process.
### Information disclosures
Under certain circumstances, individuals are required to report six non-taxable items on their annual tax returns, for informational purposes only. These items include loan proceeds, prizes, gifts, inheritances, proceeds from the sale of a personal residence, and travel expense reimbursements. Although disclosed on the return, these items remain non-taxable. If these items are not disclosed, there is a risk to lose their tax-exempt treatment.
In addition to the obligation to file an annual tax return, individuals are also required to file an annual tax haven investment information report by 28 February (*see Tax haven investments in the [Income determination](mexico/individual/income-determination.html)* *section for more information*).
## Payment of tax
The balance due is payable upon filing the return. The full tax on salary income and certain interest and dividend income is withheld at source. However, in the case of salaries received by resident individuals from non-resident employers (and non-resident employees subject to the non-resident tax on salaries), Mexican law requires the filing of personal monthly provisional tax returns to pay an amount equal to the tax withholding applicable to these wages. The monthly returns are generally due by the 17th day of the following month and are filed electronically.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Resident individuals are subject to Mexican income tax on their worldwide income, regardless of their nationality. Non-residents, including Mexican citizens who can prove residence for tax purposes in a foreign country, are taxed only on their Mexican-source income.
## Personal income tax rates
The following tax rates are effective for resident individuals for calendar year 2025:
| Taxable income (MXN) | | Basic tax | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| From | To | Tax on column 1 (MXN) | Tax on excess (%) |
| 0.01 | 8,952.49 | 0 | 1.92 |
| 8,952.50 | 75,984.55 | 171.88 | 6.40 |
| 75,984.56 | 133,536.07 | 4,461.94 | 10.88 |
| 133,536.08 | 155,229.80 | 10,723.55 | 16.00 |
| 155,229.81 | 185,852.57 | 14,194.54 | 17.92 |
| 185,852.58 | 374,837.88 | 19,682.13 | 21.36 |
| 374,837.89 | 590,795.99 | 60,049.40 | 23.52 |
| 590,796.00 | 1,127,926.84 | 110,842.74 | 30.00 |
| 1,127,926.85 | 1,503,902.46 | 271,981.99 | 32.00 |
| 1,503,902.47 | 4,511,707.37 | 392,294.17 | 34.00 |
| 4,511,707.38 | and above | 1,414,947.85 | 35.00 |
If the employee is considered a non-resident for Mexican tax purposes, the tax rate applicable to compensation will vary from 15% to 30%. The first MXN 125,900 of employment income received in a 12-month floating period will be tax exempt.
The following tax table is applicable to income tax with respect to income earned by non-residents for the calendar year 2025:
| Taxable income (MXN) | | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 125,900 | Exempt |
| 125,900 | 1,000,000 | 15 |
| 1,000,000 | and above | 30 |
Non-residents are subject to withholding taxes (WHTs) on Mexican-source interest income at rates varying from 0% to 35%, depending on several factors. Non-residents are subject to Mexican tax on gains arising from sales of real property located in Mexico (including shares of foreign companies holding a significant amount of Mexican real property) as well as the sale of shares of Mexican companies. Generally, when a capital gain is subject to tax, the non-resident investor can elect to pay either a flat rate of 25% of the gross proceeds or 35% of the net gain. Sales of shares in the Mexican stock exchange are subject to a flat 10% tax withholding on the profit from said transaction.
Other types of Mexican-source income (including rents and royalties) are also subject to WHTs when paid to a non-resident. In the case of dividends and other corporate distributions from Mexican companies, since 2014, there is a 10% tax withholding on the dividends from corporate profits generated after 2013.

Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Social security contributions
Employee contributions to the Mexican Social Security Institute are withheld at source. The employer also makes contributions. Both contributions are calculated at varying rates and subject to various limits based on multiples of the UMA.
The maximum annual contribution for employees is MXN 28,057. The employer’s maximum annual contribution is MXN 207,892 (considering a low-risk company). The employer limit could be higher, considering that the employer's portion includes the occupational risk premium, which varies depending on the activity of the employer. These maximum contributions apply to employees earning more than MXN 1'031,689 per year (or MXN 85,974 per month).
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
In the case of the northern border region, a tax credit of 50% on the VAT rate may apply, resulting in a rate of 8% instead of 16%.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Mexico.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There is no specific inheritance, estate, or gift tax in Mexico. Inheritances and gifts are treated as income under the income tax law but may be tax exempt as described below.
Income received by a Mexican resident through inheritance is exempt from income tax.
Income received as a result of a gift from a spouse, lineal ancestors, or lineal descendants is also exempt. However, gifts between siblings are not exempt, and gifts to parents are not exempt if the asset is later given or sold to a sibling of the original owner.
Other gifts are tax exempt, provided the gift does not exceed three times the annual UMA (MXN 123,821). Any portion of the gift exceeding this amount would be subject to income tax.
## Property taxes
Annual taxes on real property are levied by Mexico City and all the states at widely varying rates applied to values shown in the property tax records.
## Payroll taxes
Most Mexican states levy a relatively low rate of tax on salaries (but not on income in general), which in most cases is payable by the employer. For example, Mexico City imposes a 4% payroll tax, but it is payable by the employer and constitutes a tax deductible expense for the employer.

# Mexico
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
## Taxable period
In general terms, the taxable period in Mexico is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Corporate taxpayers are required to file annual CIT returns for the preceding calendar year by 31 March of the following year.
Thereafter, taxpayers meeting certain size criteria or belonging to a group that, as a whole, meets these criteria must submit a tax-compliance informative return along with the preceding calendar year annual CIT return (i.e. 31 March of the following year).
In lieu of submitting the tax-compliance informative return, business taxpayers meeting certain size criteria may either elect or be required to file a tax-compliance audit report on an annual basis with the Mexican Audit Administration. This audit report covers all federal taxes other than customs duties and consists of audited financial statements and detailed schedules, together with a report by the auditor stating that no irregularities were observed in respect of the taxpayer's compliance with its federal tax liabilities. This report must be filled electronically, and the auditor must be an independent certified public accountant (CPA) registered with the Mexican Audit Administration. The amount of detailed information required to be filed, and the auditor's responsibility in connection therewith, is significant.
Employees’ profit-sharing payments are generally due by 31 May of the year following that in which the corresponding profit was obtained.
Information returns must also be filed not later than 15 February each year, reporting on, amongst others, the following activities performed in the immediately preceding year:
Taxpayers making salary payments are also required to file information returns reporting salaries paid and salary credit paid in the immediately preceding calendar year.
An annual information return must be filed on investments made or held in a tax haven. This must be filed in February of the immediately following year.
An information return on transactions carried out with non-resident-related parties must be filed together with the annual CIT return (no later than March of the following year).
Taxpayers allowed to elect to file the tax report will not be obligated to file the information return stating their tax status.
## Payment of tax
Corporate taxpayers are required to make estimated payments of CIT by the 17th day of each month based on their estimated taxable income at the end of the previous month and calculated principally by applying the profit factor to the cumulative monthly gross income. The profit factor is determined by dividing the taxable profit by gross income shown in the annual return for the preceding year, or, if no profit factor is to be found in that annual return, the factor appearing in the year preceding that and so on, up to five years, with certain adjustments. For this purpose, gross income includes nominal income, excluding inflationary adjustments. The balance of CIT for the year is due at the same time as the annual return.
Special procedures are provided for computing advance CIT payments and for obtaining authorisation to reduce the amounts of monthly advances after the sixth month of the year. No advance payments or adjustments thereto are required in the first year of operations.
### Elimination of universal netting of favourable tax balances with other federal taxes or against WHTs
Until 2018, the Mexican Federal Fiscal Code provided a mechanism that allowed taxpayers to compensate favourable balances and balances due from all Federal taxes in both monthly and annual returns (‘universal compensation’). A common and important cash-flow management tool in Mexico was to compensate, for example, VAT-favourable balances against income tax or other Federal taxes due rather than constantly requesting tax refunds.
‘Universal compensation’ allowed Mexican entities to manage operating cash flow (i.e. VAT or favourable excise tax balances) through netting with income tax liabilities. The uncertain timing and formalistic nature of the Mexican tax refund process made universal compensation an important tool for Mexican businesses.
The 2019 Federal Income Budget eliminated universal compensation in a manner that would only permit taxpayers to compensate balances of the same tax nature and would exclude the possibility of compensating against WHT liabilities due by third parties that should be remitted by the Mexican resident to the tax authorities (i.e. non-Mexican residents for Mexican-sourced tax). For example, if a taxpayer has a VAT-favourable balance for the month, but also has estimated income tax payments due or a withholding income tax payment due, the taxpayer would now need to pay the income taxes and request a VAT refund on a monthly basis or credit such VAT against future VAT liabilities.
Through Administrative Rules published by the Mexican tax authorities, they enable the possibility for those taxpayers who have amounts in their favour as of 31 December 2018 to offset such amounts against those who are obligated to pay for their own debt, provided that they derive it from federal taxes different from those caused by importation, administer the same authority, and have no specific destination.
## Tax audit process
For taxpayers that file a tax-compliance audit report, the tax audit (tax inspection) may start with a review of the audit report prepared by the independent CPA. Tax authorities may request several documents from the taxpayer and third parties that carried out transactions with the audited taxpayer.
Tax audits should be concluded within the following 12 months after the audit was initiated. The period to conclude tax audits for taxpayers that are either part of the financial system or consolidated for tax purposes is 18 months. In cases where the Mexican tax authorities request information to tax authorities from foreign jurisdictions, the period to conclude the audit is two years. The above periods might be suspended under certain circumstances (e.g. a judicial recourse or appeal initiated by the taxpayer against the tax authorities). Upon conclusion of the audit, the tax authorities should issue either a notification explaining tax underpayments observed during the audit process or a notification of conclusion if no issues remain open at the end of the inspection.
Finally, tax authorities should issue a notification of assessment within the six months after the conclusion of the tax audit. At this point, all underpayments claimed by the tax authorities become due.
### Tax benefit vs. economic benefit
Per the 2020 Tax Reform, a new provision was introduced to the Mexican Federal Tax Code providing that legal acts lacking a business purpose and that result in a direct or indirect tax benefit can be recharacterised.
The new rule will allow the tax authority to presume that there is not a valid business purpose when the expected, quantifiable economic benefit is less than the tax benefit. The tax authority can presume that a series of legal acts lack business purpose when the same economic benefit could have been obtained through a simpler set of transactions, but the tax cost would have been higher.
The reasonably expected economic benefit includes generation of revenue, cost reduction, increase in the value of assets, and better market positioning. The tax authority, as part of an open audit, can presume that the legal acts lack business purposes based on facts and circumstances known as a result of the tax controversy process. A tax benefit includes any reduction, elimination, or deferral of a tax.
## Concluding Agreements
The Prodecon is a decentralised Mexican government organisation that acts as the Ombudsman of Mexican taxpayers, providing advice and issuing recommendations to the tax authorities. In recent years, Prodecon’s Concluding Agreements have become more common and have had a positive impact for taxpayers when it comes to reconciling differences with the tax authority in regards to an audit and controversial assessments.
## Statute of limitations
In general, the right of the tax authorities to collect taxes, review tax returns, or claim additional tax expires five years after the date the respective return is filed. However, in cases where the taxpayer has not secured a federal tax registration number, has no accounting records, has failed to keep accounting records for the required five-year period, or has not filed a tax return, the statute of limitations expires in ten years. Similarly, the period for claiming a refund of overpaid tax expires after five years.
## Effective tax rates
During 2021, the Mexican tax authorities published five batches of effective tax rate references applicable to hundreds of economic activities pertaining to 21 economic sectors during the fiscal years 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 based on the available information contained in the federal tax registry and several databases maintained by the Mexican tax authorities.
Such references were published by the Mexican tax authorities in order to incentivise and facilitate taxpayers' tax obligations by comparing their (taxpayers') effective tax rate against those put forward by the Mexican tax authorities, assigning a level of risk that varies depending on the differences.
Depending on the level of risk, the Mexican tax authorities may initiate a new 'deep review process' (not an audit) to assess the origin of the differences.
## Electronic invoice
As of 1 January 2022, pertaining to the transportation of goods and merchandise, taxpayers must generate a specific electronic tax invoice to display the transit of the merchandise, the origin, intermediate, and destination points, as well as the means of transportation, either through land, air, sea, or river, and the pertinent information in connection with the transportation of hydrocarbons and oil products.

Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is payable at the general rate of 16% on sales of goods and services, as well as on lease payments and imports of goods and services. The principal VAT-exempt transactions are the sale of land, credit instruments (including equity shares), residential construction, interest paid by banks, medical services, education, salaries and wages, rentals of residential property, and the sale of non-amortisable participation certificates on real estate investment trusts (REITs), provided specific requirements are satisfied.
Temporary imports under IMMEX and similar programs are subject to the general 16% VAT rate. Such imports may qualify for VAT relief when obtaining special certification from the tax authorities related to the adequate control of such imports. The relief is applied in the form of an immediate VAT credit when clearing customs, which means that the temporary import is done on a cashless basis for VAT. Companies not covered by the certification may apply the same cashless treatment if they post a bond as payment guarantee.
The VAT law also taxes sales in Mexico of temporarily imported goods by non-residents to (i) other non-residents, (ii) *Maquiladoras*, or (iii) companies in the automotive industry.
VAT paid by business enterprises on their purchases and expenses related to VATable activities (including activities subject to the 0% VAT rate) may usually be credited against their liability for VAT they collect from customers on their own sales, services rendered, etc. The input VAT credit on goods or services of a general nature, or those not specially identified with either taxable, not subject to the tax, or exempt activities for VAT purposes, is computed based on a VAT ratio proportional to the VATable versus VAT activities (taxable, not taxed, and exempt) carried out by the taxpayer. Creditable VAT paid on purchases and expenses in excess of VAT collected from customers is recoverable via either a refund or a credit against subsequent VAT liabilities.
VAT is a ‘cash basis’ tax, with few exceptions (e.g. VAT on some types of interest must be paid on an accrued basis); consequently, only the receipt of payment for goods or services triggers the output VAT liability, and an input VAT credit may be claimed only when the taxpayer pays VAT to its providers of goods and services. VAT is calculated for each calendar month as a final tax. In addition, VAT overpayments may be used to offset the tax liabilities arising from other federal taxes.
VAT must generally be withheld by Mexican residents acquiring or leasing tangible goods from non-residents if such foreign residents do not have a PE in the country to which income is attributed. Mexican business entities are required to withhold VAT on payments to individuals or entities for services consisting of ground transportation of goods. Mexican corporations must also withhold VAT on commissions paid to individuals, as well as on independent services rendered by Mexican individuals, and on tangible goods leased from individuals.
An information return related to the VATable activities carried out by the taxpayer must be filed on a monthly basis. Definitive monthly VAT payments are required by the 17th day of the immediately following month.
### Subcontracting
VAT paid for subcontracted labour will be creditable to the extent the service is considered a specialised service for purposes of the outsourcing reform (*please refer to Outsourcing reform in the [Other issues](mexico/corporate/other-issues.html) section*). The requirement for the payer to withhold 6% of the consideration and remit it to the Mexican tax authorities has been repealed as of 1 August 2021.
### Pre-operating expenses
Under current VAT law, a VAT credit is granted in the pre-operating period (i.e. the period prior to the start of the taxable activities) based on an estimate of expected future activities subject to VAT. However, there is no adjustment mechanism if the actual activities subject to VAT differ from the estimated activities.
The provision provides that VAT credits from expenses and certain investments in the pre-operating period can be used on the first VAT return for the month in which the company actually carries out activities subject to VAT, or in the month in which the company incurs the expense or makes the disbursement (in which case it can request a refund), provided that, in the latter case, the taxpayer provides information related to the VATable activities to be performed. In both cases, there will be a mandatory adjustment to the VAT credited once a 12-month period has elapsed from the date on which the credit was applied.
In addition, if the taxpayer does not perform taxable activities once the pre-operating period has ended, a reimbursement of any refund should be remitted to the tax authorities. This rule will not apply to taxpayers engaged in extraction activities, such as mining and oil.
### Digital services
Based on the 2020 Tax Reform, as of June 2020, foreign residents, regardless of whether they have a PE, that are providers of digital services to recipients located in Mexico must register with the Mexican tax authorities to calculate and collect the VAT associated with those digital services from the Mexican users and remit it on a monthly basis to the Mexican tax authorities. A digital service is defined as any service provided through digital applications or format, over the Internet or other network, and which is fundamentally automated. It specifically includes the following:
The recipient will be considered a 'Mexican user' in any of the following circumstances: (i) a Mexican has registered with the service provider, (ii) the payment was made through a Mexican financial intermediary, (iii) the IP address used by the electronic device is in Mexico, or (iv) when the recipient provides a Mexican telephone number.
In this regard, as of June 2020, such foreign residents must comply with certain specific requirements including, as earlier mentioned, obtaining a Mexican tax ID, registering a Mexican legal representative and a tax address, obtaining an electronic tax signature, and issuing invoices that meet the Mexican requirements to be established by the Mexican tax authorities, among others.
Non-residents providing digital services subject to VAT that do not comply with certain tax obligations will have their access to the Internet in Mexico temporarily blocked. The Internet blockage would be carried out by regulated telecommunication networks pursuant to a government request. Prior to disabling the non-resident's Internet access, the tax authorities would consider all of the case’s facts and circumstances and follow certain procedural requirements intended to ensure the affected entity has the proper information to comply with tax obligations. The process must be documented through specific administrative steps and written notifications. Once the tax authorities proceed with blocking Internet access, the block can continue until the non-compliance is cured.
Failure to comply with the following tax obligations, among others, can result in Internet blockage:
## Customs duties/import tariffs
Mexico’s commercial conditions provide an excellent business and investment opportunity. Mexico is a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Mechanism (APEC), and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
Mexico lies in a strategic geographical location for international trade, sharing borders with the United States (US) and representing an easy entry to the rest of Latin America, while also facing Europe and Asia.
Mexico has signed multiple Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), which provide for preferential duty rates on foreign trade operations with many more countries. FTAs signed by Mexico include the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in force as of 1 July 2020, and agreements with the European Union (EU), the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), and Japan, among many other countries. Most FTAs provide 0% duty rates for almost 90% of the goods to be imported into Mexico.
General Import Duty rates range from 0% to 35%, but most imports fall within the range of 3% to 20% (exceptionally, certain food products, shoes, and textiles pay higher duties).
In general, temporary imports are exempt from customs duties (except for fixed assets in certain transactions). *For VAT payments on temporary imports, see above*.
## Excise tax
The excise tax law (*Impuesto Especial Sobre Producción y Servicios* or IEPS) levies substantial federal excise rates on the importation and/or sale of certain taxable items, such as gasoline (% variable), beer (26.5%), wine (26.5% to 53%), spirits (53%), and cigarettes and other tobacco products (160% plus an additional quota), and on certain services related to these activities, such as commission, mediation, and distribution of excise taxable items, as well as services for raffles and gambling (30%). Excise tax is also applicable to certain telecommunications services (3%).
The excise tax law applies to soft drinks at 1 Mexican peso (MXN) per litre and to ‘junk’ food at an 8% rate. In both cases, the excise tax is payable by the producer or importer.
In general terms, goods are exempt from IEPS when exported. The input IEPS paid by exporters on their purchases is not creditable, and that tax becomes an additional cost.
IEPS is payable (output tax) and creditable (input tax) on a cash basis. It is payable on the date that the charge invoiced is collected from the client and can be credited when the respective payment is made to the supplier. On imports, IEPS is creditable when paid at the customs offices.
Per the 2020 Tax Reform, input IEPS resulting from the activities of one month will be creditable only with the output IEPS of the following months and for the alienation of the same goods. In certain cases, the IEPS legislation allows taxpayers that are not subject to this tax to credit IEPS paid on the acquisition and/or the importation of certain goods.
There is a specific procedure to calculate the tax for beer producers, bottlers, and importers; however, the tax can never be lower than 26.5%.
Among other obligations, IEPS taxpayers must file information returns before the Mexican Tax Administration periodically.
The 2020 Tax Reform also provided an update of the concept of energizing brewages as it defined as those that mix caffeine and taurine, glucuronolactone, thiamine, or other substance producing similar effects, independently of the amounts of the compounds involved (focus is on the mix regardless of the weight of the elements).
## Property taxes
Annual taxes on real property are levied by Mexico City and all the states at widely varying rates applied to values shown in the property tax records. Assessed values have increased substantially recently in Mexico City and some other areas.
## Title transfer taxes
The transfer of real estate is, almost without exception, subject to a variable transfer tax at rates averaging 2% to 5% on the highest of the value of the transaction, fair market value, or registered municipality value. The tax is levied by most states and Mexico City.
## Stamp taxes
There are no stamp taxes in Mexico.
## Payroll taxes
Most Mexican states levy a relatively low tax on salaries and other income earned by employees, which is payable by the employer (e.g. Mexico City imposes a 3% payroll tax payable by the employer).
## Social security contributions
Employers and employees are required to make contributions to the social security system. These contributions are based on the daily salary plus any other compensation paid to the employee. There are various different rates that the employers are compelled to pay to the Mexican Social Security Ministry and or Housing Ministry that may vary in proportion of the so-called base salary of their Mexican employees and the type of concepts for which the compensation is given to the employee. For example, 2% on the base salary of the employee is paid by the employer for the concept of retirement, 5% on the employee base housing contribution salary for the concept of housing must be paid by the employer, among others.
## Compulsory profit sharing
Although not a tax, every business unit with employees (irrespective of the type of organisation) is required to distribute a portion of its annual profits among all employees, except general directors and managers. The amount distributable to the employees is 10% of an adjusted taxable income. The main difference between the taxable income and the profit-sharing base is that the tax losses cannot be applied against the profit-sharing base. As of 2021 (*please refer to Outsourcing reform in the [Other issues](mexico/corporate/other-issues.html) section*), the profit distribution to each employee will be capped to the highest of either (i) three months of its regular salary or (ii) the average of profit sharing received by the employee in the past three fiscal years (i.e. should the profit allocated to an employee be below these thresholds, the employer will only pay the corresponding regular distribution based on 10%).
No profit sharing is paid during the first year of operations. Also, special rules apply for personal service entities and for entities deriving their income from rental activities, both of which can limit their profit-sharing payment to the equivalent of one month of regular salary.
The profit-sharing amount paid out is a deductible item for CIT purposes, provided certain requirements are met.
## Vehicle taxes
There is no federal tax on the ownership of vehicles; however, the states may impose a similar tax.
Tax is still levied on the acquisition of new vehicles. This tax is payable in addition to the VAT on the purchase. Note that some vehicles considered as ‘hybrid’ (e.g. battery assisted vehicles) are not subject to the new vehicle acquisition tax.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
## Federal corporate income tax (CIT)
CIT applies to Mexican resident taxpayers’ income from worldwide sources, as well as to foreign residents from income derived from Mexican-source wealth and on the income attributed to their permanent establishments (PEs) located in Mexico.
The federal CIT rate is 30%.
All corporate entities, including associations of a civil nature, branches, etc., are subject to the tax rules applicable to Mexican corporations (unless specifically ruled out, such as not-for-profit organisations).
Corporate taxpayers engaged exclusively in agriculture, livestock, fishing, and forestry activities are subject to a reduction of 30% of their tax liability.
Provisions to recognise the effects of inflation for tax purposes in the areas of monetary assets and liabilities (annual monetary adjustment) and depreciable assets are provided in the Mexican Income Tax Law, even though recent inflation rates have been stable at low levels.
Once a corporation has paid its CIT, after-tax earnings (i.e. earnings arising from the after-tax earnings account, *Cuenta de Utilidad Fiscal Neta* or CUFIN) may be distributed to the shareholders with no tax charge at the corporate level. A withholding tax (WHT) on dividend payments to individuals or foreign residents (including foreign corporations) applies at the rate of 10%; this WHT does not apply to distributions of profits subject to corporate-level tax prior to 2014. If a corporation makes a distribution out of earnings that for any reason have not been subject to CIT, such as distributions of book earnings (i.e. not yet recognised for tax purposes in Mexico), the corporation will also be subject to CIT on the grossed-up distributed earnings (gross-up factor is 1.4286).
Tax paid on dividends distributed in excess of CUFIN can be credited against the CIT of the year or in the two fiscal years following the year in which the tax on the non-CUFIN distributions was paid. The CUFIN of the tax years in which the credit is applied must be reduced by an amount equal to the grossed-up dividend distribution.
## Local income tax
There are no state taxes on corporate net income.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Social security contributions
Employee contributions to the Mexican Social Security Institute are withheld at source. The employer also makes contributions. Both contributions are calculated at varying rates and subject to various limits based on multiples of the UMA.
The maximum annual contribution for employees is MXN 28,057. The employer’s maximum annual contribution is MXN 207,892 (considering a low-risk company). The employer limit could be higher, considering that the employer's portion includes the occupational risk premium, which varies depending on the activity of the employer. These maximum contributions apply to employees earning more than MXN 1'031,689 per year (or MXN 85,974 per month).
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
In the case of the northern border region, a tax credit of 50% on the VAT rate may apply, resulting in a rate of 8% instead of 16%.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Mexico.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There is no specific inheritance, estate, or gift tax in Mexico. Inheritances and gifts are treated as income under the income tax law but may be tax exempt as described below.
Income received by a Mexican resident through inheritance is exempt from income tax.
Income received as a result of a gift from a spouse, lineal ancestors, or lineal descendants is also exempt. However, gifts between siblings are not exempt, and gifts to parents are not exempt if the asset is later given or sold to a sibling of the original owner.
Other gifts are tax exempt, provided the gift does not exceed three times the annual UMA (MXN 123,821). Any portion of the gift exceeding this amount would be subject to income tax.
## Property taxes
Annual taxes on real property are levied by Mexico City and all the states at widely varying rates applied to values shown in the property tax records.
## Payroll taxes
Most Mexican states levy a relatively low rate of tax on salaries (but not on income in general), which in most cases is payable by the employer. For example, Mexico City imposes a 4% payroll tax, but it is payable by the employer and constitutes a tax deductible expense for the employer.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
## Recognition of income
Income is generally recognised on an accrual basis. However, the service revenues of civil entities that render professional services (e.g. law and accounting firms) and low-income entities (as defined in the Mexican Income Tax Law) are reported on a cash basis.
## Inventory valuation
The costing system to be used will be the incurred cost system, based on historic costs or pre-determined costs. If the requirements provided in the regulations of the Mexican Income Tax Law are met, the direct cost system (based on historical costs) may be used.
Inventory may be determined by any of the following methods:
The FIFO method must be applied to each type of merchandise and each movement. Taxpayers selling goods that are identifiable by serial numbers, at a cost exceeding MXN 50,000, must determine their inventory by the identifiable cost method.
Once elected, a method is compulsory for five years and can be changed only if the requirements established in the regulations of the Mexican Income Tax Law are fulfilled. The monetary results of the change in method are amortised over the following five years.
For accounting purposes, different methods and certain variations can be adopted. However, a record of the differences must be maintained, and such difference will not be taxable or deductible.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are taxed as follows.
### Securities
Gains on securities are included in regular taxable income.
The tax basis of shares of Mexican corporations sold may be adjusted by the inflation applicable for the holding period.
When computing the tax basis of the shares, there are certain items to be considered, such as: (i) the movement in the after-tax earnings account (CUFIN) of the issuing company (including the possible negative CUFIN effects), as adjusted for inflation, (ii) the unamortised prior years' tax losses at the date of the sale, (iii) tax losses arising prior to the date on which the shares were acquired and amortised during the holding period, and (iv) any capital reductions of the issuing company.
When the sum of: (i) the CUFIN balance at the date of acquisition of the shares, (ii) the capital reductions paid, (iii) the unamortised prior years’ tax losses at the date of the sale, and (iv) the negative CUFIN balance of the issuing corporation is higher than the sum of: (i) the CUFIN balance at the date of the sale and (ii) the tax losses arising prior to the date on which the shares were acquired, and amortised during the shares’ holding period, the difference must be subtracted from the tax basis of the shares to be disposed of (potentially resulting in the shares’ tax basis being equal to zero).
When the aforementioned difference exceeds the tax basis of the shares disposed of, this excess (restated by inflation) must be subtracted from the tax basis of the shares in any subsequent share sale by the same taxpayer, even if the shares are issued by a different company.
The aforementioned procedure allows the average cost (tax basis) of the shares to be determined, which is then updated and considered as the acquisition cost for future sales.
A different but simpler procedure is available (optionally) for computing the tax basis of shares held during a period of 12 months or less.
Deduction of capital losses arising from the sale of shares is limited to the value of gains from similar transactions in the same or the following ten fiscal years. Losses may not be deducted by non-residents selling shares.
A gain from the sale of shares performed by non-Mexican residents is considered Mexican-source income when the transferred shares are issued by a Mexican resident or when more than 50% of their book value arises directly or indirectly from immovable property located in Mexico, including cases where the shareholding is structured in different levels.
This net income election is available only if the foreign shareholder income is not deemed to be subject to a regime considered as a ‘preferred tax regime jurisdiction’ (i.e. tax haven, which is deemed to exist when the non-Mexican resident income is not subject to taxation or taxed at an effective taxation lower than 75% of the tax that would be paid in Mexico) or resides in a country with a territorial tax system. The non-resident seller must have previously appointed a representative in Mexico and have a public accountant assigned to issue a statutory tax audit report on the transfer of shares. The public accountant issuing the respective report must specify the accounting value of the shares sold and explain the factors used in determining the sales price and the market value of the shares if shares are sold between related parties.
The representative is jointly liable for the tax on the sale of shares, even when the statutory report is issued by a public accountant.
The tax authorities may authorise the deferral of taxes that would otherwise be triggered by the transfer of shares in a group reorganisation to the extent it is a share-for-share type of deal (the authorisation must be obtained prior to the share transfer). The price used on the transaction must be at arm’s length. The tax deferred, adjusted for inflation, is due upon the sale of the originally transferred shares outside the same interest group. An interest group consists of shareholders that have over 50% common voting stock of the companies.
In principle, authorisations for tax deferral are not granted if the party acquiring or selling the shares is resident in a tax haven or is a resident of a country that has not signed a comprehensive exchange of information agreement with Mexico. However, in the latter case, an authorisation may still be granted if the taxpayer provides documentation to the Mexican tax authorities stating that the taxpayer has authorised the foreign tax authorities to provide information to the Mexican authorities regarding the operation in question.
If the share sale qualifies as an exempt reorganisation under tax treaty rules, the non-resident must appoint a legal representative in Mexico prior to the sale and file a notice with the Mexican Tax Administration informing them of such appointment and the details of the reorganisation process intended to be carried out. Additionally, certain formal requirements are established in the regulations of the Mexican Income Tax Law that must be satisfied when carrying out this type of transaction.
Tax treaty rules (optionally) override domestic law rules when the seller resides in a tax treaty country.
### Shares sold through the stock market
Capital gains realised on (i) the sale of shares issued by Mexican companies, (ii) securities exclusively representing such shares, (iii) shares issued by foreign companies quoted in the Mexican stock market, and (iv) derivative financial operations referenced to stock indexes and/or to the aforementioned shares, when the sale is conducted in stock markets or in derivative markets recognised under the Securities Market Law, are subject to a 10% income tax rate.
The applicable income tax on the gain obtained must be withheld by the broker/intermediary; however, there is no obligation to make this withholding if the investor is a resident in a country with which Mexico has signed a tax treaty to avoid double taxation and provides the broker with a sworn statement explaining said situation and providing their registration number or tax ID issued by the proper authorities in their country. If this is not provided, the income tax must be withheld.
When a non-Mexican resident sells shares that do not satisfy the above requirements to be taxed at a 10% income tax rate, they must pay their tax by applying either 25% of the sale price or 35% of the net gain, complying with the requirements established for these purposes in the domestic law.
### Real estate
In determining the taxable gain of real estate, the cost basis of land and buildings may be adjusted (i.e. increased) for tax purposes on the basis of the period of time for which the assets have been held. This adjustment is performed by applying inflation adjustment factors to the net undepreciated balance. Similar rules apply to non-residents electing to pay tax on net income by appointing a legal representative in Mexico. The rate of tax on the net gain is 35% (or lower treaty rate). Otherwise, the 25% final WHT on gross income applies to non-residents.
### Machinery and equipment (M&E)
Gains or losses from the disposal of machinery, equipment, and other fixed assets are also calculated after adjusting the basis in these assets, by applying inflation factors to the net undepreciated balance.
## Inflationary gain or loss
Taxpayers are required to calculate an adjustment for inflation (resulting in additional taxable income or deductible expense) on an annual basis by applying the percentage increases in the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) to the value of essentially all liabilities, reduced by monetary assets, including bank balances, investments (except in shares), and some debt and receivables.
For purposes of the inflationary adjustment, the amount of non-deductible interest derived from the interest deductibility limitations is excluded from the determination of the annual average of debts. However, if the amount of non-deductible interest is deducted in a subsequent period (up to ten years), the corresponding debts must be considered in the determination of the annual average.
## Dividend income
Dividends received by Mexican corporations from other Mexican corporations need not be included in gross income. Dividend income must be included within the recipient corporation’s CUFIN.
No further corporate-level taxes apply on dividends distributed out of the CUFIN. However, non-CUFIN distributions (i.e. distributions that for any reason have not been subject to CIT) are subject to tax at the level of the distributing company at the general income tax rate on the grossed-up distribution at the effective rate of 42.86%. This tax is creditable in the year of payment or two subsequent years.
## Interest income
Interest received by Mexican corporations is generally subject to tax on an accrual basis and included in gross income (*see also Inflationary gain or loss above*).
## Royalty income
Royalties received by Mexican taxpayers are taxable income at the general corporate rate (i.e. 30%). Such revenue shall be accrued for tax purposes at the earliest of the due date for the royalty payment collection, the actual collection (either fully or partially), or the issuance of the corresponding invoice.
## Governmental assistance
When the government grants economic or financial assistance to taxpayers through governmental budgetary programs, the cash received will not be treated as taxable revenue to the extent that (i) there is a public list of beneficiaries, (ii) the funds are wire-transferred to the beneficiaries’ accounts, (iii) if applicable, the tax authorities issue a certificate of good tax standing to the beneficiary, and (iv) the assets or services the taxpayer acquires with the grant are not deducted.
## Foreign income
A Mexican corporation is taxed on foreign-source income when earned. Double taxation is reduced, or possibly eliminated, by means of foreign tax credits. However, the undistributed profits of a foreign subsidiary are not subject to Mexican tax until dividends are paid, with the exception of companies with investments in entities with revenue subject to a preferred tax regime (tax haven or PTR) (*discussed below*), in which case income is generally taxable even if no distributions are received from those entities.
In addition, note that, per the 2020 Tax Reform, foreign-sourced revenue generated by Mexican residents and PEs through transparent legal entities or juridical figures will be taxable in Mexico as part of the regime that is in line with the treatment of the individual or entity generating the foreign-sourced revenue and not separately as it was previously taxed under the PTR rules. Note that this is relevant as different from the PTR regime, no exceptions on revenue anticipation that may be applicable to the PTR regime would be available in such cases.
## Investments in tax havens (income subject to PTRs)
Investments in tax havens include those made directly or indirectly in entities, branches, real property, shares, bank accounts, or investment accounts and any kind of participation in entities, trusts, joint ventures, or investment funds, as well as in any other similar legal entities created or incorporated in accordance with foreign law, located in a tax haven and including those that are carried out through an intermediary.
A business, entity, trust, or joint venture is considered to be located in a tax haven when it has a physical presence, an address, a post office box, or effective management in a tax haven, or when its bank account is held in or through financing entities located in a tax haven.
Unless it can be demonstrated that the taxpayer does not have management control of the foreign investments, the taxpayer must include the income generated through such entities or foreign vehicles in the proportion that corresponds to their direct or indirect participation in the capital of the entity or vehicle.
Revenue and profits subject to PTRs are taxed separately. This revenue cannot be combined with other taxable income or losses and it is not considered for purposes of making advance income tax payments. Tax applicable to this type of income is payable together with the annual CIT return. In addition, the 2020 Tax Reform establishes additional provisions in order to determine if the profits obtained by the taxpayers are subject to a PTR.
The classification of a PTR is not based on the location of the investment but on the tax effectively paid on the income generated abroad. An investment is considered subject to a PTR if the revenue is not subject to tax or tax paid abroad is less than 75% of the income tax that would have been incurred and paid in Mexico if the income had been taxed under Mexican rules. However, the taxpayers may opt to compare on a simplified basis the statutory CIT rate of the tax residency country of the foreign entity versus the corresponding Mexican CIT rate if certain requirements and characteristics are met (e.g. broadly that all revenue is taxable for the foreign entity and deductions are effectively incurred) in the same moments than under the Mexican Income Tax Law. Note that the updated text of the 2020 Tax Reform provides that the PTR regime testing for purposes of interpreting other provisions of the MITL that refer to the definition of PTR must be seen on a transactional basis.
In general, interest income and the annual inflationary adjustment made to liabilities of the investment in the tax haven are included in taxable income without subtracting the annual inflationary adjustment on receivables. However, the annual inflationary adjustment on receivables may be subtracted from interest income earned, provided an information return is filed.
Moreover, the 2020 Tax Reform provides that revenue earned through foreign transparent entities or foreign juridical figures held by Mexican residents would be dealt with as part of the regime that is in line with the treatment of the individual or entity generating the foreign-sourced revenue and not separately. Note that this is relevant as different from the PTR regime, no exceptions on revenue anticipation that may be applicable to the PTR regime would be available in such cases.
Tax on investments in a PTR is determined by applying the general CIT rate to taxable income (currently 30%). However, the rate for PTR was updated based on the 2020 Tax Reform to match those of Mexican individuals (the highest rate currently being 35%) in cases where the PTR is triggered by them directly. Additionally, net operating loss carryforwards associated with an investment in a PTR may be amortised against the tax profit of the following tax years arising from investments in a PTR, and tax deductions related to the investment may also be applied, as long as accounting records pertaining to those investments are available and the annual information return on the investments is filed on time.
Undistributed income from investments in entities located in a PTR need not be immediately included in taxable income (under the provisions discussed above) in certain particular cases (e.g. income arising from qualified active business activities in accordance with the applicable legislation and in the case of passive income from indirect investments in a tax haven when certain strict conditions are met).
Income earned in a PTR will be taxed until its distribution where the PTR income arises from a business activity. This treatment will not be applicable, however, if income such as interest, dividends, royalties, certain capital gains, and rents (i.e. passive income) represent more than 20% of the total income generated. In this regard, note that, per the 2020 Tax Reform, this exception is no longer allowed in those situations where the revenue of the foreign entity is Mexican sourced or have directly or indirectly derived in a deduction in Mexico.
Other specific cases of income on which the tax may apply until distribution include the case of share transfers within the same group and for income derived from interest that do not represent a tax deduction for Mexican tax residents, to the extent that certain specific requirements are satisfied.
## *Maquiladoras*
Revenues associated with productive activities must be derived solely from *Maquila* activities. Additionally, the rules on M&E ownership are consistent with the IMMEX Decree definition (i.e. 30% or more of the M&E used in the *Maquila* operation must be owned by the foreign principal).
The effective income tax rate on *Maquila* profits is 30%.
In terms of transfer pricing, only the safe harbour alternative is applicable to *Maquilas*.
Under a Presidential Decree published in Mexico’s Official Gazette, the following benefits are also granted to the *Maquiladora* industry:
Additionally, among other rules, the Miscellaneous Tax Regulations (MTRs) include further guidance in connection with the *Maquiladora* industry, as follows:

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
## Payments to Mexican residents
Payments to resident corporations and PEs in Mexico are generally not subject to WHT.
Payments by resident corporations to resident individuals are subject to WHT as follows:
| Payment | WHT (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Wages, salaries, and other remuneration | 0 to 35 |
| Fees: |  |
| Members of boards of directors and advisory boards | 35 |
| Other professional fees | 10 |
| Lease payments on real property | 10 |
| Interest on securities (1) | 1.04 |
| Interest on non-qualified securities | 20 |
| Dividends | 10 |
| Miscellaneous types of income of individuals, usually sporadic payments | 20 |
Note
1. WHT on interest paid by financial institutions to Mexican resident investors is generally set at 0.08% of the invested capital.
## Payments to non-residents
Income tax must usually be withheld from payments to non-resident corporations and individuals. In the case of non-tax treaty countries, the statutory withholding rates are as noted below.
Income tax of 40%, with no deductions, must be withheld on most Mexican-source payments made to foreign-related parties whose income is deemed to be subject to a PTR, in lieu of the tax provided in the domestic law for non-PTR foreign resident entities. This is not applicable in certain cases, such as on income from dividends and certain types of interest, including interest payments made to foreign banks. In these cases, the regular provisions of the domestic law should be applied to determine the income tax withholding.
Additionally, revenues for intermediation services, including commissions for brokerage, agents, distribution, and assignment, and generally all income from the negotiation of third-party interests, are also subject to 40% WHT when paid to residents whose income is subject to a PTR. The 40% may be reduced if the foreign related party beneficiary resides in a country with which Mexico has signed a comprehensive exchange of information agreement.
As of 2020, payments made to non-Mexican resident related parties or through structured agreements will be non-deductible when such payments are subject to a PTR. *Please refer to Non-deductible payments in the [Deductions](mexico/corporate/deductions.html) section*.
In broad terms, the revenue of a foreign entity is considered subject to a PTR when it is not subject to tax abroad or taxed lower than 75% of the tax that it would have borne if the recipient was a Mexican tax resident pursuant to the Mexican Tax Laws.
Non-residents’ wages and salaries are taxed on the basis of a 12-month earnings period at the following income tax withholding rates:
| Taxable income (MXN) | | WHT (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| From | To |
| 0 | 125,900 | 0 |
| 125,901 | 1,000,000 | 15 |
| 1,000,001 | and above | 30 |
The above mentioned rates are also applicable to retirement fund payouts.
However, no tax arises on compensation (wages, salaries, or fees other than board fees) paid by a non-resident with no establishment in Mexico (even if not subject to tax) to which the services relate, provided the individual remains in Mexico for fewer than 183 days (consecutive or not) in any 12-month period.
The tax, when applicable, is withheld if the income is paid by a resident (or a non-resident PE located in Mexico). Otherwise, the tax is generally payable within 15 working days of the associated payment, by the foreign party earning the Mexican-sourced income.
Statutory withholding rates (not mentioned above) classified as Mexican sourced and obtained by foreign residents under local legislation are as follows:
| Payment | WHT (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Professional fees for services rendered in Mexico | 25 |
| Lease payments: |  |
| Lease of real property | 25 |
| Lease of containers imported on a temporary basis, airplanes, and ships authorised by the Mexican Government to be commercially exploited in the transportation of goods or persons | 5 |
| Lease of personal property | 25 |
| Time-sharing services (1) | 25 |
| Charter agreements | 10 |
| Sales: |  |
| Real property located in Mexico (1) | 25 |
| Shares of Mexican companies (1, 2) | 25 |
| Transfers of ownership of Mexican public debt by other than the original creditors (intended to cover debt-for-equity swaps) (1) | 25 |
| Derivative transactions: |  |
| On capital (1) | 25 |
| On debt (3) | Same rates applicable to interest |
| Interest (4): |  |
| Paid to foreign government financing entities, to duly registered foreign banks and other entities that provide financing with funds obtained by issuing publicly traded debt instruments abroad, registered with the Ministry of Finance (5) | 10 |
| Interest on debt instruments placed abroad (6) | 4.9 |
| Interest payments to specific foreign financial institutions (7) | 4.9 |
| Other interest payments (not otherwise included above) paid by Mexican financial institutions to residents abroad | 21 |
| Paid to foreign suppliers of M&E, to others to finance purchases of such assets or inventory or working capital loans if the lender is duly registered | 21 |
| Paid to reinsurance entities | 15 |
| Other interest payments | 35 |
| Financial leases (on the portion deemed to qualify as interest or finance charge) | 15 |
| Dividends (12) | 10 |
| Royalties (8): |  |
| For the use of railroad cars | 5 |
| For the use of copyrights on scientific, literary, or art works, including motion pictures and radio and television recordings, as well as software and payments for the transmission of video and audio signals via satellite, cable, optic fibre, and similar media | 25 |
| On patents, invention or improvement certificates, trademarks, brand names, and advertising | 35 |
| For the use of drawings or models, plans, formulas, or procedures, and of scientific, commercial, and industrial equipment; on amounts paid for information regarding scientific, commercial, and industrial experience; and for technical assistance | 25 |
| Short-term construction and the respective installation, maintenance, technical direction, or supervision (9) | 25 |
| Reinsurance premiums | 2 |
| Income obtained by athletes and artists (1) | 25 |
| Income derived from prizes (e.g. lottery tickets or raffles) (10) | 1/21 |
| Other income (forgiven debts, indemnifications, rights to participate in business, investments, etc.) | 35 |
Notes
1. The non-resident may elect to pay tax at a rate of 35% (*see Note 11 below for the rate applicable thereafter*) on the net taxable profit in the case of (i) time-sharing services, (ii) share sales, (iii) sales of real property, (iv) activities of sportsmen/artists, and (v) derivative stock and debt transactions, provided that the non-resident recipient of the income has a legal representative resident in Mexico and to the extent that the following specific requirements are met:
3. The sale of shares through the Mexican Stock Exchange is subject to a 10% WHT. When the investor is a resident in a country with which Mexico has signed a tax treaty, such withholding will not apply if certain requirements are satisfied.
4. The applicable WHT rate (based on the WHT rates for interest) for debt-derivative transactions is applied on a net basis. However, if the transaction is liquidated in kind, the applicable WHT rate (on the same net basis) is 10%.
5. Interest payments to non-residents are exempt from Mexican income tax when they are paid on the following:
7. A 4.9% WHT rate is applicable when the interest is paid to banks resident in countries with which Mexico has signed a tax treaty.
8. The 4.9% WHT rate applies, provided the placement is handled through banks or brokerage firms resident in a country with which Mexico has signed a tax treaty if there is compliance with the information requirements established in the general rules issued by the Ministry of Finance. If there is failure to comply with these requirements, the 10% WHT rate applies. The 4.9% and 10% WHT rates mentioned in the preceding paragraphs do not apply, and instead a 35% WHT rate is applicable to interest, when the direct or indirect beneficiaries of the interest, either individually or jointly with related parties, receive more than 5% of the interest arising from the instrument in question, and are either (i) holders of more than 10% of the voting shares of the issuing company, either directly or indirectly, either individually or jointly with related parties, or (ii) business entities holding more than 20% of their shares, either directly or indirectly, either individually or jointly with parties related to the issuer.
9. The 4.9% WHT rate is applicable to interest payments made to foreign financial institutions in which the Mexican federal government or the Mexican Central Bank has equity participation.
10. The WHT rate is applied to the gross amount of the payment.
11. The non-resident taxpayer may elect to pay 35% tax on the net profit if the taxpayer has a resident legal representative and so informs the customer, who then makes no withholding. When business activities last for more than 183 days, the foreign taxpayer is deemed to have a PE in Mexico for tax purposes and is taxed in the same manner and subject to the same rules as a local resident corporation or branch.
12. The 21% federal rate is applied only in the case of non-qualifying prizes (i.e. income derived from prizes that is subject to a state tax that exceeds a rate of 6%).
13. The statutory WHT rates mentioned above may be reduced by applying tax treaty provisions. During the last two decades, Mexico has embarked on a policy of negotiating a network of tax treaties with its main trading and investment partners (*see table below*).
14. The 10% WHT on dividend payments to foreign residents does not apply to distributions of profits subject to corporate-level tax prior to 2014. If a corporation makes a distribution out of earnings that for any reason have not been subject to CIT, such as distributions of book earnings (i.e. not yet recognised for tax purposes in Mexico), the corporation will also be subject to CIT on the grossed-up distributed earnings (gross-up factor is 1.4286).
As of December 2019, the treaties with the following countries are pending ratification while waiting for the completion of specific formalities by the respective governments in order to become effective, have not been published yet in the Official Gazette, or are under negotiation: Egypt, Guatemala, Iran, Lebanon, Malaysia, Morocco, Nicaragua, Oman, Pakistan, Slovenia, Thailand, and Venezuela.
Tax treaties with the countries listed in the following table have been published in the Official Gazette and are in force.
The WHT rates negotiated under the tax treaties are as follows:

Notes
The applicable tax rates on dividends paid abroad in accordance with the tax treaties executed by Mexico are detailed below; however, under domestic law, no withholding is applied on distributions of profits subject to corporate-level tax generated prior to 2014, when the 10% dividend WHT started applying.
There are certain specific cases of interest paid to parties resident abroad that might be exempted by certain tax treaties (e.g. interest paid to a pension fund or paid by a bank, interest paid on certain loans granted or guaranteed by certain entities for exports under preferable conditions), which are not detailed in the information below.
The tax legislation gives the Mexican tax authorities the ability to require that the foreign-related party provide a sworn statement through its legal representative confirming that the item of income for which a treaty benefit is claimed would otherwise be subject to double taxation.
1. This rate applies when the recipient corporation that is the beneficial owner of the dividend (except for civil partnerships) directly owns at least 10% of the capital of the distributing corporation. In the case of Barbados, Hungary, and South Africa, the specific exclusion of civil partnerships is not included.
2. This rate applies where the company that is the beneficial owner of the dividends directly or indirectly owns at least 25% of the capital of the distributing company. In the case of Argentina specifically, there must be a direct ownership of 25% of the capital of the distributing company. In the case of Belgium, no WHT would apply if the beneficial owner holds for an uninterrupted period of at least 12 months shares representing directly at least 10% of the capital of the company paying the dividends or to pension funds if certain requirements are met.
3. This rate applies where the company that is the beneficial owner of the dividends (except for civil partnerships) directly owns at least 25% of the capital of the company distributing the dividends.
4. This rate applies where the recipient corporation that is the beneficial owner of the dividend owns at least 10% of the voting shares of the paying corporation. The Mexico-US tax treaty contains a most-favoured nation clause.
5. This rate applies where a company that is the beneficial owner of the dividends (except for civil partnerships, although limited liability partnerships are included) directly owns at least 10% of the voting shares of the company distributing the dividends.
6. This rate applies where a company that is the beneficial owner of the dividends owns at least 20% of the voting shares of the company paying the dividends.
7. This is the maximum WHT rate for dividends, with no distinction for substantial holdings. In the case of Ecuador and India, the tax payable on dividends paid to residents in Mexico must not exceed a limit established in the treaty.
8. The 5% rate applies when a company that is the beneficial owner of the dividends owns at least 25% of the voting shares of the company paying dividends during the six months prior to the end of the tax period in which dividends are paid. Under certain particular rules and provided this ownership requirement is satisfied, dividend payments are only subject to taxin the country of residence of the recipient of the dividends.
9. No withholding applies when more than 50% of the shares of the recipient corporation are owned by residents of France or Mexico or when the beneficial owner of the dividend is a resident individual. Accordingly, the WHT applies to dividends when more than 50% of the recipient corporation’s shares are owned by residents of other countries. However, the WHT must not exceed 5% when the party receiving the dividend is the effective beneficiary of said dividend. Dividends paid by a company resident in France to a resident of Mexico, other than a company that directly or indirectly holds at least 10% of the capital stock of the first-mentioned company, may also be taxed in France, in accordance with the law of France, but if the recipient of the dividends is the beneficial owner, the tax thus charged must not exceed 15% of the gross amount of the dividends.
10. The 5% rate applies where the company that is the beneficial owner of dividends directly or indirectly owns at least 10% of the capital of the company distributing the dividends. There is a 10% tax rate that applies when these same ownership requirements are satisfied, but the company paying dividends is a resident of Israel (provided dividends are paid from earnings taxed in Israel at a tax rate lower than the regular corporate tax rate in Israel).
11. The applicable tax rate on the gross amount of the dividends when the recipient company (beneficial owner) (except for civil partnerships) directly holds at least 10% of the capital of the corporation paying the dividend must not exceed 5% in the case of Luxembourg and 8% in the case of Mexico. The protocol of the Mexico-Luxembourg tax treaty states that this rate might be reviewed in the future by the contracting states if the WHT is not fully creditable, and can be adjusted under the principle of avoiding double taxation, provided the adjusted WHT rate is not lower than 5%.
12. Dividends paid by a company resident in Mexico to a company resident in the Netherlands (which is the beneficiary of said dividends) are subject to a maximum tax of 5% on the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company that directly or indirectly owns at least 10% of the capital of the company paying said dividends. However, as long as a company resident in the Netherlands is not subject to Dutch income tax on dividends received from a company resident in Mexico under the terms of the Dutch income tax law and any future amendments thereto, the dividends mentioned in the preceding paragraph may only be taxed in the Netherlands (not in Mexico).
13. The Mexico-New Zealand tax treaty contains a most-favoured nation clause that may be applicable in the future.
14. The exemption on dividend WHT is not applicable in the case of deemed dividends.
15. To the extent certain requirements provided in the Protocol are met, the WHT may be reduced to 0%.
16. The 10% rate applies to loans from banks. In the case of Belgium, the 5% rate is available for loans from banks and on interest paid from bonds that are regularly and substantially traded on a recognised securities market, and the 10% rate applies in all other cases.
17. The 5% WHT rate is applicable to interest paid to banks.
18. The 5% rate applies to interest on loans from banks, insurance companies, and retirement and pension plans. However, in the case of Saudi Arabia, interest income on loans from insurance companies is excluded for the reduced 5% WHT rate.
19. The 10% rate applies to interest on loans from banks, insurance companies, and securities regularly and substantially traded on a recognised national stock exchange.
20. The 4.9% rate applies to interest on loans from banks and insurance companies and to interest on securities regularly and substantially traded on a recognised national stock exchange.
21. In the case of the Netherlands, the 5% rate applies to interest on loans from banks and to interest on securities regularly and substantially traded on a recognised national stock exchange. In the case of the United Kingdom, the 5% rate extends to interest paid to insurance companies. In the case of Spain, the 4.9% rate applies to interest on loans from banks, interest on securities regularly and substantially traded on a recognised national stock exchange, and interest paid to insurance companies.
22. The updated WHT rates of the Tax Convention are effective as of 27 September 2017.
23. The 10% rate on interest applies in the case of interest paid to the original seller of M&E and interest paid by banks.
24. The 10% rate applies to interest on loans from banks and to interest derived from bonds or securities that are regularly and substantially traded on a recognised securities market, as well as to interest paid by the purchaser of M&E to a beneficial owner that is the seller of the M&E.
25. The 10% rate applies to interest on loans from banks and insurance companies, to interest on securities regularly and substantially traded on a recognised national stock exchange, to interest paid to the original seller of M&E in a sale on credit, and to interest paid by banks.
26. The 5% rate is applicable to interest on loans granted by banks and insurance companies, securities traded on a recognised securities market, and the sale on credit of M&E.
27. It is understood that the definition of royalties applies to any type of payment received for the provision of technical assistance services. The 15% rate applies to royalties arising from the use of, or the right to use, trademarks.
28. The original rate is 15% but has been reduced to 10% as long as the Netherlands does not impose a WHT.
29. The reduced WHT rate results from the application of the most-favoured nation clause.
30. The 5% rate applies to industrial, commercial, and scientific equipment.
31. The 10% rate also applies to fees for technical assistance, which are payments of any kind, other than those mentioned in Articles 14 and 15 of the treaty as consideration for managerial or technical or consultancy services, including the provision of services of technical or other personnel.
32. This rate applies where the company that is the beneficial owner of the dividends directly owns at least 25% of the capital of the distributing company.
33. The treaty broadly defines royalties and includes payments related to certain software.
34. This rate applies where the company that is the beneficial owner of the dividends directly or indirectly owns at least 10% of the capital of the distributing company.
35. The 5% rate applies on the gross amount of the interest paid to, among others, banks and insurance institutions.
36. No withholding applies where the company that is the beneficial owner of the dividends (except for civil partnerships) directly owns at least 10% of the capital of the company distributing the dividends or when the dividends are distributed to a pension fund.
37. The updated protocol of the Italy Tax Convention is applicable since 16 April 2015. In the case of Belgium, the new protocol entered into force in general as of 1 January 2018.
38. The 4.9% rate applies on the gross amount of the interest paid to banks and pension funds or pension schemes; the 10% rate applies on the gross amount of the interest paid in any other case.
39. The 5% rate applies on the gross amount of the interest paid to and by banks; the 10% rate applies on the gross amount of the interest in all other cases.
40. The 5% rate applies on the gross amount of the interest if the beneficial owner of the interest is a bank; the 10% rate applies on the gross amount of the interest in all other cases.
41. The 10% rate applies on the gross amount of the interest if it is paid to a bank; the 15% rate applies on the gross amount of the interest in all other cases.
42. The 10% rate applies on the gross amount of royalties derived from the use of intellectual property over literary, theatre, musical, artistic, or scientific works; the use of patents, designs, models, plans, formulas or secret procedures, computer programs, commercial equipment, industrial equipment, scientific equipment, or for information related to industrial, commercial, or scientific experiences or the rendering of technical assistance services; the 15% rate applies on the gross amount of the royalty in all other cases.
43. Even though the tax conventions are currently in force, the withholding reduced rates and provisions related to other taxes would be applicable until 1 January 2019, per articles 30 and 29 of the Jamaica and Saudi Arabia Tax Conventions, accordingly.
44. The 5% and 10% rates apply if the beneficial owner is an entity owning at least 70% or 10% of the equity of the distributing entity, respectively.
45. The 12.5% and 15% rates apply if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other contracting state (Philippines).

## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
The majority of the Double Tax Treaties (DTTs) entered into by Mexico are covered by the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) (the MLI), except for certain exceptions, such as Indonesia, which had not covered the tax convention with Mexico as covered under the MLI, and the United States of America, which decided not to join the MLI. The precise date the conventions covered by the MLI will be effective for Mexican tax purposes is yet unknown, as the Mexican Senate must conclude the approval process of the MLI.
In general terms, the 2020 and 2021 Mexican Tax Reforms were meant to incorporate fundamentals of the OECD BEPS initiative. The economic context in which these reforms were legislated assumes gross domestic product (GDP) growth of between 1.5% and 2.5%, and an increase in tax collection without the creation of new taxes, although the current expectations for economic growth have been affected due to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
On 23 April 2021, the Mexican government enacted reforms of the Labour Law as well as different fiscal provisions. This reform prohibits the subcontracting of personnel services and aims for each taxpayer to directly employ its labour force without the intermediation of an in-house or outsource service provider, disallowing the deduction of payments for subcontracting services.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
The Mexican Federal Tax Code provides that corporations are deemed residents in Mexico if the principal centre of administration or the effective place of management is located in Mexico. A specific definition of ‘tax resident’ in any tax treaty overrides domestic law definitions, provided the taxpayer is eligible to apply the treaty.
When a company ceases to be a Mexican resident in terms of the Mexican Federal Tax Code or any tax treaty, it is deemed to be liquidated for tax purposes. In such cases, a notification is required at least 15 days before the change, and the CIT return must be filed with the Mexican tax authorities within 15 working days following the date on which the change of tax residency takes place.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The Mexican Income Tax Law considers a PE to be any place in Mexico where business activities or services are carried out or rendered by non-residents, such as agencies, offices, mining exploration sites, or any other place of exploration, extraction, or exploitation of natural resources, regardless of the length of time involved.
Moreover, note that the 2020 Tax Reform introduces additional provisions to determine when a foreign resident has a PE in Mexico. In this regard, the threshold to trigger a PE when a foreign entity acts in Mexico through a dependent agent in those cases where it habitually concludes contracts on behalf of the non-resident is extended to also cover situations when the dependent agent habitually carries out the principal role leading to the conclusion of the contracts, and any of the following apply:
Additionally, the 2020 Tax Reform introduces additional scenarios to consider when an independent agent could also trigger as a PE under the argument that it does not act within its ordinary framework of activities. In this sense, the 2020 Tax Reform adds that a Mexican resident acting exclusively or almost exclusively on behalf of non-Mexican resident related parties will be deemed to be an independent agent acting outside of its ordinary frame of activities.
A foreign insurance company could also be considered as having a PE when it engages in activities consisting of insuring risk or collecting premiums (with the exception of reinsurance activities) in Mexico through a party other than an independent agent.
Based on the Hydrocarbons Law, foreign residents are deemed to have a PE when conducting certain oil and gas activities in Mexico for more than 30 days. This implies that the foreigner would need to satisfy all enrolment, compliance, documentation, withholding, and tax filing and payment obligations applicable to Mexican branches of foreign residents.
A non-resident is not considered to have a PE in Mexico as a result of the legal or economic relationships maintained with companies carrying out certain inventory processing activities (i.e*. Maquiladoras*) that process goods or merchandise maintained in Mexico by the non-resident by using assets provided by the non-resident or any related party, as long as certain requirements are met. The requirements include the conditions that the non-resident be resident in a tax treaty country and that the *Maquiladora* complies with the transfer pricing provisions (‘safe harbour’) to determine its tax profit, as provided in the Mexican Income Tax Law.
Parties resident abroad and engaged in *Maquila* operations through shelter *Maquila* companies may not be considered as creating a PE in Mexico when certain requirements are met and certain information is provided to the Mexican Tax Administration in relation to the gross revenues earned and income taxes paid by its non-Mexican-related party. Up to 2019, the PE protection is limited to four years; after that period, non-Mexican residents may opt to comply with their tax obligations as if they had a PE (instead of registering one) through the shelter *Maquiladora* for an additional four-year period, subject to the compliance of certain requirements. However, under the 2020 Tax Reform, foreign residents would be subject to tax in Mexico since the beginning of its operations with the shelter *Maquiladora* but will be able to continue complying such obligations through the shelter *Maquiladora* indefinitely (no need to register a PE), subject to certain requirements and new obligations incorporated for *Maquiladoras*.
It is important to note that, per the transitory tax provisions included in the 2020 Tax Reform, foreign residents applying the shelter *Maquiladora* regime under the previous regime may continue to do so until the relevant time period expires, after which they would be subject to the 2020 shelter *Maquiladora* tax regime update.
A definition of PE in any tax treaty overrides domestic law definitions where the taxpayer is eligible to apply the corresponding tax treaty.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
Deductions for certain business expenses are limited (e.g. business meals, use of company-owned cars).
Starting on 1 January 2021, new requirements are introduced for purposes of deducting expenses that qualify as investments.
## Depreciation and amortisation
Straight-line depreciation is permitted at the rates specified in the law (i.e. estimated lives for assets are 20 years for buildings, 3.3 years for computers, 4 years for cars [the deductibility threshold for cars is MXN 175,000, for electric cars the limit is MXN 250,000 starting from 2017], 10 years for certain M&E, etc.), and the deduction may be increased by applying the percentage increases in the NCPI from the month in which the asset was originally acquired. When an asset is disposed of or becomes useless, the remaining undepreciated historical cost may also be deducted, after application of the appropriate inflation adjustment factor to the undepreciated historical cost.
Starting from 2016, companies, including those dedicated to transportation infrastructure and those that invest in hydrocarbon-related activities and the generation of electricity, who have obtained revenues in the prior tax year up to MXN 100 million, can apply an accelerated depreciation (i.e. lump-sum deduction) for investments in new fixed assets that were acquired in the last quarter of the 2015 tax year, or in 2016 or 2017. The accelerated depreciation rate varies from around 60% to 90% depending on the type of assets and the year of acquisition (i.e. 2016 or 2017).
Intangible assets for the exploitation of goods that are in the public domain, or for rendering public services under concession, are considered deferred assets (i.e. not deducted as incurred). Therefore, these assets are subject to amortisation for income tax purposes.
Specific annual depreciation rates are established for goods used in certain industries. In connection with mining concessions, the fixed assets that qualify as installations, additions, repairs, improvements, and adaptations, as well as any other construction built in the lot assigned for mining activities, will be subject to a 5% annual deprecation rate.
## Goodwill
Goodwill is a non-deductible item for Mexican tax purposes, and the corresponding input VAT (if any) will not be creditable.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses incurred prior to the commencement of operations may be amortised at the rate of 10% per year, after applying the adjustment factors.
## Interest expenses
In general terms, interest expenses are deductible items if, among others, the principal is invested in the main activity of the Mexican taxpayer, withholding obligations are complied with, informative returns disclosing information related to the loan and transactions carried out with related parties are filed, thin capitalisation rules (3:1 debt-to-equity ratio) are satisfied, the transaction is at arm's length, and the interest does not fall into the deemed dividend criteria.
Furthermore, an interest deductibility limitation was introduced along with the 2020 Tax Reform. In this regard, the new limitation would apply to net interest (taxable accrued interest less deductible interest) exceeding 30% of an adjusted taxable profit amount. Note that such limitation would only apply to those taxpayers having deductible accrued interests exceeding MXN 20 million, allowance that should be accounted on a Mexican group basis or related party basis. For purposes of this limitation, the adjusted taxable profit (ATI) is defined as the amount resulting from adding the standard taxable profit with accrued interest, depreciation, amortisation, and pre-operative expenses.
Furthermore, this limitation would not be applicable to entities belonging to the Mexican financial sector. In addition, interests deriving from debts destined to finance public infrastructure, constructions (including the land acquisition where those constructions will be made) located in Mexico, the exploration, extraction, transport, distribution, and storage of oil and hydrocarbons or other extractive industry, electric energy projects, or water related projects would be excluded from the limitation. Note, however, that revenues deriving from such projects would be subtracted from the aforementioned ATI.
The Mexican Income Tax Law provides that this limitation would only apply when more burdensome than the existing thin capitalisation limitation.
For purposes on the annual inflationary adjustment, the amended text of the Mexican Income Tax Law provides that debts deriving non-deducible interests in connection with this limitation should not be considered in the computation. However, they must be considered if at any point the interests become deductible because of the ten-year carryforward.
Note that this applies to the entirety of interest expenses made by a Mexican entity and will be applicable from 2020, notwithstanding the interests derive from debts engaged in previous years and must be reflected in the annual tax returns of the taxpayer.
## Bad debts
Bad debts may be deducted on the earlier of the date on which the debt prescribes or the date on which the taxpayer substantiates the practical impossibility of collection, as defined by the law, among other detailed rules.
## Charitable contributions
The maximum amount for deductible donations is limited to 7% of the taxable income of the previous year.
## Fines and penalties
In general terms, fines and penalties are non-deductible items for income tax purposes, except interest for underpayment of taxes.
## Taxes
In general, all federal, state, and local taxes levied on a company (not including those required to be withheld from other parties) represent deductible expenses for CIT purposes, with the following exceptions:
## Subcontracting
According to the outsourcing reform enacted as of 23 April 2021 (*please refer to Outsourcing reform in the [Other issues](other-issues.html) section for more details*), payments derived from labour subcontracting will be deductible when made to a service provider that has secured from the labour authority a registration as a specialised service provider. For the payer to deduct such payment, the service received must be related to an activity that is not deemed to be part of its core business or main economic activity, hence, specialised nature.
## Net operating losses
Subject to certain limitations, losses incurred in prior years by a business may be carried forward and deducted from income earned over a subsequent ten-year period. Net operating loss carrybacks are not allowed.
Losses carried forward may be increased by the percentage increase in the NCPI between the seventh and 12th months of the fiscal year in which they are incurred and thereafter up to the sixth month of the fiscal year in which they are applied.
In the case of entities engaged in activities related to the exploration and production of hydrocarbons in maritime waters at depths of 500 metres or more, net operating losses (following the same adjustment rules mentioned above) may be used to reduce their taxable income within the following 15 years.
Tax loss carryforwards are non-transferable, not even by virtue of a merger. However, the tax losses the surviving entity had prior to the merger may continue to be used to offset the income derived from the same business activities that originated them and, with certain restrictions, may also be used to offset income that derives from new business activities. In the case of a spin-off, tax loss carryforwards should be divided between the surviving entity and the spun-off entities in accordance with their main business activity, prior to the spin-off, as follows:
Current tax legislation may limit the offsetting of tax loss carryforwards upon direct or indirect changes in ownership that imply a change in control of the Mexican entity in certain situations (i.e. whenever the revenue of the last three years is less than the tax loss carryforwards updated for inflation balance of the year prior to the change in control, among other situations). The limitation, if applicable, would limit the netting of tax loss carryforwards available prior to the change in control against the income derived from the same business activities that originated them.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Taxable income and authorised deductions must be determined on the basis of prices that would be agreed with independent parties in comparable transactions (arm’s-length values).
Payments to non-residents of a prorated portion of expenses (i.e. allocations of expenses) are, in principle, not deductible for Mexican corporations. However, per current administrative tax rules, they may be deductible if a comprehensive set of requirements is complied with.
Payments made by Mexican residents to domestic or foreign related parties, which are in the hands of such related parties also deductible, are not deductible for the Mexican resident unless the corresponding income is included in the related party taxable income in the same or in a subsequent tax year.
### Technical assistance, royalties, and interest payments
In order to be deductible, payments related to technical assistance, the transfer of technology, or royalties must be made directly to companies with the required technical capabilities to provide the corresponding service and should correspond to services actually received. Note that, per the 2020 Tax Reform, the royalty definition is broadened to include the temporary use of movable assets destined to commercial, scientific, or industrial activities (instead of being treated as a regular lease).
### Non-deductible payments
Amendments were made to an existing rule limiting the deductibility of payments to related party residents whose income is subject to a preferential tax regime.
The fair market value exemption was eliminated and updates were included to cover those situations where the payment is directly or indirectly configured among related parties that lead ultimately to a PTR scenario and also situations that imply a structured agreement that, in broad terms, seeks to cover those situations where the payments are made to a third party not subject to a PTR when such third party in turns makes payments to related parties of the Mexican resident in function of the consideration received from Mexico.
Note that the aforementioned deductibility limitation application is general to all types of deductible payments (e.g. acquisition of goods, interest, royalties, services).
As defined earlier, a foreign entity’s revenue is considered as subject to a PTR on the tax effectively paid on the income generated abroad. An investment is considered subject to a PTR if the revenue is not subject to tax or tax paid abroad is less than 75% of the income tax that would have been incurred and paid in Mexico if the income had been taxed under Mexican rules.
There are several exceptions to the aforementioned deductibility limitation, the main one being when the payment that is considered as revenue subject to a PTR derives from the business activity of the recipient thereof, provided that it is demonstrated that it has the personnel and assets necessary for the realisation of such activity. This paragraph will only be applicable when the recipient of the payment has its effective place of management and is incorporated in a country or jurisdiction with which Mexico has a comprehensive information exchange agreement.
The aforementioned exception would not be applicable in a scenario where the PTR is configured due to a hybrid mechanism (unless in some cases when it arises due to a shareholder-subsidiary relationship), a branch income exemption scheme, or in cases of structured agreements.
From an international tax perspective, special focus and analysis on the potential application of this new deductibility limitation rule is recommended on a case-by-case basis, as there are particularly sensitive international structures exposed to it, such as shared services centre structures, related party financing structures, captive insurance structures, and intellectual property management structures, among others.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
The Mexican Income Tax Law previously included a chapter that allowed certain holding companies to file a consolidated income tax return with their majority-owned subsidiaries. Tax consolidation was applicable for CIT purposes but not for other taxes (e.g. VAT) or compulsory employee profit sharing.
Companies that, until 2013, consolidated with their subsidiaries for tax purposes were entitled to reduce their deferred tax by crediting against the consolidated tax the tax on dividends paid between members of the group, and to reduce by up to 50% the consolidated tax by applying losses (valued at 15%) incurred by the controlled entities.
The tax consolidation regime was repealed starting in 2014, and a simplified tax consolidation (deferral) regime was introduced.
The main requirements for applying the current tax consolidation (deferral) regime are as follows:
Shares that qualify as placed among the general investing public and non-voting shares are not considered for the purposes of determining the proportions described above.
As of December 2019, Albania, Andorra, Anguilla, Argentina, Aruba, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrain, Barbados, Belgium, Belize, Bermuda, Brazil, British Virgin Islands, Bulgaria, Caicos Islands, Cameroon, Canada, Cayman Islands, Chile, China, Colombia, Cook Islands, Costa Rica, Croatia, Curaçao, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Ghana, Gibraltar, Greece, Greenland, Guatemala, Guernsey, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, India, Ireland, Isle of Man, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Jersey, Kazakhstan, the Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Latvia, Lebanon, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macau, Malaysia, Malta, Marshall Islands, Mauritius, Monaco, Montserrat, Nauru, the Netherlands, the Netherlands Antilles, New Zealand, Nigeria, Niue, Northern Ireland, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, San Marino, San Martin, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Seychelles, Singapore, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, St. Lucia, Sweden, Switzerland, Tunisia, Turkey, Turks Islands, Uganda, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uruguay, and Vanuatu are considered to have broad exchange information agreements on tax matters with Mexico; other agreements or tax treaties that might include an information exchange agreement on tax matters are awaiting ratification or being negotiated.
The Mexican Tax Administration must authorise the application of the consolidation regime, and written consent of the legal representative of each of the companies that would be participating must be filed before 15 August of the year prior to the first year of consolidation to request the proper authorisation. Special tax accounts should be kept by each of the companies of the group.
There are some types of entities that would not qualify for the consolidation regime, among others, non-profit entities, credit institutions, insurance corporations, trusts, auxiliary credit institutions, stock exchange entities, foreign exchange houses and capital investment companies, non-resident companies, companies in liquidation, civil or social associations, cooperatives, and *maquiladoras*.
In general terms, the current consolidation regime allows an individual company to offset losses against profits of other companies in the same group during a three-year deferral period.
The deferred income tax must be paid by each of the entities of the group on the same date on which they are required to file their annual income tax return for the year following that in which the three-year deferral period concludes. The deferred income tax will be paid updated with the accumulated inflation adjustment from the month in which the tax was deferred to the month in which the tax is paid.
The deferral benefit must be paid before the three-year deferral period if:
## Transfer pricing
Mexican transfer pricing legislation is based on the OECD principles. This has resulted in the implementation of transfer pricing guidelines that are largely in line with the global economy and trade.
In general terms, from a Mexican transfer pricing perspective, all related-party transactions (including certain joint-venture relationships) must be performed at arm's length. Mexican transfer pricing regulations require taxpayers to produce a contemporaneous transfer pricing report to ensure their income and expenses are in line with Mexican Income Tax Law.
Those taxpayers who are required to present an informative return with respect to their tax status (a DISIF for its acronym in Spanish) are also required to present certain information of the transactions carried out with related parties in Mexico and abroad for each fiscal year. The DISIF must be filed, when applicable, as part of the annual corporate tax return of Mexican legal entities.
Local legislation allows the selection of both traditional methods and profit-based methods consistent with the OECD guidelines. However, the legislation provides a strict ordering criteria for the application of a method, starting with the comparable uncontrolled price (CUP) method. Other methods different from the CUP may only be applied if the CUP method is justifiably not applicable based on the specific facts and circumstances of each transaction.
Mexican legislation is generally ‘form over substance’ oriented; consequently, contractual terms remain relevant when defining the economic substance of the transactions subject to the transfer pricing analysis.
Reliable financial information is not always publicly available for Mexican entities. Hence, reliance is often placed on foreign information, which is then adjusted to properly reflect local market conditions and render the transactions in question more comparable.
## Country-by-Country (CbC) reporting, Master file, and Local file
In 2016, the Mexican government enacted the requirement to file a master information return (Master file), local information return (Local file), and CbC report on a calendar-year basis, starting in FY 2016 and due every 31 December of the following fiscal year. As of 2022, the Local file will be due by 15 May of the following year. The provisions of the Mexican Income Tax Law on this obligation are largely consistent with the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) with respect to Action Plan 13: Guidance on the Implementation of Transfer Pricing Documentation and Country by Country Reporting. Note that the filing of Master and Local files is required by Mexican taxpayers exceeding a specific established threshold, while the CbC report is only required for Mexican multinational groups meeting a certain group revenue threshold. However, Mexican tax authorities may also request the filing of a CbC report concerning foreign multinational groups in certain circumstances.
Failure to file the reports is subject to fines and disqualification of the taxpayer from entering into contracts with the Mexican public sector or having their customs permits cancelled.
## Thin capitalisation
Interest generated by excess debt lent by a foreign related party to a Mexican resident is non-deductible for CIT purposes. Excess debt is defined as that exceeding three times the value of shareholders’ equity (i.e. a 3:1 debt-to-equity ratio) as per the taxpayer’s Mexican Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) balance sheet.
In principle, all interest-bearing debts are considered in determining the annual average debt for purposes of calculating the ratio and thereby the disallowed interest expense amount. However, certain debts incurred for construction, operation, or maintenance of productive infrastructure associated with Mexico’s strategic areas or to generate electricity may be excluded from the computation.
Specific provisions dealing with the disallowance of interest expenses for debt financing structured though back-to-back loans should also be closely observed.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
In general terms, profit distributions to the head office (other than those regarded as a return to the head office of the capital invested into the branch, which are reflected in their 'remittances accounts') either in cash or in kind from branches or other PEs are subject to the statutory CIT rate on the grossed-up distribution, unless the remittance is made from the CUFIN account balance (i.e. the after-tax earnings account).
Branches are also subject to the 10% WHT on profit distributions, which can be reduced or eliminated based on any applicable tax treaty provision.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
## Foreign tax credit
The Mexican Income Tax law allows Mexican corporations and individuals to credit for Mexican income tax purposes the income tax paid abroad in connection with non-Mexican source income. The tax credit would only be applicable if the relevant income item from non-Mexican source is deemed as taxable for Mexican tax purposes in respect to the full amount (i.e. including the income tax paid abroad).
In general, creditability is available in respect of foreign income taxes withheld from foreign-source income or paid with a tax return filed in the foreign country in the name of the Mexican resident or by a foreign branch of a Mexican corporation. However, in the case of profit or dividend distributions by non-Mexican resident legal entities to Mexican resident legal entities, the proportional income tax paid by the non-Mexican resident distributors would be creditable in Mexico. Note that the Mexican Income Tax Law provides a specific computation to determine the proportional income tax paid abroad.
Furthermore, the creditability of the proportional income tax paid abroad in respect of dividend or profit distributions mentioned in the preceding paragraph would only be applicable if the Mexican resident entity receiving the dividend or profits holds at least 10% of the equity of the foreign distributing entity during a six-month period prior to the distribution.
In the case of dividend or profit distributions from a foreign legal entity that are in turn distributed to another foreign legal entity that then distributes the dividend to the Mexican legal entity, Mexican income tax credit for the proportional income taxes paid by both foreign legal entities may be allowed, in accordance with a specific computation provided by the Mexican Income Tax Law. Note that the creditability is strictly limited to two foreign corporate levels. In addition, the creditability in such cases would only be applicable if the entity distributing the dividends on the second corporate level resides in a jurisdiction having an in-force broad exchange of information agreement with Mexico and the Mexican entity holds at least an indirect 5% participation in such non-Mexican resident entity equity during the six-month period prior to the dividend distribution.
The foreign tax credit will be allowed up to the effective Mexican rate of tax on the taxable income (tax result) shown by the annual return on a country-by-country basis and per income type limitation. Taxpayers who are not in a position to take full credit for the taxes paid to a foreign country on foreign-source income are allowed a ten-year carryforward of such excess foreign taxes, provided certain compliance requirements are met and the credit would be limited to the corporate tax rate in Mexico of 30%.
## Duty-deferral programs
A deferral program is an authorisation provided by the Mexican Ministry of Economy to those companies importing raw materials or fixed assets to manufacture finished products within Mexico for export.
Another program allowing preferential duty rates is the Sectorial Relief Program (known as PROSEC), which allows manufacturers to apply lower duty rates on the import of raw materials and machinery required for their productive processes, regardless of their country of origin and regardless of if they are for the Mexican market or for export. These programs were created by the federal government in order to establish competitive tariff conditions for Mexican manufacturers needing to import raw materials and fixed assets from non-NAFTA or trade partner countries.
Companies in Mexico that carry out import operations with values of MXN 300 million per semester, or IMMEX companies, can take advantage of significant customs and administrative benefits if registered into the ‘Certified Company Registry’ (authorised by the Ministry of Finance). In addition, companies that comply with certain requirements regarding controls and security within their supply chain, regardless of the MXN 300 million obligation, can also obtain the 'Certified Company Registry’; this specific type of registry is known as New Scheme of Certified Companies (NEEC for its acronym in Spanish), which is different from the newer VAT certification for IMMEX companies mentioned before.
In general terms, the main benefits provided by the Certified Company Registry allows simplified procedures to process imports and exports, including the reduction in time and number of reviews when clearing goods at customs facilities.
The Mexican Income Tax Law provides a 30% tax credit for R&D expenses, including investments in R&D. The tax credit will be equal to current-year R&D expenses in excess of the average R&D expenses incurred in the previous three years. This incentive cannot be combined with other tax incentives. The government will set up a committee to analyse and approve R&D credits. Further, taxpayers will have to file an information return each February with details of the R&D expenses to be validated by the authorities. Additional rules for the R&D tax credit were published in the Mexican Official Gazette in February 2017 and are in force since 17 March 2017. The given rules provide clarity on the procedural requirements to apply for such tax incentive, some limitations, and a list of expenses that are deemed as qualifying for purposes of obtaining the tax incentive benefits (e.g. fees paid to third party investigators, expenses incurred in testing, tools for testing, specialised equipment necessary for the development of the project, laboratory equipment, among others), but the tax incentive is capped at 10% of the total income tax of the prior year.
## Employment incentives
An incentive offers a credit equivalent to 25% of the income tax corresponding to the salary paid to workers/employees with certain types of disabilities.
An additional deduction, equivalent to 25% of the salary paid to such workers/employees, is also available.
Both benefits cannot be applied in the same fiscal year.
## Incentives for investments in movie production
A limited credit is applicable for investments in movie production activities through an immediate tax credit, which is capped at 10% of the total income tax of the prior year, provided certain requirements are met.
## Incentives for investments in theatre production
A limited credit is applicable for investments in theatre production activities through an immediate tax credit, which is capped at 10% of the total income tax of the prior year, provided certain requirements are met.
## Real estate investment incentives
Some tax benefits exist for qualifying real estate investment trusts (i.e. REITs or the so-called FIBRAS for its acronym in Spanish) in Mexico. Due to the 2020 Tax Reform, the tax benefits for private FIBRAS are eliminated.
## Capital investment
In connection with new rules pertaining to the elimination of the look-through treatment to foreign transparent vehicles (*please refer to Investments in Mexico through foreign transparent vehicles in the [Other issues](other-issues.html) section*) introduced by means of the 2020 Tax Reform, safeguards were implemented in the Mexican Income Tax Law to maintain the look-through treatment (transparency) of foreign legal figures that manage private equity investments into Mexican entities, provided certain requirement are met.
The Mexican Income Tax Law also provides for a special tax regime applicable to holders of public-issued fiduciary certificates issued by public trusts incorporated under the risk capital trust tax regime, commonly known as CKDs (*Certificados de Capital de Desarrollo*), which allows for tax deferments and special income recognition rules.
## Tax benefit for the northern border region
The Presidential Decree published on 31 December 2018 grants the following tax benefits for the northern border region, effective during 2019 and 2020, aiming to boost the development of the regional economy.
### Income tax benefit
The Decree grants a tax credit equivalent to a third of the income tax determined by taxpayers residing or having operations in the region (reducing the income tax rate to 20%). For purposes of obtaining the benefit, taxpayers must fulfil the requirements established and be authorised by the tax authorities.
While the referred tax credit is not applicable to taxpayers that are already subject to a preferential tax regime (such as *Maquiladoras*, trusts, among others), it fully represents an important benefit.
### VAT benefit
Focused on acts and activities carried out in the region, the Decree grants a tax credit equivalent to 50% of the VAT computed by taxpayers. For the purposes of facilitating the benefit, the Decree allows taxpayers to reduce the tax credit from the 16% regular rate, fixing the VAT rate to 8%.
This benefit is not applicable to certain activities (e.g. sale of real estate, intangibles, digital content), and, for purposes of being subject to it, taxpayers must fulfil the requirements established and be authorised by the tax authorities.
## Tax credit against income tax withholding on interest payments from bonds and capital gains
### Interest
The tax benefit provides a tax credit equivalent to 100% of the income tax withholding applicable to interest payments from bonds issued by Mexican entities placed among the large number of investors, crediting only against income tax equivalent to the corresponding withholding, as long as the resident in Mexico did not carry out the tax withheld. The application of the benefit shall not be considered as cumulative income.
Mexican residents may apply for the tax benefit to a foreign resident of a country or jurisdiction with which Mexico has a DTT or an exchange of information agreement.
### Capital gains
The tax benefit provides a 10% income tax rate to the profits obtained by foreign residents from the transfer of shares issued by Mexican entities on stock exchanges.
The transfer of the shares is carried out through the stock exchange or through an initial public offering of a Mexican entity that has not previously listed on stock exchanges. The value of the stockholders' equity of the Mexican company whose shares are disposed of corresponds to an amount of at least MXN 1 million.
## Other incentives
Certain other specific and limited tax incentives are available for taxpayers engaged in certain activities (e.g. those engaged in air or sea transportation of goods or passengers with respect to aircraft and ships with a federal government commercial concession or permit; in the agricultural and forestry sectors; and in-bond warehouses with respect to real property used for the storage, safeguarding, or conservation of goods or merchandise).
Taxpayers dedicated exclusively to the generation of energy from renewable sources or efficient energy through co-generation systems and that have fully deducted their investments shall establish an account designated as a ‘Tax Profit Account for Investments in Renewable Energy’, which will allow for the distribution of dividends without payment of CIT.
Individual shareholders of companies that reinvest profits generated from 2014 to 2016 are entitled to a reduction in tax on dividends of up to 5% to the extent such profits are distributed beginning in 2019.

## Relevant transactions disclosure
As recently introduced in the 2020 Tax Reform, as of January 2021, taxpayers in certain scenarios and tax advisors will be required to disclose generalised and customisable reportable transactions to the tax authorities.
The schemes to be disclosed will not only be those designed, organised, implemented, or administered as of January 2020, but also those made prior to that date which tax effects continue to materialise in FY 2020 and in future years.
As mentioned before, please see below those cases in which the taxpayer would be required to disclose the reportable transaction:
The taxpayers required to comply with the reportable scheme provisions are those residents in Mexico and residents abroad having a PE in Mexico based on Mexican Income Tax Law provisions, when their tax returns reflect the tax benefits of the reportable scheme. Such persons are also required to disclose when they engage in transactions with foreign related parties and such schemes generate tax benefits in Mexico for the latter by reason of such transactions.
## Cash deposits reporting
Financial institutions are required to report, on a monthly basis, to the Revenue Administration Service (*Servicio de Administracion Tributaria* or SAT) the information on customers making monthly cash deposits in excess of MXN 15,000.
## International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adoption
All companies listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange are required to submit annual consolidated financial statements accompanied by the opinion of a Mexican independent CPA. These financial statements must be prepared in conformity with IFRS and cover three years. Financial institutions and insurance companies must also file audited financial statements with the appropriate regulatory agency.
The elective adoption of IFRS in Mexico for other companies presents great challenges and opportunities. Changing from Mexican Financial Reporting Standards (MFRS) to IFRS requires companies to review their financial reporting procedures and criteria. Major changes in the requirements often have a ripple effect, impacting many aspects of a company's information reporting organisation.
Nevertheless, the benefits to Mexican companies in reporting under IFRS are numerous. Among the greatest of these is the opening up of the Mexican Stock Market to overseas investors. By adopting IFRS, investors are able to compare two companies on different sides of the world with greater ease, and thus it is hoped that the change will encourage investment in Mexican companies.
Adoption of IFRS is not a straightforward process, and it will require time and effort on the part of the adopting entities to be able to ensure a smooth transition from MFRS to IFRS and ensure that the changes and benefits from this transition are duly implemented.
## Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) intergovernmental agreement (IGA)
FATCA was enacted in 2010 by the US Congress to target non-compliance by US taxpayers using foreign accounts. FATCA requires foreign financial institutions (FFIs) to report to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) information about financial accounts held by US taxpayers or by foreign entities in which US taxpayers hold a substantial ownership interest.
Mexico signed an IGA with the US Treasury on 19 November 2012 under which Mexican financial institutions are required to report US-owned account information directly to the Mexican tax authority, rather than to the US IRS. The Mexican tax authority will then share that information with the US IRS.
The IGA provides that the United States will reciprocate with the sharing of information.
Mexican tax authorities have issued a set of administrative rules for banks and other financial and related entities to comply with the FATCA IGA.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
Mexican legal entities and legal figures that are financial institutions resident in Mexico or abroad with Mexican branches are required to report financial information of their clients since 2016 in line with the CRS, which was introduced at the OECD level on 15 July 2014.
The CRS obligation to financial institutions in Mexico was included in the 2016 Tax Reform to the Mexican Federal Tax Code, which broadly implies identifying the residency of their clients and the reportable accounts and filing such information to the Mexican tax authorities. In this regard, the Mexican tax authorities will exchange that information automatically with the respective jurisdictions participating in the multilateral exchange of information agreement signed on October 2014 by more than 50 countries. Depending on the particular jurisdiction, the exchange of information was set to start with 2016 data; however, with some jurisdictions, the exchange of information was agreed to start with 2017 and 2018 data.
In line with the above, Mexico started exchanging information in 2017 with respect to fiscal year 2016 and effectively received in the latter part of 2017 information of Spain, Germany, Malta, and the Netherlands, among other jurisdictions, as expressly mentioned by the Mexican tax authorities press releases.
## Investments in Mexico through foreign transparent vehicles
It is relatively common for investors to use juridical figures and foreign transparent entities to structure their investments in Mexico due to several benefits from a corporate governance perspective, mainly in cases of joint investments that involve non-related parties interested in developing business projects in Mexico.
Currently, those investment vehicles are generally treated as vehicles which revenue is subject to a PTR and are not considered as residents for purposes of treaty benefit application, which results in a burdensome taxation from a Mexican tax perspective. To manage such effects, the Mexican tax authorities, through miscellaneous tax rules, have provided look-through taxation from a Mexican tax perspective in certain circumstances, where the tax effects are determined at the level of the members of such vehicles.
Per the 2020 Tax Reform, as of 1 January 2021, foreign transparent entities and juridical figures (trusts, partnerships, investment funds) will be treated as legal entities for Mexican tax purposes; in other words, the look-through treatment would no longer be available at the level of its members. However, if such legal entities or figures are beneficiaries of a tax treaty, such disposition would prevail.
On the other hand, foreign juridical figures, which are considered transparent from a tax perspective in their jurisdiction of constitution, that manage private equity investments in Mexican legal entities will be allowed the application of look-through rules from a Mexican perspective. In this regard, the members of such figures will be taxed in Mexico based on the respective section of the Mexican Income Tax Law they are subject to. The look-through rule included in the Law would only be applicable in the case of interest revenue, dividends, capital gains, or the revenue derived from the leasing of immovable property to the extent the following requirements are met:
In this regard, it is important to analyse on case-by-case basis whether the fund under analysis has a legal personality of its own or not to determine whether transparency may be available.
## Outsourcing reform
On 23 April 2021, the Mexican government enacted a reform that prohibits the subcontract of personnel services and aims for each taxpayer to directly employ its labour force without the intermediation of an in-house or outsource service provider. Only specialised services will be allowed for subcontracting, being those that relate to activities that are not part of the core business or main economic activity of the contracting party. All companies rendering specialised services must register and secure a registry number to the labour authority.
As of 1 August 2021, any payment for the subtracting of personnel, other than those registered as specialised, will not be deductible for income tax purposes, and the corresponding VAT will not be creditable for the payer.
## Business restructuring
### Domestics restructuring
Mexican tax authorities will only authorise the transfer of shares at cost basis for business restructurings where the parties are tax residents in Mexico and belong to the same group. There are additional requirements needed before the registered CPA can issue the tax report.
Whenever the Mexican tax authorities detect during a tax audit that the business restructuring lacks a business reason, or that it does not comply with any of the relevant requirements, the authorisation will be void, and the tax corresponding to the transfer of shares must be paid.
Additionally, taxpayers shall include in their authorisation requests all 'relevant transactions' that are related to the restructure subject to the authorisation and that took place during the five years prior to the request.
Finally, when taxpayers perform a 'relevant transaction' within five years after the implementation of the business restructuring, they must file an informative tax return.
'Relevant transactions' include:
### Cross-border restructuring
In connection with tax-deferral authorisations for cross-border intra-group restructures, the deferred tax will become due whenever the Mexican issuer and the acquirer cease to consolidate their financial statements for accounting purposes.
Moreover, the tax deferral authorisation shall be rendered void when the tax authorities, during a tax audit, ascertain that the restructure or the relevant transactions (*see domestic restructuring above*) related thereto, performed either five years prior to or five years after the restructure, lack a valid business reason or when the tax authorities detect that the exchange of shares results in income subject to a preferential tax regime.
When a relevant transaction is performed during a five-year period after the restructure, the acquiring entity or its legal representative shall inform the tax authorities.
Finally, the tax report prepared in connection with the restructure shall include the business lines and the economic activity of both the issuing and the acquiring entity, as well as certifying that those entities consolidate their financial statements.
### Mergers and spin-offs
If during an audit review the Mexican tax authorities determine that there is a lack of business reasons behind the merger or spin-off or that the taxpayer has not complied with any of the Mexican Federal Tax Code's (MFTC’s) requirements, a taxable transfer of assets will be deemed to have taken place (voiding the tax-neutral effects).
For purposes of the foregoing, the accruable income should be the gain derived from the merger or spin-off.
In connection with the above, the tax authorities may take into account the 'relevant transactions' related to the merger carried out within the five years before or after the merger or spin-off.
In addition, if any of the above-mentioned relevant transactions take place within five years after the execution of the merger, then the surviving entity must report such transaction. The financial statements utilised to carry out the merger or spin-off, as well as the financial statements resulting from the merger or spin-off, should be audited by an independent and authorised CPA. This CPA will prepare a tax report (known as *dictamen fiscal* in Spanish) that should be filed with the tax authorities.

## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Foreign tax relief
An individual resident may derive income from another country, which is subject to tax in that country. The individual may credit the foreign income tax paid against the Mexican income tax liability. However, the credit is limited to the lesser of (i) the amount of foreign tax paid with respect to foreign-source income that is taxable in Mexico and (ii) the amount of Mexican tax corresponding to that income. In addition, no credit is allowed for foreign taxes imposed on income that is exempt from Mexican taxation.
## Tax treaties
Tax treaties may reduce or eliminate tax withholding from non-residents, and the treaty provisions should be analysed accordingly, depending on the country of residence of the individual receiving Mexican-source income.
Mexico has concluded double-taxation agreements (DTAs) with the following countries:
| Argentina | Hong Kong | Peru |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Australia | Hungary | Philippines |
| Austria | Iceland | Poland |
| Bahrain | India | Portugal |
| Barbados | Indonesia | Qatar |
| Belgium | Ireland, Republic of | Romania |
| Brazil | Israel | Russia |
| Canada | Italy | Saudi Arabia |
| Chile | Jamaica | Singapore |
| China | Japan | Slovak Republic |

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
During September 2020, an appeal court decision in Mexico City opened the possibility for foreign individuals leaving Mexico to seek a refund of part of their social security contributions that relate to pension and workers housing. The appeal court decision is a binding precedent only within the Mexico City area, although appeal courts in other jurisdictions within Mexico and the relevant authorities may follow the same criteria.
On 9 December 2020, a reform that regulates and promotes teleworking as a form of labour organisation was approved, establishing rights and obligations for employers and employees. This reform entered into force on 12 January 2021.
On 16 December 2020, a decree was published that amends, adds, and eliminates some tax provisions of the Social Security Law and Retirement Savings System Law. These apply from 1 January 2023.
Starting 1 June 2020, the income tax law establishes specific rules for collecting tax in relation to individuals who provide services via the digital economy as apps for transportation services, short-term rentals, and selling goods and services via digital marketplaces.
As of 2017, the Measurement and Actualisation Unit (UMA in Spanish) replaces the minimum wage in tax calculations, limits, exemptions, etc. as a unit of indexation. The UMA that corresponds to 2025 is 113.14 Mexican pesos (MXN) per day.
On 1 May 2024, a decree was published regarding the employment subsidy, which came into force on the same date. The subsidy amount is determined based on the employee's salary and a progressive tax rate established by the government; such subsidy decreases as the salary increases, and it is credited for the income tax withheld to employees with low-income by reducing their tax burden, as this subsidy is provided to employees who earn a salary below a threshold of MXN 10,171 on a monthly basis for 2025.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Personal deductions
As of 2016, personal deductions have been limited. The general limit for 2025 is the lesser of (i) 15% of the yearly overall income of the taxpayer or (ii) an amount equal to five annual UMA (a maximum of MXN 206,368). Retirement accounts and education expenses are not subject to this general limit and have separate limits (*see below*). Medical expenses will not be subject to this limit provided that the individual has a medical certificate issued by a government health institution.
### Charitable contributions
Contributions made to authorised charities are deductible, limited to 7% of the prior year's taxable income.
### Medical, dental, nutritionist, psychologist, and funeral expenses
Resident taxpayers are allowed to deduct un-reimbursed medical, dental, nutritionist, psychologist, and funeral expenses for themselves and their dependants, as well as health insurance premiums subject to the general limit. Such expenses are not deductible if they are paid in cash.
### Retirement accounts
Contributions to certain special private retirement accounts and voluntary contributions to the retirement accounts of the Mexican social security system are deductible (limited to certain amounts). Withdrawals from these plans become taxable income.
### Education expenses
Taxpayers are allowed to deduct tuition expenses paid for their spouse, children, parents, and themselves. The maximum amount deductible per student varies from MXN 14,200 to MXN 24,500 per year, depending on the level of education. The limits are adjusted annually for inflation. The cost of university-level education is not deductible.
## Standard deductions
There are no standard deductions in Mexico.
## Business deductions
Business owners and independent professionals are allowed to deduct most of the same business expenses as corporations (*see [Deductions](../corporate/deductions.html) in the Corporate tax summary for more information*).
## Losses
A net loss from professional and business activities is not currently deductible against other income, but the tax loss may be carried forward for ten years against professional and business income only.
Capital losses may be used to partially or completely offset capital gains and, in some cases, other investment income but not against compensation, business, or professional income.
Rental losses can be deducted against other investment income in the same year. However, any excess loss cannot be carried forward.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Employment income
Income from personal services (earned income) includes salaries, commissions, and allowances of all types, including those for housing, living expenses, education, foreign service, tax reimbursements, and employer profit-sharing distributions.
Employees are allowed to exclude an amount equal to 30 days' UMA if they receive a year-end bonus (Christmas bonus), 15 days' UMA each if they receive a vacation bonus or participation in the employer's profits, and overtime pay up to five times the daily UMA per week, with certain limitations. These exclusions are taken into account by the employer when calculating the income tax withholding.
Fringe benefits, such as social welfare benefits, may be considered as totally or partially exempt income if the employer satisfies certain eligibility requirements (e.g. non-discrimination). However, the exempt amount of general social welfare benefits is limited to the equivalent of one annual UMA (MXN 41,273.47 [i.e. 113.14 x 30.4 x 12] for 2025). Under no circumstances will the social welfare benefits be taxable if their amount, added to other regular compensation, does not exceed seven times the UMA.
Living expense reimbursements, including housing and rental allowances, are generally taxable as compensation to the employee, even if paid directly to third parties.
Reimbursements of expenses of a spouse or dependants usually represent taxable income to the employee.
Fees paid to members of the Board of Directors are treated as salary income for income tax purposes. Under some circumstances, independent professionals can also elect to have their fees treated as salary income, in which case it will be the payer's responsibility to withhold the income tax from the professional's income and remit it to the tax authorities on a monthly basis.
Non-residents' wages, salaries, and other remuneration for personal dependent services rendered in Mexico are taxed on the basis of income received in a floating 12-month period, as long as the stay exceeds 183 calendar days, consecutive or not, in the mentioned period when paid by a non-Mexican resident.
## Equity compensation
## Business income
All income received by individuals from business activities carried out by unincorporated enterprises and the fees of independent professionals are subject to ordinary income tax rates, and the individuals may deduct their normal business expenses.
Under a tax incentive that applies to the northern border region, a tax credit equivalent to one-third of the income tax payable may be applicable. Certain exceptions apply. The fees of independent professionals do not benefit from this tax incentive.
## Capital gains
Individuals that qualify as tax residents of Mexico are taxed on their worldwide capital gains.
However, gains on sales of securities through the Mexican Stock Exchange are only subject to a 10% tax on the net gain for the year. Shares of Mexican companies traded abroad in authorised exchanges also receive the same treatment, when determined by the Mexican Ministry of Finance to be placed among the general public.
In addition, gains from the sale of the taxpayer’s principal residence are exempt if certain requirements are met. The exemption is limited to the gain corresponding to approximately 244,560 United States dollars (USD) of gross proceeds, approximately. The exemption is limited to only one sale every three years.
Gains on the disposition of real estate property or shares of capital stock receive favourable income tax treatment where historical costs (converted to pesos) may be adjusted (increased) for inflation (on the basis of the number of months the asset had been held). In the case of shares of capital stock of a privately held Mexican corporation, the adjustment also includes amounts intended to partially cover net retained earnings, whether capitalised or not. The resulting net gain for tax purposes is taxed under a formula favourable to the taxpayer, depending on the number of years the asset was held before the sale.
## Dividend income
Moreover, with respect to dividends paid from profits that were generated by the company after 2013, a 10% tax on the net dividend will be withheld by the Mexican company. This tax is in addition to the tax paid with the annual tax return, and it cannot be credited in the return.
Dividends paid by foreign corporations to resident individuals are fully taxable in the annual tax return. In addition, similar to domestic dividends, there is a 10% tax on the net dividend that the individual must pay by the 17th day of the following month. This tax is in addition to the tax paid with the annual tax return, and it cannot be credited in the return.
## Interest income
Interest from the Mexican banking system, except for certain exempt accounts with small balances, is subject to withholding and should be reported in the annual tax return. Except for certain transitional provisions, interest paid on most Mexican government obligations is taxable.
Interest on bank accounts, bonds, and other debt obligations issued by non-residents is fully taxable, and the taxable interest includes adjustments for inflationary losses and exchange gains and losses with respect to the principal.
## Rental income
Resident individuals are taxed on their worldwide rental income. They may deduct actual expenses incurred with respect to the property rented, including depreciation at 5% on the building’s cost, indexed for inflation; property taxes; insurance premiums; maintenance; interest on loans for the purchase or construction of the property (adjusted for inflation); and commissions paid. In order to claim these deductions, electronic accounting records must be provided to the Mexican tax authorities.
Alternatively, resident individuals may elect to deduct a standard deduction, equal to 35% of the gross rental income plus real estate taxes, in lieu of the deduction for actual expenses and depreciation mentioned above.
## Tax haven investments
Taxable investment income includes income earned (even if not distributed) by investments of any kind located in countries considered to be tax havens, in proportion to the ownership percentage of the resident taxpayers. If the taxpayer either does not have effective control of the administration of the tax haven investment or the total amount of the revenues obtained in the prior year does not exceed MXN 160,000, the income does not have to be recognised until it is received. Residents are also required to file a separate report with the tax authorities by 28 February of each year regarding their direct and indirect investments held during the previous calendar year in countries considered to be tax havens. Failure to file the information report is considered a felony. A procedure is established to determine the accrued income.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Taxpayers are required to file a notice of suspension of activities for termination of tax residency in Mexico. The notice should be filed during the 15 days prior to the date on which the change of tax residency will take place. When individuals (or corporations) omit to submit such notice, they will not lose their status as Mexican residents.
A Mexican citizen who moves to a country that is considered a tax haven by Mexico will remain a tax resident of Mexico for the year in which the change of tax residency suspension notice is filed and the following five years, unless Mexico has in effect an information exchange agreement with the country or a tax treaty with an information exchange clause or an international treaty that enables mutual administrative assistance in the notification and collection of contributions.
