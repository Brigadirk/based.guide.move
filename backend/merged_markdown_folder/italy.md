## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## Social security contributions
The social security contribution mainly depends on the employment relationship.
### Employment relationship (staff)
Social security contributions are due by both the employee and the employer.
The Italian employer, in order to pay social security contributions for employees, must register with the Italian Social Security Administration (*Instituto* *Nazionale Previdenza Sociale* or INPS).
The total social security rate is around 40% of the employee's gross compensation (the rate depends on the work-activity performed by the company, the number of employees of the company, the employee's position), and is shared as follows:
In general, only around 33% of the total rate is paid into the National Pension Scheme, while the remaining part of the contribution is paid to the following Social Security funds:
The social security contributions for employees who registered with INPS after 1 January 1996 without a previous social security enrolment in the mandatory scheme or, under certain conditions, in other EU countries are due up to a maximum amount of EUR 120,607 for the year 2025.
Over the cap, only minor contributions (about 5%) are due only by the employer.
### Employment relationship (executive)
Social security contributions due from executives (i.e. *dirigenti*) for the year are summarised below.
A commercial executive is required to make the following contributions:
An industrial executive is required to make the following contributions:
### Self-employment relationship
Self-employed individuals who are not value-added tax (VAT) number holders and are not covered by a mandatory private pension fund must be registered with INPS in a ‘separate social security regime’ (*Gestione Separata Inps*), instituted with Law n. 335/95.
The separate social security regime provides for three different rates:
All the percentages are applied up to the limit established by the law for the year 2025 equal to EUR 120,607.
The percentages due by the self-employed individuals without VAT are:
The payment of the contribution is effected wholly by the company.
For self-employed individuals who are VAT number holders, and who are not covered by a mandatory private pension fund, the percentage is wholly charged to the individuals, and the payment of the contributions follows the same deadline applied for taxes. Individuals, in this case, can charge an amount equal to 4% of the compensation to the customer/client resulting from the invoice for services rendered.
The Budget Law for FY 2023 introduced a specific provision for the individuals who earn self-employment or business incomes.
This provision, so-called Incremental flat tax (*Tassa piatta incrementale*), provides, under certain conditions, a flat tax of 15% to be applied to the portion of income's increases calculated with respect to the three previous years.
From 2024 a specific measure has been introduced to reduce the "litigation" between the Italian tax authority and the taxpayer. The so called CPB (*Concordato preventivo* *biennale*) applies to the individuals who earn self-employment or business incomes.
### Flat tax scheme for self-employees
The flat tax scheme (*Regime* *forfettario*) has been introduced by the Law 190/2014. As a general rule, it provides that the taxable income is determined on a lump-sum basis, a flat tax rate of 15%, the exclusion of VAT, IRAP, and ISA and without the application of withholding taxes (WHTs).
The eligibility for the flat tax scheme is subject to the respect of certain criteria and limits.
The Budget Law for FY 2023 increased the annual income threshold to be eligible for the application of the flat tax scheme up to EUR 85,000 (the limit was EUR 65,000 previously). These provisions remain unchanged for FY 2024 and FY 2025.
The Budget Law for FY 2025 allow the self employees who are eligible for the *Forfettario regime* to have an employment relationship with the same employer. The agreement, which needs to be mandatory signed before the start of the employment relationship, must include a quota of employment (40% or 50% of a full time employee) and a quota of self-employment.
### Collaborators/directors relationship
Generally, collaborators and directors (unless an exemption applies) also have to be enrolled in a ‘mandatory social security regime’ with INPS (*Gestione* *Separata*)
The social security regime is the same as discussed under the self-employment relationship above for individuals who are not VAT number holders.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
Italian VAT (*Imposta* *sul valore aggiunto*) applies to the supply of goods and services carried out in Italy by entrepreneurs, professionals, or artists and on importations carried out by anyone. Intra-community acquisitions are also subject to VAT taxation under certain situations.
The Italian standard VAT rate is 22% as of October 2013. Reduced rates are provided for specifically listed supplies of goods and services, such as 4% for listed food, drinks, and agricultural products, and 10% for electric power supplies for listed uses and listed drugs. Intra-community supplies and exports are exempt from VAT.
Specific supplies of goods and services expressly listed in the law are exempt from VAT (e.g. public postal services, hospital and medical care, education, insurance services, specific financial services, supply, leasing of particular immovable property). Other specifically listed transactions are also out of the VAT application scope (e.g. transfers of money, transfers of business parts).
In the case of a taxable person (VAT number holders), input VAT on purchases of goods and services related to business activity generally is allowed for recovery. Special limitations apply in relation to specific items (e.g. cars, entertainment expenses).
The Italian Budget Law for FY 2024 increased from 5% to 10% the VAT rate for children's products (e.g. baby diapers, car seats, and products for nutrition of infants and toddlers).
The filing deadline for VAT returns is 30 April of the next year.
## Wealth tax on real estate properties owned outside of Italy
The Italian wealth tax on real estate properties (*Imposta* *sul valore degli immobili situati all’estero* or IVIE) owned outside of Italy by an individual who qualifies as a resident for Italian tax purposes has been introduced in Italy.
The IVIE applies on the value of the real estate (i.e. the purchase cost of the real estate property resulting from the purchase act or the market value in force where the real estate is located).
For real estate owned in a European Union (EU) member state and in a country which is a member of the European Economic Area (EEA) that has an exchange of information agreement with Italy, the wealth tax is based on the cadastral value attributed to the property in the foreign country. In instances where there is a lack of cadastral value, the wealth tax is based on the purchase cost of the property resulting or the market value in force where the real estate is located.
The applicable tax rate, starting from FY 2024, is equal to 1.06% (up to FY 2023, the tax rate was 0.76%).
No IVIE is due if the tax is lower than EUR 200; otherwise, the entire IVIE amount is due.
If the real estate properties are subject to a property tax in the country in which they are located, the individual can deduct said amount paid from the tax due in the Italian tax return.
The mentioned wealth taxes will be determined when the Italian tax return is filed.
## Wealth tax on financial investments owned outside of Italy
The Italian wealth tax on financial investments (*Imposta sul* *valore delle Attivita` Finanziarie detenute all` Estero* or IVAFE) owned outside of Italy by an individual who qualifies as a resident for Italian tax purposes has been introduced in Italy.
The taxable base is the value of the financial investments as of 31 December or the end of the holding period. The applicable tax rate is equal to 0.2%.
A change introduced by the Italian Budget Law for FY 2024 increases the IVAFE rate to 0.4% if the financial assets are held in states or territories deemed with privileged taxation identified by the Ministerial Decree of the Ministry of Economy and Finance of 4 May 1999 and subsequent amendments.
It is worth noting that Switzerland is out of the scope of the provision concerning the increase in the IVAFE rate, being no longer included, starting from the 2024 tax period, among the countries and territories listed in the Ministerial Decree of 4 May 1999.
Only for bank accounts, the above-mentioned tax is a flat amount equal to EUR 34.20 for each bank account. This flat amount is not due if the average annual balance of the bank account is lower than EUR 5,000.
The wealth tax will be determined when the Italian tax return is filed.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
A tax on inheritance and donations was reintroduced in October 2006 after a five-year period during which this tax was abolished. The percentage and exemption limits applicable to transfers of money or assets depend on the beneficiary’s relation with the deceased person or donor.
In summary, in case of transfers made in favour of:
Due to the entering into force of the Legislative Decree no 139/2024 some changes have been introduced with effects from January 1st 2025.
## Luxury and excise taxes
The following goods are subject to excise duties:
Excise duties imposed on a product must be verified on the basis of its customs combined nomenclature code.
The tax liability, depending on the products, arises:
The Italian legislation provides for many exemptions with regards to the use of excise goods.
Furthermore, under certain circumstances, a tax refund is granted to the operator who released the excise goods for consumption, if, afterwards, the products are not consumed in Italy.
## Regional tax on productivity
The regional tax on productivity (IRAP) is generally applied at a flat rate up to 3.9%. This flat rate is applicable to the productive activity exercised. The taxable base is the difference between the compensation received and the direct business expenses, excluding any cost of personnel and interest.
With the Budget Law for FY 2022 the IRAP for self employees and professionals have been abolished.
## Stamp duty
Financial investments owned in Italy by an individual are subject to the Italian wealth tax.
The taxable base is the value of the financial investments at 31 December. The applicable tax rate is equal to 0.2% for FY 2025.
This tax is withheld directly by the bank.
In addition, bank statements are subject to a fixed amount (stamp duty) equal to:
## Property taxes on real estate owned in Italy
The Italian Budget Law for FY 2014 has introduced relevant changes to the municipal tax on real estate owned in Italy. The Italian Budget Law 2020 has abolished the *Imposta municipale* *unica* or IUC, which was composed of three different taxes:
In particular:
In order to determine the taxable base of the IMU, a re-evaluation of the cadastral value of 5% is required; this amount is then multiplied by a certain coefficient (it depends on the kind of real estate and generally it is 160).
Specific tax rates provided from the municipality through a specific measure (so-called '*Delibera**Comunale*') must be applied to the taxable base.
The basic rate for a principal abode is equal to 0.5%; the municipality may increase or decrease the basic rate to 0.1%.
The basic rate for other real estate is equal to 0.86%, and the municipality may increase or decrease the basic rate to 1.06%.
The basic tax credit equal to EUR 200 and the children tax credit for a maximum amount of EUR 400 are recognised to the taxpayer.
Pro ration is based on the percentage and the time of possession.
Finally, the TARI can be determined on the basis of the medium quantity and quality of waste produced or by productivity coefficients.
The Italian Budget Law for FY 2021 introduced only for 2021 a reduction of 50% of the IMU due (this reduction is 37.5% for 2022) and a reduction of 2/3 of the TARI for pensioners residing abroad, for a single real estate unit for residential use, not rented or given on loan for use, owned in Italy by way of property or usufruct.
## Taxation of crypto-currencies
The Italian Budget Law for FY 2025 make some changes to the taxation of gains deriving from the sale of crypto-assets.
With reference to the tax period 2025 the applicable flat tax rate is 26%. Starting from tax period 2026 gains deriving from the sale of crypto-currencies will be subject to a flat tax of 33%.
In addition, the Budget Law above mentioned cancelled the tax free threshold of EUR 2,000 per tax period.
As a an alternative, the taxpayer can opt for the "revaluation" of the value of crypto-currencies owned at the beginning of relevant tax period  (e.g. January 1st 2025), assuming, instead of the cost base or purchase value, the value of crypto-assets on that date. The applicable flat tax rate in case of revaluation is 18%.
Its convenience should be evaluated on a case by case.
## Revaluation of lands and shareholdings
The Italian Budget Law for FY 2025 confirmed the revaluation of shareholdings and lands.
The revaluation rules have been changed to regulate the tax regime when fully implemented. Most important changes are linked to the temporal reference terms and to the tax rate of flat tax.
The 1st of January of the relevant tax period is the moment in which the land or the shareholding subject to the revaluation need to be owned.
The 30st of November of the relevant tax period is the deadline to opt for the revaluation and to pay the flat tax.
Tax rate is increased to 18%. The payment can also be made on instalments without the application of instalment's interests.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
A 26% base standard withholding tax (WHT) rate applies on the yields on loans and securities (bonds, shares, etc.) paid by Italian resident entities to both Italian and non-Italian resident investors.
The standard WHT rate, however, may be reduced under the applicable DTTs, EU Directives, or other special domestic tax regimes (such WHT exemptions and reductions are only granted to the beneficial owner of the income).
Interest on government bonds is subject to a 12.5% domestic WHT.
## WHT chart

Notes
1. The actual applicable rate depends on the nature of the recipient. Applicable rates are as follows: 0% applies on loan agreements and ordinary notes when the recipient is a corporation; 26% rate in all other cases.
2. For resident individuals, generally a 26% WHT applies, but there is a grandfathering regime for dividends received by ‘qualified’ shareholders (i.e. holding more than 20% of voting rights or 25% of the share capital, 2% or 5% in case of listed companies) applicable to dividend distributed in 2021 but accrued up to 2017. The rate applicable to 'non-qualified shareholders' is always 26%. Non-residents are always subject to a 26% WHT, irrespective of whether or not they are 'qualified'.
3. The domestic rate applies on 75% of the gross amount of the royalty paid; however, treaty ceilings apply on the gross amount of the royalty paid.
4. Pursuant to the EU Directives and provided that the requirements set forth therein are met, payments of dividends, interest, and royalties made by an Italian company to an EU resident group company can be WHT exempt. Specifically for the dividends, the minimum shareholding requirement (to benefit from this exemption) is currently equal to 10%; for interest and royalties, it is 25% of voting rights; a one-year minimum holding period applies for both.
5. Should the full WHT exemption not apply, 1.2% applies on dividends paid to EU and EEA tax resident corporations.
6. Pursuant to the Swiss EU tax agreement and provided that the requirements contained therein are met, payments of dividends, interest, and royalties made by an Italian company to a Swiss tax resident group company can be WHT exempt.
7. Non-resident persons have the right to obtain reimbursement for up to 11/26 of the withholding effected, upon proof of the actual taxation of the dividends in the foreign country where the recipient is a resident.
8. Provided that all conditions are met, domestic tax legislation is applicable if more favourable for the taxpayer. In a number of circumstances, tax treaties may provide for particular tax rates mainly dependent on the nature of the instruments and on the profile of the recipients/payers. In such cases, the applicable WHT rate must be verified from an analysis of the relevant tax treaty.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## IRES income determination
Specific rules have been released for entities adopting Italian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) rather than International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for Italian statutory financial reporting purposes. These provisions are aimed to align the taxable basis determination rules with the statutory financial reporting (so-called principle of derivation of the corporate income taxable basis from the statutory financial statements).
Therefore, the taxable basis is influenced by the qualification criteria, time-based recognition, and classification in the financial statements provided by the related accounting standards.
The already issued provisions for International Accounting Standards (IAS)/IFRS entities also apply to Italian GAAP adopters, if compatible.
There are also measures aimed at coordinating different items of the tax code in the light of new evaluation and representation criteria introduced by the accounting reform.
## IRAP income determination
For IRAP purposes, relevant income and expenses are those reported in the statutory financial statements. Positive and negative items resulting from transfer of business concern are out of the scope of the taxable basis.
## Inventory valuation
Italian tax law allows the application of all the most commonly used inventory valuation methods: last in first out (LIFO), first in first out (FIFO), average cost. For IRES only, the reference prices used to calculate the written down value of the inventory items cannot be lower than their market prices during the final month of the tax period.
Companies operating in the oil and gas sector are required to adopt either average cost or FIFO for tax purposes.
The 2024 Budget Law has introduced the option to adjust inventories to the actual inventory situation for the tax period in progress at 30 September 2023. The adjustment entails the payment of a substitute tax for IRES and IRAP at the rate of 18%. In case of elimination of inventory in respect of the opening balance, in addition to the 18% substitute tax, VAT is also due. The choice must be made in the tax return related to the fiscal year in progress at 30 September 2023.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are taxable in the tax period in which they are realised, as follows:
PEX applies if all of the following conditions are met:
The third condition must be met both at the time of the sale of the investment and in the three preceding years. The fourth condition must be met since the beginning of the shareholder period, or, if the buyer is a third party, over the five-year period before the disposal. If these conditions are not met, the capital gain realised by the company is ordinarily taxed.
Capital losses arising from the sale or write-down of shareholdings meeting PEX conditions are basically not tax deductible. Likewise, the capital losses realised on sales of non-PEX investments are tax deductible. Specific exemptions are provided for those entities adopting IFRS for Italian statutory accounts reporting purposes.
Specific anti-dividend washing rules provide that where capital losses arise from the disposal of shareholdings that are not eligible for PEX, such losses are deductible only for the part exceeding the tax exempt amount of dividends (*see Dividend income discussion below*) received from the shares in question in the 36 months prior to the disposal.
Capital gains on financial investments generally are excluded from the IRAP taxable base.
From 1 January 2024, capital gains realised by EU or EEA companies and entities, without a PE in Italy, with respect to the sale of qualified participations, having PEX requirements, where taxable also in Italy, are subject to taxation on only 5% of their amount.
## Dividend income
Dividends received by Italian resident companies from Italian companies or from companies resident in countries other than tax havens (i.e. not included in the 'black list') are excluded from the IRES taxable base for 95% of their amount. Conversely, no exemption applies to dividends paid by entities that are resident in tax haven jurisdictions (unless those dividends derive from profits that were already taxed under the Italian CFC rules). There are specific rules for entities adopting IFRS for Italian statutory financial reporting purposes. For such entities, dividends from investments in shares and other financial instruments held for trading are fully taxable.
To avoid the standard taxation on dividend originated by a foreign entity resident in tax havens, provided that certain conditions are met, Italian parent companies may elect a new substitute tax regime (9% to 6% tax rates) on the amounts of profits and retained reserves distributed. For calendar year entities, the substitute tax is due by 30 June 2024 and the relating option is required in the tax return. The payment of the substitute tax allows for an increase of the tax value of the participation when assessing the taxable base for the determination of capital gains.
Dividends generally are excluded from the IRAP taxable base.
## Interest income
Interest income is generally part of the taxable base.
## Waiver of credits
A specific regime is applicable regarding the waiver of credits (e.g. financial and/or commercial) towards the company by its shareholder. In particular, the part that exceeds the tax value of the credit is considered taxable income. Furthermore, the shareholder is required to provide a statement to the company pointing out the tax value of the credit. Without such a statement, the company will have to tax the full amount of the waiver of the credit.
## Foreign income
An Italian resident corporation is taxable on all income whether produced in Italy or abroad. Profits earned by subsidiaries that are resident or located in countries or territories other than tax havens are taxed only on distribution of the relevant profits. Double taxation is, in principle, avoided by means of foreign tax credits.
An optional branch exemption regime is available, which allows Italian companies to exempt from Italian taxation branch income and losses arising outside Italy, instead of the normal regime, which provides for taxation of worldwide income with foreign tax credit relief. This option affects all foreign PEs of the Italian company and is irrevocable. It must be exercised at the time the branch is incorporated and takes effect from that fiscal year.
## Shell companies
Resident companies and PEs of non-resident companies can be qualified as non-operating entities if the average revenues recorded in the current fiscal year and in the prior two years are lower than the amount resulting by applying certain 'deemed return’ percentages to the average balance sheet value of specific assets in the current fiscal year and the two previous years.
The main assets to be taken into consideration are shares and shareholdings, financial receivables, owned or leased real estate, and owned or leased tangible and intangible assets. The value of any assets acquired or sold during the fiscal year must be adjusted according to the ownership period.
These conditions must be checked every year. Therefore, it is possible for an entity to be 'non-operative' in one year and operative in the following year.
The shell company is assessed as having a minimum taxable income for both IRES and IRAP purposes.
For IRES purposes, the taxable income of a non-operative entity is determined as the sum of such values emerging from the application of specific percentages to the book values of the above-mentioned assets.
From FY 2024 the percentage to be applied to the tax base of buildings, participations, and financial credits for calculating the presumed revenues have been halved, as well as the rates for calculating the minimum revenues whereas the operational test has not been passed.
The current IRES standard rate for entities qualified as shell companies is 34.5% (24% plus surtax of 10.5%).
Tax losses generated in a tax period when the company was deemed to be non-operating cannot be carried forward.
For IRAP purposes, non-deductible items have to be added back to the deemed minimum IRES income as outlined above.
These rules are not applicable in the first year of a company’s incorporation. Exemptions from these rules can be achieved:
Shell companies are also subject to limitations in their ability to recover VAT credits.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## Social security contributions
The social security contribution mainly depends on the employment relationship.
### Employment relationship (staff)
Social security contributions are due by both the employee and the employer.
The Italian employer, in order to pay social security contributions for employees, must register with the Italian Social Security Administration (*Instituto* *Nazionale Previdenza Sociale* or INPS).
The total social security rate is around 40% of the employee's gross compensation (the rate depends on the work-activity performed by the company, the number of employees of the company, the employee's position), and is shared as follows:
In general, only around 33% of the total rate is paid into the National Pension Scheme, while the remaining part of the contribution is paid to the following Social Security funds:
The social security contributions for employees who registered with INPS after 1 January 1996 without a previous social security enrolment in the mandatory scheme or, under certain conditions, in other EU countries are due up to a maximum amount of EUR 120,607 for the year 2025.
Over the cap, only minor contributions (about 5%) are due only by the employer.
### Employment relationship (executive)
Social security contributions due from executives (i.e. *dirigenti*) for the year are summarised below.
A commercial executive is required to make the following contributions:
An industrial executive is required to make the following contributions:
### Self-employment relationship
Self-employed individuals who are not value-added tax (VAT) number holders and are not covered by a mandatory private pension fund must be registered with INPS in a ‘separate social security regime’ (*Gestione Separata Inps*), instituted with Law n. 335/95.
The separate social security regime provides for three different rates:
All the percentages are applied up to the limit established by the law for the year 2025 equal to EUR 120,607.
The percentages due by the self-employed individuals without VAT are:
The payment of the contribution is effected wholly by the company.
For self-employed individuals who are VAT number holders, and who are not covered by a mandatory private pension fund, the percentage is wholly charged to the individuals, and the payment of the contributions follows the same deadline applied for taxes. Individuals, in this case, can charge an amount equal to 4% of the compensation to the customer/client resulting from the invoice for services rendered.
The Budget Law for FY 2023 introduced a specific provision for the individuals who earn self-employment or business incomes.
This provision, so-called Incremental flat tax (*Tassa piatta incrementale*), provides, under certain conditions, a flat tax of 15% to be applied to the portion of income's increases calculated with respect to the three previous years.
From 2024 a specific measure has been introduced to reduce the "litigation" between the Italian tax authority and the taxpayer. The so called CPB (*Concordato preventivo* *biennale*) applies to the individuals who earn self-employment or business incomes.
### Flat tax scheme for self-employees
The flat tax scheme (*Regime* *forfettario*) has been introduced by the Law 190/2014. As a general rule, it provides that the taxable income is determined on a lump-sum basis, a flat tax rate of 15%, the exclusion of VAT, IRAP, and ISA and without the application of withholding taxes (WHTs).
The eligibility for the flat tax scheme is subject to the respect of certain criteria and limits.
The Budget Law for FY 2023 increased the annual income threshold to be eligible for the application of the flat tax scheme up to EUR 85,000 (the limit was EUR 65,000 previously). These provisions remain unchanged for FY 2024 and FY 2025.
The Budget Law for FY 2025 allow the self employees who are eligible for the *Forfettario regime* to have an employment relationship with the same employer. The agreement, which needs to be mandatory signed before the start of the employment relationship, must include a quota of employment (40% or 50% of a full time employee) and a quota of self-employment.
### Collaborators/directors relationship
Generally, collaborators and directors (unless an exemption applies) also have to be enrolled in a ‘mandatory social security regime’ with INPS (*Gestione* *Separata*)
The social security regime is the same as discussed under the self-employment relationship above for individuals who are not VAT number holders.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
Italian VAT (*Imposta* *sul valore aggiunto*) applies to the supply of goods and services carried out in Italy by entrepreneurs, professionals, or artists and on importations carried out by anyone. Intra-community acquisitions are also subject to VAT taxation under certain situations.
The Italian standard VAT rate is 22% as of October 2013. Reduced rates are provided for specifically listed supplies of goods and services, such as 4% for listed food, drinks, and agricultural products, and 10% for electric power supplies for listed uses and listed drugs. Intra-community supplies and exports are exempt from VAT.
Specific supplies of goods and services expressly listed in the law are exempt from VAT (e.g. public postal services, hospital and medical care, education, insurance services, specific financial services, supply, leasing of particular immovable property). Other specifically listed transactions are also out of the VAT application scope (e.g. transfers of money, transfers of business parts).
In the case of a taxable person (VAT number holders), input VAT on purchases of goods and services related to business activity generally is allowed for recovery. Special limitations apply in relation to specific items (e.g. cars, entertainment expenses).
The Italian Budget Law for FY 2024 increased from 5% to 10% the VAT rate for children's products (e.g. baby diapers, car seats, and products for nutrition of infants and toddlers).
The filing deadline for VAT returns is 30 April of the next year.
## Wealth tax on real estate properties owned outside of Italy
The Italian wealth tax on real estate properties (*Imposta* *sul valore degli immobili situati all’estero* or IVIE) owned outside of Italy by an individual who qualifies as a resident for Italian tax purposes has been introduced in Italy.
The IVIE applies on the value of the real estate (i.e. the purchase cost of the real estate property resulting from the purchase act or the market value in force where the real estate is located).
For real estate owned in a European Union (EU) member state and in a country which is a member of the European Economic Area (EEA) that has an exchange of information agreement with Italy, the wealth tax is based on the cadastral value attributed to the property in the foreign country. In instances where there is a lack of cadastral value, the wealth tax is based on the purchase cost of the property resulting or the market value in force where the real estate is located.
The applicable tax rate, starting from FY 2024, is equal to 1.06% (up to FY 2023, the tax rate was 0.76%).
No IVIE is due if the tax is lower than EUR 200; otherwise, the entire IVIE amount is due.
If the real estate properties are subject to a property tax in the country in which they are located, the individual can deduct said amount paid from the tax due in the Italian tax return.
The mentioned wealth taxes will be determined when the Italian tax return is filed.
## Wealth tax on financial investments owned outside of Italy
The Italian wealth tax on financial investments (*Imposta sul* *valore delle Attivita` Finanziarie detenute all` Estero* or IVAFE) owned outside of Italy by an individual who qualifies as a resident for Italian tax purposes has been introduced in Italy.
The taxable base is the value of the financial investments as of 31 December or the end of the holding period. The applicable tax rate is equal to 0.2%.
A change introduced by the Italian Budget Law for FY 2024 increases the IVAFE rate to 0.4% if the financial assets are held in states or territories deemed with privileged taxation identified by the Ministerial Decree of the Ministry of Economy and Finance of 4 May 1999 and subsequent amendments.
It is worth noting that Switzerland is out of the scope of the provision concerning the increase in the IVAFE rate, being no longer included, starting from the 2024 tax period, among the countries and territories listed in the Ministerial Decree of 4 May 1999.
Only for bank accounts, the above-mentioned tax is a flat amount equal to EUR 34.20 for each bank account. This flat amount is not due if the average annual balance of the bank account is lower than EUR 5,000.
The wealth tax will be determined when the Italian tax return is filed.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
A tax on inheritance and donations was reintroduced in October 2006 after a five-year period during which this tax was abolished. The percentage and exemption limits applicable to transfers of money or assets depend on the beneficiary’s relation with the deceased person or donor.
In summary, in case of transfers made in favour of:
Due to the entering into force of the Legislative Decree no 139/2024 some changes have been introduced with effects from January 1st 2025.
## Luxury and excise taxes
The following goods are subject to excise duties:
Excise duties imposed on a product must be verified on the basis of its customs combined nomenclature code.
The tax liability, depending on the products, arises:
The Italian legislation provides for many exemptions with regards to the use of excise goods.
Furthermore, under certain circumstances, a tax refund is granted to the operator who released the excise goods for consumption, if, afterwards, the products are not consumed in Italy.
## Regional tax on productivity
The regional tax on productivity (IRAP) is generally applied at a flat rate up to 3.9%. This flat rate is applicable to the productive activity exercised. The taxable base is the difference between the compensation received and the direct business expenses, excluding any cost of personnel and interest.
With the Budget Law for FY 2022 the IRAP for self employees and professionals have been abolished.
## Stamp duty
Financial investments owned in Italy by an individual are subject to the Italian wealth tax.
The taxable base is the value of the financial investments at 31 December. The applicable tax rate is equal to 0.2% for FY 2025.
This tax is withheld directly by the bank.
In addition, bank statements are subject to a fixed amount (stamp duty) equal to:
## Property taxes on real estate owned in Italy
The Italian Budget Law for FY 2014 has introduced relevant changes to the municipal tax on real estate owned in Italy. The Italian Budget Law 2020 has abolished the *Imposta municipale* *unica* or IUC, which was composed of three different taxes:
In particular:
In order to determine the taxable base of the IMU, a re-evaluation of the cadastral value of 5% is required; this amount is then multiplied by a certain coefficient (it depends on the kind of real estate and generally it is 160).
Specific tax rates provided from the municipality through a specific measure (so-called '*Delibera**Comunale*') must be applied to the taxable base.
The basic rate for a principal abode is equal to 0.5%; the municipality may increase or decrease the basic rate to 0.1%.
The basic rate for other real estate is equal to 0.86%, and the municipality may increase or decrease the basic rate to 1.06%.
The basic tax credit equal to EUR 200 and the children tax credit for a maximum amount of EUR 400 are recognised to the taxpayer.
Pro ration is based on the percentage and the time of possession.
Finally, the TARI can be determined on the basis of the medium quantity and quality of waste produced or by productivity coefficients.
The Italian Budget Law for FY 2021 introduced only for 2021 a reduction of 50% of the IMU due (this reduction is 37.5% for 2022) and a reduction of 2/3 of the TARI for pensioners residing abroad, for a single real estate unit for residential use, not rented or given on loan for use, owned in Italy by way of property or usufruct.
## Taxation of crypto-currencies
The Italian Budget Law for FY 2025 make some changes to the taxation of gains deriving from the sale of crypto-assets.
With reference to the tax period 2025 the applicable flat tax rate is 26%. Starting from tax period 2026 gains deriving from the sale of crypto-currencies will be subject to a flat tax of 33%.
In addition, the Budget Law above mentioned cancelled the tax free threshold of EUR 2,000 per tax period.
As a an alternative, the taxpayer can opt for the "revaluation" of the value of crypto-currencies owned at the beginning of relevant tax period  (e.g. January 1st 2025), assuming, instead of the cost base or purchase value, the value of crypto-assets on that date. The applicable flat tax rate in case of revaluation is 18%.
Its convenience should be evaluated on a case by case.
## Revaluation of lands and shareholdings
The Italian Budget Law for FY 2025 confirmed the revaluation of shareholdings and lands.
The revaluation rules have been changed to regulate the tax regime when fully implemented. Most important changes are linked to the temporal reference terms and to the tax rate of flat tax.
The 1st of January of the relevant tax period is the moment in which the land or the shareholding subject to the revaluation need to be owned.
The 30st of November of the relevant tax period is the deadline to opt for the revaluation and to pay the flat tax.
Tax rate is increased to 18%. The payment can also be made on instalments without the application of instalment's interests.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Taxable period
The ordinary taxable period is equal to 12 months. Conformity with the calendar year is not requested. In particular cases, the duration of the taxable period can be different from 12 months (e.g. newly established companies may be allowed to have taxable periods of up to 18 months; companies that are involved in extraordinary transactions [merger, de-mergers, etc.], as well as companies that are liquidated, may have taxable periods shorter than 12 months).
## Tax returns
From 2024, as a general rule, IRES and IRAP returns must be filed by the end of the tenth month following the tax year-end (i.e. October 31 for calendar-year entities).
The filing deadline for the WHT agent return is October 31 of the following year.
## Payment of taxes
For IRES and IRAP purposes, the tax law provides for both advance payments and settlement payments. As a general rule, the advance payments are equal to the net tax liability for the previous tax period and are due during the tax period to which they refer. The advance payments due are equal to 100%.
Advance payments are split into two instalments:
For taxpayers subject to the so-called Synthetic Index of Tax Reliability, please refer to the next paragraph. The advance payments have to be split into two equal instalments.
Settlement payments are due by the end of the sixth month following the tax year-end to which they refer to.
Tax payments should be performed through a specific form to be electronically filed to the tax authorities (i.e. F24 form).
### Offsetting of taxes
Payables and receivables (not claimed for refund) resulting from a return regarding different taxes are allowed for off-setting within a yearly limit of EUR 2 million.
Furthermore, in order to offset tax credits exceeding EUR 5,000, a so-called ‘conformity mark’ affixed by a qualified professional on the related return is required. In addition, there is an obligation to channel the filing of the F24 form through the tax authorities system (so-called ‘*Entratel’*) in case of offsetting tax liabilities with other tax credits.
No offsetting is allowed in case of unpaid taxes resulting from an official payment notice and exceeding EUR 1,500.
From July 1, 2024, a general prohibition on offsetting has been introduced in case of expired tax rolls or enforceable assessments in excess of EUR 100,000.
## Administrative penalties
### For the violations committed as of September 1, 2024
Failure to file a tax return results in a fixed penalty of 120% of the taxes due. Minimum penalties (ranging from EUR 250 to EUR 1,000) are applicable if no tax liability emerged in the return.
A tax return showing either a taxable income lower than the one assessed or a tax credit higher than those owed to the taxpayer (i.e. an untrue tax return) results in a fixed penalty of 70% of the higher taxes ultimately due.
Omitted and/or late payments of taxes, of whichever kind and nature, result in a penalty equal to 25% of the unpaid/late paid tax. However, in cases where the delay is within 15 days, the penalty is equal to 1% per day (up to 12.5%); if the delay is between 15 and 90 days, the penalty is equal to 12.5%.
### For the violations committed up until August 31, 2024
Failure to file a tax return results in a penalty ranging from 120% to 240% of the taxes due. Minimum penalties (ranging from EUR 250 to EUR 1,000) are applicable if no tax liability emerged in the return.
A tax return showing either a taxable income lower than the one assessed or a tax credit higher than those owed to the taxpayer (i.e. an untrue tax return) results in a penalty ranging from 90% to 180% of the higher taxes ultimately due.
Omitted and/or late payments of taxes, of whichever kind and nature, result in a penalty equal to 30% of the unpaid/late paid tax. However, in cases where the delay is within 15 days, the penalty is equal to 1% per day; if the delay is between 15 and 90 days, the penalty is equal to 15%.
### Self-disclosure
Self-disclosure of tax law breaches is allowed by the payment of the higher taxes and reduced administrative penalties (computed on the floor of the applicable range of penalties for the violations committed up until August 31, 2024)*.*
The actual reduction of penalties depends on the time elapsed between the occurrence of the breach and the self-disclosure itself (i.e. different interim thresholds apply). The penalty is reduced from 1/10 if the correction is done within 30 days (for an omitted/lower tax payment only) up to 1/4 (upper floor) if the correction is carried out after the issue of a pre-assessment deed (*i.e. schema d'atto*).
The starting of an audit does not prevent the possibility to amend tax returns or to carry out late tax payments. In any case, the possibility to apply the self-disclosure is prevented after the issuance of final notice of tax assessment (*i.e. avviso di accertamento*) or tax redetermination (*i.e. avviso di irregolarità*).
Special rules apply where similar violations are repeated over various years.
## Synthetic Index of Tax Reliability (the so-called ISA)
Starting from FY 2018, the so-called Sector Studies Assessment (i.e. special tax control procedures for those enterprises whose total turnover does not exceed EUR 7.5 million) has been replaced by a system of indexes to identify and reward reliable taxpayers (now applicable for the taxpayers which total turnover does not exceed EUR 5,164,569).
In particular, the ISA represents an economic and statistical methodology to determine the level of the tax reliability of the taxpayers. A low level of reliability will increase the risk to be included in the list used by the tax authorities in order to select the taxpayers to be audited.
### Advanced biannual agreement (i.e. *’concordato preventivo biennale*’)
Institution of the *’concordato preventivo biennale*‘ by Article 7 of Decree Law no. 13/2024 is an arrangement reserved for (i) taxpayers applying Synthetic Index of Tax Reliability (so-called ISA) and (ii) taxpayers under the flat-rate regime provided by Law no. 190/2014 (so-called ’*forfettari*‘). This consists of the proposal by the Italian Revenue Agency of a forecast, for the following two-year period, of the income from business activity for IRES and IRAP purposes, in order to establish the taxes due in advance.
## Tax ruling
The tax ruling is an instance where the taxpayer directed a behaviour for tax purposes to the tax authority before implementing it; its scope is to seek clarification on the interpretation of a rule objectively uncertain, related to state taxes, to be applied to concrete and personal cases.
The procedure can also be started by non-resident taxpayers, by WHT agents, and by persons in charge of fulfilling the tax payments.
The tax authorities must admit to the procedure within 30 days from the receipt of the instance; however, tacit acceptance from the tax authorities applies. The procedure that involves a contradictory procedure between the tax authorities and the taxpayer ends within 180 days from the receipt of the instance.
The content of the instance could be on the transfer pricing, the application of rules to attribute profits and losses to a PE, the tax treatment of dividend, interest, royalties, or other incomes, etc.
In particular, for those enterprises that intend to make new investments in Italy for a value not lower than EUR 15 million, a ’ruling on new investments’ could be filed, disclosing tax treatment of the investment and all related extraordinary transactions. The tax authorities will be bound not to issue any deed inconsistent with the answers given.
The tax authorities’ answer must be notified within 120 days. The deadline can be extended for an additional 90 days if the tax authorities ask for new additional information.
## Tax Control Framework (TCF) and cooperative compliance regime
In order to promote cooperation between the tax administration and taxpayers, a cooperative compliance regime (so-called '*Adempimento Collaborativo*') has been introduced into the domestic tax system by means of Legislative Decree no. 128 of 5 August 2015.
With the approval of the Law no. 111/2023 for the reform of the tax system and with the enactment of the Legislative Decrees no. 221/2023 and no. 108/2024, additional certainty is granted to companies that intend to invest in transparency with the tax authorities under the cooperative compliance regime. In particular:
In detail, the following new changes have been introduced:
- Exclusion of administrative penalties and no liability for the crime of unfaithful return.
- Reduction of assessment deadlines by two years with certified TCF.
- Further reduction of one year in the assessment deadlines in case of obtaining tax certification (so-called ’strong‘ conformity mark).
To enjoy the above benefits, a TCF certification, issued by qualified professionals enrolled in the register of lawyers or chartered accountants and accounting experts, has been introduced.
For medium-sized taxpayers who do not meet the requirements to apply the regime at hand, but have implemented an effective integrated TCF by giving specific communication to the tax authorities (irrevocable two-year option) and communicated, via tax ruling, the tax risks in a preventive manner before submitting the return or before the tax deadlines, the following benefits are provided:
A Code of Conduct is introduced to define and regulate mutual commitments between the tax authorities and taxpayers.
Joining the cooperative compliance regime is also the first step for taking part in the International Compliance Assurance Programme (ICAP).
ICAP is a voluntary program for a multilateral co-operative risk assessment and assurance process, which gives comfort and assurance where tax administrations participating in an MNE’s risk assessment consider a covered risk to be low risk.
## Tax audit process
For larger companies having a yearly turnover exceeding specific thresholds (that are in the process of being progressively decreased to EUR 100 million), administrative checks on tax returns may be carried out within the year following that in which the tax return has been filed.
Tax audits can take place at the taxpayer’s premises as well as in the tax authorities’ offices. The statute of limitations provides that tax auditors can stay at a taxpayer’s premises for not longer than 60 working days (30 days ordinary term plus 30 days of extension). At the end of this period, the audit must come to an end. Tax auditors must take note of the observations and requests made by the taxpayer. At the end of their audit, the tax auditors must draw up a tax audit report whereby the outcome of the audit activity must be detailed and the findings (if any) must be illustrated and motivated.
Should the taxpayer accept all the challenges raised by the tax auditors, it may take advantage of the application of reduced penalties. The reduced penalties are equal to 1/6 of the applied penalties.
In case the taxpayer decides not to accept the challenges by the tax auditors, a copy of the report has to be filed with the tax office.
The tax office receiving the tax audit report examines the findings reported by the tax auditors and starts the assessment procedure, which may lead to the issuing of a tax assessment notice bearing the request for payment of higher taxes and/or penalties.
## Tax controversy and dispute resolutions
Should the taxpayer accept all of the challenges raised by the tax authorities' tax assessment notice, it may take advantage of the application of reduced penalties. The reduced penalties are equal to 1/3 of the applied penalties.
Should the taxpayer decide not to accept the challenges by the tax authorities, a settlement procedure can be initiated. The favourable outcome of the settlement procedure brings forth the agreed-upon reduction of challenged taxes and the reduction of penalties. The reduced penalties are equal to 1/3 of the applied penalties.
In case no settlement is either achieved or requested for, the taxpayer may start a tax dispute before the Court. The judicial proceedings are structured in three tiers:
The settlement can be reached also during the judicial proceeding. The favourable outcome of the judicial settlement procedure brings forth the agreed-upon reduction of challenged taxes and the reduction of penalties. The reduced penalties are equal to 40% if the settlement is reached during the first instance, 50% if the settlement is reached during the second instance, and 60% if the settlement is reached during the Supreme Court instance.
## Statute of limitations
The Italian tax authorities are entitled to make an assessment in relation to corporate taxes (IRES and IRAP), VAT, and WHT returns up to:
Due to the COVID-19 emergency, the deadlines for tax periods 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 will be extended by 85 days.
Different rules were applicable until FY 2015.
The possibility to file an integrative tax return in favour of taxpayers within the deadlines of tax assessment has been introduced (e.g. FY 2018 tax return is amendable in favour of the taxpayer until FY 2024, FY 2019 tax return is amendable in favour of the taxpayer until FY 2025).
As a response to recent cases of carousel-frauds on VAT, cross-border transactions are being more heavily scrutinised.
Over the last few years, we experienced an increasing focus by the tax authorities on transfer pricing and PE-related issues.
The beneficial ownership condition is very carefully scrutinised in case of payments where a nil or reduced WHT is applied based on EU Directive or applicable DTT, in particular when the ultimate owner of the group is non-EU.
The tax authorities will also focus on intercepting the improper utilisation of contributions and tax credits intended to cope with the economic crisis caused by the epidemiological emergency from COVID-19.
## Tax offences and the entity’s criminal liability: The rules as per Decree 231/2001
With the Fiscal Decree linked to the Budget Law (Decree Law no. 123, converted into Law no. 157 of 2019 on 'Urgent provisions on tax matters and urgent matters that cannot be postponed'), a significant part of the tax crimes, attributable to tax fraud, entered the catalogue of offences for the liability of entities for administrative offences, governed by Legislative Decree no. 231 of 2001 (Decree 231/2001).
Article 39(2) of the fiscal Decree has amended decree 231/2001 by inserting under article 25-quinquiesdecies (sources of administrative criminal liability) the following tax fraud crimes, which are included in Legislative Decree no. 74 of 2000 (Decree 74/2000):
Further legislative changes occurred as a result of Legislative Decree no. 75 of 2020 (implementing Directive (EU) 2017/1371, better known as the 'PIF Directive'), which expanded the category of tax offences provided for in Article 25 quinquiesdecies of Legislative Decree 231 of 2001 with the following types of offence:
The same Legislative Decree no. 75 of 2020 provides that the offences listed above are relevant to the administrative liability of the entity if they are committed as part of cross-border fraudulent schemes and for the purpose of evading VAT for a total amount of not less than EUR 10 million.
The last relevant amendment was made by Legislative Decree no. 156 of 4 October 2022.
It is therefore necessary to update the Organisation, Management, and Control Model (MOGC) to include the tax risks associated with the types of tax offences included in 'catalogue 231'. Procedures must be mapped in the MOGC in order to define roles, responsibilities, principles of conduct, operating procedures, as well as the criteria of conduct that individuals must uphold in order to prevent the commission of tax fraud offences.
The sanctions applicable to the entities, in relation to the commission of the offences, may be both pecuniary and interdictory. Pecuniary sanctions range from a minimum of 400 to a maximum of 500 quotas, with a possible increase of one third in the event of a significant profit obtained by the entity as a result of the commission of tax fraud. Considering the current value of the quotas, the maximum financial penalty applicable to the entity for a tax offence may reach up to EUR 1,032,667.
Interdictory sanctions with a considerable impact may also be imposed. Interdictory sanctions may even be applied as a precautionary measure, including a prohibition on contracting with the public administration and a prohibition on advertising goods or services, as well as confiscation and seizure of the profits accumulated from the tax offence.
## Mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation in relation to reportable cross-border arrangements (the so-called 'DAC 6')
The EU 'DAC 6' Directive, adopted by the Council of the EU on 25 May 2018 and entered into force on 25 June 2018, introduces new rules at a European level regarding the mandatory automatic exchange of information in the tax sector.
In particular, DAC 6 requires intermediaries and taxpayers to promptly communicate to the tax authorities of the member state of tax residence, establishment, or in which they operate, the 'cross-border arrangements subject to the reporting obligation' ('Reportable Cross Border Arrangement' or RCBA), when certain conditions are met.
In this regard, from an objective point of view, two elements are relevant:
Each person, in the role of an intermediary or a relevant taxpayer, with respect to DAC 6 can assume the obligation to report the arrangements that have an impact on its tax position or on its client’s taxation or on the correct application of Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and anti-money laundering (AML) procedures. As a result, DAC 6 requires the prompt interception of potential RCBAs and to proceed with their analysis and, if necessary, report to the revenue agency.
The reporting obligations were scheduled to enter into force as from 1 July 2020 and intermediaries and taxpayers would have 30 days to comply with the reporting obligations.
The tax authorities of the EU member states, on a quarterly basis, will exchange among themselves the information submitted by intermediaries and taxpayers in order to promptly intercept aggressive tax planning schemes and neutralise the distorting effects that they produce on the EU market.
In Italy, the implementation of DAC 6 rules is basically aligned with the EU minimum standard, with the main possible deviation linked to the hallmarks and the relevance for the application of the main benefit test, which considers the taxes due by a taxpayer with a link with Italy (residence, presence of a PE, income sourced in Italy, or economic activity carried out in Italy).

## Overview
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Italy, which is located along the Mediterranean Sea in Southern Europe, became a nation-state in 1861 when the regional states of the peninsula (along with Sardinia and Sicily, the two largest islands in the Mediterranean Sea) were united under the Kingdom of Italy. After the Second World War, in 1946, a popular referendum abolished the monarchy and proclaimed Italy a parliamentary republic.
Italy has a diversified economy, which is divided into a developed industrial north, featuring many private companies, and a less-developed south. The economy is driven in large part by the manufacture of high-quality consumer goods produced by small and medium-sized enterprises, many of which are family owned. Due to its archaeological and artistic heritage, tourism is one of the most important sectors.
Italy is a founding member of the European Economic Community (EEC) and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). It is also a member state of the United Nations (UN), World Trade Organization (WTO), and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

## Value-added tax (VAT)
Italian VAT (*Imposta sul Valore Aggiunto*) applies to the supply of goods and services carried out in Italy by entrepreneurs, professionals, or artists and on importations carried out by anyone. Intra-Community acquisitions are also subject to VAT under certain situations.
The Italian standard VAT rate is 22%. Reduced rates are provided for specifically listed supplies of goods and services, such as:
Intra-Community supplies and exports are exempt from VAT under certain conditions.
Under certain conditions, transactions with taxable persons who usually carry out export of goods are exempt from VAT with right to deduct. The exemption with right to deduction is subject to the following procedures:
The content of the declarations of intent is defined by Act no. 96911/2020 of the Italian tax authorities.
The Italian tax authorities will carry out specific risk analysis and substantial controls with the aim to prevent the release of fake declarations of intent and to invalidate those fake declarations already issued.
In particular:
In case an irregularity is detected, the Italian tax authorities could also invalidate the declaration of intent sent by the usual exporter.
On June 5, 2024, the Supreme Court published the case no. 15679/2024, in which it states that the non taxable regime provided by art. 8, paragraph 1, letter c), Presidential Decree no. 633/1972, is applicable only in the case of transfer of motor vehicles (in relation to which art. 19-bis1, paragraph 1, letters c) and d), Presidential Decree no. 633/1972, provides for a partial deduction of VAT (i.e. 40%), except from specific cases) towards “usual exporters” (within the limits of the “plafond”), can be legitimately applied by the supplier only if the latter is able to prove the client's right to fully deduct the input VAT.
The legal principle expressed by the supreme judges seems excessively strict where it is stated that the non taxable regime can be applied by the suppliers only if they are able to verify and prove the habitual exporter clients’ right to fully deduct VAT on the purchase of the vehicle.
In this regard, although the Italian tax authorities have never yet expressed an opinion on the use of the “plafond” in cases of purchases for which a partial objective non-deductibility is provided, in line with the ratio of the provision, it should be recognized the possibility of a "partial" use of the “plafond” for the deductible part of VAT (in this case, 40%).
In these circumstances, without prejudice to the obligation of the supplier to verify the submission of the declaration of intent to the Italian tax authorities by the usual exporter customer, the verification activity by the supplier as set out by the Supreme Court appears to be particularly onerous (in fact, these would involve substantial controls that appear to be those of the Italian tax authorities).
In light of these considerations, clarifications from the Italian tax authorities are expected aimed, on one side, at better contextualizing the orientation expressed by national case law, and on the other side, at providing clear and practical indications on the procedures that suppliers of usual exporters should implement in order to avoid disputes in cases analogous or similar to the above-mentioned one.
In the meantime, suppliers of usual exporter clients should assess their internal procedures as well as the check currently in place, especially if the type of goods/services supplied fall into a category for which the VAT Law provides for objective non-deductibility, even if partial.
Specific supplies of goods and services expressly listed in the law are exempt from VAT (e.g. hospital and medical care, education, insurance services, specific financial services, supply/leasing of certain immovable property, cosmetic surgery healthcare services only on condition that the therapeutic purposes are demonstrated by a specific medical certificate).
Input VAT on purchases of goods and services related to business activity generally is allowed for recovery. Special limitations apply in relation to specific items (e.g. cars, entertainment expenses) and to companies carrying out both taxable transactions and transactions exempt from VAT with no right to deduct.
The filing deadline for the **annual VAT return** is **30 April** of the following year.
### Cross-border communication
Taxpayers resident or VAT-established in Italy are required to communicate to the Italian tax authorities the data related to the supply of goods and services provided/received to/from counterparts not VAT-established or VAT-registered in Italy, starting from July 1, 2022.
In this respect, Law no. 215/2021, amending paragraph 3-bis of article 1 of Legislative Decree no. 127/2015, provides that the data related to the supplies of goods and provisions of services received/carried out from/in favour of taxable persons not established in Italy (i.e. taxable persons established in the European Union or outside the European Union) must be communicated to the Italian tax authorities in .XML format and transmitted to the SDI (except for the transactions for which an e-invoice or a customs bill is issued and for the purchase of services not exceeding EUR 5,000 that are out of the scope of Italian VAT). In particular, the above-mentioned data will be communicated to the Italian tax authorities within the following deadlines:
Moreover, with reference to the cross-border sales, the Italian resident or VAT-established taxpayers must generate an electronic .XML file to be transmitted to the SDI by using the codes <TipoDocumento> TD01 or TD04 (credit notes) indicating the foreign client as the recipient of the invoice.
On the other hand, with reference to the cross-border purchases, the Italian resident or VAT-established taxpayers must generate an .XML self-invoice/integration document to be transmitted to the SDI by using the following <TipoDocumento> codes:
Finally, with reference to the penalties applicable for the cross-border transactions, please note that article 1, paragraph 1104, Law no. 178/2020 provides that, from July 1, 2022, for the omission or incorrect communication of transactions carried out with foreign counterparties, an administrative penalty of EUR 2 per each invoice is applied, up to a limit of EUR 400 per month. The penalty is reduced by half, within the limit of EUR 200 for each month, if the transmission is made within 15 days from the deadline.
### Electronic invoicing obligations
Starting from January 1, 2019, a mandatory electronic invoicing obligation is in place for the supplies of goods or services carried out between persons that are resident or established in Italy. This obligation does not apply for non-established taxable persons, even if registered in Italy through direct VAT identification or a fiscal representative.
Electronic invoices should be:
Electronic invoicing is also mandatory for business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions, where the supplier has the obligation to issue an invoice, with certain different specifications.
For the transmission of electronic invoices, the taxpayers, upon agreements between the parties, can rely on qualified intermediaries. However, the supplier will still be responsible for the issuance of the invoice in front of the Italian tax authorities.
On an experimental basis, in relation to the transactions carried out from July 1, 2021, the Italian tax authorities should have made available the draft of the following documents:
At the time being, the Italian tax authorities have limited the above to Italian established taxable persons who carry out VAT payments on a quarterly basis and to:
### E-invoicing regime between Italy and San Marino
A mandatory electronic invoicing obligation has also been introduced for supplies of goods between taxable persons established in Italy and taxable persons established in the Republic of San Marino, which is mandatory starting from July 1, 2022.
The invoicing process towards business customers resident in San Marino provides some peculiarities compared to the SDI process currently in force for domestic supplies. In particular:
With reference to the invoices issued by San Marino taxable persons to Italian business customers (with transport of the goods from San Marino to Italy), the e-invoices will be transmitted by the San Marino tax office in electronic format to the SDI, which will make them available to the Italian business customer through a specific IT channel.
### The obligation of the electronic memorisation and transmission of the considerations’ data
The electronic transmission of the considerations’ data is a new fulfilment introduced with the purpose to promote the companies’ digitalisation process and, at the same time, to contrast tax evasion and VAT frauds.
Taxpayers that carry out the activities provided by art. 22 of the Presidential Decree no. 633/1972 have the new obligation to memorise and transmit the considerations’ data, on a daily basis, to the Italian tax authorities.
The main benefits for the taxpayers are the exemption from the obligation to keep the considerations’ book, provided by article 24 of the Presidential Decree no. 633/1972, and the abrogation of some accounting fulfilments, such as the issuance and the storage of the fiscal receipts (i.e. '*scontrini'* and '*ricevute fiscali'*).
The transactions are documented by the issuance of a document, the so-called '*documento commerciale'*.
Specific exemptions have been temporarily provided to certain taxpayers with regards to the activity performed (e.g. banks, insurance companies, and certain kinds of taxpayers who carry out retail trade activities).
With the 2021 Budget Law, the new penalties regime was introduced related to the penalties that might be applied for the violations related to the electronic memorisation and the telematic transmission of the consideration’s data.
With the 2025 Budget Law, it is stated that the operator should ensure the integration and the interaction between the process related to the daily considerations’ registration and the process of electronic payment. Said system’s update should be implemented by the operators within January 1, 2026. Penalties might be applied in case the operators do not comply with the above mentioned provision.
### New VAT treatment of training services
The 2025 Budget Law established the VAT taxability of training services provided to entities authorized to provide labor pursuant to article 4, Legislative Decree no. 276 of 2003 (so called “agenzie per il lavoro”, expressly authorised companies whose activity is temporary work provision, by training entities and companies financed via the so called “bilateral fund” established pursuant to article 12, paragraph 4, Legislative Decree no. 276/2003.
In brief, according to art. 10, paragraph 20, Presidential Decree no. 633/1972, VAT exemption with no right to deduction applies only whether the following conditions are jointly met, i.e. the services:
In the light of the previous interpretative uncertainty of the Law (1), the 2025 Budget Law does not affect the behaviors adopted by the taxable persons in relation to the above-mentioned services performed prior to the date of entry into force of the Budget Law itself (i.e. January 1, 2025), for which no definitive acts have occurred (tax refunds are not envisaged).
For the judgements pending upon the entry into force of the 2025 Budget Law (i.e. January 1, 2025), the possibility of close them is recognized by submitting an ad hoc request to the Italian Tax Authorities and the payment of the higher VAT assessed (only if due), without, therefore, the application of penalties and interest, or with the proof of the payment of VAT by the supplier. It is expected that the amounts already paid while the judgment is pending will be deducted from the amounts due.
(1) As said, the question of whether the said training services were taxable or exempt from VAT pursuant to art. 10, paragraph 1, no. 20), Presidential Decree no. 633/1972 has been widely debated and there is not an univocal orientation in the  jurisprudential cases. In particular, the question of whether the training services were exempt from VAT with no right to deduct input VAT when financed through a bilateral fund pursuant to art. 12, paragraph 4, Legislative Decree no. 276/2003 has been the object of several decisions by the Italian tax courts, which have alternated between positions in favour and not in favour of the existence of the subjective requirement for VAT exemption.
### Thresholds to opt for the settlement of VAT on a quarterly basis
Taxable person can opt for settlement of VAT on a quarterly basis (in this case, 1% interest is due) if the turnover of the previous calendar year has not exceeded a certain threshold at the following amounts (set by the 2023 Budget Law, starting from January 1, 2023):
Please note that the previous thresholds, in force until the end of the year 2022, were the following:
In order to benefit from the above method, an election has to be carried out in the annual VAT return.
For the above-mentioned taxable persons, the 2021 Budget Law introduced a broader deadline for the registration of the output invoices, i.e. within the end of month following the quarter in which the transaction was carried out and with reference to the month of the tax point.
### Marketplaces
In order to contend with tax evasion on e-commerce and reduce the VAT gap, a specific compliance obligation has been introduced in Italy starting from year 2019 for taxable persons who facilitate, through the use of an electronic interface such as a virtual market, a platform, a portal, or similar means (i.e. marketplaces), distance sales of imported goods or distance sales of goods within the European Union.
By the end of the month following each quarter, the above taxable persons are required to transmit certain information regarding the supplies carried out by each supplier via the above marketplaces.
The above taxable persons are responsible for VAT due for distance sales supplies carried out via the marketplaces for which they have not transmitted or have incompletely transmitted specific data mentioned by the law, unless they can prove that VAT was paid by the supplier.
Specific regulation regarding the context of the communication as well as the technical ways of filling has been issued.
Such specific compliance obligations remained in force until the end of June 2021 as long as the new e-commerce VAT package rules, as implemented by Legislative Decree No. 83/2021, came into force on July 1, 2021.
Starting from that date, if a taxable person facilitates, through the use of an electronic interface such as a virtual market, a platform, a portal, or similar means,:
the taxable person who facilitates the supply shall be deemed to have received and supplied those goods oneself.
In this respect, such transactions should be split into two different supplies:
In order to declare and pay VAT on their supplies, the taxable persons who facilitate the supply are allowed to opt for OSS/IOSS special regimes (*please see below*).
The 2023 Budget Law does not indicate a specific date of effectiveness for this new reporting obligation. Also in this respect, it would be necessary to wait for the issuance of the implementing regulations of the Minister of Economy and Finance within 60 days from the entry into force of the 2023 Budget Law (i.e. December 29, 2022).
By implementing the new e-commerce VAT package rules, Legislative Decree No. 83/2021 also transposes in Italy the new OSS and IOSS special regimes.
The MOSS is an electronic system that allows taxpayers who provide TTE services in the European Union to declare and pay the VAT due in all the EU member states in a single member state.
As of July 1, 2021, the MOSS has therefore become an OSS and has been extended to all the following B2C transactions:
The OSS scheme simplifies the VAT compliance obligations applicable for taxable persons that sell goods and provide services to final consumers in the European Union, enabling them to:
In this respect, it is worth reminding that the new legislative provisions abolish the reference thresholds previously in force for the payment of VAT in the country of residence in the context of intra-Community distance sales. With the new regulations, a single threshold of EUR 10,000 is recognised; once this is exceeded, the VAT is applied in the country where the service or sale is to be made.
Moreover, the new provisions also abolish the VAT exemption for goods of negligible value imported into the European Union. Since 1 July, therefore, VAT is due on all the imported goods regardless of their value.
If IOSS is used, the import of low-value goods (with an intrinsic value not exceeding EUR 150) into the European Union is exempt from VAT.
Please note that, since April 1, 2021, on the Italian tax authorities’ website it is possible to register in order to exercise the option for the application of OSS and IOSS special regimes.
The use of the special regimes is optional; however, if a taxpayer exercises the option, it should apply them for all the operations that fall within them.
### Timeline in order to deduct input VAT
A reduction of the time frame for the exercise of the right to deduct VAT has been introduced since 2017.
The right to deduct input VAT may be exercised at the latest with the VAT return related to the year in which the right arises and under the conditions existing at the time of such a right has arisen.
According to the Italian tax authorities' guidelines, *inter alia*, the time from which the deadline for VAT deduction begins to run is set when the following conditions jointly happen:
In practice, a taxpayer that purchased and paid for a service in December 2017 and receives the invoice (dated December 2017) in January 2018 can exercise the right of deduction only from the VAT settlement related to January 2018 and by April 30, 2019 (i.e. deadline for submission of the relevant VAT return). However, VAT deduction must be exercised under the conditions existing at the time of the tax point (i.e. 2017).
Conversely, in case the invoice is received in December 2017, it will be possible to register it by April 30, 2018, but it will be necessary to use a special sectional of the VAT purchase ledger related to 2017; as such, the purchase will be included in the annual VAT return of the same calendar year.
Previously, the right to deduct could be exercised, at the latest, with the VAT return related to the second year following the one in which the right to deduct had arisen.
The Italian tax authorities also clarified that the credit notes as per article 26, paragraph 2, Presidential Decree no. 633/1972 (e.g. following to customer’s insolvency proceedings) have to be issued, and the higher VAT previously paid at the time can be deducted, at the most late, within the deadline for the submission of the annual VAT return re the year in which the right to issue the credit note has arisen. In this respect in the case the right to issue the credit note has arisen during the year X and the related credit note has been issued in the following year (i.e. year X+1) within the deadline for the submission of the annual VAT return of the year X, the above-mentioned credit note has to be included in the VAT settlement of the month of issuance or, at the latest, in the annual VAT return of the same year (i.e. X+1).
Starting from October 23, 2018, the right to deduct input VAT can be anticipated at the deadline of the VAT settlement in relation to the purchase invoices received and registered within the 15th of the month following the one in which the transaction is carried out.
By way of example, input VAT deduction on a purchase invoice whose tax point occurs on January 31, 2019 can be exercised with the January VAT settlement provided that the invoice is received and registered by February 15, 2019.
This possibility is not provided (as already introduced from 2017) for invoices received related to transactions carried out in the previous year. In this case, VAT must be deducted in the year in which the invoice is received.
### **VAT deduction of the transactions costs incurred in the context of leveraged buy-out merger operations (also “MLBO”)**
The Supreme Court, with the cases no. 22608/2024 and 22649/2024, has opened to the possibility to deduct input VAT on the so-called "transaction costs" incurred by special purpose vehicles ("SPV") in the context of merger leveraged buy out ("MLBO") operations. The Supreme Court judges, overturning the constant practice of the Italian tax authorities on the matter (2), have stated that the VAT paid on such costs is deductible since they represent for the SPV preliminary costs to the performance of an economic activity.
Both cases are based on the valorization of the role of the SPV, which, according to the Italian Court, should be considered, rather than as a mere vehicle for the acquisition of the so-called "target" company, in the same way as a VAT taxable person who is preparing to carry out an economic activity relevant for VAT purposes.
Even if the Supreme Court cases’ principle in comment should be welcomed, it is believed that an immediate and generalized application of the same in the varied panorama of MLBO operations may still be premature, exposing economic operators to the risk of challenge by the Italian tax authorities, which has not yet taken any steps back on its orientation on the matter.
(2) See, inter alia, Italian tax authorities’ circular letter no. 6/22016 and Ruling n. 17/2019, on the basis of which the check on whether a subject has to be considered as a taxable person and the right to deduction in the context of MLBO operations should be checked by applying the same principles expressed by the Court of Justice of the European Union in the matter of holding companies.
### European Court of Justice (ECJ) Case no. C-341/22 - Right to deduction and 'non-operational company'
On March 7, 2024, the ECJ issued the Judgement in the case C-341/22 (*Feudi di San Gregorio Aziende Agricole SpA*) regarding the right to deduct input VAT for an Italian company which was deemed 'non-operational' according to the Italian tax Law.
In summary, according to the Italian tax Law, the right to deduct input VAT paid or to ask input VAT for refund may be denied to a company that carries out transactions subject to VAT while not reaching the income threshold provided for by the Italian tax Law at issue, where that company does not demonstrate that objective circumstances rendered it impossible to achieve income higher than that threshold.
With the above-mentioned cases, ECJ stated that the above-mentioned Law provision is not compliant with the VAT Directive (i.e. EU Directive no. 112/2006). In fact, the status of a taxable person, and the related right to deduct input VAT, is not subject to satisfying a particular threshold of transactions and should only be determined according to whether that person actually carries out an economic activity.
### Issuance of credits notes in the case of insolvency proceedings
The right to recover VAT beyond the annual year limit is also applicable in the event of non-payment of the consideration, in whole or in part, by the customer, starting from the date on which the latter has been subjected to an insolvency procedure.
The debtor is considered subjected to insolvency proceedings from the date of the decision declaring the bankruptcy (or the act of compulsory administrative liquidation or the decree of admission to the procedure of arrangement with creditors or the decree that provides for the extraordinary administration procedure of large companies in crisis).
If the consideration is paid in whole or in part, the repayment of the recovered VAT regarding the credit note is due by the supplier.
According to the Italian tax authorities:
The new provisions apply in relation to insolvency proceedings starting from May 26, 2021.
In this respect, the Italian tax authorities, with the Response no. 485/2022, have clarified that, in the case the creditor has decided not to issue the credit note at the beginning of the insolvency procedure but decided to join the insolvency procedure and wait for the declaration of failure of the latter, the taxable person is entitled to issue the credit note with the definitiveness of the unfruitful distribution plan that certifies the definitive non-payment by the customer.
As provided by the Italian Law, the possibility of issuance of credit note at the beginning of the procedure applies also to the procedures regarding the negotiated settlement of the crisis (i.e. ’*composizione negoziata della crisi*‘) referred to in article 23, paragraph 1, letters a) and c) and paragraph 2, letter b), Legislative Decree 14/2019 Code of business crisis and insolvency (i.e. ’*Codice della crisi d'impresa e dell'insolvenza*’).
In this case, creditors who, following the above-mentioned negotiation, have reached an agreement with the debtor with consequent reduction of their credits can proceed with the reducing of the original credit. In particular, the credit note can be issued, starting from the date of the publication in the Register of Companies of the above-mentioned agreement or the application for approval of a debt restructuring agreement, in the event of an unsuccessful outcome of the negotiations.
### European VAT group
The deadline for option is September 30 for VAT groups effective from the following year (in the case the option is elected from 1 October to 31 December, the VAT group is effective from the second following year).
In the main, in the case of election of the VAT group:
There are certain conditions to be met in order to be entitled for the election.
Starting from 23 October 2018, European VAT group rules also apply to VATable persons established in Italy who participate in a Cooperative Banking Group (*Gruppo Bancario Cooperativo*).
The current VAT group settlement regime, which consists of settlement of VAT debits and credits among taxable persons meeting certain requirements in terms of chain of controls, will remain in place.
Via a legislative provision published in 2020, under specific conditions, VAT exemption has been confirmed applicable also for the past and to services rendered by consortia, consortium companies, and cooperative companies with consortium functions (hereinafter 'consortium') towards a consortium member who is also a member of a VAT group, where the consortium is not part of it.
The above-mentioned law also provides for a specific way of calculation of one of the conditions (pro rata of deduction) for the VAT exemption in the case of a VAT group.
### Italian tax authorities’ guidelines in case of a UK VAT group
As a general rule, where either a branch and/or the head office/’sister‘ branch is a member of a EU VAT group, supplies of services from a VAT point of view are relevant for VAT purposes (since the mentioned ’entities‘ are considered as separate taxable persons).
In the light of the evolution of the guidelines of the VAT Committee of the European Commission, the Italian tax authorities clarified that:
1. A VAT group set up in the United Kingdom, after the so called ’Brexit‘, is not the same as a VAT group set up in a member state for the purposes of the application of the VAT Law and, in particular, of the principle expressed in Skandia judgement (C-7/13).
2. In the light of the above, the supplies of services or goods carried out between the two branches of the same legal entity, e.g. branch established in Italy and branch established in the United Kingdom, the latter being a member of a VAT group established in the United Kingdom, are excluded from the scope of application of VAT (i.e. Skandia principles are not applicable) since the VAT group set up in a third country (United Kingdom) is not comparable to a VAT group set up in a member state of the European Union.
### Reporting obligations
In addition to the new monthly communication of the data regarding the purchases and sales transactions carried out with foreign counterparts to the SDI, taxable persons have to submit to the Italian tax authorities, on a quarterly basis, the communications of the periodic VAT balances.
The communications of periodic VAT balances require one to submit electronically to the Italian tax authorities, on a quarterly basis, the summary of VAT balances accounting data (also in case the entity results in a credit position). The deadlines for each quarter are May 31, September 30, November 30, and the last day of February of the following year (in case the deadline is Saturday/Sunday/bank holiday, it is postponed to the first working day that follows).
The communication of periodic VAT balances of the fourth quarter where the relevant data are, alternatively, included in the annual VAT return. In this case, the annual VAT return must be submitted by the end of February of the following year (e.g. the communication of the fourth quarter of 2019 can be avoided provided the relevant data are included in the 2019 VAT return to be submitted by the end of February 2020; the standard deadline of the annual VAT return would be April 2020).
### Service supply rules
Generic services supplied by a taxable person to another taxable person (business-to-business or B2B) are in the scope of the Italian VAT if the services are supplied to Italian taxable persons or to PEs of an Italian non-resident entity.
The specific rules are as follows:
The general rule for services supplied by a taxable person to a non-taxable person (B2C) identifies the place of taxation with the country of residence of the supplier.
Several rules, in addition to the B2B general rules, exist for the following:
In addition, special rules are provided for certain services rendered to final customers established outside the European Union.
In relation to the VAT treatment of cultural, artistic, sporting, scientific, educational, recreational, and similar services, VAT is due in the country where the activities were physically carried out for B2C activities and VAT is due in the country of the recipient for B2B activities other than admission. For B2B services in respect of admission, the place of supply is where the events take place.
### Time of supply for certain services
Time of supply is the time of completion in case of:
In case of periodic or continuous supply of services, the time of supply is the date of maturity of the consideration.
Moreover, the above supplies of services, if performed/received by taxable persons established in Italy continuously over a period longer than one year and if no payments are carried out, even partially, in the same period, shall be considered carried out at the end of each calendar year up to completion of the same supplies.
### Reverse-charge mechanism
According to the reverse-charge mechanism, the obligations related to supply of goods and provision of services carried out in Italy by non-resident taxable persons towards taxable persons established in Italy are fulfilled by the latter. The recipient of goods and/or services has to integrate the invoice received by the EU supplier or has to issue a self-invoice in case of a non-EU supplier and record it in the VAT sales register and VAT purchase register within a defined timeline.
Reverse-charge mechanism also applies to certain domestic supplies between Italian taxable persons (e.g. cleaning, demolition, equipment installation, and completion services related to the buildings). Please note that for certain supply of goods (e.g. supplies of gas and electricity to taxable dealer; supplies of gas and electricity certificates; supplies of mobile telephones), the reverse-charge mechanism is applicable on a temporary basis and on the optional decision of Italy as a EU member state, according to article 199-bis, paragraph 1, EU Directive no. 112/2006 (i.e. so-called 'VAT Directive'). In this respect, please note that the EU Directive no. 2022/890 has just postponed the deadline for the EU member states to adopt the above-mentioned 'optional reverse-charge mechanism' from June 30, 2022 to December 31, 2026. In this respect, Italy has just transposed the aforementioned law provision (art. 22, Law Decree no. 73 dated June 21, 2022).
The application of the reverse-charge mechanism also applies to the provision of services (with certain exceptions) carried out through procurement contracts, subcontracting contracts, contracts of reliance to consortium members, or other contractual relationships however named, which are carried out with the prevalent use of manpower at the client's premises and with the use of capital goods owned by the client or attributable to the latter in any form (the effectiveness of the above-mentioned law provision is subject to the issuance, by the Council of the European Union, of a specific authorisation).
The omitted reverse charge is punished with the penalty for undue input VAT deduction (i.e. 70% of input VAT that could have been deducted for the violations committed from September 1, 2024) in the case the violation is committed in the case of non-existent supplies within a fraud or evasion and where it is proved that the purchaser/recipient was aware of it.
According to the 2025 Budget Law, the reverse charge mechanism is extended to the provision of services carried out through procurement contracts, subcontracting, assignment to consortium members or business relationships characterized by a prevalent use of labor and capital goods owned by the client, rendered to companies that carry out transport and handling of goods and logistics services.
The effectiveness of the provision is subject to the release of a specific authorization by the Council of the European Union. On this point, pending the full effectiveness of the provisions above, the supplier and the client may opt for the payment of VAT on the services rendered to be made by the client in the name and on behalf of the supplier, who is jointly liable for the VAT due. In particular, the option has a three-year duration and is communicated by the client to the Italian Tax Authorities with a specific form that will be approved by the director of the Italian Tax Authorities and made available on the Italian Tax Authorities's institutional website. The invoice is issued by the supplier, pursuant to art. 21, Presidential Decree no. 633/1972, and the VAT is paid by the client, without the possibility to offset. On this point, in the event that the VAT is not due, the right to reimbursement belongs to the client provided that it demonstrates the actual payment of the VAT. The latter would also be subject to the application of the penalty, pursuant to art. 6, paragraph 9-bis, Legislative Decree no. 471 of 1997, payment of which the provider is jointly liable.
### Split-payment mechanism
The split payment is the mechanism provided for by article 17-ter Presidential Decree no. 633/1972 applicable for supplies of goods or services relevant for VAT purposes carried out towards, mainly, the Public Administrations (please note that the Italian VAT Law and specific Ministerial Decrees duly established the list of taxable persons subjected to the above-mentioned mechanism).
According to the above-mentioned mechanism, the Public Administration pays to its supplier the amount net of VAT for the purchase of goods and services, while the relative VAT, quoted in the invoice issued by the supplier, is paid directly to the Treasury by the Public Administration itself.
Italy is authorised by EU Council to continue to apply the split payment mechanism until 30 June 2026 but, starting from July 1, 2025, the split payment regime will not be applied to the transactions carried out towards companies listed on the stock exchange that are included in the Financial Times Stock Exchange Milano Indice di Borsa (‘FTSE MIB’) index (and quoted yearly in the Italian Official Gazette). Therefore, for the period July 1, 2025 to June 30, 2026, split payment mechanism will apply to the transactions carried out towards public administrations and companies controlled by public administration according to article 2359 of the Civil Code.
### VAT credit offset with other taxes
To offset a VAT credit against other taxes for an amount higher than EUR 5,000, it is necessary to wait until the 16th day of the month following the filing of the yearly VAT return on which the credit is shown.
The threshold to offset tax credits (including VAT) with other taxes or social contributions, via the F24 form, or through simplified tax refund procedure, has been increased up to EUR 2 million (FY 2022 Budget Law).
Furthermore, in order to avoid abuse, taxpayers intending to offset a VAT credit for an amount higher than EUR 5,000 are required to ask their tax advisors or auditors to affix their signature to the VAT return, which is known as the ‘conformity mark’ (i.e. *visto di conformità*).
Further restrictions for the offsetting of the credits with other tax debits have been introduced (2024 Budget Law). In particular, the offset is prevented for taxable persons who have to pay taxes due for committed violations (so-called '*iscrizione a ruolo*') or executive tax assessment entrusted to the Revenue Agency for amounts in total exceeding EUR 100,000 (for which the payment terms expired and payments are still due or the payment is not suspended).
With the Circular Letter no. 16/E, dated June 28, 2024 , the Italian tax authorities provided clarifications regarding, inter alia, changes in the procedure of tax credit offset according to article 17, Legislative Decree no. 241/1997.
In particular, it has been introduced the general obligation to use only the telematic services provided by the Italian tax authorities (i.e., through the submission of the F24 form) for all payments carried out by offsetting debits with tax credits, of any nature and amount, starting from July 1, 2024.
In more detail, the obligation to carry out the payments referred to in article 17, Legislative Decree no. 241/1997, exclusively through the electronic services provided by the Italian tax authorities, has been introduced also in the case where, after the offset, a balance is still due (before the change, the obligation to use the mentioned electronic services was just in the case of zero balance, after the offset). Moreover, the Circular Letter clarified that the offset subject to the above mentioned obligation is not just those between different taxes, according article 17, Legislative Decree no. 241/1997 (i.e., “compensazione orizzontale”), but also the offset between the same type of tax (i.e. “compensazione verticale”).
From a first reading of the Circular Letter, the extension of the obligation also to the so called “compensazione verticale” does not seem to be perfectly in line with the legislative provision. Having said that, following the Italian tax authorities’ guidelines, the payments of VAT debts, resulting from monthly and quarterly settlements done, from July 1, 2024, even partially, through the offset with an annual/quarterly VAT credit (accrued prior to the accrual of said VAT debt), must be made exclusively through the electronic submission of the F24 model.
So, in the case of  offset of  the VAT credit resulting from the annual VAT return 2024 (related to 2023), which has not been included in the periodic VAT settlements prior to July 1, 2024,  with a VAT debt, relating to monthly VAT settlements from June to December 2024, must be shown in F24. The same applies to quarterly VAT credits emerging from VAT TR models (forms related to the quarterly VAT credit asked for refund/to be offset).
### Provisions to prevent the opening of fictitious Italian VAT numbers
The 2023 Budget Law provides for some measures to prevent the opening of fictitious Italian VAT numbers. More in detail, the Italian tax authorities have the task of carrying out specific analysis of the risk related to the issue of new Italian VAT numbers, at the end of which it may invite the taxable person to appear in person to produce the compulsory accounting records required by the Italian VAT Law to verify the actual activity carried out and to demonstrate the absence of the identified risk profiles. Should the taxable person fail to appear or should the outcome of the checks on the documents produced be negative, the Italian tax authorities may decide to terminate the Italian VAT number.
The application for an Italian VAT number may subsequently be submitted by the same person, as an individual entrepreneur, self-employed person, or legal representative of a company, association or entity, with or without legal personality, set up after the termination of the VAT number. However, this requires the prior issuance of a surety policy or bank guarantee for an amount of no less than EUR 50,000 with a duration of three years from the date of issue.
The 2023 Budget Law has introduced the provision of an administrative penalty of EUR 3,000 to be applied at the same time as the above-mentioned termination of the VAT registration, without the possibility of applying penalty reduction (so-called *'cumulo giuridico*’).
### Checks on VAT registration numbers
There are certain checks that the Italian tax authorities have to carry out in relation to the attribution of a VAT number to taxable persons, such as:
In particular, the Italian tax authorities will carry out specific risk analyses on VATable persons, following which, the taxpayer may be invited to appear at the offices to show their accounting records. If the taxpayer does not comply with the above-mentioned request or does not provide the elements suitable for demonstrating the non-existence of the risk profiles, the Italian tax authorities’ office in charge notifies the provision of termination of the VAT number together with the penalties.
The recipient of the provision can subsequently request the attribution of a new VAT number, only upon presentation of a bank guarantee in favour of the Italian tax authorities for a period of three years and for an amount, in any case, not less than EUR 50,000.
### **Warranty obligation for fiscal representatives and non-EU taxpayers intending to carry out intra-EU transactions in Italy**
With two new ministerial decrees dated 4th and 9th December 2024, the Ministry of Finance has implemented the new obligations introduced by legislative decree No. 13 of February 12th, 2024.
In implementation of the new paragraph 7 quater of Art. 35 of d.P.R. 633/72 (“VAT Decree”) and the new phrase of paragraph 3 of Art. 17 of the VAT Decree, those intending to assume the role of fiscal representative of foreign entities not established for VAT purposes in Italy must jointly:
1. possess the personal integrity requirements indicated by Art. 8, para. 1, lett. a), b), c) and d) of Ministerial Decree no. 164 of May 31th, 1999;
2. submit to the competent Provincial Directorate of the Italian tax authorities on the basis of the fiscal domicile of the fiscal representative (hereinafter referred to as “competent PD”) a notarial deed pursuant to Arts. 46 and 47 of Presidential Decree 445/2000, aimed at attesting the existence of the aforementioned personal integrity requirements;
3. personally provide an appropriate guarantee to the competent PD if they intend to represent multiple entities;
4. verify the completeness of the documentation and information set produced by the represented entity established outside the EU, in order to include their VAT number in the VIES database, and its corresponding accuracy to the information in their possession.
5. Fiscal representatives who meet the requirements of integrity and have provided adequate guarantee will be available for consultation on the Italian tax authorities’ website.
Fiscal representatives who, on the contrary, do not fulfill the new guarantee obligations are subject to an administrative penalty ranging from 3,000 euros to 50,000 euros, without the possibility of applying the legal cumulation.
The guarantee referred to in point sub. 3 must be personally submitted by the fiscal representative and must meet the following requirements:
Furthermore, with the ministerial decree of December 4, 2024, the Ministry of Finance has outlined the criteria and methods for issuing the guarantee that non-EU taxable persons – identified in Italy through a fiscal representative as per Art. 17, paragraph 3, of the VAT Decree – must present in order to include their VAT number in the VIES database to carry out intra-EU transactions in Italy.
This guarantee must be presented directly by the non-EU entity or through their fiscal representative to the competent DP and must meet the same formal requirements mentioned above for the fiscal representative’s guarantee. In this case, the minimum amount to be guaranteed must be equal to 50,000.00 euros for a minimum duration of 36 months from the date the guarantee is submitted (after which - even in this case - it does not need to be resubmitted).
On this matter, both the Italian tax authorities and the Italian financial police will jointly conduct specific risk analyses aimed at identifying the fiscal representatives of non-EU entities that present indicators of risk regarding the proper fulfillment of obligations to verify the completeness and accuracy of documents produced by the foreign entity.
For both changes to become operational, it is still necessary to wait for the issuance of two provisions by the Director of the Italian tax authorities, who has been entrusted with the operational aspects.
Finally, it is worth noting that the changes will also apply to fiscal representatives and non-EU entities (which carry out intra-EU transactions) even before the entry into force of the regulation and that they will continue to operate in the same manner. Indeed, the fiscal representatives, who will act as such on the date of publication of the relevant operational measure, will be required to submit the declaration of notarial deed and the guarantee within 60 days from that date, under penalty of termination of the VAT number of the foreign subject. Similarly, non-EU subjects who, on the date of publication of the relevant operational measure, are already included in the VIES, will be required to present the guarantee within 60 days from that date, under penalty of exclusion from the aforementioned database.
### **Secondment of staff - taxable for VAT purposes from January 1, 2025**
Secondment of staff occurs when an employer, to satisfy their own interest, temporarily makes one or more employees available to another entity for the execution of a specific work activity (art. 30, paragraph 1, Legislative Decree no. 276/2003).
From January 1, 2025, the VAT treatment of secondments of staff will undergo significant changes.
As a result of art. 16-ter, Decree-Law no. 131/2024 (added by conversion law no. 166/2024), the current reference legislative provision, i.e., art. 8, paragraph 35, Law no. 67/1988, will be repealed starting from personnel loans and secondments stipulated or renewed from January 1, 2025.
According to art. 8, paragraph 35, Law no. 67/1988, “loans or secondments of staff for which only the reimbursement of the related cost is paid are not considered relevant for VAT purposes.”  As clarified by the United Sections of the Court of Cassation in judgment no. 23021/2011, this legislative provision applies only in cases where the amount paid by the seconding party exactly corresponds to the wages and social security charges of the seconded personnel, which are legally borne by the seconding party.
Regarding the compatibility of the aforementioned article with Directive 2006/112/EC (hereinafter “VAT Directive”), the European Court of Justice (hereinafter “CJEU”) intervened with the judgment of March 11, 2020, in case C-94/19, San Domenico Vetraria (hereinafter “San Domenico Vetraria judgment”). In this judgment, the EU judges ruled that a national legislation under which loans or secondments of staff from a parent company to its subsidiary, for which only the reimbursement of the related cost is paid, are not considered relevant for VAT purposes, is not compliant with the VAT Directive. This is provided that the amounts paid by the subsidiary to the parent company and such loans or secondments are mutually conditional. The EU judges referred to the referring court to verify this circumstance. The repeal of the mentioned article followed discussions with European institutions to avoid an infringement procedure for failure to implement the aforementioned CJEU judgment.
The new legislation stipulates that secondments and loans of staff stipulated or renewed from January 1, 2025, will be taxable for VAT purposes, regardless of whether the seconding company pays an amount equal to, less than, or greater than the personnel cost. The repeal of the legislative on secondments presents interpretative and practical application uncertainties.
One aspect concerns the determination of the VAT taxable base for secondments and personnel loans.
### Another aspect to consider concerns the effective date of the repeal of the mentioned art. 8. It is provided that the legislative provision is considered repealed for personnel loans and secondments stipulated or renewed from January 1, 2025. There is no reference to the execution of supplies, provided by art. 6, Presidential Decree no. 633/1972. In the past, regarding new legislative provisions whose entry into force was linked to the stipulation or renewal of the contract, the Italian tax authorities clarified that the changes applied also with reference to renewals – both express and tacit – as well as extensions that occur after the aforementioned date of December 31, 2015, even if referring to contracts concluded between the parties before that date. For the purpose of identifying, from a temporal perspective, the applicable discipline, reference is made to the date of stipulation, renewal, or extension of the contracts in question.
### Sale and lease back: clarification on VAT treatment by the Italian authorities
With Resolution no. 3 of February 3, 2023, the Italian tax authorities have provided guidelines on the VAT treatment to apply on the sale and lease back agreement, that is a sale agreement with a lease back.
In brief, the Italian tax authorities have stated that some elements of the contractual arrangements may constitute significant indices in order to evaluate the transaction for VAT purposes as a supply of goods or rather as a purely financial operation.
In particular, for example, the following are indicative of an exclusively financial nature of the transaction:
The qualification of the sale and lease back must, therefore, be left to the interpreter according to a case-by-case approach.
### Italian tax authorities Circular no. 30 of October 27, 2023: first considerations on the VAT treatment of crypto-assets
The Italian tax authorities have provided some comments on the VAT treatment of crypto-assets, although not regulated by the aforementioned Finance Law.
As a preliminary remark, the Italian tax authorities have recalled the fact that there is a lack of a specific VAT legislation at the domestic and EU level and the necessity, for the time being, to refer to international best practice and guidelines at the European level.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, without claiming to be exhaustive, the Italian tax authorities have anyway provided more comprehensive guidelines compared to previous clarifications. A case-by-case analysis remains necessary whenever the actual cases and the characteristics of each case do not correspond to the categories of instruments already known and for which an assessment has already been made by the Italian tax authorities.
### Reporting obligations for payment service providers with reference to cross-border payment (CESOP)
On November 3, 2023, a new reporting obligation has been introduced for payment service providers in relation to cross-border transactions.
These new obligations are part of the European Union's action plan to fight VAT fraud in e-commerce.
Please see below a summary of the new obligations as well as the highlights of the implementation of the CESOP Directive in Italy.
A EU platform called Central Electronic System of Payment information (hereinafter, ’CESOP‘) has been created for the reporting and storage of cross-border payment information and for the further processing of such data by member states’ anti-fraud officers. The data will be made available to the local tax authorities under specific conditions, in line with current data protection legislation.
The new obligations require payment service providers (PSPs) to (i) transmit on a quarterly basis certain data on cross-border payments to the tax authorities of the relevant member states, starting from those made from January 1, 2024, as well as (ii) store the relevant data for a period of three years starting from the end of the year in which the original payments were carried out.
Having received the data from the PSPs, the Italian tax authorities transmit them to CESOP by the tenth day of the second month following the end of the reporting period.
#### CESOP Directive in Italy
The ’entities in scope‘ of the new obligations are the PSPs as defined pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 11 of 27 January 2010 (implementing in Italy PSD Directive), i.e. ’electronic money institutions and payment institutions, as well as credit institutions, Poste Italiane S.p.A. [Italian post office institutions, which are entitled under national law to provide payment services], the European Central Bank, national central banks, national and local public bodies when not acting in their capacity as monetary authority, or other public authorities’.
The obligation to report the cross-border data is triggered when a PSP processes more than 25 cross-border payments towards the same payee during a calendar quarter.
Cross-border payments data for which Italy is the ’member state of origin‘ of the PSP (i.e. the member state in which a PSP has requested and obtained its payment licence, which may be the member state in which the PSP has its registered office or head office) must be reported to the Italian tax authorities. In the event that a PSP operates in different member states, other than the member state of origin, the data of the cross-border payments for which Italy is the ’host member state‘ (i.e. any member state, other than the member state of origin, in which the PSP is providing payment services either via an agent, a branch or directly) must be reported to the Italian tax authorities.
This reporting will take place on a quarterly basis starting from January 2024 and will require PSPs to submit the data to the local tax authorities of the member states of origin or of the host member state at the latest by the end of the month following the calendar quarter to which the data refers.
With specific reference to the obligation to store the data of the cross-border payments subject to transmission, as anticipated, they must be stored for a period of three years starting from the end of the year in which the original payments were carried out.
The documents/information that PSPs will need to store are:
Moreover, the Implementing Decree specifies the penalties applicable in case of violation of the report/storage obligations. In particular:
## Registration tax
Specific deeds and contracts must be filed with the local registration tax office either upon signature or if specific circumstances occur, and the relevant tax must be paid.
Depending on the nature of the contract and on the assets that are the object of the contract, as well as on the form of the contract, registration tax is levied as a fixed amount or as a percentage of the value of the goods and/or rights that are the object of the contract. As a general rule, no proportional registration tax is due in the case of transactions subject to VAT.
## VAT and registration tax on lease of immovable properties
Leases of residential and commercial buildings, or portions thereof, generally are exempt from VAT with no right to deduction and subject to the registration tax at a 2% or 1% rate.
Different VAT rates, VAT treatment, and registration tax treatment apply depending on the type of buildings the lease refers to (e.g. residential, commercial buildings) and the supplier (e.g. individual, construction companies, taxable persons other than construction companies).
Specific rules apply in case of financial leases of residential and commercial buildings from a registration tax perspective.
## Customs duties
The correct classification of the goods is one of the most important issues to consider when an economic operator introduces goods in Italy. A wrong classification can give rise to the application of higher customs duties, and the operator could face a tax burden not due, or to the application of lower customs duties, and this situation could lead to a tax assessment by the Italian Customs Authority.
In determining whether the transaction value is acceptable, the fact that the buyer and the seller are related is not, in itself, sufficient for considering the transaction value as not acceptable. Where necessary, the circumstances surrounding the sale are examined, and the transaction value is accepted if the relationship did not influence the price.
The price actually paid or payable is the total transaction amount paid for the imported goods and includes all payments made as a condition of sale of the imported goods by the buyer to the seller or by the buyer to a third party to satisfy an obligation of the seller.
In determining the customs value, the following items shall be added to the price, to the extent that they are incurred by the buyer and are not included in the price (list not exhaustive):
At the same time, provided that they are shown separately from the price actually paid or payable, the following items shall not be included in the customs value (list not exhaustive):
A reduced or zero rate of duty at importation can be applied when the goods imported have a preferential origin. The preferential origin depends on the existence of commercial agreements between the European Union and other non-EU states or by facilities provided by the European Union to non-EU states unilaterally.
The application of a reduced or zero rate of duty can even depend on the existence of preferential tariff treatment or on the existence of a particular exemption provided by law for some kind of goods.
Any person may appoint a representative in one's dealings with the Customs Authority to perform the activities and formalities laid down by customs rules. Such representation may be direct, in which case the representative shall act in the name and on behalf of another person, or indirect, in which case the representatives shall act in one's own name but on behalf of another person.
For direct representation, a forwarding agent, holder of a particular licence, must be appointed.
The representative must be established within the European Union.
### Re-engineering of the electronic import clearance system
As of November 30, 2022, the Italian Customs Authority, as part of the re-engineering project of the electronic import clearance system, announced the definitive dismissal of the IM message in favour of the new telematic tracks for the transmission of the customs declarations.
The implementation of the above-mentioned telematic tracks means that the customs declaration is originated by the exchange of data through electronic messages, thus removing the necessity and also the possibility of getting the Single Administrative Document (i.e. SAD).
In order to register the transaction in the VAT ledgers and deduct the relevant import VAT, operators must therefore download a new document from their reserved area on the Italian Customs Authority website called *’prospetto di riepilogo ai fini contabili*‘. This document is in PDF format.
As clarified by the Italian Tax Authority with the Ruling no. 417/2022, documents other than the *’prospetto di riepilogo ai fini contabili*‘(e.g. ‘courtesy documents‘ issued by forwarding agents or customs brokers) cannot be used in this respect.
### **Re-engineering of the electronic export clearance system**
As from December 2, 2024, the Customs Authority, as part of the re-engineering project for the export clearance IT system, has implemented new telematic formats for the transmission of the export customs declarations.
## Excise duties
The following goods are subject to excise duties:
The subjection of a product to excise duties has to be verified on the basis of its customs combined nomenclature code.
The tax liability, depending on the products, arises:
As a general rule (with exception of natural gas and coal, coke, and lignite), with reference to excise goods released for consumption during a month, the payment of the relative excise duties has to be made by the 16th day of the following month.
With reference to excise goods imported, customs rules are applied as far as the procedure and terms of payment are concerned.
The production, processing, and holding of 'excise goods', except from natural gas, coal, coke, lignite, and electric power, are subject to a suspensive regime performed through a fiscal warehouse.
In order to manage a fiscal warehouse, it is necessary to acquire a licence issued by the Italian Customs Authority, and there are specific obligations for the owner of a fiscal warehouse (e.g. provide for a particular guarantee, keep a particular accounting system for the goods stored, be subject to controls performed by Italian Customs Authority, where requested).
The Italian legislation provides for many exemptions with regards to the use of 'excise goods'.
Furthermore, under certain circumstances, a tax refund is granted to the operator who released for consumption if, afterwards, the products are not consumed in Italy.
## Plastic tax and sugar tax
The 2020 Budget Law introduced a new tax on the utilisation, event partial, of single-use plastic items or ’MACSI‘ (‘plastic tax‘), which have or are intended to have the function of containing, protecting, handling, or delivering goods or food products (e.g. plastic bottles, bags, and trays for food), even in sheet, film, or strip shape.
The tax does not apply to compostable MACSIs, as well as to medical devices and plastic containers used to contain and protect medicinal drugs.
The taxable amount of the new tax is fixed at EUR 0.45 per kilogram of plastic material contained in the MACSI.
The 2020 Budget Law also introduced a new tax on sweetened beverages (‘sugar tax’). Notably, the tax applies to finished products and those prepared to be used as such after dilution, falling within the headings of NC 2009 (fruit juices, vegetables, and legumes) and 2202 (water with added sugar or other sweeteners or flavouring, and other non-alcoholic beverages) of the EU combined nomenclature, put up for sale, intended for human food consumption, obtained by adding sweeteners, and having an alcoholic strength of less than or equal to 1.2% by volume.
The taxable amount of the new tax is fixed, respectively, at EUR 10 per hectolitre for finished products and at EUR 0.25 per kilogram for products intended to be used as such after dilution.
An exemption applies to sweetened beverages if the overall content of sweeteners is less than or equal to, respectively, 25 grams per litre for finished products, or 125 grams per kilogram for products intended to be used as such after dilution.
The Law no. 67, dated May 23, 2024, provided for the deferral of the plastic tax to July 1, 2026 and of the sugar tax to July 1, 2025.
## Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)
Regulation EU 2023/956 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 May 2023 introduced the so-called ’Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism’ (CBAM).
Starting October 1, 2023, the CBAM applies to import of the following product groups to the European Union from non-EU countries:
The CBAM does not apply to goods originating in the following countries:
In the transitional period starting October 1, 2023, there are requirements for quarterly reporting of embedded greenhouse gas emissions of products imported to the European Union, with the first reporting to be submitted by January 31, 2024.
In the CBAM definitive period starting January 1, 2026, only the ’authorised CBAM declarants‘ would be allowed to import the CBAM products to the European Union.
In the definitive period, there would be more obligations in relation to CBAM, including purchasing certificates, verification of greenhouse gas emissions data, and submission of annual declaration.
The price of CBAM certificates would be linked to the carbon prices at the EU ETS.
## Stamp duty taxes
Stamp duty taxes (*Imposta di Bollo*) apply on a certain list of deeds or documents provided for by the relevant law provision (e.g. checks, bills of exchange, statements of account, certificates, books of account, deeds of transfer of quotas, and, in some specific cases identified by the Law, invoices).
According to the kind of deed, stamp duty tax is due upon the deeds’ origin or in case of use (e.g. if the deed is filed to the Italian Registration Office). Moreover, it can be a fixed amount or as an amount proportional to the value of the deed or document.
Stamp duty tax can be paid:
Even considered the mandatory electronic invoicing obligation for the supplies of goods or services carried out between persons that are resident or established in Italy, there are specific ways of payments of stamp duty tax.
Stamp duty tax is usually alternative to VAT; however, in case of considerations partially subject to VAT and partially not subject to VAT, the invoice is subject to stamp duty tax if the total amount of the considerations not subject to VAT exceeds EUR 77.47. Moreover, some transactions are stamp duty tax exempted (e.g. inter-Community supply of goods). For transactions that are exempted from VAT (with restriction on VAT credit) and for transactions out of scope of VAT, exceeding EUR 77.47, an amount of EUR 2 is due as stamp duty tax for each issued invoice.
For electronic invoices sent to SDI, the stamp duty must be paid quarterly on the basis of the calculations provided by the Italian tax authorities.
The Italian tax authorities will make available, within the reserved area *Fatture e Corrispettivi* of the Tax Box (*Cassetto Fiscale*), a payment service and an F24 draft with the indication of the stamp duty to be paid (determined on the basis of the amount indicated in the field 2.1.1.6 '*DatiBollo'* of the .XML invoice).
The 2021 Budget Law provides that for the payment of stamp duty tax on e-invoices and other documents submitted through the SDI, the taxpayer who provides the goods or services is jointly and severally liable, even where the invoice is issued by a third party.
The Italian tax authorities, through Act no. 34958/2021, introduced important changes related to the settlement of stamp duty on e-invoices. In particular, the new provisions concern:
## Unified municipal tax (*Imposta Unica Comunale* or IUC)
The IUC is composed of the following different taxes:
For the '*Imposta Municipale Unica* (IMU)' is provided:
## Financial Transaction Tax (FTT)
Italian FTT applies to (i) cash equities, (ii) derivatives, and (iii) high-frequency trading transactions.
Cash equities FTT applies to the purchase of shares and other equity instruments issued by Italian companies, as well as securities (wherever issued) tracking those Italian shares (e.g. ADRs). The taxable base is the net daily balance of transactions on the same financial instruments by the same person on the same settlement date. The rate is 0.2% on OTC trades or 0.1% on trades executed in a regulated market (or multilateral trading facility).
Derivatives FTT applies to any derivative contract or securitised derivative, whose underlying value is directly or indirectly tied to Italian shares. The taxable base is the notional amount of the derivative (no netting applies), and it is subject to a special tax scale, on both the purchase and the sale legs; the amount is reduced to 1/5 for transactions executed on regulated markets and multilateral trading facilities.
High-frequency trading FTT applies to transactions on shares (wherever issued) and share-based derivatives (wherever the underlying share is issued) in the Italian financial markets; trades amended or cancelled within half a second are subject to a 0.02% rate, to the extent they exceed 60% of overall trades.
## Digital service tax (DST)
As of FY 2020, corporations will apply a tax at the rate of 3% on the value of specific digital services collected, net of VAT and other indirect taxes.
The web tax is addressed to taxpayers who individually or at the group level realise during a taxable year (i.e. calendar year):
Taxpayers must pay the tax by 16 May of the calendar year following the year in which the taxable revenues were obtained.
Taxpayers also must submit an annual tax declaration regarding the provided taxable services by June 30 of the following year. For companies that are part of the same group, a single entity must be identified to comply with the above-described provisions.
The entry in force is January 1, 2020. The Italian DST shall be repealed when internationally agreed-upon provisions on the digital economy’s taxation become applicable.
The DST is aimed at the revenues collected from the provision of the following services:
## Social security contributions
The Italian employer, in order to pay social security contributions for employees, must register with the Italian Social Security Administration (*Instituto Nazionale Previdenza Sociale* or INPS).
The total social security rate is around 40% of the employee's gross compensation (the rate depends on the work-activity performed by the company, the number of employees of the company, and the employee's position), and is shared as follows:

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year for individuals in Italy is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
The taxpayer can file Modello *Redditi PF*or *Modello* 730 (*Mod*. 730, a simplified income tax return) on the basis of his/her personal situation. Generally the 730 form is filed by the individuals who have an Italian withholding agent.
### Mod. 730
In Italy, the *Mod*. 730 is a simplified income tax return. It can be filed only for specific incomes (i.e. incomes subject to ordinary taxation) and the taxpayer must meet the following conditions:
The main advantage of this tax return is that the taxpayer is not required to prepare any calculation; the balance resulting from the tax return is directly withheld or refunded (if the result is a credit) to the employee in the Italian pay slip. Married couples can file the *Modello* 730 jointly.
This tax return has to be submitted to the Italian tax authorities by 30 September via electronic filing.
### *Modello Redditi PF*
In case *Mod*. 730 is not applicable, the taxpayer has to file the Italian tax return called *Modello Redditi PF*. This tax return has to be submitted to the Italian tax authorities by 31 October via electronic filing. Married couples cannot file the *Modello Redditi PF* jointly.
Payment of taxes is due on a self-assessment basis. In case the result of the tax return is a credit this will be refunded to the individual by the Italian tax Authorities, directly.
### WHT and Mod. CU issued by the employer
On employment income, the employer, as tax agent, applies for the monthly withholding tax on the basis of the tax rates applicable to the annual employment income.
The employer is required to issue within 16 March of the next year an annual employment certification, so called *Model CU*, certifying the amounts of the taxable income of the employee and the withholding taxes applied during the fiscal year.
In case the foreign individual has an employment relationship with an Italian company, the Italian employer, as withholding agent, is required to act as above.
In case foreign individuals have no employment relationship with an Italian company, they are required to declare the income in the Italian tax return (through the so called ‘self-assessment method’).
## Payment of tax
The income taxes are paid through the individual tax return using the so-called 'self-assessment' method as follows:
The following payments are due:
Tax advances are used to offset the tax balance of the following year.
Starting from 1 July 2024, the payment forms, which include credits used to offset the tax liability, need to be electronically filed through the online web services of the Italian tax authorities (i.e. it is no longer possible to make such payments through the online banking services).
## Tax audit process
The tax authorities have the power, during the period up to 31 December of the fifth year following the year in which the tax return has been filed, to audit the taxpayer's return. The taxpayer has the option to appeal within 30/60 days from the notification date of the notice of assessment.
In case of an omitted tax return, the tax authorities can assess during the period up to 31 December of the seventh year following the year when the tax return should have been filed.
If the taxpayer has appealed, then a judgement will be issued by the tax commission. It is possible to appeal against this judgement again by means of a petition filed within 60 days from the date of the notification of the tax commission's notice of judgement. The case is reviewed by the tax commissions. It is possible to appeal against this second judgement only on a point of law.
At the moment, the main areas of focus for the Italian tax authority are:

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
The main income tax levied on individuals is the personal income tax (PIT), also known as the *Imposta* *sui redditi delle persone fisiche* (IRPEF).
In Italy, the individual is subject to the following income taxes:
The tax liability shall be computed on a progressive rate, and the applicable tax rates are shown below (*see* *National income tax*).
## The scope of taxation in Italy
The tax status of an individual is the starting point for applying the correct taxation in Italy. According to the Italian tax law, both Italian residents and non-resident individuals are subject to taxation in Italy, but on a different basis.
### Tax resident individuals
Tax resident individuals are liable to the Italian personal (or national) income taxes on their income wherever produced (under the so called ‘worldwide principle’). Therefore, tax residents are also subject to taxation on foreign incomes (e.g. deriving from real estate owned outside of Italy, foreign dividends and interest, foreign compensation and director’s fees, and other foreign income).
Tax resident individuals are required to declare all their foreign investments (financial and not) for monitoring purposes through the Italian tax return.
### Tax regime for neo-domiciled individuals
Individuals who transfer their tax residency *(see the [Residence](italy/individual/residence.html) section for more information*) from abroad to Italy may elect for the application of a flat tax, at a fixed amount of 100,000 euros (EUR) (hereinafter the ‘neo-domiciled tax regime’) on the foreign sourced incomes.
Due to changes occurred by the entering in force of the Article 2 of the Law Decree No 113 of 2024, for the individual who opt for the neo-domiciled tax regime from 2025 tax period, the flat tax amounts to 200,000 euros (EUR). The individuals who opted for the regime from 2024 tax period can continue to pay the fixed amount of euros 100,000 (EUR) up to the end of the application of the regime regardless of the new provisions.
The mentioned tax regime will also apply on:
In addition to the taxpayer, each family member could be subject to a flat tax on non-Italian sourced income at a fixed amount of EUR 25,000.
In order to be eligible for this tax regime it is necessary to carry out the option through the annual Italian tax return. In any case, it is advisable to submit an advance ruling to the Italian tax authorities in order to obtain their formal opinion on the applicability of the special regime.
To elect such treatment, the individual must meet several requirements, including previous non-Italian tax residency for at least nine years over ten fiscal years preceding the transfer.
The mentioned tax regime is not cumulative with the special tax regime for inbound workers (s*ee New tax regime for inbound workers in the [Income determination](italy/individual/income-determination.html) section*)*.*
### Flat tax regime for non- Italian retirees
The special regime provides for a flat tax rate of 7% on the non-Italian sourced pensions and incomes.
The ordinary length of the regime is 10 years starting from the year in which an individual become Italian tax resident. The regime applies to pension income but also to employment or self employment income, business income, capital income, rental income.
An individual is allowed to apply for the 7% flat tax regime if the following conditions are meet:
In addition, according to the law provisions, annuities and lump sum pension payment fall into the application of the 7% flat tax regime with exclusion of those deriving from unit linked policies, integrative foreign pension fund, annuities linked to life insurance policies and aimed at covering the risk of permanent disability.
The option for the 7% flat tax regime is exercised through the filing ot the annual income tax return linked to the tax year in which the tax residence is transferred to Italy. This option is valid from that tax period and for the first nine subsequent tax periods. Specifically, the individuals need to indicate, in a dedicated section of the Italian tax return, the country or countries in which he/she was the tax residence before to exercise for the above mentioned option.
It ia also possible to exclude one or some jurisdictions from the application of the 7% flat tax regime.
With the Resolution no. 21/E of 2024 the Italian tax Authority clarified that for the application of 7% flat tax regime, in compliance with the other requirements provided by the law, it is sufficient the registration with the record of Italian resident population (i.e. Anagrafe)
### Non-tax resident individuals
Tax non-resident individuals are subject to PIT (IRPEF) only on ‘income produced’ in Italy (i.e. employment income related to the work activity performed in Italy). Therefore, the foreign incomes are not relevant to the purposes of taxation in Italy.
## National income tax
National income tax for FY 2025 is levied at progressive tax rate on all income reported below.
| Taxable income (EUR) | | Tax on excess (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 28,000 | 23 |
| 28,001 | 50,000 | 35 |
| 50,001 |  | 43 |
## Additional tax on variable compensation in the financial sector
Variable compensation (e.g. bonus/stock option/incentive plan) paid to an executive/manager in the financial sector (i.e. banks, financial institutions, and other companies whose business is exclusively or primarily to acquire ‘holdings’; management companies, *Società* *di Gestione del Risparmio* [SGR] and *Società* *di Intermediazione mobiliare* [SIM]; financial intermediaries) is subject to an additional tax of 10% as described below.
With the Sentence no 16257/2023 the Italian Supreme Court further extended the subjective scope of application of the rule, also including companies that provide consultancy and compliance services in corporate and financial matters to companies.
In case the variable compensation is paid before 17 July 2011, the taxable base for the additional tax of 10% is the variable compensation (FY ‘n’) less three times the base salary (FY ‘n’).
In case the variable compensation is paid after 17 July 2011, the taxable base for the additional tax of 10% is the variable compensation (FY ‘n’) less the base salary (FY ‘n’)
In both cases, the comparison between variable/base compensation has to be applied between variable and base compensation in the same fiscal year (independently from the year of payment).
## Flat tax on 'productivity' bonus
Productivity bonus consists of a variable remuneration paid to an employee in light of the improvement of the quality of production and/or of the company’s productivity, as long as it is applied for the whole eligible workforce (or homogeneous category of them) grounded on objective, fair, predetermined and materially valuable performing criteria, generally named ‘KPIs’ (e.g. savings related to electricity, growth of revenue, profits increase, decrease of the production waste; improvement of the delivery time; implementation of the smart working scheme).
The productivity bonus cannot exceed EUR 3,000 per year.
Such bonus is subject to a flat taxation equal to 10% as PIT, regional, and municipal withholding, but it is not exempt from social security withholding borne by the employer and employee. The Budget Law for FY 2025 has reduced, confirming what was already provided with the Budget Law for FY 2024, the applicable tax rate to 5%. This provision is valid up to the tax period 2027.
With regard to eligibility, employees who have received an annual gross retribution during the previous year (including variable compensation scheme potentially provided) exceeding EUR 80,000 are not entitled to benefit from the aforesaid tax discount.
## Regional income tax
Regional income tax depends on the region of residence. The regional income tax rate ranges from 1.23% to 3.33%.
## Municipal income tax
Municipal income tax depends on the municipality of residence. The municipal income tax rate ranges from 0% to 0.9%. Municipalities can establish progressive tax rates applicable to the national income bracket.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Applicable rates
Italian corporate entities are subject to a corporate income tax, known as *imposta sul reddito sulle società* or IRES, and to a regional production tax, known as *imposta regionale sulle attività produttive* or IRAP.
The standard rates are as follows:
Specific rules apply for bank and financial entities.
Different IRAP rates are applicable for certain entities (i.e. banks and financial entities, insurance corporations, entities with a determined governmental exclusive right to provide services).
Regions have the power to slightly increase or decrease IRAP rates.
### **Reduced CIT rate for companies  reinvesting profits in fixed assets (so called “*****IRES Premiale*****”)**
Reduction of the CIT rate from 24% to 20%, for the tax period following the one in progress as of  December 31, 2024 (FY 2025 for companies with calendar fiscal year), for companies that jointly (i) allocate 80% of the profits of the FY ending December 31, 2024, to a specific retained earning reserve, (ii) reinvest 30% of them in the purchase of new 4.0 and 5.0 fixed assets (it must be at least equal to the 24 per cent of profits by FY December 31, 2023, and the minimum threshold is EUR 20,000), (iii) have maintained stable employment levels in 2024, (iv) increase them by at least 1% in 2025, and (v) the company has not resorted to the wage guarantee fund (CIG) during the fiscal year in progress as of December 31, 2024.
## General rules
### IRES
The IRES taxable base is determined according to the worldwide taxation principle, which states that, regardless of the location/jurisdiction where the income is produced, to the extent that the income is legally attributable to an Italian resident entity, the income is taxed in Italy. IRES is charged on the total net income reported in the financial statements of the company as adjusted for specific tax rules. Non-resident companies are taxed only on Italian-source income.
### IRAP
There are different methods of computation for the IRAP taxable base, depending on the nature of the business carried out by the taxpayer. Provisions for liabilities and risks, as well as extraordinary items, cannot be taken into account when determining the IRAP taxable base.
For sales and manufacturing companies, the IRAP taxable base is broadly represented by the company’s gross margin in its financial statements. In addition to the non-deductible items mentioned above, interest income and expense and provisions for bad debts are excluded for the purposes of the IRAP taxable base.
For banks, the IRAP taxable base is broadly defined as follows:
Special rules apply to financial institutions, other than banks, and holding companies.
IRAP is levied on a regional basis, and regions are allowed to increase or decrease the standard IRAP rate up to 0.92%. Companies with facilities in different regions must allocate their overall taxable base to the different regions on the basis of the employment costs of personnel located at the various sites. Facilities become relevant to the calculation of IRAP if they have been established for more than three months. Italian companies with PEs abroad, as well as shipping companies qualifying for the tonnage tax regime (*see Tonnage tax below*), are not subject to IRAP on the income earned through these PEs.
The deduction of labour costs for IRAP purposes depends on the type of hiring contract. In particular:
## Global minimum tax
On December 28, 2023, the Legislative Decree no. 209 implementing EU Directive 2022/2523 has been published.
### Income Inclusion Rule (IIR)
The Decree provides for a IIR applicable to parents (ultimate parent entity [UPE], intermediate parent entity [IPE], or partially owned parent entity [POPE]) located in Italy with respect to foreign located and stateless low-taxed constituent entities (LTCEs). The Decree also provides for a domestic IIR applicable, under the rule order, by an Italian parent to itself and to Italian located constituent entities that are LTCEs. IIR and domestic IIR applies to fiscal years beginning on or after 31 December 2023.
### Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR)
The Decree, in line with the Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) rules and the Directive, provides for the UTPR as a separate charging provision. The UTPR will be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after 31 December 2023.
The QDMTT is applicable for fiscal years that begin on or after December 31, 2023. The same is provided for multinational groups in the initial phase of internationalisation and for large-scale domestic groups. The Illustrative memorandum affirms that the QDMTT is intended to be qualified and designed as a permanent safe harbour.
As regards the accounting standards, the Decree adopts the Local Accounting Standard with the UPE's accounting standard as a last resort rule. The substance-based income exclusion (SBIE) is expected to apply equally to the QDMTT as it does the IIR.
### Safe Harbours
On May 21, 2024, the Ministry of Economy and Finance issued a Decree providing further details on the application of the Transitional Safe Harbours. The decree only addresses the Transitional Safe Harbours (QDMTT and Simplified Calculations Safe Harbours are not included). Most of the decree addresses the Transitional Country-by-Country Reporting (CbCR) Safe Harbour, and it includes the additional rules from the December 2023 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Administrative Guidance.
## Substitutive tax on reorganisations (mergers, de-mergers, contributions in kind)
Corporate restructurings, such as mergers, de-mergers, and contributions in kind, are, in principle, tax neutral even if, for financial accounting purposes, the transaction results in the recognition of higher values of the assets or of goodwill. Companies may elect to obtain partial or full recognition for tax purposes of the step-up in the financial accounting values of assets or of the goodwill arising from the corporate restructurings, provided they pay a substitutive tax.
## Tonnage tax
Italian tax resident shipping companies, as well as non-resident shipping companies operating in Italy through a PE, can qualify for and then elect to be subject to the Italian tonnage tax regime. The regime basically allows for the determination of presumptive income based on the net tonnage of the qualifying ships (tonnage income). The tonnage income is subject to IRES only.
To qualify for the tonnage tax, ships must: (i) have a net tonnage of more than 100 net tons (NT); (ii) be used for goods transportation, passenger transportation, salvage, towing (subject to certain conditions) and other services; and (iii) operate in international shipping as defined by the rules disciplining Italian International Registry. Specific rules apply in the case of bare boat charter. In particular, the ship will always be subject to the Tonnage Tax, while the specific net income will be subject to the analytical taxation provided for by the ordinary rules (IRES 24%). A Tax credit will be recognized in order to avoid double taxation. Chartered ships with crew are included in the tonnage tax regime if their global net tonnage is less than 50% of the total net tonnage.
Tonnage income is calculated on the basis of the ship’s net tonnage. The daily income is determined according to the following rate system:
| Ship's net tonnage (NT) | Daily income in EUR per NT |
| --- | --- |
| 0 to 1,000 | 0.0090 |
| 1,001 to 10,000 | 0.0070 |
| 10,001 to 25,000 | 0.0040 |
| above 25,001 | 0.0020 |
No deductions and tax losses offset are allowed from tonnage tax income.
Income and expenses from the following activities are all deemed to be covered by the tonnage income determined as previously discussed:
Capital gains or losses arising from the transfer of ships that have been acquired by a company while under the tonnage tax regime are also deemed to be included in tonnage tax income. In the event of options exercised from FY 2016, if the taxpayer sells a ship already owned before the tonnage tax application, a capital gain determined according to the rules of Article 158 of the Italian Income Tax Code (TUIR) is added to the taxable income. In such case, the capital gain is equal to the lower of (i) the difference in the market value of the vessel and the non-amortised cost of the same, recorded on the last day of the year preceding the one in which the option is exercised, and (ii) the difference between the consideration received and the cost not amortised at the time of the sale. In any case, the taxable amount cannot be lower than the 'net latent capital gain' calculated as the difference between the market value of the vessel and the non-amortised cost of the same both before the tax period in which the option is exercised decreased by the tonnage income determined until the time of transfer.
In the event of an option exercised before FY 2016, the sale of a vessel purchased before tonnage tax can generate a capital gain or a loss to be added to the tonnage tax; this amount is equal to the difference between the consideration received and the non-amortised cost of the last antecedent fiscal year to that of the first application of the tonnage tax.
An election for the tonnage tax regime should be made for all of a company’s or group’s qualifying vessels. So called ‘cherry picking’ is not allowed. Election for the tonnage tax regime is on a voluntary basis, but, once elected, it remains in effect for ten years. The election is silently renewed at the end of the ten-year period.

## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
The major recent changes in the Italian tax rules that occurred in the last 12 months are the following:
Please note that Italy tax updates are generally expected to occur between November and December in connection with the Budget Law and approval of related implementing laws.
## Approval of several CIT provisions
The Legislative Decree 192/2024 (Revision of the Income Tax Regime – Individual Tax / Corporate Income Tax - CIT) introduced a number of different provisions on CIT matters. Below are the main measures:
The 2025 Budget Law introduced the following main Corporate Income Tax measures:
The deadlines for filing corporate income tax (IRES) and regional production tax (IRAP) returns is by the end of the tenth month following the fiscal year-end (i.e. 31 October for calendar year).
## Introduction of VAT modifications and other taxes provision modifications
## New administrative penalties regime
Starting from September 1, 2024, a new regime of administrative penalties has been introduced on tax violations. In general terms, taxpayers should benefit from a reduction of penalties, and self-disclosure procedures are encouraged.
## Enhancement of Tax Control Framework (TCF) and cooperative compliance regime
Additional certainty is granted to taxpayers under the cooperative compliance regime regarding transparency with the tax authorities. In particular:
A certification of the TCF has been introduced to apply for the regime.
Entities that are part of a group can opt for the cooperative compliance regime in case at least a group entity meets the size requirements and the group has implemented a certified TCF.
Subjects not eligible can apply for an optional regime, provided that a certified TCF is in place.
A Code of Conduct is introduced to define and regulate mutual commitments between the tax authorities and taxpayers.
## Tax credits and incentives
The main changes introduced by the 2025 Budget Law in terms of incentives for businesses include:
1. The limitation of the use of the tax credit for investments 4.0 and the simplification and strengthening of the Transition bonus 5.0.
2. Confirmation for 2025 of the tax credit for investments in the single ZES, also for companies operating in the agricultural, fishing and aquaculture sectors.
4. Extension, until 2027, of the tax credit for the listing of SMEs.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
From the fiscal year following the one in progress on 29 December 2023 and from 2024 for entities with a tax period coinciding with the calendar year, the criteria according to which tax residence is recognised on the basis of the principal business activity has been eliminated.
A foreign company holding one or more Italian subsidiaries is deemed to be resident in Italy for tax purposes if at least one of the following conditions exists:
Non-resident companies are subject to IRES and IRAP only on their Italian-source income. Specifically, Italian non-resident companies having a PE in Italy are subject to IRES and IRAP with respect to the taxable income generated from the PE in Italy.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The domestic definition of PE is substantially aligned with the OECD model.
## Corporate residence of a trust
Trusts are considered as persons subject to corporate taxation.
Residence is defined on the basis of the location of the place of effective management or the place of ordinary management. In the absence of any such structure, trusts managed by a trustee will be deemed as tax resident in Italy if the trustee is tax resident in Italy; in case of more than one trustee, a case-by-case analysis shall be conducted in accordance to specific guidelines.
In addition, trusts that have the largest part of their assets located in Italy (e.g. real properties or real rights) are deemed to be tax resident in Italy; nevertheless, in case the assets are composed of financial activities, an *ad hoc analysis* is required to define the place of effective course of business, being irrelevant the residency of the trustee(s).
Note that there are anti-avoidance rules for Italian non-resident trusts, setting out the specific conditions on which these trusts can become Italian tax resident.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## **Additional deduction for labor costs**
The additional deduction for labor costs has been extended also for Fiscal Years (FYs) 2025, 2026, and 2027. Previously the deduction was granted for FY 2024 only.
Under CIT purposes, the additional deduction is equal to 20% of the cost of newly hired personnel under a permanent employment contract. An additional deduction of 10% is granted for hiring “disadvantaged” workers who fall within certain categories.
## Depreciation and amortisation
All fixed assets that are used in the business of the company, except land, are depreciable for tax purposes (for both IRES and IRAP).
For IRES, the maximum depreciation rates for fixed tangible assets are set forth in a Ministerial Decree. Such depreciation rates are different depending on the type of asset and on the economic sector in which the company operates. In the event that financial accounting depreciation exceeds the amounts allowed for tax purposes, temporary differences arise. Tax depreciation of fixed tangible assets is allowed from the tax period in which the asset is first used. In the first tax depreciation period, the depreciation rate cannot exceed one-half of the normal rates.
From FY 2023 up to FY 2027 the amortisation of instrumental plants for large retail enterprises has been extended from 3% to 6%.
Land is not a depreciable asset. Amortisation of goodwill derived from an asset deal and amortisation of trademarks are deductible for an amount not exceeding 1/18 of the cost in any year.
Patents, know-how, and other intellectual property (IP) may be amortised over a two-year period. Concession rights may be depreciated with reference to the utilisation period as determined either by law or in the relevant agreement.
For IRAP purposes only, depreciation and amortisation (other than as related to goodwill and trademarks) are deductible in accordance with the amounts reported in the financial statements, regardless of the limits outlined above.
## Finance leasing
Leasing expenses booked in the profit and loss statement pursuant to Italian GAAP are fully deductible from the IRES taxable base if the relevant agreement has a minimum duration period. In particular, if the agreement was executed as of 1 January 2014, the duration required is the following:
Longer minimum duration periods are provided for financial leasing agreements executed before 1 January 2014.
For IFRS adopters, the lease accounting of IFRS 16 is relevant for corporate income tax (CIT) purposes pursuant to the enhanced derivation principle (*see Adoption of IFRS and taxation in the [Other issues](other-issues.html) section*).
## Interest expense
Generally, interest expense is fully tax deductible up to the amount of interest income. Thereafter, excess interest expense is deductible at up to 30% of the gross EBITDA (interest deduction capacity) relevant for tax purposes (before 2019, reference had to be made to EBITDA as reported in the financial statements). Gross operating margin is defined as the difference between operating revenues and expenses excluding depreciation of tangible and intangible assets and charges for leased assets based on their tax value.
Net interest expense in excess of the yearly limitation is carried forward in the following fiscal years. Hence, net interest expense not deducted in previous years can be deducted in the future fiscal years as long as total interest in that year does not exceed 30% of gross operating margin. If net interest expense is lower than the annual limit (i.e. 30% of gross operating margin), this difference can be carried over to increase the company’s interest deduction capacity in the future five years.
Starting from 2019, interest income exceeding interest expenses can be carried forward to offset future interest expenses in any following FYs.
Dividends received from foreign subsidiaries are excluded in the computation of the EBITDA used to determine the interest expense deductibility limit (prior to FY 2017, these dividends were included).
Where an election is made for the domestic tax consolidation regime (*as discussed in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*), the net interest expense limitation applies to the consolidated tax group. As a consequence, if a company participating in a tax group has an excess interest deduction capacity, this excess may be used against the interest deduction deficit in another company belonging to the same tax consolidation group.
The above-mentioned rules are not applicable for financial institutions, such as banks and insurance companies, where the deductibility of interest expense (for both IRES and IRAP purposes) is fully admitted. For SGR and SIM, the deductibility of interest expense is limited to a fixed amount of 96% of the interest expense shown in the income statement of these entities.
The tax authorities have provided guidelines regarding leveraged buyout (LBO) operations. The latter shall be considered, in general, legitimate, and interests arising from related acquisition financing shall be considered, in principle, deductible within the ordinary limits (30% of EBITDA, transfer pricing rules, etc.). It is advisable to seek *ad hoc* advice before implementing LBO operations.
## Bad debts
Yearly provision for bad debts not guaranteed by third parties and relating to sales of goods and services is tax deductible at up to 0.5% of the receivables gross value. Deduction shall no longer be permitted when the total amount of the bad debts reserve exceeds 5% of the above-mentioned gross value of the receivables as of the end of the fiscal year.
Specific rules apply to small credits. In particular, a loss on a bad debt can be deducted for IRES purposes when the following conditions jointly apply:
The loss is tax deductible, regardless of the amount, when the collection right is prescribed.
Moreover, losses are tax deductible in case of derecognition of bad debts applied in compliance with accounting standards (both Italian GAAP and IFRS), always provided the inherence test is met.
## Charitable contributions
Deduction of charitable contributions is allowed. The amounts allowed for deductions depend on the specific features of the recipient entity, and specific limitations are set by the law.
## Entertainment expenses
For IRES purposes, expenses for gifts and entertainment that meet the requirements (both qualitative and quantitative) contained in the specific Ministerial Decree are fully deductible in the tax period in which they are incurred. Entertainment expenses that do not meet these requirements cannot be deducted.
Expenses related to gifts with a value of EUR 50 or less are entirely deductible.
From the fiscal year subsequent the one in progress on December 31, 2024 (i.e. FY 2025 for entities with calendar fiscal year) payments and the related reimbursements of aforementioned costs must be made electronically (for example bank or postal transfer, debit, credit and prepaid cards, bank and cashier's checks) to be deductible for CIT, Regional Production Tax, and Individual tax purposes.
## Meals and lodging expenses
For IRES purposes, the deduction for meals and lodging expenses incurred within the municipality is limited to 75% of the amount incurred. However, the VAT related to such costs is fully recoverable.
From the fiscal year subsequent the one in progress on December 31, 2024 (i.e. FY 2025 for entities with calendar fiscal year) payments and the related reimbursements of aforementioned costs must be made electronically (for example bank or postal transfer, debit, credit and prepaid cards, bank and cashier's checks) to be deductible for CIT, Regional Production Tax, and Individual tax purposes.
## Car costs
The IRES deductibility of expenses related to cars used by companies is as follows:
Car costs may be entirely deducted if (i) automobiles are absolutely necessary for the company’s business or (ii) automobiles are an essential element in the company’s activity (i.e. vehicles owned by a car rental company).
## Telephone expenses
For IRES purposes, up to 80% of the total expenses related to both mobile and landline telephones are deductible.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are generally not considered inherent costs and are, consequently, not deductible for tax purposes.
## Taxes
The following IRAP items are deductible in determining the IRES taxable base:
IMU is deductible for IRES purposes up to 100% of the amount paid in FY 2022 and in the following fiscal years. Previously, it was deductible up to 50% of the amount paid in FY 2019 and 60% of the amount paid in FY 2020 and FY 2021.
## Net operating losses
Tax losses can be carried forward for IRES purposes and used to offset income in the following tax periods without any time limitation.
Tax losses can only be offset with taxable income for an amount not exceeding 80% of the taxable income. Thus, corporations are required to pay IRES on at least 20% of taxable income.
Note that losses arising in the first three years of activity can be offset with 100% of taxable income.
For IRAP purposes, tax losses may not be carried forward.
Specific (tax anti-avoidance) rules limit the carryforward of tax losses in the event of:
The Legislative Decree 192/2024 has revised the conditions and limits in case of change of control and change of actual business purposes.
The vitality condition based on the number of employees has been removed. The "fair value of the net equity" (instead of the book value, as provided in the past) limit has been identified for the carryforward of "non-intragroup" NOLs. For intragroup transactions, the carryforward loss limits do not apply.
The new provision is effective for transactions implemented in the FY 2024.Transitional regime applies for *all* the tax assets acquired up to the tax period ending on December 31, 2023.The aforementioned changes must occur together in order for the limitations to be applicable. The change of the main activity is relevant for these purposes if it takes place in the tax period in which the change of control occurs or in the two subsequent or preceding periods.
Specific anti-abuse provisions are also applicable to net operating losses in cases of merger or de-merger.
In Italy, tax losses may not be carried back.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Transactions with foreign affiliated companies should be at ‘fair market value’ and, generally, as defined by OECD Guidelines. *See Transfer pricing in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section for more information*.
## Deduction of costs suffered for transactions with non-cooperative jurisdictions
Expenses borne for transactions with entities resident or located in non-cooperative tax jurisdictions are deductible for CIT purposes within the limit of their fair market value, unless actual evidence of their economic soundness and effective execution is provided to the tax authorities. Notwithstanding all the above, a proper disclosure of such transactions is to be provided in the tax return. Penalties for omitted disclosure are introduced. Corporations applying the cooperative compliance regime can define in advance with tax authorities the fair market value for the transactions at hand.
## Allowance for corporate equity (ACE) deduction
As from the fiscal year subsequent the one in progress on December 31, 2023 (i.e. FY 2024 for entities with calendar fiscal year), the **ACE is repealed**. Nevertheless, the use of any excess credits from the previous fiscal year is permitted until they are fully utilised.
ACE was a deduction equal to the net increase in the equity employed multiplied by a rate determined each year. This rate was equal to 1.3% from FY 2019.
The relevant increase was determined by the equity contributions and by the retained earnings (except profits allocated to a non-disposable reserve) less the following items:
If the allowance for a year was higher than the net IRES taxable base, the difference would have been carried forward to the next fiscal period.
To calculate the equity increase, the reference equity was the one disclosed in the Financial Statements for the fiscal year current at 31 December 2010, net of the profits for the same year.
Specific ACE anti-avoidance rules, in order to exclude duplicates of ACE benefit within a group of companies, apply. ACE anti-avoidance inter-company transactions had to be carefully monitored.
Legislative Decree no. 34/2024 changed the regulation of Super-ACE credits. As of the Decree's entry into force (February 2024), Super-ACE credits can only be sold once. This also applies to credits already sold, prior to the entry into force of the law.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Domestic tax consolidation
Companies belonging to the same group can elect for domestic tax consolidation. This regime allows the determination of a single IRES taxable base comprised of the taxable income and losses of each of the participating entities. The tax consolidation does not operate for IRAP purposes.
Where an overall tax loss position arises, this can be carried forward and used against future consolidated taxable income. Conversely, tax losses arising in fiscal years preceding the domestic tax consolidation election can be carried forward and used only by the company to which these losses belong.
The taxable basis determined by each company participating in the tax consolidation arrangement is included in its entirety. No apportionment is made in relation to the percentage of control.
In order to validly elect the Italian domestic tax consolidation regime, the following conditions must be met:
The consolidation arrangement operates on an elective basis. Taxpayers may select whether to be included or not, and it is not necessary for all the Italian group/sub-group companies to jointly elect for the tax consolidation.
Once the election is made, it cannot be revoked until three fiscal years have passed.
The election is also allowed to Italian 'sister' companies or PEs in Italy of foreign companies resident in EU/EEA countries with which Italy has entered into an agreement that ensures an effective exchange of information. An Italian entity should be designated to exercise the option, acting as a consolidating entity.
The election is silently renewed at the end of the three-year period.
## Worldwide tax consolidation group
A worldwide tax consolidation group is available, allowing the consolidation of foreign subsidiaries.
In addition to the requirements set out for the domestic tax group system, the following conditions apply:
Income for each company is apportioned in the tax consolidation based on the actual percentage of control exercised by the ultimate parent company that is an Italian tax resident.
A number of additional requirements need to be fulfilled in order for a worldwide tax consolidation to be operative, including a mandatory audit of the financial statements of all the foreign subsidiaries.
Once the election is made, it cannot be rescinded for five fiscal years. The option is silently renewed at the end of the related period.
## Transfer pricing
Income derived from operations with non-resident corporations that directly or indirectly control the Italian entity, are controlled by the Italian entity, or are controlled by the same corporation controlling the Italian entity have to be valued on the basis of the arm’s-length nature of the goods transferred, services rendered, and services and goods received if an increase in taxable income is derived there from. Possible reductions in taxable income as a result of the arm’s-length principle are allowed:
Statutory rules on transfer pricing are set out in Article 110, paragraph 7, of the Italian Income Tax Code (TUIR), which has been amended, making specific reference to the arm’s-length principle. Before this amendment, the Italian Transfer Pricing Law used the concept of ‘normal value’ (*valore normale*) as the basis for pricing inter-company transactions. This concept was similar to the OECD arm’s-length principle, although not precisely the same and potentially open to various interpretations. The new definition formally endorses the OECD standard by providing that inter-company transactions are determined based on the ‘conditions and prices that would have been agreed in comparable circumstances between independent parties acting at arm’s length’.
Furthermore, on 14 May 2018, the Italian Ministry of Finance published a Decree providing key principles to assist implementation of the provisions contained in the revised wording of TUIR, aligning Italian transfer pricing rules with international standards, taking into account the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project and the 2017 OECD Guidelines. The Decree addresses only points of principles, while the Regulation issued by the Italian Revenue Agency on 23 November 2020 (‘*Provvedimento del Direttore dell’Agenzia delle Entrate*’, prot. 2020/360494) and the subsequent Circular Letter No. 15/E published by the Italian Revenue Agency on 26 November 2021 include operational and procedural guidance.
Transfer pricing rules provide for a penalty protection regime in case of transfer pricing audit, provided that the taxpayer has prepared proper documentation detailing the compliance of inter-company transactions with the arm's-length principle.
The Regulation applies to transactions incurred between Italian entities and non-resident entities belonging to the same group (transfer pricing rules are not applicable to domestic transactions). No specific methods have been introduced to test the arm’s-length nature of transactions; reference is made to the OECD Guidelines and to the Decree of 14 May 2018, which is in line with OECD recommendations. An exception exists for corporations involved in on-line advertising and related ancillary activities that are required not to use cost-based indicators for transfer pricing purposes, unless an advance pricing agreement (APA) has been defined with the tax authorities on this.
Based on the transfer pricing Regulation, taxpayers can obtain penalty protection if they provide the Italian tax authorities with:
The documentation can be prepared only with reference to some of the inter-company transactions (cherry picking); in such a case, the penalty protection regime is applicable with exclusive reference to the covered operations.
Documentation must be provided to the tax authority upon request, within 20 days, in the electronic format.
Transfer pricing documentation must be prepared each year on a company-by-company basis. Small and medium companies (defined as those with an annual turnover of less than EUR 50 million; the turnover must be computed considering also the revenues of directly or indirectly controlling or controlled entities) can update the economic analysis only every three years, provided that the comparability analysis is based on publicly available sources and no significant change between the fiscal years have occurred. Otherwise, it is necessary to update the economic analysis each year. All the other sections of the report have to be updated each year, even for small and medium companies.
Relief from penalties is granted for both IRES and IRAP applicable to transfer pricing adjustments to taxpayers who have prepared transfer pricing documentation in line with Italian Regulation.
### Advance pricing agreements (APAs)
According to Article 31-ter (titled 'Advance agreements with businesses with an international activity') of the Presidential Decree no. 600 dated 29 September 1973, the Italian Tax Assessment code, taxpayers may apply for an APA procedure. It is possible to obtain bilateral and multilateral APAs where a double taxation agreement has been concluded by Italy and the partner states based on article 25, paragraph 3 of the OECD Model Convention. The procedure is available for companies engaged in 'international activity' and can cover transfer pricing issues, allocation of profit to PEs, dividends, the existence or otherwise of an Italian PE, royalties, and interest. In 2015, the scope of the APA was extended to also cover the entry and exit values of assets and liabilities on change of corporate tax residence.
The agreement executed between the tax authorities and the taxpayer is binding for the fiscal year during which the agreement is executed and for the following four fiscal years and can then subsequently be renewed.
Rollback provisions are available as follows:
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
CbC reporting has been introduced in Italy for multinational enterprise (MNE) groups with consolidated group revenues of at least EUR 750 million. With this report, any MNE group shall disclose annually and for each tax jurisdiction in which it conducts business the information set out therein.
The template of the CbC report includes:
The group entity responsible for the submission of the CbC report is the ultimate parent entity. However, where some conditions are met, the report shall be submitted by the entities resident in Italy for tax purposes.
The legislative Decree no. 214/2024 has been recently approved by the Italian Government and implements the EU Directive 2021/2101. The public CbCr applies to financial statement starting from the fiscal year beginning from June 22, 2024 and it envisages the publishment of a specific relation to the business’s website and the filing at the Company Register. Administrative penalties between EUR 10,000 and EUR 50,000 are imposed to the Director if the report is not filed. The above standard penalties are halved if the CbCR is not published on time and they are doubled if some relevant information is not true, or if some information required by the decree is omitted.
The CbC report shall be filed within 12 months of the last day of the reporting fiscal year of the MNE group. Moreover, the deadline for the notification of the CbC status to the Italian tax authorities is within the deadline for the submission of the income tax return.
## Thin capitalisation
Italy no longer has thin capitalisation rules *per se*. Instead, net interest expense is deductible only up to an amount equal to 30% of gross operating margin (*see Interest expense in the [Deductions](deductions.html) section for more information*).
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
An Italian company that controls, either directly or indirectly, a foreign enterprise, company, or other entity is required to consolidate the taxable income arising in proportion to the percentage of shareholding held, irrespective of whether the profits have been distributed or not.
Income from CFCs is taxed separately from the other taxable income of the business at the standard IRES rate (i.e. other tax losses cannot be used to offset CFC income). Foreign taxes paid by the CFCs are recoverable by way of a corresponding tax credit.
Dividends received by an Italian shareholder from a CFC are excluded from taxable income up to the amount of the taxable income attributed under the above CFC provisions. The excess of any dividends over income already included through the CFC regime is fully taxable in the hands of the shareholder.
Exemption from CFC rules can be achieved by means of an advance ruling from the Italian tax authorities showing that the CFC entity carries on a substantive economic activity by using employees, equipment, assets, and premises.
The CFC rules apply to controlled companies that jointly meet the following conditions:
With the Legislative Decree n. 209/2023, the Italian law on CFCs has been modified to align the ETR test with Pillar 2 rules. Such modifications come into effect as from FY 2024. This new law establishes that where a foreign controlled entity has audited and certified financial statements, then the ETR test for CFC reasons may be simplified by assessing if there is a relevant threshold of 15% effective taxation, below which the test is not deemed to be satisfied. The update in the legislation also grants the parent company a three-year irrevocable option to pay a substitute income tax equal to 15% of the net accounting profit of the financial year computed disregarding the taxes that contributed to that value, the depreciation of assets, and provisions for risks with respect of all its CFCs. The three-year option is tacitly renewed upon termination, unless expressly revoked beforehand by the parent company.
In the absence of audited financial statements, the current criteria for computing the ETR remains applicable and the parent company is not allowed to opt for the payment of the 15% substitute tax.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
The tax regime for PEs is the same as for corporate Italian entities (e.g. joint-stock companies). Accordingly, a PE is subject to IRES as well as to IRAP. Both taxes are determined on the basis of a specific statutory account prepared according to the accounting principles applying to resident enterprises with similar business activity carried out by the PE.
Transfer pricing principles apply to ‘transactions’ between the head office and its Italian PE. A PE is considered a functionally separate entity, independent from its headquarters, and a PE’s profits and ‘free capital’ are attributed to it on the basis of OECD principles.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
In February 2023, the Council of Ministers gave the green light for the creation of a new 'incentives code' in order to block the extreme fragmentation of current incentive policies and achieve full efficiency of measures for businesses. The Ministry of Enterprise and Made in Italy (MIMIT) will have to adopt the delegated decrees within 24 months (December 2024).
The Reform is connected to the 2023-2025 Budget Law in line with the indications of the Economic and Financial Document and with the Recovery and Resilience Plan (RRP) and also includes among the objectives the simplification of the rules on investment and measures to facilitate the development of South Italy. In fact, the revision of incentives is a necessary step also for the promotion of Italian industrial policy, which requires at national level a greater efficiency of the measures available for companies as well as an orientation towards global challenges such as the green and digital transition.
## Foreign tax credit
Where foreign-source income definitively is taxed abroad, a tax credit can be claimed for use against a company’s IRES liability. The amount of the tax credit that can be claimed is the lower of the foreign tax incurred and the proportion of the IRES liability related to the foreign-source income. For partially exempt income (e.g. dividends), the foreign tax credit is reduced in proportion to the amount of the income taxable in Italy.
If an Italian company receives foreign income from more than one country, this limitation is applied separately to each country.
Foreign taxes borne by the foreign PE of an Italian resident company are allowed to be offset against the overall consolidated tax liability (IRES).
Any excess of foreign tax credit over the maximum amount allowed for recovery in the same tax period can be carried back or carried forward for eight years and recovered if specific conditions are met (e.g. same source country of the income, occurring because of an excess of the IRES liability related to the foreign-source income).
## Introduction of the reshoring exemption
In detail, in the tax period in which the reshoring takes place and in the five subsequent tax periods, a 50% exemption for IRES and IRAP purposes is granted for income deriving from the repatriated assets and activities. For the determination of eligible income, the taxpayer is required to maintain separate evidence, from an accounting point of view, to allow verification of the correct determination of the income and the value of net production taxable for IRAP purposes.
## Tax credit for investments in new capital assets
Tangible assets '4.0'
For enterprises that invest in new tangible assets included in Annex A of Law n. 232/2016 (so called 'assets 4.0') different benefit rates are provided based on the tax period in which the investment is realised and based on the acquisition cost.
If such investments are made between January 1, 2023 and December 31, 2025, or by June 30, 2026, provided that by December 31, 2025 the purchasing order is accepted by the seller and the buyer paid an instalment of at least 20% of the purchasing cost, the tax credit is recognised in the following measures:
The above-mentioned threshold applies for each fiscal year in the period 2023 through 2025.
Only for investments made in FY 2025, it is introduced a national budget limit equal to 2,2 billion euro. In order to obtain the tax credit, taxpayers must file specific communications to the competent authorities.
### Intangible assets '4.0'
With regard to intangible assets included in Annex B of Law 232/2016 (including expenses for services incurred in connection with the use of cloud computing solutions), Law No. 234/2021 introduced different rates depending on the year of investment.
Specifically, for investments made for FY 2023, the tax credit is granted at 20% of the cost, again up to an annual maximum of EUR 1 million. The tax credit rate decreases to 15% for investments made in FY 2024 and 10% for investments made in FY 2025.
The 2025 Budget law has terminated early the applicability of the tax credit for investments in intangible capital goods made in 2025. Therefore, in 2025 only investments already started in 2024 will remain eligible for the tax credit, for which the two reservation requirements had already matured, i.e. acceptance of the order by the supplier and payment of a minimum deposit of 20% by the buyer.
In all cases, there is a six-month window (until June 30 of the following year) if the conditions for the reservation are met by December 31 of each year.
### Tax credit Transition '5.0'
A tax credit is applicable to investments in tangible and intangible assets interconnected with the company’s Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) that enables the company to achieve its goals of optimising processes, reducing energy consumption (positively impacting the decarbonisation process), and improving production efficiency. Eligible investments must be made in FYs 2024/25 and they must be aimed at Transaction 5.0, allowing for energy savings compared with the level of consumption before the investments.
A minimum energy consumption reduction of at least 3% of the entire production structure or 5% of the specific production process is requested to access the tax credit. The tax credit is recognised to the extent of 35% of the cost for investments up to EUR 10 million, and 5% of the cost for investments between EUR 10 million and EUR 50 million.
In case of higher reduction of the energy consumption, the tax credit rates are increased by 5 or 10 percentage points. The energy consumption reduction must be certified by an independent energy expert, and the communication must be filed with the energy sector authority (GSE).
The following tax credits are available to all enterprises that invest in eligible activities, regardless of the legal form and the economic sector in which they operate.
### R&D tax credit
For eligible R&D activities, the tax credit is equal to 20% (12% in FY 2020) of the eligible costs incurred, with a maximum annual amount of EUR 4 million (EUR 3 million for FY 2020). The 2021 Budget Law extended for two years the increased benefit rates provided for if the R&D activities are carried out in the South Italy regions.
The 2022 Budget Law extended the measure up to the tax period including 31 December 2031; however, the tax credit rate was decreased to 10% of the eligible expenses, and the annual ceiling of the credit increased to EUR 5 million.
To determine the cost basis of the benefit, the following expenses are eligible:
1. Personnel costs.
2. Depreciation charges, costs of the financial or simple lease, and other expenses related to movable tangible assets and software used in R&D projects.
4. Depreciation charges related to industrial privatives.
5. Expenses for consultancy services and equivalent services related to R&D eligible activities.
6. Expenses for materials, supplies, and other similar products used in the R&D projects.
### Tax credit for technological and digital innovation and ecological transition
A tax credit for enterprises that invest in technological and digital innovation activities '4.0' and in projects aimed at the ecological transition is also applicable.
Until FY 2023, this tax credit is equal to 10% (6% in FY 2020) of the eligible costs incurred, with a maximum annual amount of EUR 2 million (EUR 1.5 million in FY 2020). The applicable rate is increased to 15% (10% in FY 2020) in case the eligible activities consist of technological innovation aimed to reach an ecological transition goal or a digital innovation goal compliant with the so-called '4.0' model, without prejudge of the maximum annual amount of EUR 2 million (EUR 1.5 million in FY 2020).
Based on changes introduced by the 2022 Budget Law, for the tax periods 2024 and 2025, the tax credit rate is reduced to 5% while the annual maximum limit of EUR 2 million remains unchanged.
On the other hand, as regard the tax credit for investments in 4.0 digital innovation projects or for projects aimed at achieving ecological transition objectives, for the tax period 2022, the measure of 15% is confirmed within the annual maximum limit of EUR 2 million, and then it is progressively reduced to 10% for the tax period following the one in course on 31 December 2022, within the annual maximum limit of EUR 4 million, and to 5% for the tax period following the ones in course from 31 December 2023 to 31 December 2025, again within the annual maximum limit of EUR 4 million.
To determine the tax credit, taxpayers shall consider the same eligible expenses as for R&D credit, under the same conditions, except for those relating to industrial property rights as indicated in (iv) of the paragraph above.
### Tax credit for design and aesthetic ideation activities
This measure is addressed mainly to enterprises operating in the textile and fashion, footwear, eyewear, gold, furniture, and ceramic sectors that have carried out design and aesthetic ideation activities for the conception and realisation of new products and samples.
The tax credit rate is equal to the one for technological innovation. To determine the tax credit, taxpayers shall consider the same eligible expenses as for the R&D credit, under the same conditions, except for those relating to industrial property rights indicated in (iv) above.
## Tax credit for investments in the Southern Italy Special Economic Zone (SEZ)
In relation to the tax credit 2024 for investments in the SEZ area, 2025 Budget Law modified art. 16 co. 6 of Legislative Decree 124/2023 bringing some changes to the national budget available to finance this measure. In particular, the tax credit at hand is recognised within the maximum limit of EUR 2,2 billion for the year 2025 (investments made in the period January 1 through November 15), based on the definitions and the criteria provided for by the Ministerial Decree issued.
As already provided for by Legislative Decree 124/2023, the tax credit will be recognised in a variable amount depending on the size of the company and the location of the investments made in the regions of Southern Italy, which become a single special economic zone, relating to the purchase of new capital goods (plants, equipment, and machinery) and the purchase of land and the construction of buildings, including restructuring expenses.
The nominal rate of the tax credit for large companies is 15% of the eligible investments in the Region Abruzzo, 30% in the Regions Molise, Basilicata, and Sardinia, and 40% in the Regions Campania, Puglia, Calabria, and Sicily. Increased rates of 10% and 20%, respectively, are applicable for medium and small companies, as defined based on the EU applicable regulation.
## Advertising campaign tax credit
There is a facilitative measure intended for businesses, self-employed workers, and non-commercial entities in relation to investments made in advertising campaigns in the daily and periodical press, including online (article 57-bis, Legislative Decree 50/2017).
From 2023, to benefit from the tax credit, it is necessary that the overall amount of advertising investments made exceeds the amount of similar investments made in the previous year by at least 1%.
The incentive consists of a tax credit equal to 75% of the incremental value of the investments made. It is granted within the maximum limit of the annual allocation and in compliance with the European Union regulations on '*de minimis*' aid. Therefore, if the overall amount of credits requested exceeds the amount of available resources at a national level, these are divided percentage-wise among all those who are entitled to the bonus.
## Patent Box regime
In order to benefit from this new procedure, each year taxpayers have to opt for it in the annual CIT return and prepare a proper documentation set, whose possession has to be declared in the annual CIT return. This documentation, which has to be prepared in Italian language, electronically signed with time-stamp by the legal representative of the company (or its delegate), and provided to the tax authority upon request, within 20 days, in the electronic format, will allow taxpayers to benefit from the penalty protection relief in case of tax audit and related challenge.
All relevant instructions for implementing the new Patent Box regime are included in Regulation no. 48243/2022 and no. 52642/2023 of the Director of the Italian Revenue Agency and clarifications provided in Circular Letter no. 5/2023.

## Adoption of IFRS and taxation
For IAS/IFRS adopters, the Italian tax law provides for the enhanced derivation (*principio di derivazione rafforzata*) of the CIT basis from the IFRS statutory financial statements.
The taxable base is determined starting from the net income arising from the profit and loss, increased or decreased by items directly booked to equity pursuant to the application of IAS/IFRS. In this respect, the accrual principle, and the qualification and classification criteria stated by the IFRS, are relevant for the calculation of the taxable base. Valuations criteria are not accepted for tax purposes. Specifications and limitations of the derivation principle can be introduced by means of a Decree issued by the Ministry of Finance.
The First Time Adoption is characterised by the neutrality principle (*Principio della Neutralità*); such principle aims to neutralise the effects deriving from the movement to IAS/IFRS.
The following specific rules applicable to IAS adopters must be considered:
## Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
The FATCA aims to detect and discourage offshore tax evasion by United States (US) citizens or residents for tax purposes in the United States who hold financial assets through foreign financial institutions (FFIs), generally banks, custodial institutions, certain investment entities, and life insurance companies.
In order to simplify the obligations imposed on FFIs, the US Treasury and various foreign governments have entered into intergovernmental agreements (IGAs).
The Italian Inter-Governmental Agreement (i.e. Italian IGA) was signed between Italy and the United States on January 10, 2014, and it has been ratified by the Law no. 95/2015 (i.e. FATCA ratification law) issued on January 18, 2015.
For countries that have signed a Model 1 IGA, the United States has granted a number of important simplifications, such as the possibility for FFIs to use information collected for anti-money laundering (AML) purposes and for FATCA customer identification and the suspension of most of the penalties (e.g. account closure) for those account holders who refuse to provide the information required for their correct identification (i.e. recalcitrant).
The FATCA implementation Decree (i.e. FATCA Decree) was issued by the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) on August 6, 2015.
FATCA obligates Italian financial institutions to identify (starting from July 1, 2014) and classify account holders in order to report certain financial information (e.g. name, address, taxpayer identification number [TIN], account balance) related to US persons to the Italian Revenue Agency. The Italian tax authority will then exchange such information with the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by the end of September of each year.
The IGA ratification Law also includes provisions regarding on-boarding and due diligence requirements for CRS purposes.
The CRS implementation Decree (i.e. CRS Decree) was issued by the MEF on December 28, 2015. The CRS Decree includes the Annex C, which lists the reportable jurisdictions (i.e. each European Union member state that is not Italy and each jurisdiction that has signed an agreement with Italy or with the European Union on the basis of which it would receive information on reportable accounts), and Annex D, which lists the participating jurisdictions (i.e. each European Union member state that is not Italy and each jurisdiction that has signed an agreement with Italy or with the European Union on the basis of which it would transmit information on reportable accounts). Annex C and Annex D have been modified by further Decrees issued by the MEF.
Starting from January 1, 2016, Italian financial institutions are required to identify and report non-resident (non-US) account holders to the Italian Revenue Agency, as provided by the CRS developed by the OECD.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
The Italian tax law allows for certain expenses to be deducted from a taxpayer’s gross income, while tax credits can be used as an offset against a taxpayer’s tax liability.
## Employment expenses
With reference to employment income, Italy has adopted a system of tax credits (*see Employment tax credits under the [Other tax credits and incentives](other-tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for more information),* unlike other countries that permit an employment expenses deduction in determining taxable income.
Provided that the conditions requested by law are met, the main deductions from employment taxable income are the following:
## Personal deductions
Provided that the conditions requested by law are met, the main deductions from gross taxable income, if they have not been deducted from each kind of income, are the following, if properly documented:
### Alimony payments to a separate spouse
Individuals can fully deduct from taxable income the alimony paid to a separate or divorced spouse resulting from a court judgement.
Note that only the portion that is related to the separate spouse is deductible, while the portion attributable to maintenance of children is not deductible.
### Charitable contributions
Contributions to certain religious entities can be deductible from the taxable income up to EUR 1,032.91 (per taxpayer). Payments need to be made through traceable means (i.e. credit or debit card, electronic services of a bank account).
## Personal exemptions
Unlike other countries that permit personal exemptions and allowances in determining taxable income, Italy has adopted a system of tax credits (*see Family tax credits under the [Other tax credits and incentives](other-tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for more information).*
## Business deductions
Unlike other countries that permit business deductions in determining taxable income, Italy has adopted a system of tax credits (*see Employment tax credits under the [Other tax credits and incentives](other-tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for more information).*
## Losses
For personal income taxation purposes, offset of losses against income is allowed for capital gains/losses on income items of the same nature.
It is possible to offset the gain/loss from sale of shares regardless of the issuer of the shares, whether the shares are quoted or not. The loss of quoted shares can be offset against the gain from the sale of unquoted shares.
It is not possible to offset the gain/loss of ‘qualified’ and ‘not qualified’ participation.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
The Italian tax system provides the six following categories of income:
The gross taxable income is determined by the sum of the taxable incomes of the above categories subject to ordinary taxation.
Please note that some kinds of income (interest, dividends, and capital gains) could be subject to a flat tax rate provided that conditions established by the Italian tax law are met.
## Employment income
Employment gross taxable income includes all compensation (cash or benefits in kind) received by the employee in relation to their employment relationship, including: bonuses, stock options, loans, overseas adjustments, cost of living allowance, tax reimbursements, car allowance, etc.
As a general rule, 100% of compensation paid in cash is subject to tax (some exceptions to this rule are reported below), and compensation paid as fringe benefits (such as housing, loans, company car granted for personal and business use) are taxed on the base of the ‘normal value’ or on a lump-sum basis. Normal value is defined in Article 9 of the Italian Tax Code, as the price generally applied to similar goods and services on the market. In particular, for shares, bonds, and other securities listed on stock exchange or traded over-the-counter, the normal value shall be determined on the basis of the average closing price during the preceding month (30-31 days); for other shares, it is determined in proportion to the net equity value of the company.
Specific rules apply to the items listed below.
### Out-of-town travel allowance
Travel allowances provided for transfers/business trips are included in taxable income on amounts exceeding EUR 46.48 per day (transfers within Italy), or EUR 77.47 per day (transfers outside of Italy), if no meal and no accommodation costs are reimbursed. The above amounts are reduced by:
As a general rule the expenses need to be paid through traceable means (i.e. credit or debit cards, other electronic methods required by the law)
### Relocation allowance
### Moving expenses
Moving expenses reimbursements (transportation of household goods, travelling expenses for employee and their family) are fully tax-free, if reimbursed by the employer upon submission of related receipts. The payments must be made with traceable means, such as bank transfers, credit or debit cards, or other electronic methods required by the law
### Employer contributions
Employer contributions to insured medical benefits are also considered taxable income in certain cases.
### Housing benefit
As a general rule accommodations provided to an employee by an employer are considered as a taxable benefit.
If the rental contract is in the name of the employer, and the rental fee is paid by the employer, the taxable amount is the difference between a figurative value called cadastral value (approximately equal to about 1/10 to 1/15 of the annual rental amount), increased by the utilities eventually reimbursed to the employee, and reduced by any contributions paid by the employee (if any).
If the rental contract is not in the name of the company, the taxable amount will be equal to the difference between the annual rental amount and the contributions paid by the employee (if any).
### Personal use of company car
The company car benefit (provided by the employer to the employee for private and business use) constitutes taxable income to the employee for an amount equal to the 30% of the imputable value determined in accordance with tables provided by the Italian Automobile Club (based on car model, engine power, fuel, and considering an average annual mileage of 15,000 km/*per annum*). This rule applies until 30 June 2020.
Starting from 1 July 2020, the Italian Budget Law 2020 has foreseen different percentages of the fringe benefit taxable depending on the level of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions emitted into the atmosphere, as follows:
Starting from January 1st 2025 the percentage of the imputable value is reduced to 10% for battery powered electric vehicles and to 20% for plug-in hybrid vehicles. For all other vehicles, except the two ones mentioned above, the imputable value is 50% of the amount corresponding to the conventional mileage of 15.000 kilometres.
### Interest on loans
The taxable income derived from loans granted by the employer, directly or through third parties, is equal to 50% of the difference between interest calculated at the official interest rate (in force at the end of each tax year concerned) and interest calculated at the rate applied by the employer or the third party.
Due to the increase of the official interest rate, the above provision, for the determination of the taxable value of the fringe benefits, has been amended by the Law Decree 145/2023 as follows:
### New tax regime for inbound workers
Article 5 of Legislative Decree 27 December 2023, no. 209, introduced significant changes to the ’inbound workers regime’.
In its current formulation, the tax benefit applies to employment incomes or equivalents and to self-employment incomes produced in Italy by the employees who transfer their tax residency pursuant to the new paragraph 2 of the Presidential Decree of 22 December 1986, no. 917.
Such incomes, within the limit of EUR 600,000 per year, do not contribute to the formation of the overall income to the extent of 50% of their amount.
The regime applies from the year of acquisition of the tax residence and for the four subsequent years.
The application of the new inbound workers regime is subject to compliance with the following conditions:
The contribution to the formation of the overall income is reduced to 40% in the event that the worker moves to Italy with a minor child or in case of the birth of a child during the period of use of the regime. In this latter case, the application of the greater benefit will start from the tax period in progress at the time of birth. In any case, it is required that, during the period of use of the regime, the minor child maintains residency in Italy.
The new provisions will apply to subjects who transfer their tax residency to Italy starting from the 2024 tax period.
Limited to individuals who transfer their legal residency to Italy in 2024, the application of the regime can be extended for another three years in the event that they become owners, by 31 December 2023 and, in any case, in the 12 months preceding the transfer in Italy, of a residential real estate used as a main residency in Italy. The non-contribution to the formation of the gross income, for the further three years, is equal to 50%.
Individuals who transferred their legal residency (i.e. who made the registration within the record of Italian resident population) by 31 December 2023 continue to apply the previous provisions regarding the application of the inbound workers regime.
### Employment activity performed abroad
Regarding the taxation of employment income derived from a work activity performed outside of Italy by a tax resident individual, the Italian tax law provides a specific rule which allows the individual to be subject to taxation on the ‘notional remuneration’ (*retribuzione convenzionale*). This particular tax regime is applicable when the following conditions are met:
The ‘notional remuneration’ depends on the employee’s position (i.e. employee, manager) and the national labour contract applicable to the company (i.e. industrial/commercial activity).
Employment income derived from work activity performed abroad (outside of Italy) by a non-tax resident individual is not subject to taxation in Italy.
The Italian Budget Law for 2025 provided a new interpretation of the article of the law which governs the application of the *"retribuzioni convenzionali".* In particular the condition that the employment activity is rendered wholly and continuously abroad for more than 183 days in a 12-month period is meet also assuming the employee return to his domicile in Italy one way per week.
### Equity compensation
The possibility of obtaining the benefit of an exemption from employment income taxation has been abolished by Law Decree number 112/2008 which entered in force on 25 June 2008. The taxation of stock options has been subject to different changes in law in the last few years; this latest Law Decree has established that, starting on 25 June 2008, income derived from the exercise of stock options (the difference between the ‘normal value’ of the shares at exercise date and the strike price) will be considered as taxable employment income and subject to ordinary progressive income tax rates. However, this income, as per the interpretation made by the Italian Social Security Authorities, is exempted from social security contributions.
## Self-employment income
Self-employment income is subject to IRPEF. The income derived from services rendered by self employees is calculated as the difference between fees collected and business expenses. Documented expenses refunded for travelling, boarding, and lodging expenses incurred in rendering services outside the tax domicile can be excluded from the formation of the taxable income.
Self employees are required to keep accounting records, but directors and statutory auditors do not have to keep such records.
Non-residents who are self-employed are subject to a 30% final WHT unless otherwise provided by DTTs. In this case, they are not required to file an income tax return in case the WHT has been applied by an Italian withholding agent.
## Real estate income
Since FY 2013, the property used by the taxpayer as 'principal abode' is no longer subject to IMU (Real estate property tax)
### Principal abode
The taxable income deriving from the ownership of a principal abode is calculated on the basis of its 'cadastral value', which corresponds to the 'ordinary'/'average' income deemed to be derived from such properties, determined by the Cadastral Office in consideration of their characteristics. The cadastral value has to be increased by 5%.
In any case, the taxable value for principal abode can be deducted by the gross taxable income.
### Real estate at disposal
IMU has substituted IRPEF for real estate at disposal. The cadastral value, increased by 5%, of the real estates keep at disposal need to be reported on a tax return while no taxable income arises. However, an exception is provided for real estate at disposal located in the same municipality in which is located the principal abode, which constitutes taxable income in the measure of 50% of the cadastral value increased by 5%.
### Real estate rented
#### Taxed at a progressive tax rate
In case of rented real estate located in Italy, the taxable income generally corresponds to the highest amount between: (i) the cadastral income increased by 5% and (ii) 95% of the rental fees referring to the relevant tax period.
In fact, for leased buildings, the law admits a 5% flat rate reduction of rentals (higher flat rate reduction is provided in some specific cases) in consideration of eventual managing and maintenance expenses incurred by the owner.
As a result, related expenses actually incurred are not relevant for tax purposes.
The taxable income, as determined above, is subject to a progressive tax rate.
#### Taxed at a flat tax rate
As of FY 2011, a new tax regime, called *cedolare secca,* has been introduced. It is a voluntary and optional tax regime which can replace the ordinary one. In case of application of the *cedolare secca*, the rental income can be taxed at a fixed tax rate equal to 21% or 10%, provided some conditions are met.
This taxation replaces:
The taxable base is 100% of the rental income.
### Foreign real estate
If the income deriving from the rented real estate owned outside of Italy is subject to rental income taxes in the foreign country, the same taxable base used in the foreign tax return is assumed as taxable base in Italy. This income is subject to taxation at progressive tax rates. In this case, the taxpayer is entitled to claim for the foreign tax credit in the Italian tax return in order to avoid double taxation.
The said deduction is limited to the proportion of the Italian tax corresponding to the ratio between the taxable income produced abroad (and subject to double taxation) and total income. The foreign tax credit cannot, in any case, exceed the net Italian tax due on the foreign source income.
Otherwise, if the income deriving from rented real estate owned outside of Italy is not subject to taxation in the foreign country, the rental income reduced by 15% constitutes the taxable income in Italy.
## Investment income
Investment income is generally defined as income arising from the use of capital, typically interest and dividends.
### Dividend income
The taxation of dividend distributions mainly depends on following categories of participation:
Generally, dividend distributions deriving from a ‘qualified shareholding’ are subject to progressive tax rates on 49.72% of dividends distributed (i.e. 50.28% of dividends income is not subject to further taxation). Dividends distributions deriving from a ‘non-qualified shareholding’, such as dividends granted by Italian companies, are subject to final WHT at 26% to be applied at source, on the contrary through the annual Italian tax return.
Moreover, according to the 2018 Financial Law, as of FY 2018, the tax treatment of dividends deriving from qualified shareholdings will be aligned to the one provided for non-qualified shareholdings through the application of a 26% flat tax; a transition period has been provided where dividends distributed from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2022 and referred to profits produced before 31 December 2017 will be taxed according to the old provisions.
The 2018 Italian Budget Law has also introduced for Italian individuals without self-business a final WHT at a 26% rate for dividend distributions deriving from qualified and non-qualified shareholdings (starting from 1 January 2018).
With the answer to the tax ruling no. 454 of 22 September 2022, the Italian tax authorities confirmed the applicability of final WHT at a 26% rate for dividend income deriving from qualified shareholding received starting from 1 January 2023 regardless of the formation period.
The dividends distributed by a foreign entity that are not paid through an Italian resident intermediary shall be included (gross of foreign taxes withheld) in the individual tax return and taxed at a 26% flat rate.
Due to several sentences of the Supreme Court of Cassation, if provided by the Double tax treaty, the individual may have the possibility to ask for the reimbursement of foreign taxes withheld at source, within the measure provided by the applicable Tax Treaty,
Dividends distributed by a foreign entity and paid through an Italian resident broker are subject to tax at a 26% flat rate (net of foreign taxes withheld). In this case, no further action will be required.
### Interest income
Interests are subject to a flat tax rate of 26% to be applied at source.
## Capital gains
For individuals, capital gains are generally taxable, even if they do not arise from speculative intent or from a business.
### Capital gains tax on securities
The taxable base referred to in the sale of assets (securities, i.e. stocks, bonds, etc.) is the sale price less the purchase price, with all the additional purchase costs (notary fees, taxes, broker fees, etc.).
As per the taxation of dividends, the taxation of capital gains on securities also mainly depends on the following categories of participation:
#### Qualified shareholdings
The capital gains earned by the sale of qualified shareholdings is taxed as follows:
#### Non-qualified shareholdings
The capital gains earned by the sale of non-qualified shareholdings is taxed applying a flat tax rate of 26%.
### Capital gains tax on the sale of a real estate
The taxable base of the real estate capital gains is the difference between the sale price and the original cost of real estate together with the sum of all the additional purchase costs (notary fees, taxes, etc.).
The capital gain on the sale of real estate is taxed at progressive tax rates or with a flat tax of 26% under certain conditions.
There are some exemptions, however, and such are applicable on capital gains deriving from the following sales:
## Exempt income
The following are some examples of income exempt from IRPEF:

## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## Tax credits
An individual who qualifies as Italian tax resident can deduct from gross income tax liability the following main tax credits if all the conditions requested by the Italian tax law are met and if properly documented:
## Employment tax credits
Employment tax credits vary depending on the income:
### Employment income tax credit
The employment income tax credit is determined as follows:
| Employment income (EUR) | Tax credit amount (EUR) |
| --- | --- |
| Up to 15,000 | 1,955 (the tax credit cannot be lower than EUR 690 or EUR 1,380 for fixed-term contracts) |
| 15,001 to 28,000 | EUR 1,910 + 1,190 x (28,000 - gross income) / 13,000 |
| 28,001 to 50,000 | EUR 1,910 x (50,000 - gross income) / (50,000 - 28,000) |
| Above 50,000 | 0 |
The tax deduction is increased of EUR 65 if the gross income is between EUR 25,000 to EUR 35,000.
The recognition of a sum by way of additional treatment, which does not contribute to the formation of income and which therefore constitutes a net amount, amounts to 7,1% of the employment income if it not exceeds EUR 8,500 per year, 5,3% if the employment income is in the range between EUR 8,500 and EUR 15,000, 4,8% if the employment income is higher than EUR 15,000 per year
In addition the Italian Budget Law for fiscal year 2025 provided for an additional deduction for the employees with an annual employment income included in the range EUR 20,001 and EUR 40,000 per year.
The amount of the additional deduction is EUR 1,000 if the gross taxable income is between EUR 20,000 and EUR  32,000. The additional deduction is prorated if the gross taxable income is between EUR 32,001 and EUR 40,000 per year.
### Pension income tax credit
The pension income tax credit is determined as follows:
| Pension (EUR) | Tax credit amount (EUR) |
| --- | --- |
| Up to 8,500 | (EUR 1,880 x days) / 365 (the tax credit cannot be lower than EUR 713) |
| 8,501 to 28,000 | EUR 700 + (EUR 1,255 x ratio); Ratio = (EUR 28,000 - gross income) / (EUR 28,000 - EUR 8,500) |
| 28,001 to 50,000 | EUR 700 x ratio; Ratio = (EUR 50,000 - gross income) / (EUR 50,000 - EUR 28,000) |
| Above 50,000 | 0 |
### Self-employment income tax credit
The self-employment income tax credit is determined as follows:
| Self-employment income (EUR) | Tax credit amount (EUR) |
| --- | --- |
| Up to 5,500 | 1,265 |
| 5,501 to 28,000 | EUR 500 + 765 x (28,0000 - gross income)/(28,000 - 5,500) |
| 28,001 to 50,000 | EUR 500 x (50,000 - gross income) / (50,000 - 28,000) |
| Above 50,000 | 0 |
## Family tax credits
As a general rule tax credits are granted to resident taxpayers with a dependent spouse, children, and other relatives living with the taxpayer, provided that each dependant’s annual income does not exceed EUR 2,840.51. For children under 24 years of age, the income limit to be considered has been raised to EUR 4,000 from FY 2019.
The family tax credit varies according to dependent spouse and family dependants.
| Dependants | Tax credit amount (EUR) |
| --- | --- |
| Dependent spouse | EUR 800 is the maximum annual amount allowed, which decreases with the increase in taxable income, up to EUR 80,000. |
| Children below three years of age \* | EUR 1,220 is the maximum annual amount allowed for each child, which decreases with the increase in taxable income, up to EUR 95,000. |
| Children above three years of age \* | EUR 950 is the maximum annual amount allowed for each child, which decreases with the increase in taxable income, up to EUR 95,000. |
| Other cohabiting dependants (parents and gran parents only) | EUR 750 is the maximum annual amount allowed, which decreases with the increase of the taxable income, up to EUR 80,000. |
\* For each child with disabilities, the applicable basic tax credit shall be increased by EUR 400.
For taxpayers with more than three dependent children, the applicable basic tax credit should be increased by EUR 200 for each child.
The child deduction must be imputed at 50% to both parents when none of them is considered as a dependant of the other for tax purposes; where the parents are separated or divorced, the entire deduction shall be imputed to the parent having custody of the child.
From 1 March 2022, the family tax credits for dependent children will apply only for children above 21 years of age and below 30 years of age (as recently amended by the Italian Budget Law for FY 2025)
For children below 21 years of age, there will not be any tax credit in the tax return; however, it will be possible to request for a monthly payment from the Italian social security authorities, and the amount (from EUR 50 to EUR 175 per child) will depend mainly on the 'family economical situation index' (ISEE).
## Other tax credits
Some other expenses entitle the taxpayer to a tax credit. The tax rate is 19% of the total amount paid.
The allowable deductions are prorated for the individuals who earn a gross taxable income higher than EUR 75,000 oer EUR 100,000 per year and in relation to the number of dependents children in the family.
### Mortgage interest credit
Tax credit is granted on interest on real estate mortgage loans issued from banks of the European Union, financial institutions, or other EU entities if they refer to the ‘habitual abode’ in Italy. Other requirements (e.g. year when the contract was signed) must be satisfied to be eligible.
The tax credit is equal to 19% of the mortgage interests paid. The maximum amount on which the tax credit is calculated is EUR 4,000.
### **Medical expenses credit**
### **Education expenses credit**
University expenses are deductible up to an amount equal to the cost charged by public educational institutions fixed by the education authority each year.
For nursery, elementary, secondary, and high school, the total maximum educational expense on which will be calculated the 19% rate is EUR 800 *per annum* per child. The Italian Budget Law for 2025 increased the maximum amount on which it is allowed to calculate the deduction up to EUR 1,000 *per annum per child*.
School fees for registration of children up to three years old are deductible on the above percentage of the maximum amount of expenses of EUR 632.
### **Life and accident insurance credit**
Life and accident insurance is deductible, only if related to the case of death, invalidity, or non-self-sufficiency, for the maximum amount of EUR 530.
### **Sporting association’s fees credit**
Sporting association’s fees for children between 5 and 18 years old are deductible on 19% of the maximum amount of expenses of EUR 210 per year per child.
### **Rental fees credit**
A fixed amount tax credit, depending on the total income of the taxpayer, for annual rental fees paid for the principal abode is available under certain conditions (this tax credit can be used just for individuals who have gross taxable incomes under EUR 30,987.41).

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
Article 1 of Legislative Decree No. 209 of 27 December 2023, entitled ’Implementation of the tax reform on international taxation‘, published on 28 December 2023 in the Official Gazette introduced significant changes to the connection criteria for determining the tax residency of individuals as provided and regulated by Article 2, paragraph 2, of Presidential Decree No. 917 of 22 December 1986.
According to Article 2 of the Italian Tax Code, an individual is considered an Italian resident for tax purposes if, for the greater part of the fiscal year (i.e. for more than 183 days) taking into account even fractions of days,:
If one of the above conditions is met, the individual qualifies as tax resident for Italian tax purposes.
Furthermore, unless proved otherwise, individuals who are registered in the record of the resident population for most of the tax period are also presumed to be residents.
The recent changes to the criteria for the determination of the tax residency result in the exclusive relevance of the ’place where, primarily, personal and family relationships of the person develop‘. Therefore, the Legislature define a precise hierarchy between the connection criteria privileging the personal and family relationships over economic and work-related interests.
An Italian citizen who transfers to a foreign country has to cancel oneself with the Records of the Italian Resident Population and has to register with the Records of the Italian resident abroad, the *Anagrafe Italiani Residenti Estero* (*AIRE*).
An anti-abuse rule provides that Italian citizens who transfer residence to countries considered as ‘tax havens’ (these are determined through a Decree of the Ministry of Finance), are deemed to be resident in Italy even if they are no longer registered in the Records of the Italian Resident Population, unless otherwise proven by the individuals.
Italian tax residents will be subject to taxation for the whole fiscal year (January through December).
Any provision covered by double tax treaties (DTTs) between Italy and other countries shall apply.
The Italian tax authority recently is focused on the assessment of the tax residence status for Italian citizens who moved their tax residence abroad.
## Potential assessment of the tax residence status for Italian citizens who moved their tax residence abroad
The tax residence status for Italian citizens who moved their tax residence abroad is carried on by the Italian tax authority and registered into the record of Italian residents abroad (so-called ‘AIRE’).
The increased role of the Italian tax authorities in this matter takes origin from:
