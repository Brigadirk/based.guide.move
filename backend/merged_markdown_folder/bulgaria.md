## National insurance contributions
National insurance contributions include social security and health insurance contributions.
The aggregate rate of social security contributions is 24.7% to 25.4%\*, of which 14.12% to 14.82%\* is payable by the employer and 10.58% is payable by the employee.
The aggregate rate of health insurance contributions is 8%, of which 4.8% is payable by the employer and 3.2% is payable by the employee.
The total national insurance contribution rate (social security and health insurance) is 32.7% to 33.4%\*, of which 18.92% to 19.62%\* is payable by the employer and 13.78% is payable by the employee.
The minimum monthly insurance base for freelancers remains BGN 710 for the period 1 January - 31 March 2023. The maximum monthly insurance base for freelancers is BGN 3,400 for 2023.
For individuals working under employment agreements or as managers or controllers of companies, the minimum insurance base depends on the economic activity of the insurer as well as on the profession and grade of the insured person. The maximum monthly insurance base is limited to BGN 3,400.
\* The range is due to the rate of contributions payable to the ‘Accident at Work and Occupational Illness Fund’, which is due only by the employer and can vary from 0.4% to 1.1% depending on one’s economic activity. The rate for the administration and services sector is 0.5%.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 11 June 2024
Bulgarian companies are required to withhold tax on payments of dividends and liquidation proceeds; interest (including that incurred under finance lease agreements and on bank deposits); royalties; fees for technical services; payments for the use of properties; payments made under operating leasing, franchising, and factoring agreements; and management fees payable to non-residents.
Capital gains from the transfer of shares in a Bulgarian company or immovable property located in Bulgaria realised by a non-resident are also subject to domestic WHT; however, the tax is payable by the non-resident. Capital gains from securities are not subject to WHT if they result from shares in listed companies and tradable rights in such shares on a regulated securities market in the EU/EEA (the exemption may extend to third country markets eligible as equivalent markets under the law). Capital gains from disposal of governmental bonds are also exempt from WHT realised on a regulated market in the EU/EEA.
Interest and royalties payable to EU-based associated companies may be subject to full WHT exemption in Bulgaria. Associated company criteria are identical to those in the EU Interest and Royalty Directive and require a holding of at least 25% of the capital for at least two years. The WHT exemption on income from interests and royalties can be applied before the expiration of the two-year participation period, provided that the participation in the capital does not fall below the required minimum before the end of this period (i.e. the direct participation is kept for at least two years).
Subject to 10% WHT would be any accruals for penalties or damages payments to entities in low-tax jurisdictions, except for insurance compensations. The tax legislation introduces a list of low-tax / uncooperative jurisdictions. These are certain off-shore territories that are explicitly listed, as well as countries with which Bulgaria has not signed a DTT and in which the applicable corporate tax rates are more than 60% lower than the applicable rate in Bulgaria.
Certain types of income (other than dividends) accrued by a PE of a foreign person to other parts of its enterprise located outside the country are subject to WHT (*except for that mentioned in the [Branch income](bulgaria/corporate/branch-income.html) section*).
## Dividends
When a dividend is accrued to a non-resident company or an individual (both resident and foreign), it is subject to WHT at a rate of 5%, unless the rate is reduced by an applicable DTT. No differentiation is made between portfolio and substantial holdings for purposes of this WHT on dividends.
Dividends distributed by a Bulgarian resident company to an entity that is a tax resident in an EU/EEA member state are not subject to Bulgarian WHT (except for cases of hidden profit distribution).
## Interest
A 10% rate applies to interest (including interest from bank deposits) payable to a non-resident, unless the rate is reduced by an applicable DTT.
Interest on borrowings by the government or the Bulgarian National Bank from international financial institutions is not taxable if the respective loan agreements contain relevant exemption arrangements (international treaties override domestic legislation).
Interest paid to an associated EU-based related company is subject to WHT exemption (requiring at least 25% holding for at least two years*, see above for a description of relief from the two-year participation period*).
An exemption from WHT is provided for income from interests on bonds and other debt securities emitted by a local tax resident and admitted to a regulated stock exchange in an EU/EEA member state.
An exemption from WHT is also provided for income from interests on loans extended by a tax resident of an EU/EEA member state, issuer of bonds or other debt securities, provided that the bonds/debt securities are issued for the purposes of extending a loan to a local legal entity and are admitted to a regulated stock exchange in an EU/EEA member state.
## Royalties
Royalties payable to foreign persons are taxed at a rate of 10% at source, unless the rate is reduced by an applicable DTT.
Royalty payments to an associated EU-based related company are exempt from WHT (requiring at least 25% holding for at least two years, *see above for a description of relief from the two-year participation period*).
## Capital gains and technical services
Capital gains generated by foreign tax residents out of certain types of qualifying Bulgarian-source disposals are subject to 10% WHT, unless the rate is reduced by an applicable DTT.
## Application of DTT relief
Bulgaria has ratified the OECD Multilateral Instrument (MLI).
Applying DTT relief is generally possible only after completing an advance clearance procedure with the Bulgarian tax authorities. Companies have to evidence that they satisfy the requirements for applying the DTT (e.g. tax residence, beneficial ownership, existence of contractual relationship, actual accrual/payment of the income). The procedure usually takes 60 days to complete.
The above procedure has to be followed only if the annual income payable by a Bulgarian resident exceeds BGN 500,000. In all other cases, DTT relief can be applied directly, through submitting a tax residence certificate and a beneficial ownership declaration with the payer of the income.
Beneficial ownership is explicitly defined in Bulgarian legislation. A company is considered a beneficial owner of the income if it has the right to dispose of the income, has discretion over its use, bears the whole or a significant part of the risk of the activity from which the income is realised, and does not qualify as a conduit company.
A conduit company is a company that is controlled by persons who would not benefit from the same type and amount exemption if the income was realised directly by them, does not carry out any economic activity except for owning and/or administering the rights or the assets from which the income was realised, and does not own assets, capital, or personnel relevant to its economic activity or does not control the use of the rights or assets from which the income was realised.
The conduit company restriction does not apply to companies that have more than a half of their voting shares traded on a registered stock exchange.
The following is a summary of the main parameters of the Bulgarian DTTs as of 1 January 2021:

Notes
\* Under Bulgarian domestic legislation, dividends distributed to non-residents are subject to 5% WHT, unless the recipient is a tax resident company of an EU/EEA member state (in which case the recipient is not subject to WHT).
\*\* Under Bulgarian domestic legislation, interest and royalty payments accrued to EU-tax-resident companies, satisfying the Interest and Royalty Directive requirements, are exempt from WHT.
1. The lower rate applies to dividends paid out to a non-resident that is the direct owner of at least the equivalent of 100,000 United States dollars (USD) forming part of the capital of the company making the payment.
2. The reduced rate for royalties is available for the use of (or right to use) industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment.
3. The lower rate applies in specific cases only (e.g. if a company that beneficially owns the dividend directly holds at least 10% of the shares of the dividend payer for at least 365 days, dividends to pension funds).
4. There is no WHT on royalties for the use of (or the right to use) scientific or cultural works.
5. The lower rate applies to dividends paid out to a foreign company that directly controls at least 15% of the share capital of the payer of the dividends.
6. There is no WHT on interest when paid to public bodies (government, the central bank, and, in several cases, certain governmental bodies).
7. The lower rate for interest applies only in specific circumstances (e.g. under loan granted by banks). The royalty definition under the new tax treaty with the Netherlands is narrowed, and it excludes payments for the use/right to use ICS equipment.
8. Up to 10% branch tax may be imposed on PE profits.
9. The 10% rate on capital gains from securities applies in specific cases that are described in the respective treaty (including capital gains from disposal of shares in certain cases).
10. The zero rate on interest applies if the loan is extended by a bank and also for industrial, trade, and scientific equipment on credit.
11. The zero rate on interest applies if the interest is paid to public bodies (government, municipality, the central bank, or any financial institution owned entirely by the government), to residents of the other country when the loan or the credit is guaranteed by its government, or if the loan is extended by a company for any equipment or goods.
12. The Council of Ministers has stated its intention to renegotiate the DTTs with Malta and Finland.
13. A 5% rate on royalties applies if the Swiss Confederation introduces in its domestic law WHT on royalties paid to non-residents.
14. The 10% rate on interest applies if the interest is received from a financial institution, including an insurance company.
15. The 5% rate on royalties applies if the royalties are paid for the use of copyright for literary, art, or scientific work.
16. The lower rate applies to dividends paid out to a foreign company that directly controls at least 10% of the share capital of the payer of the dividends.
17. The zero rate applies to dividends payable by a Bulgarian resident entity to an entity resident in Malta. The 30% rate applies to dividends payable by a Maltese entity to a Bulgarian entity.
18. The 10% rate applies to dividends distributed by companies that enjoy a reduced or zero CIT by virtue of a tax incentive for investments. In all other cases, the rate is equal to one half of the applicable rate as per the national legislations of Bulgaria and Israel. Nevertheless, the WHT rate may not be less than 7.5% or more than 12.5%.
19. The 5% rate applies to interest payable to banks or other financial institutions. The zero rate applies to interest payable to certain public bodies (governments, municipalities, central banks) or to residents of the other country when the loan or credit is guaranteed, insured, or financed by a public body of that country or by the Israeli International Trade Insurance Company.
20. The rate on royalties is equal to one half of the applicable rate as per the national legislations of Bulgaria and Israel. Nevertheless, the WHT rate may not be less than 7.5% or more than 12.5%.
21. The rate on capital gains from securities is equal to one half of the applicable rate as per the national legislations of Bulgaria and Israel. Nevertheless, the WHT rate may not be less than 7.5% or more than 12.5%. However, capital gains from transfers of shares in entities whose real estate properties exceed 50% of their assets are taxed in the country in which the real estate is located.
22. The zero rate applies to dividends and interest paid to certain public governmental and local bodies as well as entities fully owned by the state.
23. The 5% rate on royalties applies if the royalties are paid for the use of copyright for literary, art, or scientific work as well as for the use of industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment.
24. There is no WHT on interest when paid to and beneficially owned by public bodies (government, local public authorities, the central bank, or any financial institution wholly owned by the government), as well as on interest derived on loans guaranteed by the foreign government or based on an agreement between the governments of the states.
25. The 7% rate on royalties applies if the royalties are paid for the use of, or the right to use, cinematograph films and films or tapes for radio or television broadcasting, any patent, trademark, design or model, plan, secret formula, or process.
26. The zero rate applies for capital gains from shares in a Bulgarian resident company that are traded on the Bulgarian Stock Exchange.
27. In accordance with the EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive implemented in the Bulgarian legislation, dividends distributed by a Bulgarian resident company to an entity that is a tax resident in an EU member state may not be subject to Bulgarian WHT.
28. Full WHT at source may be levied on capital gains from the sale of shares in companies, the main assets of which are direct or indirect holdings in real estate situated in Bulgaria, and in some other cases (subject to the specifics stipulated in the respective treaty).
29. There is no WHT on interest when paid to public bodies (government, the central bank, governmental institutions) or any financial institution wholly owned by the government.
30. Pension funds and charities are considered resident persons.
31. The zero rate does not apply to dividends distributed to real estate investment trusts (REITs).
32. The zero rate does not apply to interest paid under a back-to-back loan.
33. The benefits of the treaty are limited to entities that satisfy certain criteria (Limitation of Benefits clause).
34. The 5% rate on royalties applies if the royalties are paid for the use of, or the right to use, any patent, design, model, plan, secret formula, process, or know-how.
35. The treaty provides for 10% WHT on capital gains unless shares were sold on a recognised stock exchange or seller owned at least 20% of the issuing company's capital.
36. The reduced rate for interest is available for bank loans (subject to specifics in the treaty).
37. The zero rate applies to dividends paid to a pension fund, central bank, or a foreign company (other than a partnership) if the company directly controls at least 10% of the share capital of the payer for at least one year.
38. The zero rate applies to interest paid to a pension fund, a public body (i.e. the government, a political subdivision, a local authority, or a central bank), in relation to a liability for the sale on credit of goods, equipment or services, as well as to a company with a minimum direct participation of at least 10% in the payer of the interest for at least one year or where a third company holds a 10% minimum direct participation in both the payer and the recipient of the interest.
39. The use or right of use of industrial, economic, and scientific equipment has been excluded from the definition of royalty and is subject to full WHT exemption.
40. The zero rate on dividends applies on dividends distributed to and beneficially owned by a company resident of a contracting state or a pension fund. The 5% rate would apply in all other cases, unless the dividends are paid out of income that is derived from immovable property by an investment vehicle that distributes most of this income annually and whose income from such property is exempted from tax (i.e. real estate investment trust). 15% WHT rate is provided under the tax treaty to a dividend paid out by a real estate investment trust.
41. The zero rate applies to interest paid to certain public bodies (i.e. the government, a political subdivision, a local authority, or a central bank) under a loan extended by a bank or in relation to a sale of industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment on credit or a loan of any kind extended or guaranteed by a governmental institution for the encouragement of exports.
42. The zero rate applies to copyright royalties and other like payments in respect of the production or reproduction of cultural, dramatic, musical, or other artistic work (not including royalties in respect of motion picture films and works on film or videotape or other means of reproduction for use in connection with television), arising in one state and paid to a resident of the other state who is subject to tax thereon.
43. The 12.5% rate applies to royalties, and the 10% rate applies to technical services.
44. The new DTT between Bulgaria and the Netherlands shall apply from January 2022.
Under some DTTs, technical service payments fall within the definition of royalty payments and are taxed accordingly.

# Bulgaria
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 11 June 2024
The taxable result is based on the statutory accounting principles relating to profit/loss and adjusted for tax purposes. Statutory accounting is maintained on an accrual basis in line with the applicable accounting standards.
Small and medium-sized companies may apply specific national standards for the financial statements of small and medium-sized companies or, optionally, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The principles provided by the standards for the financial statements of small and medium-sized companies are similar to those provided by IFRS. Certain types of companies, including banks and insurance companies, are obligated to apply IFRS.
## Inventory valuation
The tax legislation follows the accounting rules for inventory valuation methods. The accounting rules may restrict the application of certain methods (e.g. last in first out [LIFO] is not allowed under IFRS).
Inventory valuation and revaluation methods applicable under accounting standards may be used for tax purposes. Companies may choose the method of inventory valuation but must apply the chosen method consistently throughout the accounting period. An inventory of assets and liabilities is carried out in each accounting period. Accounting gains and losses realised upon revaluation of inventory will not be recognised for tax purposes and will form a temporary tax difference. These gains and losses will be recognised for tax purposes in the period in which the inventory is disposed of.
## Capital gains
Realised capital gains are included in corporate income and are taxed at the full CIT rate.
Capital gains from trade in listed securities (shares, tradable rights) on regulated markets in the European Union / European Economic Area (EEA) are not subject to taxation. As of 1 January 2021, the same tax treatment is extended to transactions carried out on equivalent markets outside the European Union as specified in the legislation.
Assets distributed as dividends are deemed realised at market value, and any capital gains arising from this will be subject to tax.
## Dividend income
### Inter-company dividends
Inter-company dividend payments between Bulgarian companies and dividends distributed by EU/EEA residents to Bulgarian companies (except for dividends from special purpose investment companies or in case of ‘hidden distribution of profits’) are not included in the tax base of the recipient company.
Dividends distributed to a Bulgarian company by its EU or EEA subsidiary are exempt from CIT only if the distribution is not treated as a tax-deductible expense by the distributing company.
### Stock dividends
No explicit regulation with respect to stock dividends exists in the Bulgarian CIT Act. Rather, the tax treatment of stock dividends follows the accounting treatment.
## Interest income
Interest income is included in the financial results of the company and is subject to 10% CIT.
## Royalty income
Royalty income is included in the financial results of the company and is subject to 10% CIT.
## Exchange rate gains/losses
Exchange rate gains and losses are reported in the profit and loss account and reflected in the assessment of taxable profit.
## Foreign income
Income derived outside Bulgaria by resident legal entities is included in the taxable base for the purpose of CIT, regardless of whether such income is subject to taxation abroad.
In instances where the provisions of a DTT are applicable, a tax credit or exemption for the foreign tax paid may be allowed. There is also a unilateral tax credit that may not exceed the amount of the tax that would be payable in Bulgaria for the same type of income.
Undistributed income of foreign subsidiaries of a Bulgarian resident company may be taxed, subject to the controlled foreign company (CFC) rules (*for more details, please see the [Group taxation](bulgaria/corporate/group-taxation.html) section*).

# Bulgaria
## Overview
Last reviewed - 11 June 2024
Bulgaria, situated on the Balkan Peninsula in Southeast Europe, has a strategic geographic position as a bridge between Europe and Asia. Bulgaria is divided into 28 provinces, with Sofia as its capital. The official language of Bulgaria is Bulgarian, and the currency is the lev (BGN).
Bulgarian tribes merged with the local Slavic inhabitants in the late seventh century to form the first Bulgarian state. At the end of the 14th century, the Bulgarian state fell under Ottoman rule. Northern Bulgaria attained autonomy in 1878, and all of Bulgaria became independent from the Ottoman Empire in 1908. Communist influences ended in 1990, when Bulgaria held its first multi-party election since World War II and began the process of moving toward political democracy and a market economy.
Bulgaria joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 2004 and the European Union (EU) in 2007.
As a member of the European Union, Bulgaria has well-developed macroeconomic policies and is one of the most financially stable economies in the Central and Eastern region of Europe. In recent years, Bulgaria has been an increasingly attractive destination for outsourcing of businesses in a number of sectors, such as the pharmaceutical sector and the IT and communications sectors. The workforce in Bulgaria is well-educated, while the cost of labour in the country is relatively low. The country has a low corporate income tax (CIT) rate of 10%. The World Bank classified Bulgaria's economy as an ‘upper-middle-income economy’.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 11 June 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate is 20%. A reduced VAT rate of 9% applies to certain tourist services.
The reduced VAT rate of 9% for restaurant and catering services, the use of sports facilities, and general tourist service is extended until the end of 2024 (it was supposed to expire at the end of 2023). Also, the 0% VAT rate for bread and flour is extended until the end of June 2024 (it was supposed to expire at the end of June 2023).
Some activities are zero-rated, including intra-Community supplies, exports of goods to countries outside the European Union, international transport of goods (i.e. transport to or from countries outside of the European Union), and supplies of goods and services related to aircraft and vessels, subject to statutory limitations.
Some supplies are VAT exempt without the right to a VAT credit, including (but not limited to) certain land transactions; leasing of residential property to individuals; financial, insurance, gambling, educational, and health services; and provision of food products to a food bank, subject to certain statutory conditions. Options to charge VAT exist for certain land transactions, leasing of residential property to individuals, and finance lease contracts.
Input VAT shall be deducted proportionately depending on the percentage of the use of the goods or the immovable property for business purposes.
The VAT Act provides for mandatory VAT registration upon certain conditions (e.g. for all companies upon reaching a statutory threshold of BGN 100,000 taxable turnover in Bulgaria for a period not longer than two consecutive months, including the current month). From 1 January 2025, the VAT registration threshold will be increased to BGN 166,000.
Foreign taxable persons not established in Bulgaria and planning to perform taxable supplies in the country for which VAT is due by the supplier are subject to mandatory VAT registration (irrespective of their taxable turnover in Bulgaria), subject to certain exceptions.
Voluntary VAT registration is also available. The Bulgarian legislation does not provide for retroactive VAT registration.
A special VAT regime applies to the so-called call-off stock mechanism in case of supplies to other member states. Where a taxable person transfers one's own goods from Bulgaria to another EU member state with a view to these goods being supplied to an (already known) customer in that member state, subject to certain conditions, the Bulgarian taxable person will not be required to register for VAT purposes in that member state. The same rules apply in the mirror situation (goods dispatched from another member state to Bulgaria).
The following mechanism for VAT recovery applies to VAT-registered companies: the positive or negative difference between the output VAT charged by the company and the input VAT for the respective month results, respectively, in a VAT payable or a VAT refundable position. The VAT payable should be remitted to the state budget not later than the 14th day of the month following the respective month. VAT refundable is offset against any VAT payable in the following two months, and any remainder is effectively recovered within 30 days thereafter.
The following statutory periods for VAT refunds apply:
It is possible to claim a refund for VAT paid with respect to assets acquired not earlier than five years prior to the VAT registration, under certain conditions. In the case of real estate, the term is 20 years.
The cash accounting regime may be applied by persons with a taxable turnover below EUR 500,000 for a period of 12 months and a number of other requirements. Taxpayers authorised to apply this regime remit VAT upon receiving a payment from their counterparts and are entitled to VAT credit when they make a payment to their suppliers. Under this regime, a person who has received an invoice from a supplier that is using the cash accounting regime will be entitled to VAT credit upon payment of the invoiced amount.
As of 1 January 2019, a relief for smaller suppliers of telecommunication services, radio and television broadcasting services, and electronically supplied services is introduced. Where the turnover for such services is below a threshold of EUR 10,000 per calendar year, the supplier should charge VAT under the Bulgarian rules. The supplier can opt to apply the existing rules and charge VAT in the country of the recipient even before its sales reach EUR 10,000 per calendar year.
## Customs duties
Customs duties are calculated in accordance with the EU customs tariff and regulations.
All entities that are holders of customs procedures shall be registered in the electronic system of the Customs Agency.
## Excise duties
Excise duties are charged as a percentage of the sales price or customs value or as a flat amount in Bulgarian lev per unit (or per other quantity measures, depending on the type of the excisable good), unless a suspension regime applies. Excisable products include petrol and diesel fuel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), heavy oil, kerosene, beer and spirits, tobacco and tobacco products, and electricity.
The applicable rates include the following\*:
\* Temporary zero excise duty rates are introduced as of July 2022 for certain energy products until 30 June 2025 (subject to the position of the European Commission).
Lower rates may apply in certain cases (e.g. beer produced by independent small breweries).
The Excise Duties and Tax Warehouse Act provides for the tax warehousing regime and regulates the production, storage, and movement of excisable products under duty suspension.
## Property tax
The annual property tax rate is determined by each municipality and ranges from 0.01% to 0.45% of the tax value of property. Individuals and legal entities that are owners of immovable property (i.e. land and buildings) are liable for property tax. For individuals and residential properties of enterprises, the taxable base is the tax value as determined by the municipal authorities based on certain statutory criteria. The taxable base for properties of enterprises is the higher of the property’s gross book value and its tax value determined by the respective municipal authorities.
A garbage collection fee is payable for immovable property at a rate determined by the local municipal council annually.
## Transfer tax
A transfer tax is due on the value of transferred real estate or motor vehicles, subject to certain exemptions (e.g. contributions in-kind, acquisitions under the Law on Privatisation and Post-privatisation Control). The rate of the transfer tax ranges from 0.1% to 3% and is determined by each municipality.
## Stamp duties
There are no stamp duties in Bulgaria.
## Payroll taxes
Upon payment of salaries, the employer should withhold personal income tax (PIT) at a flat rate of 10% due on employment remuneration, bonuses, and certain fringe benefits and should remit it to the tax authorities by the 25th day of the following month.
## National insurance contributions
National insurance contributions include social security and health insurance contributions.
The aggregate rate of social security contributions is 24.7% to 25.4%\*, of which 14.12% to 14.82%\* is payable by the employer and 10.58% is payable by the employee.
The aggregate rate of health insurance contributions is 8%, out of which 4.8% is payable by the employer and 3.2% is payable by the employee.
The total national insurance contribution rate (social security and health insurance) is 32.7% to 33.4%\*, out of which 18.92% to 19.62%\* is payable by the employer and 13.78% by the employee.
\* The range is due to the rate of contributions payable to the ‘Accident at Work and Occupational Illness Fund’, which is due only by the employer and can vary from 0.4% to 1.1%, depending on the employer’s economic activity. The rate for the administration and services sector is 0.5%.
## Insurance premium tax
A tax of 2% is levied on all insurance premiums paid under insurance agreements covering risks insured in Bulgaria. Life insurance, reinsurance, aircraft, vessels, and international transport insurance agreements are exempt from this tax. The taxable base is the insurance premium received by an insurance company under an insurance agreement.
Insurance companies and their tax representatives are liable to collect the tax and remit it to the budget quarterly by the end of the month following the quarter when the insurance premium was collected.
## Tourist tax
The tourist tax is levied with respect to the number of nights spent in hotels and other places for accommodation. The municipalities may determine the tax within a range of BGN 0.20 to BGN 3 per night, depending on the type of accommodation facility.
The tax is payable on a monthly basis by the 15th day of the following month.
## One-off taxes
The following corporate expenses are subject to a one-off tax:
The rate of the one-off tax with respect to the above expenses is 10%. Both the expenses and the related one-off taxes are deductible for CIT purposes.

## Taxable period
The financial and tax years coincide with the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Annual profit must be declared between 1 March and 30 June of the year following the financial (tax) year. Along with their annual CIT returns, companies are required to file financial information for their business activities during the year in a standard statistical form not subject to a financial audit. The self-assessment principle is applied.
## Payment of tax
If a company realised net revenue from sales of more than BGN 3 million in the year before the preceding year, it is liable for monthly CIT payments for each month in the current year. If the net sales revenue for the year before the preceding year is below BGN 3 million but above BGN 300,000, the company is liable for quarterly advance CIT payments for each quarter of the year except the fourth quarter. The amount of the monthly or quarterly CIT instalments is calculated based on the forecast taxable profit for the current year.
Companies established during the current or preceding year and companies with net revenue from sales below BGN 300,000 for the year before the preceding year are not required to pay advance CIT instalments.
The overpaid amount of CIT can be offset against advance and annual payments due for the next period. The overpaid amount may also be effectively claimed for refund by the taxpayer. The difference between the annual tax declared in the CIT return and the advance tax paid for the corresponding year must be paid by the deadline for submitting the tax return on 30 June of the following year.
### Priority order for settlement of tax and social security liabilities
Payment of tax liabilities and social security contributions should be made to four separate accounts: for tax liabilities, for general mandatory social security contributions, for supplementary mandatory retirement provisions, and for health insurance contributions.
If a taxpayer has several public liabilities (e.g. tax and/or social security liabilities) to one of the four accounts of the NRA, the one with the earlier payment date will be settled first.
## Tax audit process
Tax audits are usually performed every four to five years, corresponding to the period of the statute of limitations.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations (i.e. the period within which the state authorities are entitled to collect the tax liabilities and other related mandatory payments) is five years from the beginning of the year following the year in which the tax liabilities became payable. The above periods can be extended in certain cases. However, the maximum period of the statute of limitations is ten years.
Transfer pricing is becoming an area of focus for the tax authorities.

# Bulgaria
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 11 June 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year in Bulgaria is, without exception, the calendar year.
## Tax returns
In general, taxpayers have to submit annual tax returns. Employees who work on the basis of an employment contract with a local employer are not obligated to submit tax returns if they have employment income only, the entire income has been taxed during the year via the employer’s monthly payroll withholding, and at 31 December of the tax year they have only one employer who makes an annual reconciliation of the due tax by 31 January of the following year. In all other cases, individuals, including those who receive income under employment contracts with non-resident employers, are obligated to file an annual tax return.
For tax purposes, spouses are treated as separate taxpayers. No income splitting is allowed. Income is declared in the year in which it is actually received, regardless of the year when it was earned and to which it relates.
The deadline for submission of tax returns is 30 April of the following year. A reduction of 5% of the outstanding income tax is applicable if the annual tax return is filed electronically by 31 March of the following year, the individual has no outstanding public liabilities, and the tax is paid by 31 March of the following year. The discount of 5% is capped at BGN 500.
Individuals are allowed to file a one-off corrective tax return without a penalty by 30 September of the following year.
The following information also needs to be declared in the annual PIT return of a Bulgarian tax resident:
As of 1 January 2018, Bulgarian tax resident individuals are able to report the following in their annual PIT return:
The reasons for this amendment are optimisation of the processes related to tax inspections and tax audits of individuals concerning the comparison of the property acquired in the course of the year and the reported income. Up to now, there was no possibility to report received non-taxable income, and its assessment was possible only through the performance of a tax inspection or tax audit.
## Payment of tax
The deadline for payment is 30 April of the following year.
PIT for employees is withheld by the employer from the gross remuneration on a monthly basis. The employer acts as an agent of the revenue authorities and transfers the tax due to the budget. Certain taxpayers who are not employees, such as freelancers, must pay quarterly advance taxes, regardless of whether the payer is a Bulgarian or non-Bulgarian resident entity.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitation is currently five years from 1 January of the year following the year in which the tax was due for payment.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 11 June 2024
Bulgarian tax residents are taxed on their worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed on their income from Bulgarian sources only, through a permanent establishment (PE) and/or via withholding tax (WHT), depending on the case (*see the [Branch income](bulgaria/corporate/branch-income.html)* *section*).
In general, corporate income is subject to CIT at a flat rate of 10%.
## Alternative tax
Income earned by organisers of gambling games for which the bet is included in the price of a phone or other telecommunication service is subject to 15% alternative tax, applied on the increase in the price of the phone or other telecommunication service (i.e. the difference between the regular price of the service and the new higher price due to the gambling game). A fixed-sum tax is applied to the operation of gaming machines.
Online gambling games are exempt from the alternative tax (and are subject to standard CIT instead), as are a significant part of the other land-based gambling games (i.e. totto; lotto sports betting, including horse and dog racing; and betting on random events or related to the knowledge of facts).
## Tonnage tax regime
A special alternative tax regime applies to the operation of commercial maritime vessels, as per their net tonnage, at a rate of 10%.
## Local income taxes
There are no provincial or local government corporate income taxes in Bulgaria.

## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 11 June 2024
## 15% global minimum tax adopted in Bulgaria as of 1 January 2024
While Bulgaria is keeping its standard 10% nominal corporate income tax (CIT) rate, starting 1 January 2024, Bulgarian entities in scope of the so-called ‘global minimum tax’ will be subject to a minimum effective tax rate of 15%.
The law implementing the European Union (EU) Global Minimum Tax Directive was finally voted by the Bulgarian Parliament on 12 December 2023.
Ever since the publication of the draft bill in September 2023, the key debate was around some important reliefs allowed under the EU Directive that Bulgaria refused to introduce. After strong reactions from businesses, the Parliament granted at least a partial relief for capital investments in fixed assets in Bulgaria.
The complex Pillar Two legislation will impact many large businesses in Bulgaria. Companies should prioritise the analysis of the financial and administrative impact of the new rules on their business organisation.
## Public country-by-country (CbC) reporting adopted in Bulgaria as of 1 January 2025
The EU Directive on Public CbC Reporting has been recently implemented into the local legislation. The Directive is applicable to both EU-headquartered multinational enterprises (MNEs) and non-EU-headquartered MNEs doing business in the European Union through a subsidiary or branch with a total consolidated revenue of more than 1.5 billion Bulgarian lev (BGN) (750 million euros [EUR]).
Based on the legislation, MNEs would be required to publicly disclose certain tax-related information broken down by EU member states, non-cooperative jurisdictions, and all other jurisdictions on an aggregated level. Such information should be disclosed for the financial years starting on or after 22 June 2024. Accordingly, the first financial year subject to disclosure will be 2025 for companies using the fiscal year-end of 31 December.
## Adjustment of input value-added tax (VAT) credit for scrapping or loss of goods
Taxpayers will no longer need to make adjustments of VAT credit in the case of (i) duly proved or confirmed destruction of goods, including as a result of scrapping due to objective obsolescence, and (ii) scrapping when the goods are sold as a taxable supply. Prior to the changes, the VAT Act required such adjustments unless other exceptions were applicable. Due to this, there may be opportunities to apply for refund of VAT paid in similar situations for past periods.
## Changes in the threshold for VAT registration
From 1 January 2025, the VAT registration threshold will be increased to BGN 166,000.
## Changes to the reduced VAT rates
The reduced VAT rate of 9% for restaurant and catering services, the use of sports facilities, and general tourist service is extended until the end of 2024 (it was supposed to expire at the end of 2023).
The 0% VAT rate for bread and flour is extended until the end of June 2024 (it was supposed to expire at the end of June 2023).

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 11 June 2024
A corporation is resident in Bulgaria for tax purposes if it is incorporated in Bulgaria.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
PEs of foreign tax residents (e.g. branches) are treated as separate entities similar to Bulgarian residents for tax and accounting purposes.
The definition of a PE in the Bulgarian legislation follows, in general, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) model; however, it covers a broader scope of activities leading to a tax presence in Bulgaria. A PE is generally defined as a fixed place (own, rented, or otherwise used) through which a foreign entity partly or wholly carries out business activities in the country.

# Bulgaria
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 11 June 2024
## Depreciation and depletion
For accounting purposes, depreciation is calculated in accordance with the straight-line, progressive, or declining-balance methods. Accounting regulations permit Bulgarian companies to establish a depreciation schedule for each tangible and intangible fixed asset on the basis of the method chosen by the company.
For tax purposes, only the straight-line method is permitted. For machines and equipment that are part of the initial investment, accelerated depreciation may also apply, subject to certain conditions.
For tax purposes, fixed assets are divided into the following seven categories:
| Category | Assets | Maximum rates (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| I | Massive buildings, industrial constructions/equipment, transmission facilities/lines (including electricity) | 4 |
| II | Machinery, production facilities, apparatuses | 30/50 |
| III | Vehicles (except cars), coverage of roads and runways | 10 |
| IV | Computers, peripherals to computers, software and rights to use software, mobile phones | 50 |
| V | Cars | 25 |
| VI | Long-term intangibles with legal or contractual limitations on the period of use | 33⅓ |
| VII | Other assets | 15 |
Under certain conditions, assets classified in Category II that are new may be depreciated at a maximum rate of 50% for tax purposes.
The depreciation rate for Category VI is determined by the period of limitations, but not more than 33⅓%.
Depletion is not specifically regulated for tax purposes.
## Goodwill
Goodwill is not amortisable under Bulgarian tax law.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses may be recognised as deductible in the year of establishment of the company.
## Interest expenses/borrowing costs
Interest expenses are recognised as deductible expenses, subject to the thin capitalisation rules (*see the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*) and the interest limitation rules applicable in Bulgaria.
### Interest limitation regime
As of 1 January 2019, in addition to the existing thin capitalisation regime, new interest limitation rules are introduced to the CIT Act, transposing the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD).
Under the interest limitation regime, net borrowing costs are deductible for tax purposes in the year when incurred, up to 30% of the company’s tax-adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA).
If the net borrowing costs for the year are up to EUR 3 million, no restrictions apply under the interest limitation regime (the thin capitalisation rules may still apply).
Any resulting non-deductible borrowing costs can be carried forward and deducted in future years without a time limitation based on a special formula.
Credit institutions are out of the scope of the interest limitation regime.
## Bad debt
Bad debt impairment costs can be deducted upon expiration of the statute of limitation period. Also, the impairment costs can be recognised for tax purposes upon transferring the receivables. Such impairment costs are tax deductible for financial institutions in the year of recognition.
## Charitable contributions
Generally, charitable contributions to certain organisations or persons, specified by law, can be deductible at up to 10% of a company’s accounting profit.
## Fines and penalties
Expenses for fines and penalties for violation of the legislation are not deductible.
## Taxes
CIT is not deductible for tax purposes. However, other taxes, such as one-off taxes on certain expenses (e.g. representative expenses, certain types of fringe benefits) or local taxes and fees may be recognised as deductible for CIT purposes.
## Net operating losses
The taxpayer has the right to carry forward tax losses incurred in a given year over the following five years. The loss subject to carryforward is the negative amount of the financial result adjusted for tax purposes, with certain add-backs and deductions specified in the tax legislation.
Tax losses may be reversed up to the amount of the positive financial result after tax adjustments (without the effect of the loss subject to be carried forward itself).
Carryforwards of foreign-source losses may only offset income from the same source. However, EU/EEA-source losses may offset income from other sources, including Bulgarian sources.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments to foreign affiliates may be subject to recalculation by the tax authorities if such payments are not made at arm’s length (as part of the general transfer pricing requirements).

# Bulgaria
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 11 June 2024
No group consolidation is permitted for tax purposes in Bulgaria. All companies must pay tax on the basis of individually assessable profits and losses.
## Transfer pricing
Bulgarian law requires that taxpayers determine their taxable profits and incomes applying the arm’s-length principle to prices at which they exchange goods, services, and intangibles with related parties (transfer prices). Bulgarian transfer pricing rules generally follow OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines.
Transfer prices are not set in compliance with the arm’s-length principle where:
The market interest rate is defined as the interest payable under the same conditions for a loan provided or received, notwithstanding the form of the loan, between non-related parties. The market interest is determined according to the market conditions.
The taxable person should be able to evidence that its relations with related parties are in line with the arm’s-length principle.
For the purposes of transfer pricing rules, market prices are determined by the following methods:
Recently, the revenue authorities are increasingly focusing on the transfer pricing area.
As of 2020, preparation of transfer pricing documentation justifying the arm’s-length nature of related-party transactions is mandatory under certain conditions.
Bulgarian entities, as well as foreign entities acting through PEs in Bulgaria, which participate in cross-border related-party transactions and meet certain criteria (exceed certain thresholds), will be required to prepare transfer pricing documentation, comprising:
The contents of the documentation are explicitly listed in the Bulgarian Tax and Social Security Procedure Code.
The first year for which a Local file should be available is 2020 (with a deadline for preparation of the file by 30 June 2021).
Currently, there is no possibility to obtain an Advance Pricing Agreement (APA). However, it is possible to obtain an opinion from the revenue authorities on a case-by-case basis. Such opinions are not binding, but they may provide protection from assessment of interest for late payment and penalties.
## Mandatory country-by-country (CbC) reporting obligations and notification requirements
The following entities have the obligation to submit CbC reports to the National Revenue Agency (NRA):
The CbC reports shall contain certain types of financial information, as well as information on the business activities of all group entities.
The reports will be automatically exchanged between the EU member states or other jurisdictions with which Bulgaria has signed international agreements. An exception exists for the reports submitted by MNEs with group revenue exceeding BGN 100 million whose ultimate parent company is a Bulgarian tax resident, which will not be subject to the automatic exchange of information with other jurisdictions.
The first year for which CbC reports should have been filed by Bulgarian ultimate parent companies or surrogate parent entities was fiscal year (FY) 2016. In the other cases, the first reporting year was FY 2017.
### Notification requirements
Bulgarian tax residents that are part of an MNE group shall notify the NRA of the group entity that will submit the CbC report. The notification deadline is the last day of the reporting fiscal year of the MNE group.
The first year for which CbC notifications should have been submitted was FY 2016 (the notification deadline for FY 2016 was 31 December 2017).
## Thin capitalisation
Interest payable by local companies to local or foreign persons may be restricted by the thin capitalisation rules (which also apply to interest due to non-affiliated companies).
The tax deductibility for interest expenses that exceed interest income is restricted to 75% of the accounting result of the company, exclusive of interest income and expense. If the accounting result of the company before including the effect of the interest income and expenses is a loss, none of the net interest expense will be deductible for tax purposes. Interest on bank loans and interest under financial lease agreements are subject to thin capitalisation regulations only when the agreements are between related parties or guaranteed by or extended at the order of a related party.
The thin capitalisation rules do not apply if the debt-to-equity ratio does not exceed 3:1 for the respective tax period.
Interest expenses restricted in a given year under the thin capitalisation rules may be deducted from the financial result for tax purposes during the following years (as of January 2019, the previously existing five-year carryforward term has been removed). This reversal may be made up to the tax allowed interest expenses, as per the above formula (considering also potential limitations in the deductibility capacity under the interest limitation regime, where applicable).
Where both the borrower under a bank loan or financial lease and its related party provide a guarantee or collateral, interest costs will not be regulated if the own guarantee / collateral provided by the borrower is sufficient to cover the whole bank loan / lease.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
A CFC regime has been introduced for the first time in Bulgaria as of 1 January 2019.
Undistributed profits of low-taxed foreign subsidiaries (and PEs) shall be included in the tax base of the Bulgarian controlling entity, subject to 10% Bulgarian CIT. Certain exemptions apply, including that profits of CFCs with substantive economic activity will not be taxed in Bulgaria.
A foreign entity or a PE is treated as a CFC if it meets the controlling interest test (generally defined as more than 50% of voting rights, capital, or entitlement to profits) and a low-taxation test.
Certain measures apply to avoid double taxation (e.g. tax credit for foreign tax paid by the CFC abroad, measures in case of subsequent dividend distribution).
## Exit taxation
As of 1 January 2020, new exit tax rules are introduced in accordance with the EU ATAD.
The transfer of assets or activities outside of Bulgaria (but within the same enterprise) may be subject to Bulgarian CIT in the following scenarios:
where Bulgaria ends up losing taxing rights on any subsequent disposals of the assets / business.
Exit tax is levied on the excess of the market value of the assets / business over their tax value at the time of the transfer. If the result is a capital loss, it is tax-deductible.
Special rules are introduced in certain circumstances of transfers (e.g. of temporary nature).
The existing rules on transfer of services between a PE and a head office in Bulgaria and abroad are slightly amended.
## Hybrid mismatch rules
As of 1 January 2020, hybrid mismatch rules are introduced based on Directive 2017/952/EU (ATAD II).
The new rules aim to counter tax avoidance based on different characterisation of tax items between two or more jurisdictions.
The regime is applicable:
Hybrid mismatches include situations, where:

# Bulgaria
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 11 June 2024
Although branches are not deemed to be separate legal persons, branches of non-resident companies have separate balance sheets and profit and loss accounts and are subject to CIT at the standard rate of 10% as well as other general taxes (e.g. VAT, property tax).
Representative offices of foreign entities are not allowed to carry out business activities and are not subject to CIT. A representative office registered under the Encouragement of Investments Act may perform only those activities that are not regarded as ‘economic activities’ (e.g. marketing activities normally carried out by a representative office and auxiliary to the activities of its head office). Representative offices do not constitute PEs of the non-resident entities unless they engage in business activities in breach of the law.
Profits repatriated by a branch to its head office abroad are not subject to WHT. However, certain income payable by a Bulgarian branch or a PE to other parts of the enterprise abroad may trigger WHT (e.g. income from technical services, interest, royalties) in certain cases.

## Intergovernmental agreements (IGAs)
In December 2014, Bulgaria and the United States signed and disclosed a non-reciprocal Model 1B IGA to implement the tax reporting and withholding procedures associated with the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA).
As of 1 January 2016, Bulgaria has implemented the rules on automatic exchange of financial information in compliance with the EU law, OECD recommendations, and FATCA. The tax authorities will exchange financial information with foreign tax offices on an annual basis.
The information concerns individual and company accounts (including trusts, foundations, and pass-through foreign control entities), account balances, and fund movements related to dividends, interest, sales proceeds, assets, etc.
## Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS)
Bulgaria has incorporated measures tackling hybrid mismatches in its Corporate Income Tax Act (e.g. non-taxable dividends from EU/EEA subsidiaries become taxable if the dividend payment is deductible at the level of the paying entity).
The Bulgarian tax authorities generally follow the other BEPS developments and consider them in their approach.
## Multilateral Instrument (MLI)
Bulgaria is a signatory to the MLI, as of 7 June 2017.
With a law promulgated in the State Gazette in June 2022, Bulgaria ratified the MLI. Detailed information regarding the position/reservations of Bulgaria on the provisions of the MLI is to be deposited and published on the official OECD website.
## Common reporting standard (CRS)
Bulgaria has incorporated the CRS in its domestic Tax and Social Security Procedure Code, effective as of 1 January 2016. Detailed information can be found in the OECD’s Automatic Exchange Portal at the OECD BEPS portal.
## DAC 6 reporting regime for cross-border tax planning arrangements
Bulgaria has introduced the so-called EU DAC 6 reporting framework for cross-border tax arrangements that meet any of the explicitly listed specific features (hallmarks).

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 11 June 2024
## Minimum monthly salary
As of 1 January 2024, the minimum monthly salary is increased to 933 Bulgarian lev (BGN) (from BGN 780 for 2023).
## Tax relief for children
The increased value (the same as for 2022) for tax reliefs for minor children will apply for 2023. One of the parents will be able to deduct from their annual tax base:
The relief for 2023 may be applied through the employer on a monthly basis or through the quarterly/annual tax return(s) of the beneficiary parent.
## Trading in financial assets
Transactions with virtual currencies are expressly added to the list of taxable transactions with financial assets. Until now, virtual currencies were not expressly included in the list of taxable financial assets; nevertheless, the tax authorities had the view that these should have been taxed (being financial assets). The tax base of all transactions with financial assets is decreased by a fixed amount of 10% (to give some allowance to the investors to cover costs related to the investment operations).
## Changes in the income certificate under Article 45 of the Personal Income Tax Act (PITA)
Upon request by the employees, the employer shall issue a standard template income certificate for the employment income paid during the respective year, including for certain types of non-taxable income, such as:
## Changes in the report submitted by the payer of non-employment income under Article 73 of the PITA
The amounts reported in the declaration under Article 73(1) of the PITA (for year 2024 and onwards) shall also include:
## Opportunity for declaring non-taxable income and income taxed with final tax
Bulgarian residents are now able to voluntarily report information for an extended scope of non-taxable income, as well as income taxed with final tax, in the annual personal tax return under Article 50 of the PITA.
## Change in the scope of income that employers should report in the income statements
At the request of the employee, the employer should issue an income statement for non-taxable income from labour relations under Article 24 of the PITA. The income statement should include the total amounts from food vouchers, paid non-taxable benefits, one-time benefits at the expense of social costs, non-taxable monetary and material prizes, etc.
Employers should also report such types of non-taxable income in the declaration under Article 73, Paragraph 6 of the PITA.
The changes apply to income paid in 2022 as well.
## Fast track for granting a Blue Card for high-tech companies relocating employees to Bulgaria
The Blue Card will be a key tool for attracting highly qualified personnel, featuring faster procedures, more flexible and inclusive admission criteria, and broader rights, including facilitated short- and long-term mobility.
The new 'fast track' will affect applications for groups of a minimum of ten employees and is intended to benefit companies aiming to relocate whole offices and their activities and employees from non-European Union (EU) countries to Bulgaria.
In order for Blue Card applications to be considered as priority ones, they need to meet the following conditions:

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 11 June 2024
## Personal deductions
### Charitable contributions
Donations to certain organisations are deductible up to the defined limits (i.e. the total amount of donations may not exceed 65% of the total annual taxable base of the individual).
### Social security contributions
### Health and life insurance contributions
Voluntary pension and unemployment contributions, as well as certain health insurance and life insurance contributions, are deductible up to certain limits.
### Mortgage interest expenses
Young married couples (including foreign individual tax residents of an EU/EEA member state) may deduct from their annual taxable income the interest on mortgage loans for the first BGN 100,000 of the loan, under certain conditions.
### Children and disabled children
Tax incentives can be utilised both by local and EU/EEA established individuals. The tax incentives for children provide for reduction of the total annual tax base calculated under the PITA of the parent in the following amounts:
The conditions for this tax relief require that the child is underage, not placed in a specialised care institution as at 31 December of the fiscal year, and is a resident of an EU/EEA member state as at the same date. This relief can be used by a parent who is not deprived of parental rights, a guardian, a family member or close relative where the child is placed, or a foster parent. Only one parent (or foster parent or close relative) may benefit from this new tax relief. If a double benefit is determined after а review, the amount of the relief has to be returned to the authorities.
Tax incentives of BGN 12,000 per a disabled child are also introduced and are applicable under certain specific conditions.
A new opportunity is introduced with regards to the tax relief for children. Individuals may use the tax relief for children in advance by reducing the monthly taxable base for July and October with certain amounts by BGN 500 per month per child (BGN 1,000 per month per disabled child) for employment income, as follows:
## Tax relief for individuals who use non-cash methods for payment of their expenses
The requirements for tax relief for individuals who use non-cash methods for payment of their expenses are that the individual has received taxable income during the tax year, 100% of the taxable income to be received is by bank transfers, at least 80% of the expenses of the individual are to be paid by non-cash methods, and the individual must have no outstanding public liabilities at the date of filing of the annual tax return. The tax relief is 1% from the total tax liability in Bulgaria for the tax year, but capped to BGN 500.
All tax reliefs above may be used only in case the individual has no outstanding public liabilities at the date of filing of the annual tax return.
## Tax relief for improvements and/or repairs made to a real estate property located in Bulgaria
Both local and EU/EEA established individuals can benefit. The tax relief provides for reduction of the total annual tax base calculated under the PITA with the payments made during the year for work done in relation to improvements and/or repair of a real estate up to BGN 2,000.
The tax relief is applicable under certain specific conditions.
## Business deductions
Individuals earning certain types of income can deduct pre-estimated statutory expenses in calculating their taxable income:

## Visas and work permits
Effective from 1 January 2007, EU nationals are not required to obtain visas or work permits to be allowed to enter or work in the country. EU nationals wishing to work or reside in Bulgaria for more than three months should obtain a certificate of residence. This is a relatively straightforward registration procedure (i.e. the certificate is issued within one working day and may be valid for up to five years if a valid contract/assignment letter/financial means and social security coverage is in place for this term).
Non-EU nationals need to obtain a work permit in order to legally work in the country. The procedure is time-consuming, and various documents need to be submitted to the labour authorities. On the basis of the work permit, the expatriate should apply for a long-term visa type D and later for a Bulgarian residence permit, which would allow one to reside and work legally in Bulgaria.
No work permits are required for non-EU nationals who are registered with Bulgarian Commercial Register as managers, board members, procurators, or controllers of Bulgarian companies or are registered with the Bulgarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry as heads of representative offices of foreign entities. Such individuals need a visa D and a residence permit only.
### Blue Card Regime
As of 2011, the so-called ‘Blue Card’ was introduced, which gives working/residing rights in Bulgaria (and residence rights in a few EU member states) to non-EU nationals with high qualification and specialisation skills. The main requirements for obtaining a Blue Card in Bulgaria are:
As of 23 March 2018, new rules have been adopted in relation to the issuance of the EU Blue Card for certain types of highly skilled non-EU professionals:
As of 2022, a new regime, called 'fast track', has been introduced for high-tech companies relocating employees to Bulgaria. This regime is intended to ease the relocation of big groups as they would be considered priority applications. In order to qualify, the applicants need to meet the following criteria:
Changes to the Law on Health Insurance have also been adopted, through which holders of the EU Blue Card enter the circle of persons subject to compulsory health insurance in Bulgaria.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 11 June 2024
Individuals must pay personal income tax (PIT) on their gross income less any mandatory social security contributions they make at their own expense. Very few other deductions are possible.
## Employment income
Taxable income from work on the basis of an employment contract includes the following:
Employment income is taxed at a 10% flat tax rate.
## Business income
Business income of individuals registered as sole traders form the taxable base under the provisions of the Corporate Income Tax (CIT) Act (i.e. income minus expenses plus adjustments equals taxable profit). If the turnover exceeds BGN 100,000 in 12 consecutive months, the sole trader is subject to VAT registration. VAT registration may be required regardless of the turnover in certain cases.
Patent activities of sole traders are taxed under the provisions of the Local Taxes and Fees Act.
Sole traders file annual PIT returns. The deadline for reporting and payment of PIT due by sole traders is between 1 March and 30 June.
Sole traders can benefit from a 5% discount, provided that they report and pay their PIT due until 31 March of the following year.
## Capital gains and investment income
Bulgarian tax residents (including expatriates who are considered Bulgarian tax residents) are taxed on capital gains and investment income realised from all sources during their period of residence. Foreign tax residents are taxed only on the capital gains and investment income derived from sources in Bulgaria.
### Capital gains
Capital gains are taxed on an annual basis with a 10% flat tax rate if received by Bulgarian tax residents, and with a 10% final withholding tax (WHT) if received by non-residents. Certain exemptions provided in respect of capital gains are discussed under *Exempt income below*.
The taxable base for income from capital gains is determined as follows:
### Dividend income
Dividends and liquidation proceeds paid by Bulgarian and foreign entities are subject to a 5% final WHT at source. When the dividends/liquidation proceeds are paid by non-resident entities who are not obligated to withhold and remit the Bulgarian taxes, the tax is payable by the recipient themselves on an annual basis. The dividend income paid by non-resident entities should also be reported in the annual tax return.
### Interest income
Interest income from bank accounts in the European Union / European Economic Area is tax free as of 1 April 2022.
Interest income from bank accounts outside the European Union / European Economic Area is taxable at a tax rate of 10% as of 1 April 2022 instead of a final tax rate of 8% for Bulgarian tax residents and 10% final tax rate for non-Bulgarian tax residents.
### Rental income
Income from rent or other rights of use against consideration (except for rent from agricultural land), as well as income from annuities and leases, is subject to quarterly advance PIT at 10% and a final tax on an annual basis at the flat rate of 10%. Advance tax is not due for the fourth quarter unless the individual confirms in writing before the payer of the income one's willingness to apply an advance tax withholding for the fourth quarter.
For tax purposes, a statutory deduction of 10% of the gross income is provided.
### Royalty income
Royalties are taxed on an annual basis with a 10% flat tax rate if received by Bulgarian tax residents and a 10% final WHT if received by non-residents.
## Other income
The following basic types of income are also subject to PIT (the list, however, is not comprehensive).
Amounts redeemed early from voluntary pension, health, unemployment and/or vocational qualification and life insurance coverage, are subject to 10% final tax.
## Exempt income
Some types of non-taxable income are listed below, subject to specific conditions and requirements set in the law:
Property received on the grounds of inheritance, donation, or restitution is not considered income taxable under the PITA. However, other taxes and fees may be applicable.
