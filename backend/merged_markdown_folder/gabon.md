## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 04 March 2024
Subject to the provisions of double tax treaties (DTTs), profits subject to corporate income tax (CIT) in Gabon are those obtained by companies exploited in Gabon or those relating to operations carried out in this country.
As the Uniform Act of the Organisation for the Harmonisation of Business Law in Africa (OHADA) relating to the law of companies and economic interest groups has introduced the simplified stock company (SAS) in the OHADA area, the General Tax Code has enlarged the application of the CIT to include the SAS. The application of the CIT has been extended, on an optional manner, to companies of owners of ships or built and unbuilt properties, for the part of the shareholders indefinitely liable and whose identity is known by the administration.
The CIT rate is fixed at 30%.
The CIT rate is 35% for companies operating in the oil and mining sectors.
CIT is assessed on profits minus deductible expenses and charges. Profits are composed of all operations carried out in Gabon by companies during the period of taxation, including, notably, capital gains on fixed assets.
Capital gain realised in the scope of the transfer of social rights of persons whose assets are mainly constituted of such rights or rights held directly or indirectly in a company located in Gabon is subject to CIT in Gabon. The company located in Gabon whose rights are transferred must collect and remit to the tax administration, within one month from the realisation of the transfer, the amount corresponding to a discharge levy of 20% carried out on the capital gains resulting from the transfer of social rights.
Non-resident companies shall be taxed via withholding tax (WHT) at the rate of 20% for income raised in Gabon if they have no permanent establishment (PE) in Gabon.
In cases where non-resident companies have PE in Gabon, they shall be subject to CIT on the income raised in Gabon via the Gabonese PE.
## *Impôt Minimum Forfaitaire* (IMF)
The IMF is a lower limit to the CIT and is calculated as 1% of the global turnover carried out during the fiscal year of taxation.
The turnover on which the IMF is calculated corresponds to all the revenues resulting from the operations carried out during the fiscal year, including the financial and exceptional profits.
## *Minimum de Perception* (Minimum of Perception)
The Minimum of Perception is the ultimate lower limit to the CIT, as the amount of CIT paid by a taxpayer cannot be less than XAF 1 million, even in the absence of profit.
Companies exempted from CIT, as well as new companies, are exempted from the IMF and the Minimum of Perception.
The duration of exemption is three years for small and medium enterprises.
## Local income taxes
There are no local government taxes on income in Gabon.

## Social security contributions
Employees must contribute to the social security system (National Social Security Fund [CNSS]) together with the employer.
The taxable basis is made up of gross salaries, including indemnities considered as elements of the salary and any benefits in kind. However, there is an annual ceiling of XAF 18 million (or XAF 1.5 million per month).
The allowances for professional expenses are excluded from the taxable basis, subject to the fact that they are used according to their purpose and that they are not exaggerated.
The employees pay 2.5% for the CNSS retirement insurance and 1% for the National Disease Insurance and Social Guarantee Fund (CNAMGS) health insurance.
The other social security contributions represent 20.1% of the taxable salary. They are paid by the employer according to the following apportionment:
The employer is the debtor before the CNSS for the payment of the total social security contributions, including the portion due by the employees, which is withheld monthly on each employee's salary.
## Capital gains tax
Capital gains are subject to a tax on capital gain at a rate of 20%.
This tax must be paid by the taxpayer who has made the said capital gain before 30 April of the year following the year during which the capital gain has been made.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate in Gabon is 18%, which applies to all transactions unless otherwise provided for by the law.

## Payment of tax
Tax is payable to the General Tax Office in two instalments on 30 November and 30 January. The balance of the tax due must be paid by 30 April. The first instalment must equal one-quarter of the tax assessed in the previous year and the second instalment must equal one-third of this tax.

The Tax Inspectors proceed to audits at the head office or at the place of the taxpayer’s main establishment.
The main steps of the tax audit are the following:
Exceptionally, the tax administration can proceed with on-site verification in case of discovery of hidden activities and no respect of filing and payment requirement without prior notification of a tax audit.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 04 March 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is a cumulative tax levied on the sale of goods and the provision of services rendered or used in Gabon.
There are four VAT rates:
Taxable persons are individuals or legal entities carrying out, usually or occasionally, in an independent manner, taxable operations in the scope of an economic activity and for an onerous consideration.
The aforesaid persons, subject to CIT or personal income tax (PIT), being registered or not, are liable to VAT should their turnover out of taxes reach XAF 60 million.
### VAT on real estate
Operations in relation to the construction or sale of real estate, such as sales of lands to build on, delivery of new buildings, or self-delivery of some buildings, carried out by persons subject to VAT in the scope of their economic activities are subject to VAT on real estate.
The taxpayer of the VAT on real estate is the builder of the building.
The VAT is payable on the delivery date.
The deeds relating to the transfer of buildings subject to VAT on real estate are subject to registration formalities.
The VAT on real estate is calculated based on the sale price as determined by the parties or on the real value of the real estate in case it is superior.
The applicable rate is 18%.
### Deferred payment of VAT on importations
Industrial and exporter companies are allowed to proceed to a deferred payment of VAT due on importations of goods, notably materials, equipment, industrial machinery, and spare parts where the total value exceeds XAF 100 million, subject to the fulfilment of the following required and cumulative conditions:
Operations that do not give rise to VAT deduction are excluded from the benefit of the deferred VAT payment mechanism.
In principle, VAT due on importation of goods cannot be paid under the credit-removal regime, except when otherwise provided as mentioned above.
## Special Solidarity Contribution (SSC)
SSC is a tax levied on the sale of goods and the provision of services rendered or used in Gabon based on similar principles as VAT.
The SSC must be invoiced by the taxpayers (natural and legal persons) carrying out, on as usual or occasional basis, taxable transactions whose annual turnover, excluding taxes, is at least XAF 30 million.
The arrangements for the taxation of the said contribution are similar to those applicable to VAT.
This contribution aims to replace the contribution to Health Insurance (ROAM) that was formerly due by operators of the mobile telecommunication sector.
The SSC is calculated based on the amount invoiced, out of taxes.
The applicable rate is 1%.
## Customs duties
Gabon is member of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC), a customs union that comprises countries from Central Africa.
Four customs regimes are available in Gabon, notably one standard regime and three specific regimes (an exemption regime, a temporary admission regime, and a reduced tax regime).
Apart from customs duties, the importation of merchandise in Gabon is subject to the community tax of integration (CCI) at a rate of 0.4% and to the OHADA withholding (duty) at a rate of 0.05% of the customs value of the imported merchandise.
The CAF is paid at a single rate of 0.2% of the customs value of the products originating from states that are not members of the African Union.
The Amended Financial Act 2020 has provided a six-months period of exemption of customs duties and taxes due in the scope of the importation of some goods related to the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The list of the goods shall be published in a Decree.
## Excise duty
Excise duty principally applies to luxury goods, such as alcoholic drinks, perfume and cosmetic products, caviar, salmon, cigars, and cigarettes.
The rates of the excise duty are between 5% and 40%.
In addition to the *ad valorem* rate, there is a specific tax based on the quantities.
The excise duties are currently the following:
## Tax on property
Single property tax (CFU) is levied annually on registered properties, unless an exemption applies.
It is owed by all natural and legal persons who own one or more land holdings on the 1st of January of the taxation year.
The owners of the properties subject to the CFU must declare them and proceed with the payment of the tax on the 30 of March of each year.
For natural persons, the CFU is determined on the basis of taxable income that is equal to the actual or computed rental value of the properties, following a deduction of 75% to take into account wear and tear, maintenance and repair costs.
For legal persons, the CFU is determined on the basis of taxable income that is equal to the actual or computed rental value of the properties, following a deduction of 25% to take into account wear and tear, maintenance and repair costs.
For the calculation of the CFU, the following rates are applied to the aggregate net taxable rental value :
## Transfer tax
The tax on funds transfer is due on remote transfer operations carried out in Gabon at destination of countries outside the Central Africa Monetary Union (UMAC) countries.
The tax is calculated on the amount of the funds to be transferred, except for related fees and commissions paid by the giver.
The rate of the transfer tax is 1.5%.
## Stamp duty
A stamp duty is levied on all paperwork relating to civil and judicial actions and to documents that could be produced in court as evidence.
All signatories for mutually binding contracts, lenders and borrowers for loans, and ministerial officials who receive or modify deeds announcing unstamped deeds or books are jointly responsible for the payment of stamp duties and fines.
## Business license tax
The business license tax applies to both individuals and entities, Gabonese and foreign, engaged in a profession, business, or industry in Gabon.
Business license tax corresponds to a professional tax borne annually. It is deductible from the taxable income for CIT purposes.
The head of the group of companies is exempted from the payment of the business license tax.
## Franchise tax
The franchise tax is a fixed annual duty varying from XAF 10,000 to XAF 500,000, according to the size, nature, and location of the company. Each company that carries on a trade, business, or activity that is not expressly exempted is liable for franchise tax.
Activities that are expressly exempted from franchise tax are those carried out by companies of provident, craftsmen, teachers and professors, lyrical and dramatic artists, farmers, cattle-breeders, fishers, etc.
## Registration duties
Registration duties in Gabon are fixed, proportional, or progressive, depending on the nature of the acts and transfers in question.
## Payroll taxes
PIT and complementary tax on salary (TCTS) are withheld monthly by the employer and paid to the Treasury before the 15th day of the following month.
## Social security contributions
Employers must contribute to the social security system, which consists of the National Social Security Fund (CNSS) and the National Disease Insurance and Social Guarantee Fund (CNAMGS).
The taxable basis for social security contributions to the benefit of the CNSS is made up of gross salaries, including indemnities having the function of a salary and any benefits in kind. However, there is an annual ceiling of XAF 18 million (or XAF 1.5 million per month).
The taxable basis for social security contributions to the benefit of the CNAMGS is made up of gross salaries, including taxable indemnities, up to the limit of a monthly ceiling of XAF 2.5 million.
The social security contributions due by the employer for both funds are determined according to the following rates:
| Contribution to CNSS | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Family allowances | 8 |
| Industrial accidents (work injuries) | 3 |
| Retirement pensions | 5 |
| Contribution to CNAMGS | Rate (%) |
| Health evacuation funds | 0.6 |
| Medication distribution | 2 |
| Hospitalisations | 1.5 |
| **Total** | **20.1** |
## Tax on insurance premiums
Insurance or annuity agreements made with insurance companies or any other Gabonese or foreign insurer are subject to an annual obligatory tax.
The tax is levied on the sums charged by the insurer and on any accessory payments made to this party by the insured party according to the following rates:
| Nature of the policies | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Marine policies | 5 |
| Life policies | Exempt |
| Fire policies | 30 |
| Other (e.g. personal liability, transportation) | 8 |
| Reinsurance | Exempt |

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 04 March 2024
Individuals are liable to personal income tax (*Impôts sur le revenu des personnes physiques* or IRPP) in Gabon on all wages, salaries, annuities, fees, and allowances received as remuneration for any activity carried out in Gabon.
Individuals who have their habitual residence abroad are liable to the IRPP for the whole of their revenues having origin in Gabon.
The reimbursement of personal taxes such as IRPP and complementary tax on salaries (TCTS) of the employees and managers, by companies, whatever the conditions and denomination of the tax may be, is strictly forbidden.
## Personal income tax (IRPP) rates
The IRPP is determined according to a progressive rates scale established according to the taxpayer's family charges (with a maximum of six dependent children) and according to income brackets.
The situation of the taxpayer is appreciated at 1 January of the year of payment of the wages being the subject of the taxation or at the end of the same year in the event of a wedding or increase of the number of dependants.
The number of shares to be taken into account for the assessment of the taxable income is fixed as follows:
| Family status | Number of shares |
| --- | --- |
| Unmarried, divorced, or widowed person without dependent child | 1 |
| Married person without dependent child or unmarried or divorced person having a dependent child | 2 |
| Person married or widowed within two years after the death of the spouse, having a dependent child, or unmarried, divorced person having two dependent children | 2.5 |
| Person married or widowed within two years after the death of the spouse, having two dependent children, or unmarried, divorced person having three dependent children | 3 |
| Person married or widowed within two years after the death of the spouse, having three dependent children, or unmarried, divorced person having four dependent children | 3.5 |
| Each additional child (up to a maximum of six children) | 0.5 |
The number of shares enables the determination of a ratio ‘Q’, which enables the determination of the income bracket of the employee as set out hereafter:
Q = [(S x 12) - A] / P *(as Q is annual)*
P = Family quotient (number of shares).
S = Monthly taxable gross income.
A = 20% allowance.
The amount of the tax is determined according to the following progressive rates:
| Part of the taxable revenue for 1 share (Q) | | Rate of tax |
| --- | --- | --- |
| From | To |
| 0 | 1,500,000 | 0 |
| 1,500,001 | 1,920,000 | 5% x Q - 75,000 |
| 1,920,001 | 2,700,000 | 10% x Q - 171,000 |
| 2,700,001 | 3,600,000 | 15% x Q - 306,000 |
| 3,600,001 | 5,160,000 | 20% x Q - 486,000 |
| 5,160,001 | 7,500,000 | 25% x Q - 744,000 |
| 7,500,001 | 11,000,000 | 30% x Q - 1,119,000 |
| 11,000,001 | and above | 35% x Q - 1,669,000 |
## Complementary tax on salaries (TCTS)
The TCTS rate is 5% of the salary, indemnities, and emoluments paid to the taxpayer.
The part of the revenue up to XAF 150,000 per month is exempted from the TCTS.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 04 March 2024
## Inventory valuation
Stocks are estimated at cost price. If the market price is lower than the cost price, the company has to make provisions for depreciation of inventory.
## Capital gains
Capital gains arising from the transfer of assets must be used for the calculation of taxable profits. However, the tax on capital gains can be deferred if a company reinvests an amount equal to the capital gain and the sale price of the transferred asset back into its fixed assets within three years.
Capital gains realised on the transfer of legal rights of persons or entities, whose asset is, in its majority, constituted of such rights or rights directly or indirectly owned in a company located in Gabon, are subject to CIT in Gabon. In this context, the Gabonese company must collect and remit to the tax administration a discharge levy of 20% made on the capital gains of the transfer of legal right within one month from the date of transfer.
## Dividend income
The rate of transferable securities income tax (*Impôt sur le Revenu des Capitaux Mobiliers* or IRCM) is 20% on distributed dividends.
IRCM charged on the beneficiaries of the earnings is withheld at source by the distributing company. It is paid over to the Registration Officer within 30 days from the payment of the dividends.
### Inter-company dividends
Inter-company dividends are taxed at a reduced rate in full discharge of the 20% WHT if paid and received by or from companies with their registered office in a CEMAC country, shares were allotted at the time of issue or kept for two years, and the Gabonese company owns more than 25% of the share capital of the subsidiary.
## Interest income
Interest income paid to companies is subject to a 20% WHT in Gabon. When paid in respect of bonds of five years or more, it is subject to a 10% WHT.
## Royalty income
Royalty income is subject to CIT at a rate of 30% (35% for companies operating in the oil and mining sectors).
## Foreign income
Foreign interest, royalties, and dividends are included in taxable income, subject to international tax treaties. Note that tax treaties provide that certain/all types of income are not includable in Gabon taxable income. Gabon has tax treaties with Belgium, France, the other countries of CEMAC, and some countries that continue to apply the provisions of the African and Malagasy Common Organisation (OCAM) tax treaty.
The concept of deferred tax is not applicable in Gabon.

## Social security contributions
Employees must contribute to the social security system (National Social Security Fund [CNSS]) together with the employer.
The taxable basis is made up of gross salaries, including indemnities considered as elements of the salary and any benefits in kind. However, there is an annual ceiling of XAF 18 million (or XAF 1.5 million per month).
The allowances for professional expenses are excluded from the taxable basis, subject to the fact that they are used according to their purpose and that they are not exaggerated.
The employees pay 2.5% for the CNSS retirement insurance and 1% for the National Disease Insurance and Social Guarantee Fund (CNAMGS) health insurance.
The other social security contributions represent 20.1% of the taxable salary. They are paid by the employer according to the following apportionment:
The employer is the debtor before the CNSS for the payment of the total social security contributions, including the portion due by the employees, which is withheld monthly on each employee's salary.
## Capital gains tax
Capital gains are subject to a tax on capital gain at a rate of 20%.
This tax must be paid by the taxpayer who has made the said capital gain before 30 April of the year following the year during which the capital gain has been made.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate in Gabon is 18%, which applies to all transactions unless otherwise provided for by the law.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 04 March 2024
## Depreciation
The straight-line method and an accelerated depreciation method are permitted in Gabon. Tax and book conformity is obligatory (i.e. annual depreciation must be booked to preserve tax deductibility).
The main depreciation rates provided by the Gabonese Tax Code are the following:
| Asset | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Buildings | 5 |
| Machinery, equipment | 5 to 100 |
| Office furniture | 10 |
| Office equipment | 15 |
| Vehicles | 20 to 33.3 |
| Computing equipment | 25 to 100 |
| Acquisition cost of equity security and other fixed securities | 20 |
## Goodwill
There is no provision in the Gabonese Tax Code concerning the tax treatment of goodwill.
## Start-up expenses
During the first five years of activity, a start-up can use an accelerated depreciation method on the acquired equipment goods under certain conditions and subject to specific provisions of the Gabonese Tax Code applicable to start-ups. Applicability of these provisions must be requested from the General Tax Manager prior to the incorporation of the company.
## Interest expenses
Interest paid directly or indirectly to shareholders with respect to the sums made available by them to the company is only deductible within the limit of those calculated on the intervention rate on invitation to tender (TIAO) of the Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) raised by 2%, provided that the share capital is fully paid up in case of incorporation of the company as well as in case of increase of the said share capital.
Concerning corporations or limited liability companies, the deduction is only allowed with regard to the sums made available by partners or shareholders assuming in right or in fact the management of the company, only for the part of these sums that does not exceed, for the whole partners and shareholders, one and a half of the share capital fully paid up.
The interests on loans granted in view of the production of fixed assets are included into the cost of acquisition of these assets and are not admitted as deductible expenses.
## Bad debt
Bad debt can be deducted from the result of the fiscal year during which the debt became completely unrecoverable, subject to the irrecoverable character of the compromised debt being justified due to the situation of the debtor.
## Provisions
To be tax deductible, provisions must relate to existing liability or loss. General provisions are not deductible.
## Expenditures on rent
The amount of the rentals granted to a company is allowed as a deductible expense under the condition that it does not exceed the average rentals applied for similar buildings and amenities.
However, an exception is provided with regard to the renting of premises by a shareholder directly or indirectly owning at least 10% of the shares of the company.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions do not, in principle, constitute expenses deductible from the taxable result. However, contributions for charity can be deducted, provided that the donation is made to the profit of organisms of public interest located in Gabon and that the donation is justified.
The deduction is limited to 1/1,000 of the company’s turnover for the considered fiscal year.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and third-party taxes borne by companies are not tax deductible.
## Social security contributions paid to foreign retirement funds
The deductibility of social security contributions paid by the employer to foreign retirement funds are only allowed when paid to the benefit of employees in secondment and within a limit of 15% of the gross salary paid to these employees.
## Taxes
Only professional taxes for which the recovery proceeding has started in the current fiscal year and for which the company is effectively liable due to operations carried out in Gabon can be deducted.
## Net operating losses
The Gabonese Tax Code does not provide the possibility to carry back losses. It does, however, provide for a five-year carryforward for net operating losses.
Regarding depreciation deferred in the accounts, they can be carried forward indefinitely.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Management fees paid to a foreign parent company are deductible if they meet all of the following conditions:
Management fees determined on a lump sum basis are not deductible.
Management fees exceeding 5% of the taxable profit before deduction of the said fees are not deductible.
Fees for the use of patents, licences, trademarks, manufacturing processes, and analogous rights exceeding 5% of the taxable profit before deduction of the said fees are not deductible.
Interest paid to shareholders is deductible only within the limit of the BEAC’s normal rate for advances plus 2%, on the condition that the registered capital is entirely paid. The portion exceeding the ceiling is not deductible and is thus subject to taxation.
Concerning corporations or limited liability companies, the deduction is only allowed with regard to the sums made available by partners or shareholders assuming in right or in fact the management of the company, only for the part of these sums that does not exceed, for the whole partners and shareholders, one and a half of the share capital fully paid up.

# Gabon
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 04 March 2024
## Specific group tax regime
There is a specific tax regime derogatory to the common law tax regime that is applicable, under conditions, to groups of companies.
According to the provisions of Article 11 b. of the tax measures applying to groups of companies, groups of companies are those constituted by companies subject to CIT, or a foreign equivalent tax, united between them through direct or indirect capital links of at least 50% and that allow one of them or several companies, jointly, to control the others.
The control is defined as:
To be eligible for this specific tax regime, and without any prejudice of other activities performed to the profit of third parties, the head of the group of companies must perform to the profit of other companies of the group an activity relating exclusively to the following fields:
Each company subject to CIT that is a member of the group and fulfils the conditions provided by the law will be subject to a separate taxation of its results according to the rules of common law and subject to amendments expressly provided by the law for the determination of the taxable result.
The express amendments provided in the scope of the specific tax regime applicable to groups of companies are the following:
### Capital gains
Net capital gains are taxed at a reduced rate of 20% when they are realised in the scope of intra-group operations.
### Expenses deductible from the taxable result subject to CIT
The following expenses are deductible within the group:
### 20% WHT
Sums subject to CIT according to the provisions of Article 206 of the Gabonese Tax Code paid by a Gabonese debtor member of a group of companies to a foreign company member of the same group are exempted from the 20% WHT even though no DTT aiming to avoid double taxation has been concluded between Gabon and the country of residence of the beneficiary of the remunerations.
### Transferable securities income tax (IRCM)
Companies of the group that benefit from transferable securities income originating from Gabon are exempted from IRCM when the said revenues are paid by a company member of the group.
In return, payments carried out by the head of the group of companies to the profit of its partners (individuals or legal entities) are subject to IRCM at a unique and at source rate of 10% (instead of 20%).
It is to be noted that the transferable securities incomes having their source abroad and which gave rise to taxation in their country of origin give the right in Gabon to a tax credit of the amount of the taxation that is deductible from the CIT of the fiscal year of perception of the incomes. The aforesaid tax credit applies even though no DTT aiming to avoid double taxation has been concluded between Gabon and the country of origin of the incomes.
### VAT
The head of the group of companies is liable for VAT.
Members of a group of companies could, however, on option, consider the following provisions of services performed within the group as being out of the scope of application of VAT:
The option for the subjection of the above-mentioned operations must be formulated by the concerned taxpayers on express request addressed to the General Tax Manager.
### Registration duties
Deeds relating to incorporation, increase or reduction of share capital, breaking up with or without clearance, merger, scission, partial contribution of assets, and transfer of shares of a company member of a tax group, are subject to a fixed duty of XAF 20,000.
In the absence of a more favourable duty provided by the common law of registration, the changes of ownership and use that are not provided at Article 6 of the Gabonese Tax Code are subject to a proportional rate of 1% when carried out by members of the same tax group.
### Requirements relating to declaratory obligations
The adherence to the group tax regime must be notified in writing by the head of the group of companies to the General Tax Manager accompanied by the list of the companies included in the tax perimeter of the group.
Each company remains liable for the periodical returns applicable to its activity.
For the purpose of calculation and verification of the returns, each tax return relating to the CIT of each company of the group will be gathered and filed at the same time by the head of the group of companies before the Tax Office.
## Transfer pricing
The Gabonese Tax Code provides rules regarding transfer pricing issues.
According to these rules, any payment considered to be a result of mismanagement will be subject to the CIT rate at 30% (35% for companies operating in the oil and mining sectors) plus penalties.
Indeed, Article 12 of the Code provides that "By virtue of law or in fact, for companies which are dependent of companies or groups of companies located outside the CEMAC area, or for those which possess the control of companies located outside the CEMAC area, payments or expenses realised by any mean whatsoever or any kind of advantages or help granted to third parties without equivalent counterpart for the company, comparable to abnormal act of management, constitute transfer of profits subject to corporate income tax".
It is applicable for the following:
The abnormal act of management is not limited to expenses; it also includes any form of advantages or allowances granted to third parties without any equivalent compensation for the company.
Article 13 of the Gabonese Tax Code provides that "The advantages or assistance granted by companies belonging to the same group can only be considered as resulting from a normal management if the company which grants these advantages or assistance demonstrates the existence of its own interest in acting as such. The general interest of the group is not sufficient to justify such practices".
Further to the Financial Act for 2017 implementing the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) regulation, a Master file containing information about the group structure and a Local file in relation to the structure, transfer pricing policy, and group transactions of the local entity must be provided to the tax authorities on a yearly basis, at the same time as the Annual Tax Return (DSF).
The Financial Act for 2017 has also introduced penalties, in case of failure to provide the Master and Local files, corresponding to 5% of the transactions realised with companies of the group with a minimum of XAF 65 million per year.
In addition, a Country-by-Country (CbC) report must be filed by the ultimate parent company of the group before the tax administration of which it depends.
## Thin capitalisation
Thin capitalisation rules have been introduced by the Finance Act 2018.
When the company paying the interest is deemed to be thinly capitalised, only a portion of that interest may be deductible from the taxable result.
A company is deemed thinly capitalised when the amount of interests paid on inter-company loans exceeds, simultaneously, the three following limits during the same fiscal year:
In a thinly capitalised company, the fraction of interests exceeding the highest of the above-mentioned ratios would not be tax deductible in the course of the considered fiscal year.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There is no specific tax rule under Gabon legislation related to CFCs.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 04 March 2024
Taxation of branch income is the same as for corporate income. However, a 20% WHT on profit is due at the time the profit is taken by the head office (located abroad) of the branch. This rate is reduced to 10% in case of the existence of a tax treaty.
## Simplified tax regime for oil subcontractors
The simplified tax regime for oil subcontractors is abrogated from 1 January 2022.
## Specific regime for regional offices (*quartiers généraux*)
A regional office is a company or a branch that renders various administrative services, such as management or accounting, exclusively to other companies of the same group based in a given geographical area (usually a group of countries).
The derogatory tax regime that was applicable to the said regional offices has been abrogated by the amended Financial Act for 2021. The tax base of such offices is then determined in accordance with the common law regime.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 04 March 2024
## Foreign tax credit
DTTs include provisions relating to the attribution of foreign tax credits. Such tax credits aim to limit the double taxation of profits that are subject to taxation in both member states of the treaty.
## Tax credits for job creation
There is a mechanism in place for granting corporate tax credits for any salaried appointments of Gabonese personnel.
This tax credit is equal to 20% of the gross salary paid to new employees and is subject to the creation of a minimum number of jobs, according to the size of the company as follows:
Note that the tax credit is granted only on newly created jobs since the preceding fiscal year. Contracts concluded with the employees must also be for an undetermined duration, and the new jobs must not result from the diminution of existing jobs.
## Inbound investment incentives
Due to the provisions of the Investments Law, any private investment in Gabon can benefit from:
Depending on the frameworks it is eligible for, a company can benefit from customs privileges and tax breaks.
Industrial companies already set up in Gabon and wishing to increase their production capacity can be admitted to a preferential tariff framework. This entails the application of a global reduced rate of 5% for duties and taxes paid on imports of equipment (excluding materials, furniture, and spare parts), provided that these correspond to an investment schedule and their value is in excess of XAF 100 million.
New industrial companies can also benefit from this framework, provided they are not subject to any of the other privileged frameworks outlined by current legislation.
The granting of this privileged tariff framework occurs on the basis of a decision by the Minister of Finances, following a proposal from the Director of Customs and Indirect Taxes.
## Capital investment incentive
New companies are exempt from the IMF, the minimum taxation of CIT, during the first two years of operations.
## Capital investment companies
Capital investment companies are exempted from CIT on income resulting from investment products and capital gain resulting from the transfer of shares. This exemption is subject to the fulfilment of cumulative conditions.
Capital investment companies operating in the following fields are exempted from CIT during the first three years of their activity:
## Social housing incentive
There are some tax exemptions applicable exclusively to authorised companies during the performance of a social housing investment project.
Favourable measures are applicable with regards to the importations of materials, engines, and equipment destined to authorised companies. Indeed, such importations are exempt from customs duties. They can also be imported under the normal temporary admission.
The concerned companies may apply before the customs authorities in order to benefit from the above-mentioned regime.
The concerned companies are those authorised for the planning of urban lands intended for social habitat and the building of housings of a socio-economic nature and industrial units of manufacturing of materials and other inputs used for the building of social housings. The above-mentioned tax exemptions relate to CIT, VAT, and business license tax.
## Tourism incentive
Companies having hotel activity in the tourism sector are exempted from CIT during the first three years of existence, provided that the amount of the investment equals or exceeds XAF 300 million. If not (i.e. investment of less than XAF 300 million), aforesaid authorised companies investing in the tourism sector can benefit, during a five-year period, from a 5% tax credit.

## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 04 March 2024
## Foreign tax credit
No foreign tax credits are granted. However, the tax obligations of non-residents may be affected by a tax treaty in effect between Gabon and the country where the taxpayer is resident.
## Tax treaties
Gabon has signed and ratified double tax treaties (DTTs) with Belgium, France, the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) member states (i.e. Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon), and the African and Malagasy Common Organisation (OCAM) member states (i.e. Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Gabon Ivory Coast, Malagasy, Mauritius, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, and Togo). Nevertheless, please note that the OCAM organisation no longer exists and only Gabon and Senegal continue to apply the OCAM DTT).

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 04 March 2024
## Employment income
The IRPP is calculated on the net global revenue earned by the taxpayer during the course of a calendar year (1 January until 31 December).
The net global revenue is equivalent to the total net revenue of the following types of incomes:
The IRPP is due by the head of the family for one’s own revenues, those of one’s spouse, and of one’s dependent children.
Regarding salaries, the taxable income includes all cash remuneration, allowances, acquisition gain related to the allocation to employees of free shares on preferential basis, and bonuses paid to employees. However, some bonuses listed in the Gabonese General Tax Code are exempted from the tax, provided they do not exceed the ceiling of XAF 4 million per year.
### Benefits in kind
Benefits in kind, such as housing, electricity, water, domesticity, and food, are taxed according to a schedule of deemed values, as follows:
### Expatriate tax concessions
Travel expenses incurred by the employer for the holidays of expatriates and their family are exempted from the IRPP, up to the limit of one direct air ticket per year from their employment location to their country of origin.
## Business income
Allowances for business expenses are exempted from the IRPP, provided that they are used according to their subject and that they are justified.
## Capital gains
