# Palestinian territories
## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
Income Tax Law number 8 for the year 2011 (and its amendments) is the applicable Law in Palestine. According to this Law ‘all realised incomes in Palestine from any source for any person are taxable unless there is a clear tax exemption in the Income Tax Law’.
## Personal income tax rates
Employees who are working in Palestine are subject to tax on their wages, salaries, and benefits according to the following yearly brackets and rates:
## Resident withholding tax (WHT)
WHT must be deducted on payments to residents if such payments exceed ILS 2,500 according to the percentage or amount specified in the WHT certificate issued by the Tax Department. In case the WHT certificate is not provided, the payer must deduct 10% of the payment and transfer it to Tax Department.
## Non-resident WHT
According to Income Tax Law, a resident person who pays any amount to a non-resident that is subject to tax under the provisions of this law shall withhold tax at a rate of 10% of the payment amount as a final tax and transfer it to the account of the Tax Department. If the resident fails to withhold the required tax, it shall be collected from the resident as a party responsible for paying it.
## WHT on dividend
Currently, dividends are exempt from income tax, and there is no WHT on dividends. However, it is expected that a 10% tax on dividend will be imposed.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
The following are considered to be a resident for tax purposes:
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The Palestinian Income Tax Law does not mention or define the concept of ‘permanent establishment’. This concept is stated in international Double Tax Avoidance Agreements. According to the Palestinian Income Tax Law, income generated in Palestine is liable to tax in Palestine. In order to determine the place where income is generated, the Palestinian Tax Authorities use the same terms that are used in international tax treaties in order to determine whether there is or isn’t a PE.

# Palestinian territories
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
Branches of foreign entities are subject to 15% income tax on their taxable income.
Deductions from income include the allocations of branches in the expenses of the main headquarters that is located outside Palestine with a percentage not exceeding 2% per year of the gross taxable income of branches in Palestine
Branches don’t pay dividends, so there is no extra tax when transferring the branch’s profits to the headquarters.
