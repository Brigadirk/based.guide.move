# Liechtenstein
## Overview
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
Liechtenstein is a doubly-landlocked country in Central Europe, bordered by Switzerland to the west and south and by Austria to the east. The small, alpine country of approximately 40,000 people is divided into 11 communes. Its capital is Vaduz, and the official language is German. Liechtenstein has a parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarchy. The country uses the Swiss franc (CHF) as its national currency.
Liechtenstein was established within the Holy Roman Empire in 1719. Occupied by both French and Russian troops during the Napoleonic wars, it became a sovereign state in 1806 and joined the Germanic Confederation in 1815. Liechtenstein became fully independent in 1866 when the Confederation dissolved. Until the end of World War I, it was closely tied to Austria, but the economic devastation caused by that conflict forced Liechtenstein to enter into a customs and monetary union with Switzerland. Since 1995, Liechtenstein is also a member of the European Economic Area (EEA) and therefore closely associated to the European Union (EU) single market.
Since World War II (in which Liechtenstein remained neutral), the country's attractive financial, legal, and talent environment has spurred outstanding economic growth. Despite its small size and limited natural resources, Liechtenstein has developed into a prosperous, highly industrialised, free-enterprise economy with a vital financial service sector and the highest *per capita* income in the world. The Liechtenstein economy is widely diversified with a large number of small businesses.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
The corporate profit tax is determined according to the taxable corporate net income, which is based on the financial statements under consideration of the following provisions.
## Inventory valuation
Inventories must be stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is generally determined by the first in first out (FIFO) or by the average cost method. The tax authorities permit a general reserve against stock contingencies of up to one-third of the inventory cost or market value at the balance sheet date without inquiry into its justification, provided a detailed record of inventory is available for review by the tax authorities. The need for a reserve in excess of this amount (e.g. for obsolescence, slow-moving-stocks) must be substantiated to the satisfaction of the tax authorities.
## Capital gains
As of 13 July 2018, new anti-abuse rules have been introduced with regard to the taxation of capital gains. Capital gains deriving from investments in foreign legal entities are not tax-exempt for income tax purposes anymore if more than 50% of the total income of the foreign legal entity consists of passive income and its taxable income is subject, directly or indirectly, to low taxation. This new rule is applicable as of 2019 for participations established as of 2019 and as of 2022 for participations established before 2019.
## Dividend income
Dividend income and liquidation proceeds are generally tax-exempt for corporate investors (shareholders or beneficiaries). For such payment from 25% (or greater) participation, exemption only applies if such dividend is not tax deductible in the source country.
As of 13 July 2018, new anti-abuse rules have been introduced with regard to the taxation of dividend income and liquidation proceeds. Dividend income and liquidation proceeds deriving from investments in foreign legal entities are not tax-exempt for income tax purposes anymore if more than 50% of the total income of the foreign legal entity consists of passive income and its taxable income is subject, directly or indirectly, to low taxation. This new rule is applicable as of 2019 for participations established as of 2019 and as of 2022 for participations established before 2019.
## Interest income
Interest income is taxable and must be at arm’s length if it is in respect to related parties (*for safe harbour rates, see Interest expenses in the [Deductions](liechtenstein/corporate/deductions.html) section*).
## Royalty income
Royalty income is subject to ordinary income taxation at 12.5%.
## Income from investment funds
For corporate investors, income from investment funds is subject to corporate profit tax at a rate of 12.5%. Since units in investment funds do not constitute participations in legal persons, to the extent that investment funds in turn invest in participations in legal persons, dividends and capital gains (including non-realised capital gains) from such investments are tax-exempt. Since investment funds are subject to proper accounting rules, the net income shown in the financial statements provides for the taxable basis. If in practice, however, based on proper accounting, it is not possible to differentiate between income from dividends, capital gains, or interests, a simplified approach can be used to calculate the taxable basis for the fiscal year 2014 going forward. The simplified approach will be guided by the equity exposure of investment funds. Accordingly, the higher the investments in participations in legal persons are, the higher the lump sum tax exemption for dividends and capital gains will be.
## Foreign income
Resident corporations operating locally are generally taxed on their worldwide income. However, income from foreign real estate and PEs situated abroad is exempt from taxation in Liechtenstein.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
## Social security contributions
The taxpayer’s share of social security contributions (old-age and dependent pension schemes, disability insurance) is 4.70% (with an upper limit of 18% for self-employed and employed individuals) and 0.5% for unemployment insurance on the first CHF 126,000 of compensation.
## Real estate profit tax
Capital gains from the sale of real estate, or equivalent actions with the same result, are subject to a separately assessed real estate profit tax. The taxable gain is generally the difference between proceeds of the sale and the original purchase price of the property plus any capital expenditure incurred. The basic tax rate is the income tax rate for singles without children, which ranges between approximately 3% and 24%, depending on the amount of taxable real estate gain. The transfer of the economic ownership of real estate (e.g. via the sale of the majority of the shares in a real estate company) may trigger real estate tax as well.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
Liechtenstein has adopted the VAT law of Switzerland, while having its own VAT administration.
## Wealth tax
Movable and immovable assets are subject to wealth tax. In principle, wealth tax is levied based upon the fair market value.
The taxable wealth is multiplied by a standard interest 4% to calculate a notional income, which is subject to income tax together with other income.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Liechtenstein does not levy inheritance, estate, or gift taxes.
## Dedication tax
Dedication of assets to a non-taxable entity (non-profit organisation according to Art. 107 Abs. 4a PGR) or under circumstances that make the assets no longer subject to wealth taxation triggers a tax of 3.5% of the wealth tax value of the contribution. The donator is taxable.
To the extent that, due to the transfer of wealth to a legal person or special asset dedication not exempted from tax liability pursuant to article 107 paragraph 4a PGR, this wealth is no longer subject to the wealth tax and privileges or shares do not become liable to the wealth tax, the transferor shall pay a tax in the amount of 3.5% of the wealth-tax value of the contribution.
In addition to the state tax of 3.5%, there will be a surcharge for the community of 3.5% multiplied by 150% to 180%; consequently, the maximum dedication tax is 10.5%.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
In principle, all corporations, foundations, and establishments are subject to a profit tax at a flat rate of 12.5%. Resident companies are subject to unlimited tax liability on worldwide income. Non-resident companies are subject to limited tax liability on income from properties or branches within Liechtenstein.
## Global minimum tax
For ultimate parent entities qualifying for the global minimum tax (FL GlobE Tax Law / OECD GloBE Tax Law), a Qualified Domestic Minimum Tax (QDMTT) and Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) at a rate of 15% in alignment with the OECD global minimum tax rules applies.
## Liechtenstein minimum tax
All legal entities are subject to an annual corporate minimum tax of 1,800 Swiss francs (CHF) for tax years starting 1 January 2017. This tax can be fully credited to the profit tax.
The full tax amount is due even if the corporation is not resident in Liechtenstein for the whole tax period.
Under a lone exception, minimum tax is not due if the total assets of an operating entity did not exceed CHF 500,000 during the last three years.

## Taxable period
The tax returns are filed on a calendar-year basis.
## Tax returns
Returns must be filed annually, normally by mid to end of April of the year following the respective tax year. An exemption might be granted upon a written request to the communal tax authorities. For an extension period of more than one month, a prepayment of 80% of the previous year's taxes is required. The maximum extension period is five months.
Employees must enclose a certificate of remuneration issued by their employers.
## Payment of tax
The tax liability is definitive when the tax assessment has been delivered. Taxable persons can either pay the taxes within 30 days or make an objection against the tax assessment.
Employers need to deduct a withholding tax (WHT) from the salary of their employees. As of 2019, employees may also be required to pay WHT if certain conditions are met. Employees do not need to pay a provisional tax bill.
The income tax of self-employed persons (as well as of legal entities) needs to be paid provisionally, based on the taxable income of the last tax return. Provisionally paid taxes are credited to the definite tax due.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
In principle, tax is levied on the resident taxpayer’s worldwide earned income and net wealth. However, there are important items that are exempt from income tax, as described in other sections.
Individuals without permanent or habitual residence within Liechtenstein can be subject to Liechtenstein income taxes only with respect to income from certain Liechtenstein sources. Important examples are:
## National tax
| National tax rate | Single person’s income (CHF\*) | Deduction from result (CHF) | Single parent’s income (CHF) | Deduction from result (CHF) | Married couple’s income (CHF) | Deduction from result (CHF) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Personal exemption | 15,855 |  | 23,783 |  | 31,710 |  |
| 1% up to | 21,140 | 159 | 31,710 | 238 | 42,280 | 317 |
| 3% up to | 42,280 | 581 | 63,420 | 872 | 84,560 | 1,163 |
| 4% up to | 73,990 | 1,004 | 110,985 | 1,506 | 147,980 | 2.008 |
| 5% up to | 105,700 | 1,744 | 158,550 | 2,616 | 211,400 | 3,488 |
| 6% up to | 137,410 | 2,801 | 206,115 | 4,202 | 274,820 | 5,602 |
| 6.5% up to | 169,120 | 3,488 | 253,680 | 5,232 | 338,240 | 6,976 |
| 7% up to | 211,400 | 4,334 | 317,100 | 6,501 | 422,800 | 8,667 |
| 8% above | 211,401 | 6,448 | 317,101 | 9,672 | 422,801 | 12,895 |
\* Swiss francs
## Communal tax
Communal tax is a surcharge on the national income tax due. Communities levy a surcharge of between 150% and 180%. The surcharges are fixed annually by the local governments. Consequently, the tax rate consists of the national tax rate combined with the surcharges, which results in tax rates from 2.5% to 22.4%.
For individuals with a limited tax liability who are ordinary tax-assessed, a general municipal multiplier of 150% will be applied.
## Lump sum taxation (tax based on expenditure)
In the case of persons who, for the first time or after at least ten years away from the country, take up residence or habitual abode in Liechtenstein, are not Liechtenstein citizens, do not work in Liechtenstein, and finance their costs of living through the income from their wealth or other funds received from abroad, a tax based on expenditure may, upon application, be levied in lieu of the wealth tax and income tax. Real estate situated in Liechtenstein is subject to the wealth tax.

## Taxable period
The tax year corresponds with the business year. Consequently, the applicable accounting period, which may end at any date within the calendar year, is the basis for corporate taxation.
## Tax returns
Corporations resident in Liechtenstein or with PEs in Liechtenstein must file a tax return by 1 July of the calendar year following the fiscal year-end.
Due to a substantiated written request, the tax authorities may extend the submission deadline by six months. A deadline extension requires the payment of the provisional invoice. In especially justified cases, the submission deadline may be extended once again. Such a request must be made before expiry of the first deadline extension.
The tax assessment issued by the tax administration is based on the company’s tax return, including the attachments and the financial statements filed.
## Payment of tax
Companies must pay tax within 30 days of receipt of the assessment. The defaults charge rate is 4%.
## Tax audit process
Generally, the Liechtenstein tax system is based on self-assessment. In the past, the Liechtenstein tax authorities assessed an entity based on the documents and information provided by the entity itself and additional documents or explanations requested by the tax authorities. Currently, however, the Liechtenstein tax authorities aims to carry out external tax audits in-house. However, due to limited resources, profit tax audits happen rarely.
## Statute of limitations
The limitation of the right to assess a tax is five years, starting after the end of the tax year in terms of periodic tax and after the end of the year in which the taxable incidence had taken place in terms of non-periodic tax. The tax claims, in any case, are prescribed ten years after the end of the year in which the taxes have been assessed on a final basis.
The tax authorities especially focuses on payments between affiliated companies (e.g. inter-company loans). Furthermore, all provisions and depreciations will be checked under the premise of economic necessity.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
Liechtenstein has adopted the VAT law of Switzerland, while having its own VAT administration.
Any person who, irrespective of legal form, carries on a business is liable for VAT. Any person liable for VAT that is involved in domestic entrepreneurial activity with a taxable turnover that is less than CHF 100,000 within a financial year can be exempted from taxation. Special regulations apply for non-profit institutions as well as for non-profit sport or cultural clubs. Reverse charge is applicable for services and certain deliveries from an entity domiciled abroad.
Filing of VAT is exclusively done electronically via the VAT-Portal of the FL tax authority.
## Customs duties/import tariffs
Based on the customs union treaty of 1923 between Liechtenstein and Switzerland, Switzerland customs duties and import tariffs are applicable for Liechtenstein as well. The tariffs and duties depend on various specific attributes of the products and are listed on comprehensive tariffs and duties lists; consequently, the specific tariffs and duties must be checked for every case individually.
## Excise taxes
Several excise taxes apply in Liechtenstein (e.g. petroleum tax, tobacco tax, car tax, performance-related heavy vehicle fee, beer tax, taxation of distilled spirits).
## Property taxes
No property taxes are applicable in Liechtenstein.
## Stamp duty
Based on the customs union treaty of 1923 between Switzerland and Liechtenstein, the Swiss stamp duty tax law of 27 June 1927 is applicable in Liechtenstein. The stamp duty law, *inter alia*, includes the issuance stamp tax and the security transfer tax.
### Issuance stamp tax
Upon the formation of legal entities whose capital is divided into shares (e.g. company limited by shares, limited liability company, establishment with capital divided into shares), the stamp duty amounts to 1% of the nominal value or the higher amount effectively paid (above par). The first CHF 1 million is tax exempt.
The same duty also becomes due when the capital is increased or when the shareholders make contributions without increasing the capital. There is no stamp duty tax on bonds and money market certificates.
Various exemptions should also be considered.
### Security transfer tax
Security transfer tax is due on all transactions of qualifying securities if a security dealer is involved. The tax amounts to 0.15% for domestic securities (Switzerland and Liechtenstein) and 0.3% for foreign securities.
In particular, banks and financial intermediaries qualify as security dealers and are liable for the payment of the security transfer tax. Furthermore, legal entities with qualifying securities with a book value of more than CHF 10 million also qualify as security dealers and are also liable for the payment of the security transfer tax.
## Formation tax (*Gründungsabgabe*)
Unless Swiss stamp duty law applies, a formation tax in the amount of 1% of the statutory nominal capital is levied upon the formation or relocation of legal companies in Liechtenstein (e.g. foundation, establishment) as well as for capital increases.
The general tax rate of 1% is reduced to 0.5% for amounts greater than CHF 5 million and to 0.3% for amounts greater than CHF 10 million. The first CHF 1 million is tax exempt.
Foundations are subject to the formation tax at a tax rate of 0.2%, but at least CHF 200.
## Real estate profit tax
Capital gains from the sale of real estate, or equivalent actions with the same result, are subject to a separately assessed real estate profit tax. The taxable gain is generally the difference between proceeds of the sale and the original purchase price of the property plus any capital expenditure incurred. The basic tax rate can be up to 24%, depending on the amount of taxable real estate gain. The transfer of the economic ownership of real estate (e.g. via the sale of the majority of the shares in a real estate company) may trigger real estate tax as well.
## Environmental taxes
Liechtenstein’s environment-related taxes include the mineral oil tax on motor fuels and combustibles, the mineral oil tax surcharge on motor fuels, the CO2-yield on fuel sales, the climate cent, the automobile tax, the motor vehicle tax, the performance-based heavy vehicle fee, the incentive tax on extra light heating oil, diesel, and gasoline, and the incentive tax on volatile organic compounds. All these taxes are consumer born levies and fees and are levied on the sales price upon sale of such products to the end consumer. Based on the 2019 tax statistics, the tax income from such environmental taxes amounted for some 3.9% of Liechtenstein’s total tax income.
## Tax on insurance premiums
Liechtenstein levies a tax on certain insurance premiums. The tax rate amounts to 5% of the cash premium (2.5% for life insurance). Cash premiums in foreign currency have to be converted to Swiss francs at the time the tax claims arise.
Various exemptions should also be considered.
## Social security contributions
Employers, in general, are required to account for social security contributions on the salaries of their employees. If the employee is subject to the Liechtenstein social security system, the following compulsory social security contributions are concerned:

Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
A company is considered to be resident in Liechtenstein if its registered seat (incorporation) or place of effective management is within Liechtenstein.
Companies that have neither a domicile nor effective place of management in Liechtenstein, as well as special asset dedications without legal personality (e.g. trusts), are subject to limited tax liability for the following income:
## Permanent establishment (PE)
In 2025, the definition of permanent establishment in Liechtenstein was explicitly expanded to include the concept of dependent agent PE.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
## Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation of tangible fixed assets and amortisation of intangible assets is allowed if it is 'commercially justified'. For tax purposes, either the straight-line (depreciation based on the acquisition value) or the declining-balance method (depreciation based on the book value) may be used. Depreciation and amortisation not recorded in statutory accounts are not deductible for tax purposes.
A special (higher) rate of depreciation may be allowed for assets used only for short periods or for assets for which a rapid decrease in value can be proved.
The depreciation/amortisation rate *per annum* of various property types are provided below. Note that these depreciation rates relate to write-downs on the book value. If the write-down is performed on the acquisition value, then the rates enumerated below should be reduced by half.
| Property type | Rate *per annum* (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Immovable assets: |  |
| Real estate (dwelling houses, offices, shops, restaurant and hotel buildings, industrial buildings, factories, warehouses, and parking spaces) | 5 |
| Movable assets: |  |
| Mobile structures, technical installations (air conditioning plant, gas and electricity mains for industrial purposes), elevators, investments in foreign real estate, high rack warehouses, and airplanes | 15 |
| Office furniture and machines, workshop, and storeroom equipment | 20 |
| Furniture used for the hotel and restaurant trade | 25 |
| Machines and accessories for production purposes, vending machines, telephone installations, and operating applications | 30 |
| Machinery used in more than one shift or used under heavy conditions, motor vehicles | 35 |
| Information technology (hardware and software), office furniture and machines, workshop and storeroom equipment, hotel and restaurant cookery, cutlery, and linen | 50 |
| Officially approved installations and equipment against water pollution, energy-saving equipment, and installations using solar energy | 50 |
| Intangible assets: |  |
| Goodwill, patent, licence, and other rights of use | 40 |
As of 2019, realised and unrealised losses from participations are no longer deductible.
## Start-up expenses
In general, the expenses for a start-up are tax deductible as long as they are economically justified.
## Interest expenses
Interest paid by a corporation to a third party is a deductible business expense. Interest paid to related parties (affiliates or shareholder) has to reflect the fair market rate and has to be at arm’s length.
With respect to related parties, the tax administration of Liechtenstein annually issues safe harbour interest rates to be used on loans denominated in Swiss francs on the one hand and in foreign currencies on the other hand. The corporation may deviate from these safe harbour rates as long as it can prove that the rates are at arm’s length and more appropriate in the present case.
### Safe harbour rates 2024
| Loans in Swiss francs | Minimum interest rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| For loans made to related parties: |  |
| Financed from equity and no interest-bearing debt capital | 2.00 |
| Financed from debt capital: |  |
| Cost price | + 0.5 |
| At least | 2.00 |
|  |  |
|  | Maximum interest rate (%) |
| For loans received from related parties | 2.00 |
For loans in the following currencies, the same mechanism applies:
| Currency | 2024 (%) | 2023 (%) | Currency | 2024 (%) | 2023 (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EUR | 3.75 | 3.75 | USD | 5.25 | 4.75 |
| GBP | 5.25 | 4.75 | JPY | 1.50 | 1.50 |
| SEK | 4.50 | 4.25 | NOK | 5.00 | 4.50 |
| CZK | 6.50 | 6.50 | PLN | 6.75 | 8.00 |
| AUD | 5.00 | 5.25 | HKD | 5.75 | 5.25 |
| CAD | 5.25 | 4.75 | ZAR | 9.25 | 9.75 |
Furthermore, the tax authorities ask for an economic justification if loans are not in the currency of the statutory accounts.
## Notional interest deduction (NID) on equity
The NID on equity is a standardised deduction for interest on equity based on the multiplication of the ‘modified’ equity by the interest rate (according to the annual finance law). The equity interest rate is 4%. Losses due to the NID are not accepted; consequently, a negative result due to this deduction does not generate loss carryforward.
To determine the modified equity, the following terms have to be considered:
|  | Example 1 | Example 2 | Example 3 | Example 4 | Example 5 | Example 6 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Modified equity | 1,000,000 | 500,000 | 500,000 | 1,000,000 | 1,000,000 | 1,000,000 |
| Loans | 0 | 500,000 | 500,000 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Profit | 100,000 | 100,000 | 200,000 | 1,000,000,000 | 30,000 | 60,000 |
| Interest on loans (4%) | 0 | (20,000) | (20,000) | 0 | 0 | 0 |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Profit | 100,000 | 80,000 | 180,000 | 1,000,000,000 | 30,000 | 60,000 |
| Interest on equity (4%) | (40,000) | (20,000) | (20,000) | (40,000) | (40,000) | (40,000) |
| Taxable profit | 60,000 | 60,000 | 160,000 | 999,960,000 | 0 | 20,000 |
| Profit tax rate | 12.50% | 12.50% | 12.50% | 12.50% | 12.50% | 12.50% |
| Tax burden | 7,500 | 7,500 | 20,000 | 124,995,000 | 0 | 2,500 |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Effective tax rate** | **7.50%** | **9.38%** | **11.11%** | **12.50%** | **0.00%** | **4.17%** |
According to the Liechtenstein Tax Act, modified equity is defined as the equity amount minus own shares, participations in corporations, and assets not operationally necessary.
In addition, modified equity must be further reduced by 6% of all assets qualifying for the NID. This means that, after deducting non-qualifying assets (own shares, participations, non-operating assets), an additional deduction of 6% on the remaining assets has to be made.
Furthermore, if a related-party loan has an interest rate below the level of the NID of 4%, the difference in the amount has to be deducted from the modified equity. However, no deduction has to be made if the loan arises from the operating business of the company.
The NID for transactions between related parties is restricted. The NID is added to the taxable income if the investment is not financed by equity in the parent company or if transactions with related parties are purely tax motivated.
## Provisions
### Bad debt provision
It is admissible to set up an accounting provision for specific impaired debt; additionally, it is possible to account for a general bad debt provision of up to 10% on receivables from Liechtenstein and Switzerland and up to 15% on receivables from any other country if no specific provision has been accounted for the corresponding debt. These provisions are not accepted regarding receivables to corporations and institutions under public law, banks, or for inter-company receivables.
### Inventory provision
### Provisions on financial investments
Provisions on financial investments are possible but must be proved by an established corporate evaluation method or other suitable documents.
### Other provisions
Provisions at the expense of the profit and loss statement are admissible for obligations during the business year whose amount is not yet determined or for other immediately imminent losses during the business year.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions to legal persons and special asset dedications with domicile in Liechtenstein, in another country member of the European Economic Area (EEA), or in Switzerland, which are exempt from tax liability in light of exclusively and irrevocably common-benefit purposes, are deductible, up to the amount of 10% of the taxable corporate net income.
## Deduction for income from intellectual property (IP)
With the tax law amendments that entered into force on 1 January 2017, the Liechtenstein IP box regime was abolished with a phase-out period for existing IP boxes until 2020.
As of 1 January 2021, all income from IP is subject to ordinary taxation at 12.5%.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are not tax deductible, provided the penal nature predominates.
## Taxes
Taxes are not deductible in Liechtenstein.
## Net operating losses
A loss can be carried forward and offset against the profits for future years. There is no time limitation of loss carryforwards as well as loss offsetting. Losses cannot be carried back.
The loss carryforward is limited to 70%. The other 30% can still be carried forward indefinitely. As a consequence, 30% of the taxable profit is subject to annual taxation even if corresponding losses from previous years exist.
Effective January 1, 2025, the maximum limit of 70% does not apply in the tax year in which the business is terminated for good.
Losses from foreign PEs and group loss offsetting
Losses from a foreign PE can be offset with taxable net corporate income to the extent these losses were not already taken into account in the country where the PE is situated or in another country. If that PE records profits in the following years, these profits need to be added to taxable net corporate income again. The period a loss can be carried forward is limited up to five years. Afterwards, the losses will be added if not yet added to the taxable profit due to foreign loss offsetting. The same limitation of loss carryforward applies to group taxation as well.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Interest, royalties and licences, and other fees to foreign affiliates are allowed as deductions to the extent that they meet the arm’s-length test (i.e. equivalent to charges that would be made by an unrelated third party).
For interest payments between affiliated companies or between shareholders and companies, Liechtenstein tax authorities publish safe harbour rules annually (i.e. generally accepted interest).

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
Resident and non-resident corporations have the possibility to opt for group taxation (i.e. tax group) if they meet the legal requirements (e.g. more than 50% of capital and 50% of voting rights). The ultimate group leader must either be a corporation domiciled in Liechtenstein or with the effective place of management in Liechtenstein.
In order to form multi-level group structures, sub-groups may also be built. The same rules are applicable for the group leader of the sub-group as for the primary group leader.
A written application for forming a tax group must designate the group leader and group members to be filed with the tax authorities. It is not necessary that all associated companies have to become group members. The group leader can decide, for each company that fulfils the conditions, which company will be included in the group or not. The group leader and the group members need to have uniform business years.
Losses of group members can be offset against profits of the (sub) group leader within the same year. The offsetting is only possible under the following conditions:
The losses are allocated to the (sub) group leader according to the direct participation quota of the (sub) group leader to the group member whose losses should be offset. If the losses cannot be used at the level of the (sub) group leader, they can be allocated to other group members. However, the minimum tax is applicable for each group member.
Losses that have been attributed to the (sub) group leader must be adjusted in the following cases:
The (sub) group leader must provide evidence annually that no adjustment needs to be made. Even if the conditions for adjustment are not fulfilled, losses that have been attributed to the (sub) group leader must be adjusted five years after attribution.
## Transfer pricing
Until 1 January 2017, Liechtenstein did not have specific transfer pricing rules apart from the rule that intra-group transactions are carried out at arm’s-length terms. However, since the tax law amendments entered into force on 1 January 2017, all companies will be obligated to provide, upon request by the tax authorities (i.e. no periodical filing), documentation regarding the adequacy of transfer prices of transactions with related companies or PEs. Large companies have to prepare the transfer pricing documentation based on an internationally accepted standard. If a company exceeds at least two of the following three criteria, it qualifies as a large company (based on Liechtenstein company law):
Small companies (i.e. not exceeding two of the above criteria) are not required to prepare transfer pricing documentation in accordance with an international accepted standard.
## *Country-by-country (CbC) reporting*
The CbC reporting law entered into force on 1 January 2017. CbC reporting is applicable for Liechtenstein group holding companies with a consolidated turnover of at least CHF 900 million. The legal basis of the CbC reporting law is the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (MAC). The MAC entered into force on 1 December 2016 and is applicable for tax years starting 1 January 2017.
Public CbCR is expected to apply for Liechtenstein once EEA joint committee ratifies respective arrangement. To be monitored when this becomes effective.
## Thin capitalisation
Liechtenstein does not have thin capitalisation rules.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Liechtenstein does not have specific CFC rules. However, legal or actual structures that appear inappropriate to the economic circumstances and whose sole economic purpose consists in attaining tax advantages are considered abusive if:

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
The principles applicable to corporations also apply for branch income, provided that transactions with the head office or other branches are at arm’s length. Liechtenstein taxation is imposed on the profit attributable to the branch. The annual corporate minimum tax of CHF 1,800 is also applicable.
There is no withholding tax (WHT) on profit transfer to the head office.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
The following tax incentives are currently applicable:
## Private asset structure (*Privatvermögensstrukturen* or PAS)
Liechtenstein offers tax privileges for PASs. A PAS must not conduct any economic activity. The purpose of a PAS is limited to acquiring, holding, administrating, and selling financial instruments according to the Liechtenstein assets management law as well as cash and bank accounts in the interest of the investor. Participations may only be held if it can be proved that the shareholders or beneficiaries have no influence on the administration of this company.
The articles of the PAS must contain a clause that the regulations for PASs are applicable. Exemptions of this rule are applicable for legal entities that existed before the introduction of the tax law as of 1 January 2011.
The investors of a PAS must be individuals who administrate their own assets or structures acting in the interest of individuals.
The company or the audit company needs to confirm, upon formation or after major changes, that the conditions for the PAS structure are fulfilled. This is supervised by the tax authorities or a neutral certified accountant.
A PAS only pays the minimum tax of CHF 1,800 annually.
This tax scheme was qualified as in conformity with the provisions on state aid set out in Article 61 of the Agreement on the European Economic Area by the ESA.
## Avoidance of double taxation
Foreign taxes shall be allowable against domestic taxes (credit method) under circumstances where (i) the income is derived or wealth is owned in a country that has concluded an agreement for the avoidance of double taxation with Liechtenstein and such agreement provides for a tax credit or (ii) reciprocity is granted. Income or wealth shall be exempted from taxation in Liechtenstein (exemption method) if the agreement for the avoidance of double taxation provides tax exemption or if reciprocity is granted.

## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
## Restructurings
Restructurings (e.g. change of corporate form, merger, spin-off) can be carried out tax neutrally, provided certain conditions are met.
All restructurings have in common that they can only be carried out tax neutrally if they are performed at tax book value and if the assets remain taxable within Liechtenstein. Furthermore, specific/additional conditions must be met for each kind of restructuring.
## Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
A Model 1 intergovernmental agreement (IGA) for the implementation of FATCA was signed between the governments of Liechtenstein and the United States on 16 May 2014.
Under the Model 1 IGA, Liechtenstein financial institutions will be required to report to local tax authorities on the accounts of US citizens. The Liechtenstein tax authorities will then send the tax information to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
## Automatic information exchange
Liechtenstein, *inter alia*, has committed to implement the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) for automatic exchange of tax information, which the G20 Finance Ministers endorsed on 23 February 2014. Accordingly, Liechtenstein belongs to the group of early adopters leading to the first automatic information exchanges in 2017 for the year 2016. The Liechtenstein Parliament passed the law on the automatic exchange of information (AIA law), with various amendments to the Liechtenstein Tax Act, on 6 November 2015. The AIA law corresponds mainly with the OECD CRS and shall introduce a uniform standard for exchanging tax information with tax authorities of other countries. The AIA law entered into force on 1 January 2016.
## EU Mandatory Disclosure Rules (DAC6)
In order to detect cross-border, potentially aggressive tax arrangements, the European Union has introduced a new tax transparency directive 2018/822 (DAC6), which may also have far-reaching consequences for companies or individuals based outside the European Union. DAC6 imposes mandatory disclosure requirements for certain arrangements with an EU cross-border element where the arrangements fall within certain 'hallmarks' mentioned in the directive and in certain instances where the main or expected benefit of the arrangement is tax advantage.
Liechtenstein is a member of the European Economic Area but not of the European Union. As the European Economic Area does not include the common tax policy, DAC6 is, as such, not binding for Liechtenstein. There is currently no voluntary adaption of the DAC6 regulation planned in Liechtenstein. Hence, the DAC6 mandatory disclosure rule is not applicable for Liechtenstein intermediaries and companies. Nevertheless, these rules have far reaching impacts also for Liechtenstein-based intermediaries and companies as reporting may be required by the EU-based contracting parties of a transaction and with that also discloses Liechtenstein-related transactions and information.
Liechtenstein-based intermediaries and companies with cross-border transactions with the European Union should review, in any case, whether the involved EU-based counter-party may need to disclose a transaction.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
The Liechtenstein Parliament passed the law on the automatic exchange of information (AIA law) with various amendments to the Liechtenstein Tax Act on 6 November 2015. The AIA law corresponds mainly with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) common reporting standard (CRS) and shall introduce a uniform standard for exchanging tax information with tax authorities of other countries. The AIA law entered into force on 1 January 2016.
Furthermore, the Liechtenstein Parliament passed the amending Protocol to the agreement between the European Community (EC) and Liechtenstein on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments (European Union [EU] interest savings agreement) on 6 November 2015. The amending Protocol changes the EU interest savings agreement into an AIA agreement. The amending protocol entered into force on 1 January 2016.
With the tax law amendments that entered into force on 1 January 2017, the correspondence principle for dividends to avoid double non-taxation was introduced. Individual investors (shareholders or beneficiaries) shall only benefit from the participation exemption on dividend income if the payment from ≥ 25% participations held as business assets is not tax deductible in the source country. The correspondence principle, however, does not apply for dividends received from participations that are held as private assets.
Dividend income and capital gains deriving from foreign participations held as business assets are subject to anti-abuse provisions. Dividend income and capital gains deriving from investments in foreign legal entities are not tax-exempt for income tax purposes anymore if more than 50% of the total income of the foreign legal entity consists of passive income and its taxable income is subject, directly or indirectly, to low taxation. The grandfathering for participations established before 2019 ended on 31 December 2021.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
Generally, all income is subject to annual income tax.
In particular, the following income is taxable:
## Employment income
An employee resident in Liechtenstein is principally taxed on any salary and any other monetary benefits (including reimbursements of living expense) received from the employer, regardless of where the work has been performed or where the payment is made.
## Capital gains
Capital gains from disposal of shares in domestic or foreign corporations are tax-exempt. In return, capital losses cannot be deducted.
Capital gains deriving from foreign participations held as business assets are subject to anti-abuse provisions. Capital gains deriving from investments in foreign legal entities are not tax-exempt for income tax purposes anymore if more than 50% of the total income of the foreign legal entity consists of passive income and its taxable income is subject, directly or indirectly, to low taxation. The grandfathering for participations established before 2019 ended as of 31 December 2021.
## Dividend income
Dividend income and liquidation proceeds are generally tax-exempt for individual investors (shareholders or beneficiaries) provided that the payment from ≥ 25% participations held as business assets is not tax deductible in the source country. The correspondence principle, however, does not apply for dividends received from participations that are held as private assets.
Dividend income deriving from foreign participations held as business assets are subject to anti-abuse provisions. Dividend income deriving from investments in foreign legal entities is not tax-exempt for income tax purposes anymore if more than 50% of the total income of the foreign legal entity consists of passive income and its taxable income is subject, directly or indirectly, to low taxation.
