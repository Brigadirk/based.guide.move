# Saudi Arabia
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 21 July 2024
## Inventory valuation
The weighted average-cost method is used for valuing inventory under Saudi tax law.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are subject to income tax or Zakat, as appropriate, at the normal income tax or Zakat rate. However, capital gains realised from the disposal of shares in Saudi stock companies listed in the Saudi market are tax exempt, subject to certain conditions.
## Dividend income
Dividend income that is received by a resident party is subject to income tax at the normal income tax rate unless exempt. Dividends can be exempt from income tax in Saudi Arabia if the following conditions are met, generally:
Dividends paid by resident entities to a non-resident party are subject to WHT at 5%.
## Interest income
Interest income is subject to income tax at the normal income tax rate. Interest paid to a non-resident party is subject to WHT at 5%.
## Royalty income
Royalty income is subject to tax at the normal income tax rate. Royalties paid to a non-resident party are subject to WHT at 15%.
Royalty is defined as per article one of the Saudi income tax law as follows:
“Payments received for use of or the right to use intellectual rights, including, but not limited to, copyright, patents, designs, industrial secrets, trademarks and trade names, know-how, trade secrets, business, goodwill, and payments received against the use of information related to industrial, commercial, or scientific expertise, or against granting the right to exploit natural and mineral resources.”
## Imports and supply contracts
Saudi tax law provides that no profit will be considered to arise from a contract for the supply of goods to Saudi Arabia, provided delivery of the goods is either free on board (FOB) or cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) to a Saudi port. However, should the contract provide for the delivery and/or installation of materials at a point inside Saudi Arabia, the supplier may be considered to be carrying on business within Saudi Arabia, and, as a consequence, the contract may be subject to Saudi income taxation as follows:
## Foreign income
The gross income derived by a capital company resident in Saudi Arabia from its operations and of its branches inside and outside Saudi Arabia is subject to tax in Saudi Arabia. However, in order to avoid double taxation on the same income, the following exceptions and clarifications are to be considered:
Previously (up to 31 December 2017), foreign dividends were taxable unless a double tax treaty (DTT) provided relief.
There are no restrictions on repatriation of profits, fees, capital, salaries, or other monies.

# Saudi Arabia
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 21 July 2024
Payments made from a resident party or a PE to a non-resident party for services performed are subject to WHT. The rates vary between 5%, 15%, and 20% based on the type of service.
The WHT should be paid within the first ten days of the month following the month during which the payment was made.
The domestic rate for WHT is 5% on dividends, 5% on interest, and 15% on royalties.
## Tax treaties
Saudi Arabia has entered into tax treaties with several countries. Treaties currently or about to be effective are listed below.
DTTs have not yet been effectively tested in Saudi Arabia. However, they generally follow the OECD Model Treaty and may provide certain relief, including WHT on dividends, interest, and royalties.
The following are the treaty WHT rates for payments made from Saudi Arabia to treaty country recipients. Each tax treaty should be studied carefully because there could be exceptions to the general rules.

ZATCA offers a choice of automatic application of relevant tax treaty without going through the refund procedure. The choice is given to Saudi Arabia residents or PEs of non-residents that make payments subject to WHT in Saudi Arabia.

As mentioned above, ZATCA provides a choice; taxpayers can still withhold tax and comply with the refund procedure.

# Saudi Arabia
## Overview
Last reviewed - 21 July 2024
The country is a leading producer of oil and natural gas. The government continues to pursue economic reform and diversification, particularly since Saudi Arabia's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in December 2005, and promote foreign investment. A burgeoning population, aquifer depletion, and an economy largely dependent on petroleum output and prices are all ongoing governmental concerns.
Saudi Arabia possesses about 20% of the world's proven petroleum reserves, ranks as the largest exporter of petroleum, and plays a leading role in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
In April 2016, Saudi Arabia introduced the Vision 2030 plan to reduce its dependence on oil, diversify the economy, and develop service sectors, such as health, education, infrastructure construction, recreation and tourism, and many more. The sweeping reforms outlined in the Vision 2030 and National Transformation Plan affect vast areas of the government, the economy, and citizens. Tax policy will play a significant role in these reforms as part of the government’s efforts to diversify revenues away from oil and address broader social and economic objectives while maintaining a fertile business environment and continuing to attract foreign direct investment (FDI).
Furthermore, Saudi Arabia is encouraging the growth of the private sector in order to diversify its economy and to employ more Saudi nationals. Diversification efforts are focusing on power generation, telecommunications, natural gas exploration, and petrochemical sectors. Roughly 10 million foreign workers play an important role in the Saudi economy, particularly in the oil and service sectors.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 21 July 2024
## Social security contributions
Social insurance contributions are paid monthly based on the monthly basic salary plus housing (paid or in kind) with an upper limit of SAR 45,000, are computed at 2% for non-Saudi employees (note that this is not social insurance, it is occupational hazard), and are paid by the employer. For Saudi employees, the rate is 21.5% and is paid by both the employee (9.75% = 9% social insurance + 0.75% unemployment insurance [SANED]) and the employer (11.75% = 9% social insurance + 2% occupational hazard + 0.75% unemployment insurance [SANED]).
## Consumption taxes
There is no consumption tax system in Saudi Arabia.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Saudi Arabia.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There are no inheritance, estate, or gift taxes in Saudi Arabia.
## Property taxes
There are no property taxes in Saudi Arabia. However, there is white land tax (WLT).
### White land tax (WLT)
Pursuant to Royal Decree No. M/4 dated 24 November 2015 and to Council of Ministers Decision No. 377 dated 13 June 2016, the White Land Tax Law and its implementing regulations (the 'WLT law') were issued.
The Ministry of Housing (MOH) has been mandated to enforce and implement the WLT law.
Under the WLT law, owners of urban vacant land (also referred to as 'unexploited land or undeveloped land') designated for residential or commercial use will have to pay an annual tax of 2.5% on the market value of the land.
#### Taxable lands

# Saudi Arabia
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 21 July 2024
Generally, non-Saudi investors are liable for income tax in Saudi Arabia. In most cases, Saudi citizen investors (and citizens of the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] countries, who are considered to be Saudi citizens for Saudi tax purposes) are liable for Zakat, an Islamic assessment. Where a company is owned by both Saudi and non-Saudi interests, the portion of taxable income attributable to the non-Saudi interest is subject to income tax, and the Saudi share goes into the basis on which Zakat is assessed.
According to the income tax law, the following persons are subject to income tax:
The rate of income tax is 20% of the net adjusted profits. WHT rates are between 5% and 20%. Zakat is charged on the company’s Zakat base at 2.5%. Zakat base represents the net worth of the entity as calculated for Zakat purposes.
It should be noted that, although the income tax rate is 20%, income from the following two activities is subject to different rates:
Effective 1 January 2018, the income tax legislation was amended to repeal the Natural Gas Investment Tax (NGIT) provisions; natural gas investment should be taxed under the general provisions of the income tax legislation (including being subject to the general income tax rate of 20%).
## Local income taxes
There are no local, state, or provincial government taxes on income other than the regular income tax or Zakat as mentioned above.

# Saudi Arabia
## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 21 July 2024
## Social security contributions
Social insurance contributions are paid monthly based on the monthly basic salary plus housing (paid or in kind) with an upper limit of SAR 45,000, are computed at 2% for non-Saudi employees (note that this is not social insurance, it is occupational hazard), and are paid by the employer. For Saudi employees, the rate is 21.5% and is paid by both the employee (9.75% = 9% social insurance + 0.75% unemployment insurance [SANED]) and the employer (11.75% = 9% social insurance + 2% occupational hazard + 0.75% unemployment insurance [SANED]).
## Consumption taxes
There is no consumption tax system in Saudi Arabia.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Saudi Arabia.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There are no inheritance, estate, or gift taxes in Saudi Arabia.
## Property taxes
There are no property taxes in Saudi Arabia. However, there is white land tax (WLT).
### White land tax (WLT)
Pursuant to Royal Decree No. M/4 dated 24 November 2015 and to Council of Ministers Decision No. 377 dated 13 June 2016, the White Land Tax Law and its implementing regulations (the 'WLT law') were issued.
The Ministry of Housing (MOH) has been mandated to enforce and implement the WLT law.
Under the WLT law, owners of urban vacant land (also referred to as 'unexploited land or undeveloped land') designated for residential or commercial use will have to pay an annual tax of 2.5% on the market value of the land.
#### Taxable lands
Article 8 of the implementing regulation states that the following conditions should be met for the land to qualify to be subject to WLT:
'Vacant land shall mean a land that is not developed for its purposes in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations applicable at the time of announcement'.
## Luxury and excise taxes

# Saudi Arabia
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 21 July 2024
## Taxable period
Tax filings are based on the company’s fiscal year.
## Tax returns
Returns are due to be filed with ZATCA within 120 days after the taxpayer’s year-end. The system is one of self-assessment.
According to the tax authority, companies that are owned by Saudis only, or by Saudis and non-Saudis, must file audited financial statements along with the tax return.
## Payment of tax
Final tax due must be paid within 120 days after the taxpayer's year-end.
Three equal advance tax payments are required to be made on the last day of the sixth, ninth, and 12th months for a current tax year, provided that the taxpayer has earned income during the year. Each advance payment is equal to 25% of the amount resulting from the taxpayer’s tax liability based on the previous year return minus the withheld tax on reported income, if any. The taxpayer is not required to make advance tax payments if the result of the said formula is less than SAR 500,000. Late payment of an advance payment is subject to a delay penalty of 1% of the amount due for every 30 days of delay.
## Tax audit process
There is no specific audit process followed by ZATCA; however, the most common ways for ZATCA to select companies for tax audits are the size of the company, the companies’ shareholders nationality (totally owned by foreigners and branches of foreign companies), and certain risk assessment measures.
ZATCA recently introduced what they call the 'risk engine', which is used to determine the companies that need to be audited. However, such engine has not been tested yet.
## Statute of limitations
ZATCA may, with a reasoned notification, make or amend a tax assessment within five years from the end of the deadline specified for filing the tax declaration for the taxable year, or, at any time, upon a written consent of the taxpayer.
ZATCA may make or amend an assessment within ten years of the deadline specified for filing the tax declaration for the taxable year if a taxpayer does not file its tax declaration or it is found that the declaration is incomplete or incorrect with the intent of tax evasion.
A taxpayer may request a refund of overpaid amounts at any time within five years from the end of the overpaid taxable year.
ZATCA emphasises the reconciliation between the payroll as per the records of the General Organisation for Social Insurance (GOSI) (i.e. salaries and wages subject to GOSI) and salaries and wages charged to the taxpayer’s accounts duly certified by a Saudi licensed CPA.
ZATCA focuses on the payments made to non-resident parties to verify compliance with the WHT regulations by requesting a reconciliation statement for such payments with the annual WHT form.
ZATCA has also been requesting import value lists from the Customs Authority in order to confirm the value of goods imported and declared by taxpayers in their annual declarations during the financial period.

# Saudi Arabia
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 21 July 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT) and excise tax
VAT Law and implementing regulations have been published and are applicable from 1 January 2018.
VAT is imposed at a rate of 5% for most goods and services, with certain exceptions applicable. Effective 1 July 2020, the standard VAT rate was increased by the government to 15%.
The Excise Tax Law became effective on 11 June 2017 in Saudi Arabia, with only tobacco products (at 100%), soft drinks (at 50%), and energy drinks (at 100%) selected as goods subject to the excise tax in Saudi Arabia.
In order to comply with the Saudi Arabian Excise Tax Law, manufacturers and importers of excisable goods are required to register with ZATCA. Businesses that qualify to be under the scope of the Excise Tax Law that fail to register and comply with the guidance issued by ZATCA will be considered as tax evaders and will be imposed penalties.
## Customs duties
Customs duties are imposed on imports according to tariff rates that are effective on the payment date in accordance with the Saudi Customs regulations. Customs duties are imposed on the price of the imported goods. This price is assessed based on the actual cost paid or on the agreed upon cost denominated in the currency of the exporting country. The price consists of the price of the imported goods as packed for shipping from the port of export plus freight and insurance cost to the Saudi port, which is converted to Saudi riyals at the exchange rates published by the Saudi Central Bank (SAMA) on the date of the declaration. In case this procedure is not achievable, the imported goods will be priced based on the most proximate comparable value that could be ascertained. Imported goods that are subject to customs duties based on weight are assessed based on the gross weight or the net weight as shown in the tariff schedules. The gross weight of the goods includes the goods weight, including all internal and external packing materials. Net weight of the goods excludes all internal and external packing materials, including the items used for separating and arranging the goods.
To encourage joint ventures in manufacturing, the government grants tariff protection from competing imports to locally produced, quality goods. Rates can be as high as 25%.
Penalties on smuggling goods vary from confiscation to collections of customs duties and penalties to imprisonment.
## Payroll taxes
Since there is no individual income tax regime in Saudi Arabia, earnings from employment are not subject to income tax. Only the social insurance tax (*see below*) is applied on the payroll.
## Social insurance tax
Social insurance tax is paid monthly based on (i) basic wage, (ii) cash or in-kind housing allowance, and (iii) commissions, with an upper limit of 45,000 Saudi riyals (SAR), is computed at 2% for non-Saudi employees, and is paid by the employer. For Saudi employees, the rate is 21.5% and is paid by both the employee (9.75%) and the employer (11.75%).
## Real Estate Transaction Tax (RETT)
RETT is imposed at a rate of 5% of the total real estate disposal value regardless of its condition, shape, or use at the time of the disposal.
This includes the land and what is being constructed or built on it, whether the disposal occurred on this land at its current state or after an establishment was built on it, irrespective of whether the entire property was disposed of or only a part of it such as a detachment, a communal, a residential unit, or any other types of real estate, and whether the disposal was authenticated or not.
RETT also applies on transfer of real estate rich entities (as defined for RETT purposes).
The rules provide for certain exemptions that could be available in certain cases.
## Other taxes
There is no form of stamp duty, transfer, sales, turnover, or production taxation, except in so far as they may fall within the scope of Zakat, which is applicable only to Saudi nationals.

# Saudi Arabia
## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 21 July 2024
## Tax Rules for Regional Headquarters (RHQs)
The Tax Rules for RHQs have been published by the Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority (ZATCA) with an immediate effect from the date of publishing (i.e. 16 February 2024).
The rules clarify several key matters to the tax and investment society, which includes the following, among others:
### Tax incentives
RHQs meeting the qualification criteria shall be eligible to enjoy the following tax incentives:
The WHT exemption shall not apply in any of the following cases:
Income derived by the RHQ from non-qualifying activities shall be treated according to the provisions of the relevant tax regulations in the Kingdom.
The provisions of the in-force treaties in Saudi and international obligations shall apply to the RHQs.
For purposes of all international treaties, conventions, or other agreements to which the Kingdom is party, RHQs are considered tax residents to the extent they meet the tax residency criteria according to Saudi Income Tax Law.
### **Duration of the tax incentives**
## Amendments to Zakat and Income Tax By-Laws
His Excellency the Minister of Finance has approved the amendments to Zakat and Income Tax By-Laws, which have been published in the Official Gazette (Umm AlQura) on 12 September 2023 and entered into effect from that date.
The amendments cover the deductibility of expenses for taxpayers, the procedures of the tax and Zakat litigation process, and the WHT rates on inter-company transactions, among other amendments.
The importance of these amendments arises from their extended impact on non-resident taxpayers in Saudi with respect to their income derived from a source in Saudi, particularly through related parties and branches of foreign companies.
## E-invoicing
On 28 May 2021, the ZATCA has published the e-invoicing resolution setting out the controls, requirements, technical specifications, and procedural rules covering the generation and integration phases, which includes value-added tax (VAT) invoices, debit notes, and credit notes. A detailed set of requirements and guidelines were also published.
The generation phase will be mandated from 4 December 2021, and the integration will be implemented in phases starting from 1 January 2023.
## Special tax rules for the Special Integrated Logistics Zone (ILBZ or 'the Zone')
The ILBZ is a special economic zone (SEZ) located adjacent to the King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) following the issuance of Royal Order (A/17) dated 10 October 2018.
The General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) has issued the Special Tax Rules (the 'Tax Bylaws') setting out the tax and customs incentives (and the associated conditions) that apply to entities established in the ILBZ to carry out specific activities.
The Tax Bylaws specify that, provided certain conditions can be met, ILBZ entities would be subject to corporate income tax (CIT) at 0% on the income earned from carrying on their specific activities for up to 50 years. Further, provided certain conditions can be met, ILBZ entities would also be exempt from deducting WHT on certain payments relating to the specific activities to non-residents.
From a customs perspective, goods imported into the ILBZ would be under a customs duty suspension arrangement. While these goods are under the customs duty suspension arrangement, transactions relating to these goods would be outside the scope of VAT in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Further guidance will be issued by the ZATCA to specify the conditions and the procedures that ILBZ entities will need to follow to access these tax and customs incentives.

# Saudi Arabia
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 21 July 2024
All expenses that are necessary and normal to the business, paid or accrued, are allowable deductions, provided the expense meets the following conditions:
## Depreciation
A depreciation deduction is allowed under the following limitations as stipulated by the law:
Depreciation for tax purposes is calculated as follows, based on the following five categories of depreciable tangible or intangible assets, other than land:
| Asset category | Depreciation rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Fixed buildings | 5 |
| Industrial and agricultural movable buildings | 10 |
| Factories, machines and equipment, computer application programs, passenger cars, and cargo vehicles | 25 |
| Expenditures for geological surveying, drilling, exploration, and other preliminary work to exploit and develop natural resources and their fields | 20 |
| All other tangible or intangible assets not included in previous categories, such as furniture, planes, ships and trains, and goodwill | 10 |
The declining-balance method of depreciation, according to the above rates, should be followed for tax purposes. However, straight-line depreciation is allowed for Zakat payers as per Zakat regulations.
There are also rules for depreciation relating to assets either acquired or disposed of. Essentially, 50% of the allowable acquisition price or disposal proceeds is added to or subtracted from the asset pool in the first year, and the remaining 50% in the following year.
From 1 January 2018, the cost base of assets transferred or distributed between companies that are part of the same group should be set at the net book value.
Assets under build, own, and transfer (BOT) and build, own, operate, and transfer (BOOT) are allowed to be depreciated over the contract period. This presumes, although it is not clear, that assets under the BOT and BOOT schemes actually will have a separate grouping in addition to the above prescribed groups.
## Start-up expenses
Tax treatment of start-up expenses depend on how they were treated under Saudi generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Generally, they can be fully expensed in the first financial year or can be capitalised and amortised.
## Loan charges (interest expenses)
An interest deduction is limited to the lower of the loan charge incurred during the tax year, if related to income that is subject to tax, or the result of the following formula, whichever is less.
The taxpayer’s total income from loan charges, plus 50% of (A minus B) as below:
A = income subject to tax other than income from loan charges.
B = expenses allowed under the law other than loan charge expenses.
Note that this formula does not apply to banks and interest charges used to finance capital assets that are capitalised / added to the value of the asset during the construction phase of that asset.
## Bad debt
Bad debts are deductible, provided they meet all of the following conditions:
## Charitable contributions
In determining the tax base of each taxpayer, a deduction is allowed for donations paid during the taxable year to public agencies or philanthropic societies licensed in Saudi Arabia, which are non-profit organisations and are allowed to receive donations.
## Allocations and reserves
Allocations and reserves formed during the year are deductible as follows:
A reserve for unearned premiums means a part of premium amounts collected or stated in books that covers risks related to the future tax year(s). A reserve for unexpired risks mean the amount of compensation claimed or reported, but for which the payment process falls short of completion during the tax year.
## School fees
School fees paid by taxpayers for their employees’ children are deductible expenses, provided they meet the following conditions:
## Pension fund
Employers’ contributions to employees’ pension funds or savings funds established under Saudi Arabia’s rules and regulations are deductible, provided that such contribution, one payment or in aggregate, is not in excess of 25% of the employee’s income before the employer’s contributions and that the fund meets the following criteria:
A capital company is allowed to deduct its contribution to a retirement fund, a social insurance fund, or any other fund established for the purpose of settling employee end-of-service benefits or to meet staff medical expenses, provided they meet certain conditions. It should be noted that there is a notification requirement to ZATCA in order to claim any deduction of the contribution.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties related to income tax, paid or payable in Saudi Arabia or to other countries, are not deductible.
Financial fines or penalties paid or payable to any party in Saudi Arabia, such as traffic fines or fines for causing damage to public utilities, are also not deductible.
Fines or penalties paid for breach of contractual obligations, such as fines on delayed or defaulted completion of contracts, are deductible, provided they are documented by the contracting party and the income from such penalties is reported in the year of recovery.
## Taxes
Income taxes are not deductible.
## Non-deductible expenses
The following expenses are non-deductible:
## Net operating losses
A taxpayer may carry forward operational losses, as adjusted, to the years following the loss year until the cumulative loss is fully offset. The maximum profit percentage of any year that could be used to offset cumulative losses should not exceed 25% of the year’s taxable profit as reported in the taxpayer’s return. Carryback of losses is not allowed.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments made to head offices located abroad by local branches are not deductible. Such payments include:
The value of goods or services delivered to the taxpayer by related parties is not deductible to the extent that it is in excess of an arm’s-length value.

# Saudi Arabia
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 21 July 2024
The income tax rules in Saudi Arabia do not allow for consolidation or grouping of taxpayers. For Zakat purposes, the concept of consolidation is acceptable and relief may be obtained for wholly owned subsidiaries by Saudi/GCC companies that are subject to Zakat.
Note that an entity operating in Saudi Arabia that has undertaken more than one project under the same commercial registration is required to consolidate the results of such projects into the financial statements of that entity and subject them to taxation as a single operation.
## Transfer pricing
On 15 February 2019, ZATCA published the Transfer Pricing By-Laws (the By-Laws) in final form as well as an accompanying frequently asked questions (FAQs) document.
The By-Laws are effective from their date of publication in the official gazette. It has also been clarified in the FAQs (in question 8) that the By-Laws will apply to the reporting year ended 31 December 2018 and all subsequent reporting years.
On 7 April 2023, ZATCA announced the approval of the proposed amendments to the Transfer Pricing By-Laws to bring the following into effect:
The above amendments will be applicable for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2024.
### Persons subject to the By-Laws
For financial years starting on or after 1 January 2024, the transfer pricing provisions apply to all tax and Zakat paying entities (initially, besides Country-by-Country [CbC] Reporting, the transfer pricing provisions were only applicable to taxpayers and entities subject to both tax and Zakat).
### Scope of the By-Laws: Domestic transactions
Unless expressly exempt in the By-Laws, all related party transactions, regardless of the place of residence, nationality, or domicile of the persons are within the scope of the By-Laws.
### Non-arm's-length pricing
In circumstances where the terms, conditions, or remuneration of a controlled transaction are not consistent with the arm's-length principle, ZATCA has the ability to reallocate or disregard the result of the controlled transaction.
### Documentation requirements
#### Disclosure Form of Controlled Transactions (CTDF)
Article 14 of the By-Laws requires taxpayers to submit a CTDF to ZATCA together with their annual income tax declaration within 120 days of the end of the fiscal year.
Documentation must be readily accessible and available for review by the tax authority at the time of submission of the CTDF and contain information and economic analysis to verify that the conditions of the controlled transactions are at arm’s length.
The CTDF also requires confirmation of whether the taxable person maintains a transfer pricing Master File and Local File. The implied effect of this is therefore to require that Master File and Local File documentation is prepared within 120 days of the end of the fiscal year.
The By-Laws state that 'together with the CTDF, the taxpayer must submit an affidavit from a licensed auditor through which the auditor certifies that the transfer pricing policy of the multinational enterprise (MNE) is consistently applied by and in relation to the taxpayer'.
Note that 'transfer pricing policy' is not defined in the By-Laws.
Article 4, Paragraph A, of the By-Laws requires the taxpayer to make adjustments to their tax base to reflect arm’s-length pricing of controlled transactions and report those adjustments in their annual tax declarations.
#### Master File and Local File
The Master File and Local File requirements broadly follow those outlined by the recommendations of Action 13 of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD’s) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project.
The Master File will need to be provided to ZATCA within a maximum of 30 days from request (or the length of time given in the request if longer). The Local File is also to be provided within 30 days upon request by ZATCA (or the length of time given in the request if longer).
ZATCA has stated on its website, and described further in the FAQs, that it will provide an extension of 60 days to the requirements to submit the Master File and Local File on request for 2019 only.
### Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
The By-Laws set out the circumstances in which the Ultimate Parent Entity of an MNE Group (UPE), or a taxable person in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia that is not a UPE, will need to submit and file reports and notifications to ZATCA, and state that these will need to be in the language and form that ZATCA may specify.
The requirements are broadly in line with the recommendations of Action 13 of the OECD’s BEPS Project.
The CbC reporting requirements now include Zakat payers as well as taxpayers.
The threshold for companies to be subject to the report filing and notification requirements is a consolidated group revenue exceeding SAR 3.2 billion, and it must be filed with ZATCA within 12 months after the last day of the year to which the report relates.
## Thin capitalisation
There is no special legislation governing thin capitalisation for tax purposes. A Saudi company may deduct interest payments to affiliates, but not the head office, provided that the amount of debt and rate of interest are at arm’s length and that the interest deductibility formula is met. A Saudi company may be financed with minimum capital, and there is no limit to the amount of debt that may be used.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no special rules for CFCs in Saudi Arabia. However, *as mentioned above*, the gross income derived by a capital company resident in Saudi Arabia from its operations and branches outside Saudi Arabia is subject to tax in Saudi Arabia (subject to relevant conditions).
## Intra-group transactions relief
Intra-group transfers of cash, shares, financial securities, and other tangible and intangible assets can be carried out tax neutrally, provided the following conditions are met:
The 'cost base' of the relevant intra-group transactions will be net book value to achieve the no gain no loss result.
It is not yet clear whether non-resident companies or cross-border transactions would also benefit from such relief.

# Saudi Arabia
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 21 July 2024
## Foreign tax credit
Income tax and related fines and penalties paid or payable to Saudi Arabia or to other countries are non-deductible expenses.
## Incentives for investment in less-developed regions
The government of Saudi Arabia has granted tax concessions to the following six less-developed regions in Saudi Arabia, with the intention of attracting more investment:
These tax privileges are granted for a period of ten years from the start of any project.
The qualifying investing company’s annual tax bill may be reduced by:
More deductions are granted if investment capital for any project exceeds SAR 1 million and if more than five employees of Saudi nationality have jobs of a technical or administrative nature with contracts of at least one year.
## Customs incentives

## Tax Rules for Regional Headquarters (RHQs)
The Tax Rules for RHQs have been published by the Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority (ZATCA) with an immediate effect from the date of publishing (i.e. 16 February 2024).
The rules clarify several key matters to the tax and investment society, which includes the following, among others:
### Key definitions regarding the RHQs:
The Rules state some key definitions with respect to the RHQs, which include the following, among others:
### Tax incentives
RHQs meeting the qualification criteria shall be eligible to enjoy the following tax incentives:
The WHT exemption shall not apply in any of the following cases:
Income derived by the RHQ from non-qualifying activities shall be treated according to the provisions of the relevant tax regulations in the Kingdom.
The provisions of the in-force treaties in Saudi and international obligations shall apply to the RHQs.
For purposes of all international treaties, conventions, or other agreements to which the Kingdom is party, RHQs are considered tax residents to the extent they meet the tax residency criteria according to Saudi Income Tax Law.
### **Duration of the tax incentives**
### Economic substance rules for the RHQs:
In addition to the set requirements by the competent authority, RHQs shall fulfil all of the following economic substance requirements:
### Tax compliance requirements:
RHQs are required to comply with the tax and Zakat regulations with respect to filing the tax and Zakat returns.
In addition to the above, RHQs should comply with the annual report (according to the form provided and the specified procedures by ZATCA), to ensure and validate the compliance with the economic substance requirements.
### Fines and penalties:
RHQs shall be exposed to certain fines and penalties in case of non-compliance with the Tax Rules for RHQs. These fines and penalties shall apply without prejudice the other penalties stipulated as per the Tax Regulations:
RHQs must comply with the Transfer Pricing By-Laws and any amendments to it. Also, RHQs must ensure that all transactions with related parties are conducted at arm’s-length.
In addition to the above-mentioned fines and penalties, ZATCA in coordination with the competent authority may revoke the tax incentives for the RHQ in any of the tax avoidance cases mentioned per the Tax Rules for RHQs.

# Saudi Arabia
## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 21 July 2024
## United States (US) Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
Saudi Arabia signed a Model 1 Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) in light of the FATCA dated 24 June 2014. The draft regulations were issued in February 2012 and the final regulations were released on 17 January 2013 with an amendment to some of the deadlines issued through a notice on 12 July 2013.
On 6 February 2017, the Saudi Arabian Cabinet formally approved the IGA between Saudi Arabia and the United States to improve international tax compliance and implement the FATCA. The IGA and related implementing regulations will reduce the burden for financial institutions and remove some of the implementation issues faced by Saudi Arabia financial institutions, including the legal impediments related to data protection and reporting restrictions.
Under the IGA, Saudi-based financial institutions will be treated as compliant with the FATCA and should not be subject to a 30% WHT on US-source income and gross proceeds unless a financial institution fails to meet the requirements set out in the IGA and Saudi implementing regulations.
The IGA, signed on 15 November 2016, requires financial institutions to report US reportable accounts to the local competent authority, which is ZATCA. In case of non-compliance with IGA requirements, ZATCA may subject the relevant financial institutions to penalties.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
On 2 November 2016, the OECD announced that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia joined the CRS Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA), committed to the first exchange of financial account information by September 2018 (2018 adopter).
Applicable for individuals and legal entities, it aims to give participating countries transparency on the financial assets that residents hold offshore.
The CRS requires financial institutions to identify customer tax residencies and report to local tax authorities financial accounts held directly or indirectly by foreign tax residents. It also requires those tax authorities (in participating countries) to exchange this information.
If you are tax resident of a country other than the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia or where you maintain your bank account, then under the CRS, KSA-based financial institutions may be required to provide details, including information relating to accounts, to the tax authority in the country of your tax residency through ZATCA in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In case of non-compliance, ZATCA may subject the relevant financial institutions to penalties.
