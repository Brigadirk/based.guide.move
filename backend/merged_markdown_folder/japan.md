## Social security contributions
An employee whose salary or bonus, including fringe benefits, is paid in Japan by a local employer (including a Japanese branch of a foreign corporation) is generally liable to pay a share of social insurance premiums. The employee’s share consists of the following contributions:
| Contribution | Standard premiums on monthly salary | Standard premiums on bonuses |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Health insurance for the Metropolis of Tokyo (each prefecture has its own health insurance rate, and rates are slightly higher for individuals from the age of 40 to the age of 64) (1) | 4.99% (on a maximum of JPY 1,390,000 of wages per month) | 4.99% (on an annual cap of JPY 5.73 million of irregular annual total payments) |
| Welfare pension (2) | 9.15% (on a maximum of JPY 650,000 of wages per month) | 9.15% (on a maximum of JPY 1.5 million of irregular payments per month) |
| Unemployment insurance (3) | 0.60% | 0.60% |
| Total | 14.75% | 14.75% |
Note
1. The fixed rate of 4.99% (previously 5.00%) for health insurance applies from March 2024. Simultaneously, the fixed rate of 0.80% (previously 0.91%) for long-term care insurance also applies from March 2024. Long-term care insurance is required for individuals from the age of 40 to the age of 64.
2. Premiums on child allowances is imposed separately at 0.36%.
3. Premiums on unemployment insurance are imposed at 0.6%.
Japan social insurance paid by the employee is deductible for Japan income tax purposes.
## Consumption taxes
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are currently no net wealth/worth taxes in Japan.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Inheritance tax is a national tax imposed on the recipients of an inheritance.
The transfer of overseas assets between foreign nationals who have had a 'Jusho' ( tax residency determined based on the family, business, days staying in Japan, asset location) in Japan for less than ten out of the last 15 years with a visa issued under Table 1 of the Visa Status Table of Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act ('temporary foreigners') and other temporary foreigners or with non-Japanese nationals outside of Japan is exempt from Japan gift and inheritance tax. Note, however, that the transfer of overseas assets between non-Japanese nationals and Japanese nationals who currently have a 'Jusho' or have had a 'Jusho' in Japan within the previous ten years is not exempt.
To qualify for the above exemption, foreign nationals need to meet the definition of temporary foreigners. The foreign national has to (i) have had a ‘Jusho’ in Japan for not more than ten out of the past 15 years looking back from the date of death/gift and (ii) hold a visa issued under Table 1. Foreign nationals who satisfy (i), but fail to satisfy (ii) (i.e. who hold a visa issued under Table 2), are not considered temporary foreigners and are therefore subject to worldwide taxation of Japan gift and inheritance tax while residing in Japan, regardless of whom the transfers are made with.
Note that a Table 1 visa under the Visa Status Table of the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act includes work-related visas and does not include the following visa types: permanent resident, spouse or child of a Japanese national, spouse or child of a permanent resident, and long-term resident.
The transfer of overseas assets to a Japanese national heir or donee who is not a resident of Japan but who has had a ‘Jusho’ in Japan within the ten years prior to the gift or inheritance is subject to Japan gift and inheritance tax. If a Japanese national heir or donee has not had a ‘Jusho’ in Japan within the ten years prior to the gift or inheritance, they will not be subject to tax so long as the decedent or donor is a foreign national. Similarly, the transfer of overseas assets from a Japanese national decedent or donor who is not a resident of Japan but had a ‘Jusho’ in Japan within the ten years prior to the gift or inheritance is also subject to Japan gift and inheritance tax.
Effective 1 April 2021, the Japan gift and inheritance tax laws were updated to further narrow the scope or applicability for foreign nationals. The transfer of overseas assets from foreign nationals, regardless of the length of their period of residence in Japan, to ‘temporary foreigners’ or non-Japanese nationals outside of Japan is exempt from Japan gift and inheritance tax if the foreign national transferor holds a Table 1 visa.
This updated exemption and disregard to the length of period of residence in Japan does not apply to foreign national resident recipients of gifts and inheritances of overseas assets. Foreign national resident recipients still need to have had a ‘Jusho’ in Japan for no more than ten of the past 15 years and hold a Table 1 visa in order to be considered ‘temporary foreigners’ and be exempt from Japan gift and inheritance tax on overseas assets received from foreign national transferors. Also, to clarify and confirm, the updated law does not provide an exemption on the transfer of overseas assets if either the foreign national resident transferor or transferee holds a Table 2 visa. This is unchanged.
Note that any transfers of assets located in Japan are always subject to Japan gift and inheritance tax, regardless of whom the transfers are between or when the transfers take place.
Assets subject to inheritance tax include tangible, intangible, real, or personal property, unless otherwise specifically exempt under the law. Assets are valued in accordance with the provisions of the Japanese tax rules. The same rules apply to the gift tax system.
The basic exemption is JPY 30 million plus JPY 6 million per statutory heir. If the gross estate is smaller than the total amount of the basic exemption, there is no filing requirement.
Gift tax is a national tax levied on the recipients of a gift. The scope of gift tax is similar to the scope of inheritance tax in that a taxpayer’s visa type and the time they have resided inside and outside of Japan affects which gifts may be subject to gift tax. However, the gift tax regime is not unified with inheritance tax, with the exception of gifts made within seven years (within three years for gifts made on or before 31 December 2023) prior to the death of the donor.
The annual gift tax exemption per recipient is JPY 1.1 million. Any amount of gift(s) received above the exemption will potentially be subject to Japan gift tax.
Additionally, there is a special system where the taxpayer can make an irrevocable election to integrate inheritance and gift tax when certain conditions are met.
Under the special system, referred to as 'settlement of taxes at the time of inheritance':

Annual basic exemption for gift tax\*: JPY 1,100,000
\* This basic exemption does not apply to the irrevocable elective system mentioned above.
## Property (fixed assets) taxes
The annual fixed assets tax is levied by the local tax authorities on real property. Real property is taxed at 1.4% (standard rate including city planning tax) of the value appraised by the local tax authorities. The depreciable fixed assets tax is assessed at 1.4% of cost after statutory depreciation.
Registration and license tax is levied where certain property is registered, at a rate from 0.1% to 2% of the taxable basis. The taxable basis depends upon the property being registered.
## Luxury and excise taxes
Excise taxes were abolished by introduction of the consumption tax.

Notes
6. Tax treaties with many countries provide reduced tax rates, as indicated. Some treaties, however, provide higher tax rates (e.g. Brazil, Thailand), although the rate under domestic law will be the maximum rate. Still other treaties do not provide rates at all (e.g. Egypt). In these instances, rates specified under Japanese domestic tax laws apply.
7. The tax treaty was concluded mainly for the purpose of information exchange.
8. The tax treaties with Brazil and Thailand provide 25% tax rates for certain income. However, the WHT rate cannot exceed 20.42% (including the income surtax of 2.1%) on any income to be received by a non-resident taxpayer of Japan under Japanese income tax law.
9. The treaty with the former Czechoslovakia is applied to the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. It stipulates that cultural royalties are tax exempt.
10. The treaty with the former USSR is applied to Armenia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan.
11. Tax treaties with many countries provide reduced rates where the recipients of interest are government organisations and financial institutions.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
The taxable income of a corporation is the aggregate income from all sources. There is no specific requirement to differentiate between the types of income. In principle, accounting for tax purposes follows Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in Japan, and income of a corporation is determined on an accrual basis.
## Inventory valuation
Inventory cost should be determined by applying one of the following methods accepted for corporate tax purposes: actual individual cost, first in first out (FIFO), weighted average, moving average, most recent retail, selling price reduction, and lower of cost or market.
## Capital gains
Capital gains and losses are classified as ordinary income and losses, respectively.
Under certain circumstances (e.g. qualified reinvestment, exchange of property), taxes generally levied on capital gains may be deferred (i.e. provided rollover relief) as long as certain requirements are met. A special relief is available in the case of expropriation of real property by either the national or a local government.
The recognition of capital gains or losses from the transfer of certain assets between group companies is to be deferred until the asset is transferred to a non-group company.
## Dividend income
The threshold ownership percentage for corporate dividend exclusion is illustrated in the following table.
A holding period of six months or more until the tax year-end for which the dividend will be paid is required to be eligible for the dividend income exclusion for ownership percentages of between 1/3 to 100%. The dividend income exclusion for ‘other domestic corporation’ and ‘portfolio investment’ is allowed by reference to the ownership percentage as of the tax year-end for which the dividend will be paid.
| Type of investment | Ownership % | Exclusion % |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wholly owned domestic subsidiary | 100% | 100% |
| Affiliated domestic corporation | More than 1/3 | 100% less allocable interest |
| Other domestic corporation | More than 5% but less than 1/3 | 50% |
|
| Portfolio investment | Less than 5% | 20%\* |
| Exchange trust fund (ETF) | | 20% (treated as a portfolio investment) |
| Other investment trusts | | 0% |
\* For dividends from portfolio investments received by insurance companies, the exclusion percentage will be 40%.
95% of dividends received by a domestic corporation from a foreign corporation in which it has held at least 25% of the outstanding shares for a continuous period of six months or more, ending on the date on which the dividend is declared, can be excluded from the company’s taxable income. The ownership percentage may be reduced depending on the terms of a tax treaty between Japan and the jurisdiction of the foreign corporation. 100% of dividends received by a domestic corporation from a foreign controlled corporation (CFC) can be excluded from the company’s taxable income to the extent that the dividend is distributed from income of the CFC that was subject to taxation by the Japanese corporation under the CFC regime.
Dividends received from foreign corporations where the dividend is deductible for corporate tax purposes in the foreign corporation’s jurisdiction are outside the scope of the dividend exclusion regime. As a result, any dividends paid to domestic corporations under so-called ‘mandatorily redeemable preferred shares’ issued by Australian or Brazilian subsidiaries, where the dividends are paid in a manner similar to interest and are deductible for local tax purposes, are not excluded from taxation in Japan.
Any foreign tax imposed on a taxable dividend in Japan will be eligible for foreign tax credit relief.
WHT for dividends is applicable at a rate of 15% national tax and 5% local tax (or 20% [national tax] depending on the type of stock from which the dividends were received), and a tax credit may also be available. The national tax portion of the WHT is subject to an income surtax of 2.1%, which is levied for dividends received for the period from 1 January 2013 through 31 December 2037. As a result, total WHT of 20.315% (or 20.42%) is levied.
Effective 1 October 2023, WHT between domestic corporations will be eliminated if the dividends are paid to a Japanese company by the following Japanese companies: (i) a 100% subsidiary or (ii) a company where the recipient directly holds greater than 1/3 of the paying company on the dividend record date.
## Interest income
Interest (on bonds or deposits) received is included in taxable income. WHT for interest is applicable at a rate of 15% national tax (for both corporate and individual recipients) and 5% local tax (for individual recipients only), and a tax credit may be available. As with dividend income, the national tax portion of the WHT is subject to an income surtax of 2.1%, which is levied for interest income earned for the period from 1 January 2013 through 31 December 2037. As a result, total WHT of 20.315% is levied for individual recipients and 15.315% for corporate recipients. Interest on loans is only subject to WHT of 20.42% (20% national tax plus surtax) if the recipient is a non-resident or a foreign corporation.
## Royalty income
Royalty income is subject to corporate taxation in the same manner as other income. If the recipient is a non-resident or a foreign corporation, WHT on royalty income is applied at the rate of 20% national tax and a surtax of 2.1%, which surtax is levied for royalties received for the period from 1 January 2013 through 31 December 2037. As a result, total WHT of 20.42% is levied.
## Real estate rental income
Real estate rental income is subject to corporate taxation in the same manner as other income. If the recipient is a non-resident or a foreign corporation, WHT on real estate rental income is applied at the rate of 20% national tax and a surtax of 2.1%, which surtax is levied for rental income received for the period from 1 January 2013 through 31 December 2037. As a result, total WHT of 20.42% is levied.
Real estate capital gain is subject to corporate taxation in the same manner as other income. If the recipient is a non-resident or a foreign corporation, WHT on real estate capital gain is applied at the rate of 10% national tax and a surtax of 2.1%. Rental income is also subject to a rate of 10% national tax, and a surtax of 2.1% will be applied for rental income received from 1 January 2013 through 31 December 2037. As a result, total WHT of 10.21% is levied.
In contrast to the financial income described above (i.e. interest, dividends, royalties), real estate rental income and capital gains are subject to corporate income tax for a non-resident or a foreign corporation. WHT is creditable from this corporate tax liability by the filing of a corporate tax return.
## Foreign income
A domestic corporation is subject to Japanese corporate income taxes on its worldwide income. However, to avoid double taxation of foreign-source income, such corporations are allowed to claim a tax credit against corporation and inhabitants’ taxes for foreign income taxes paid directly. *See Foreign tax credit in the [Tax credits and incentives](japan/corporate/tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for more information*.
Undistributed profits of a foreign subsidiary (i.e. a CFC) for which the applicable tax rate is 30% (in the case of a shell company; the rate will be reduced to 27% for tax years of the Japanese parent beginning on or after 1 April 2024) or 20% are included in the Japanese parent company’s taxable income under certain conditions. *See Anti-tax haven (CFC) rules in the [Group taxation](japan/corporate/group-taxation.html) section for more information*.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Taxable period
## Tax returns
Corporate income tax returns (i.e. the national corporation tax return, enterprise tax return, and local inhabitants’ tax return) are self-assessment tax returns.
If a corporation meets certain conditions, such as keeping certain accounting books, and makes an application for it in advance, it is allowed to file a ‘blue form’ tax return. A ‘blue form’ filing corporation may benefit from loss carryforward and other benefits, including access to incentives.
A corporation (including a branch) is required to file the final corporate income and consumption tax returns within two months after the end of its annual accounting period. In certain cases, if a corporation cannot file the final return by the deadline, the due date of the final return may be extended for one month (two months in case of a group tax relief filing) with the tax authority’s approval.
Large corporations (with capital at the beginning of the tax year exceeding JPY 10 million) and certain other types of corporations are required to file corporate and local tax returns and consumption tax returns by e-filing.
## Payment of tax
Income taxes payable on the final corporate income tax and consumption tax returns should be paid on or before the filing due date of the final tax returns (usually two months after the end of the corporation’s accounting period). If an extension of time for filing is granted, the taxes may be paid on or before the extended due date with interest accrued at a rate of 2.4% (for the year 2023) *per annum* for the period from the day following the original due date (i.e. two months after the end of an accounting period) to the date of the actual payment.
Provisional tax payments are required for a corporation that has a tax period longer than six months. Provisional taxes generally are computed as one-half of the tax liabilities for the previous year, but they may be reduced by the filing of interim tax returns that reflect semi-annual results of the operations. The provisional tax payment is required to be made within two months after the end of the sixth month of the corporation’s accounting period.
## Penalties
If the tax return is filed late, a late filing penalty is imposed at 15% to 20% of the tax balance due. Where a corporation voluntarily files the tax return after the due date, this penalty may be reduced to 5% if the filing is completed before the tax authorities’ tax audit notification. The rate is increased to 10% (or 15% if the tax due is in excess of JPY 500,000 or 25% if the tax due is in excess of JPY 3 million) if the filing is completed before acknowledgement of the tax assessment notice. The late filing penalty will be increased to 15% (or 20% if the tax due is in excess of JPY 500,000 or 30% if the tax due is in excess of JPY 3 million) if the filing is completed by or after acknowledgement of the tax assessment notice.
An under-payment penalty is imposed at 10% to 15% of additional tax due. Where a corporation amends its tax return and pays any additional tax liabilities voluntarily after the due date, this penalty may not be levied. The penalty is imposed at 5% to 10% once notification of the commencement of a tax audit is received.
In addition, interest for the late payment of tax is levied at 2.4% *per annum* for the first two months and increases to 8.7 % *per annum* thereafter (for the tax year 2023).
## Tax audit process
Generally speaking, corporate tax audits are performed in cycles of three to five years’ duration. However, this period may be shortened in certain cases, such as: significant tax matters are pointed out in a prior audit, the tax authorities decide to conduct industry-wide audits, the taxpayer is reported in the media for a significant transaction, etc. If a taxpayer requests a downward correction of a tax return in order to obtain a refund, a high-level tax audit will also be performed before the refund is granted.
In principle, tax agents are required to notify taxpayers prior to commencement of an audit. Similarly, upon completion of a tax audit, tax officers are in principle required to provide the taxpayer with a brief written summary of their findings.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations is generally five years, subject to the below exceptions:
Tax authorities are often focused on cross-border, inter-company transactions (i.e. transfer pricing), PEs, and significant group restructurings, among other issues.

## Social security contributions
An employee whose salary or bonus, including fringe benefits, is paid in Japan by a local employer (including a Japanese branch of a foreign corporation) is generally liable to pay a share of social insurance premiums. The employee’s share consists of the following contributions:
| Contribution | Standard premiums on monthly salary | Standard premiums on bonuses |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Health insurance for the Metropolis of Tokyo (each prefecture has its own health insurance rate, and rates are slightly higher for individuals from the age of 40 to the age of 64) (1) | 4.99% (on a maximum of JPY 1,390,000 of wages per month) | 4.99% (on an annual cap of JPY 5.73 million of irregular annual total payments) |
| Welfare pension (2) | 9.15% (on a maximum of JPY 650,000 of wages per month) | 9.15% (on a maximum of JPY 1.5 million of irregular payments per month) |
| Unemployment insurance (3) | 0.60% | 0.60% |
| Total | 14.75% | 14.75% |
Note
1. The fixed rate of 4.99% (previously 5.00%) for health insurance applies from March 2024. Simultaneously, the fixed rate of 0.80% (previously 0.91%) for long-term care insurance also applies from March 2024. Long-term care insurance is required for individuals from the age of 40 to the age of 64.
2. Premiums on child allowances is imposed separately at 0.36%.
3. Premiums on unemployment insurance are imposed at 0.6%.
Japan social insurance paid by the employee is deductible for Japan income tax purposes.
## Consumption taxes
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are currently no net wealth/worth taxes in Japan.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Inheritance tax is a national tax imposed on the recipients of an inheritance.
The transfer of overseas assets between foreign nationals who have had a 'Jusho' ( tax residency determined based on the family, business, days staying in Japan, asset location) in Japan for less than ten out of the last 15 years with a visa issued under Table 1 of the Visa Status Table of Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act ('temporary foreigners') and other temporary foreigners or with non-Japanese nationals outside of Japan is exempt from Japan gift and inheritance tax. Note, however, that the transfer of overseas assets between non-Japanese nationals and Japanese nationals who currently have a 'Jusho' or have had a 'Jusho' in Japan within the previous ten years is not exempt.
To qualify for the above exemption, foreign nationals need to meet the definition of temporary foreigners. The foreign national has to (i) have had a ‘Jusho’ in Japan for not more than ten out of the past 15 years looking back from the date of death/gift and (ii) hold a visa issued under Table 1. Foreign nationals who satisfy (i), but fail to satisfy (ii) (i.e. who hold a visa issued under Table 2), are not considered temporary foreigners and are therefore subject to worldwide taxation of Japan gift and inheritance tax while residing in Japan, regardless of whom the transfers are made with.
Note that a Table 1 visa under the Visa Status Table of the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act includes work-related visas and does not include the following visa types: permanent resident, spouse or child of a Japanese national, spouse or child of a permanent resident, and long-term resident.
The transfer of overseas assets to a Japanese national heir or donee who is not a resident of Japan but who has had a ‘Jusho’ in Japan within the ten years prior to the gift or inheritance is subject to Japan gift and inheritance tax. If a Japanese national heir or donee has not had a ‘Jusho’ in Japan within the ten years prior to the gift or inheritance, they will not be subject to tax so long as the decedent or donor is a foreign national. Similarly, the transfer of overseas assets from a Japanese national decedent or donor who is not a resident of Japan but had a ‘Jusho’ in Japan within the ten years prior to the gift or inheritance is also subject to Japan gift and inheritance tax.
Effective 1 April 2021, the Japan gift and inheritance tax laws were updated to further narrow the scope or applicability for foreign nationals. The transfer of overseas assets from foreign nationals, regardless of the length of their period of residence in Japan, to ‘temporary foreigners’ or non-Japanese nationals outside of Japan is exempt from Japan gift and inheritance tax if the foreign national transferor holds a Table 1 visa.
This updated exemption and disregard to the length of period of residence in Japan does not apply to foreign national resident recipients of gifts and inheritances of overseas assets. Foreign national resident recipients still need to have had a ‘Jusho’ in Japan for no more than ten of the past 15 years and hold a Table 1 visa in order to be considered ‘temporary foreigners’ and be exempt from Japan gift and inheritance tax on overseas assets received from foreign national transferors. Also, to clarify and confirm, the updated law does not provide an exemption on the transfer of overseas assets if either the foreign national resident transferor or transferee holds a Table 2 visa. This is unchanged.
Note that any transfers of assets located in Japan are always subject to Japan gift and inheritance tax, regardless of whom the transfers are between or when the transfers take place.
Assets subject to inheritance tax include tangible, intangible, real, or personal property, unless otherwise specifically exempt under the law. Assets are valued in accordance with the provisions of the Japanese tax rules. The same rules apply to the gift tax system.
The basic exemption is JPY 30 million plus JPY 6 million per statutory heir. If the gross estate is smaller than the total amount of the basic exemption, there is no filing requirement.
Gift tax is a national tax levied on the recipients of a gift. The scope of gift tax is similar to the scope of inheritance tax in that a taxpayer’s visa type and the time they have resided inside and outside of Japan affects which gifts may be subject to gift tax. However, the gift tax regime is not unified with inheritance tax, with the exception of gifts made within seven years (within three years for gifts made on or before 31 December 2023) prior to the death of the donor.
The annual gift tax exemption per recipient is JPY 1.1 million. Any amount of gift(s) received above the exemption will potentially be subject to Japan gift tax.
Additionally, there is a special system where the taxpayer can make an irrevocable election to integrate inheritance and gift tax when certain conditions are met.
Under the special system, referred to as 'settlement of taxes at the time of inheritance':
### Inheritance tax rates

Annual basic exemption for gift tax\*: JPY 1,100,000
\* This basic exemption does not apply to the irrevocable elective system mentioned above.
## Property (fixed assets) taxes
The annual fixed assets tax is levied by the local tax authorities on real property. Real property is taxed at 1.4% (standard rate including city planning tax) of the value appraised by the local tax authorities. The depreciable fixed assets tax is assessed at 1.4% of cost after statutory depreciation.
Registration and license tax is levied where certain property is registered, at a rate from 0.1% to 2% of the taxable basis. The taxable basis depends upon the property being registered.
## Luxury and excise taxes
Excise taxes were abolished by introduction of the consumption tax.

Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Consumption tax
Consumption tax paid by a corporation that is attributable to taxable revenue shall be creditable/refundable by filing a consumption tax return to the extent that such transaction is recorded in the accounting books and relevant invoices are kept.
A new Qualified Invoice System (QIS) was introduced as part of Japan’s 2016 Tax Reform, which is effective from 1 October 2023. Under the QIS, a consumption taxpayer (a ‘taxpayer’ who files consumption tax returns and pays or receives a refund of consumption tax) can in principle only take an input tax credit if such taxpayer receives a ‘qualified invoice’ from a seller that is registered as both (i) a consumption taxpayer and (ii) a qualified issuer (QII). Effectively, the new system will require sellers to include their QII number in invoices so that the purchaser receiving such invoice will be able to take the input credit for the consumption tax included in the invoice. The requirement is similar to that of a seller to include its VAT number on an invoice in the European context.
Businesses (other than exempt entities) must file an application with their tax office to become a QII in order to be able to issue qualified invoices.
Note that consumption tax is also imposed on the cross-border provision of digital services (e.g. e-books, music, and advertising) by foreign service providers. In this respect, a reverse-charge mechanism is applicable for business-to-business (B2B) transactions, and foreign service providers may need to register for consumption tax purposes with regard to business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions.
The platform taxation system was introduced under the 2024 Tax Reform Act, with the purpose of managing foreign service providers’ tax compliance. The provision of services subject to the platform taxation system includes B2C digital services rendered in Japan by foreign service providers via qualified platform operators, for which the payments from customers are received. Such services are deemed to have been provided by the qualified platform operators, who are then responsible for reporting and paying taxes on the provision of the services that are actually provided by the foreign service providers. When the total amount of the payments received from customers exceeds JPY 5 billion in the tax period of the platform operator, the NTA will designate such platform operator as a qualified platform operator.
Once a qualified platform operator has been designated, the NTA will publish on their website the name of the digital platform and other information of that qualified platform operator. In addition, the designated qualified platform operator shall notify the foreign service providers of this status.
## Customs duty
Customs duty is levied on certain imported goods based on the customs tariff table.
## Excise taxes
Excise taxes are levied on gasoline, aviation fuel, tobacco, and liquor.
## Fixed assets tax
The annual fixed assets tax is levied by the local tax authorities on real property and depreciable fixed assets used for business purposes. Real property is taxed at 1.7% of the value appraised by the local tax authorities. The depreciable fixed assets tax is assessed at 1.4% of cost after statutory depreciation. The taxable basis of certain fixed assets acquired by 31 March 2025 by a small or medium-sized enterprise (SME) under an accredited plan will be reduced by one half or one third.
## Stamp duty
A stamp duty is levied on certain documents prepared in Japan. The tax amount is generally determined based on the amount stated in the document. The maximum amount of stamp duty is JPY 600,000.
## Registration and licence tax
Registration and licence tax is levied where certain property is registered, at a rate from 0.1% to 2% of the taxable basis or at a fixed amount (up to JPY 60,000). The taxable basis depends upon the property being registered (e.g. the amount of paid-in capital registered by a company or the value of real estate as assessed by local tax authorities).
## Payroll taxes
In general, the employer has an obligation to withhold payroll taxes monthly and for the annual year-end salary adjustment.
### Labour and social insurance paid by employer
The employer is generally liable to pay a share of the following contributions on salary or bonuses, including fringe benefits, to be paid in Japan. The employer’s share consists of the following contributions:
| Contribution | Standard premiums on monthly salary | Standard premiums on bonuses |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Health insurance for the Tokyo metropolitan area (each prefecture has its own health insurance rate, and rates are slightly higher for individuals between the ages of 40 and 64)\* | 4.99% (on a maximum of JPY 1,390,000 of wages per month) from March 2024 | 4.99% (on an annual cap of JPY 5.73 million of irregular annual total payments) from March 2024 |
| Welfare pension, plus child allowance | 9.15% (on a maximum of JPY 620,000 of wages per month) fixed rate | 9.15% (on a maximum of JPY 1.5 million of irregular payments per month) fixed rate |

| Total\*\* | 15.09% | 15.09% |
\* Premiums on child allowances will be imposed separately at 0.36%.\*\* In addition, workers’ accident compensation insurance will be imposed. The rate varies depending on the type of business.
## Family corporation tax
If an individual shareholder together with family members own, either directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the total issued shares or voting rights of a Japanese corporation, the corporation is treated as a family corporation (with the exception of corporations with paid-in capital of JPY 100 million or less) and is subject to the family corporation tax in addition to corporation tax.
Family corporation tax is an additional tax at the rates shown in the table below, which is charged on a corporation’s undistributed current earnings in excess of specified limits calculated in the following formula.
Taxable undistributed current earnings = Undistributed current earnings – the permitted deduction\*
\* The deduction is the greater of (i) 40% of income, (ii) JPY 20 million, or (iii) 25% of the year-end capital amount – (capital reserve less current year’s increase in capital reserve)
| Taxable undistributed current earnings | Family corporation tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| First JPY 30 million *per annum* | 10 |
| Next JPY 70 million *per annum* | 15 |
| Over JPY 100 million *per annum* | 20 |

# Japan
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Taxable period
The Japanese individual income tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December.
## Tax returns
All income tax returns are filed on an individual basis in Japan; joint tax returns are not permitted. The tax year is the calendar year for all resident-status individuals, and a taxpayer is required to file a national tax return by 15 March of the following year. If the due date is a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the next business day shall be the due date.
If a taxpayer’s income consists only of employment income paid by one local employer (including a Japanese branch of a foreign corporation) and does not exceed JPY 20 million in a year, the payer of the income makes a ‘year-end adjustment’ on the employment income, and if total income other than employment income is JPY 200,000 or less, the employee is not required to file a national income tax return. However, a local prefectural and inhabitant's tax return has to be filed to the extent the taxpayer has income other than employment income.
### Overseas assets reporting
Tax permanent residents of Japan who own assets outside of Japan that exceed JPY 50 million in value as of 31 December of the year must disclose such assets by submitting the Report of Foreign Assets by 30 June of the following year. If the due date is a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the next business day shall be the due date.
### Assets and liabilities reporting
Global asset and liability reporting is required for resident taxpayers who have worldwide assets with a total market value of JPY 1 billion or more as of 31 December and for taxpayers who have total income (other than retirement income) on the tax return exceeding JPY 20 million and hold (i) worldwide assets with a gross fair value of JPY 300 million or more, or (ii) financial assets subject to the exit tax of JPY 100 million or more as of 31 December. Individuals meeting these conditions will need to report, in detail, their worldwide assets and liabilities on the Report of Assets and Liabilities form. These reports are not a part of the income tax return and need to be filed separately with the tax office by 30 June of the following year. If the due date is a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the next business day shall be the due date.
## Payment of tax
If salary is paid in Japan by a local employer, monthly withholding of national income tax is required. The national tax due on overseas payments of salary is payable when the tax return is filed, rather than through payroll withholding. Please note that the overseas payment of salary is deemed to be paid in Japan and subject to WHT if the payer has a residence, business entity, or a PE in Japan. Two provisional payments of national tax may be required in July and November if the previous year’s final tax liability (after the deduction of WHT) was JPY 150,000 or more.
Local inhabitant's tax is assessed on the prior year’s income if a taxpayer is registered as a tax resident as of 1 January of the current year. The tax is paid on a four-instalment basis (i.e. in June, August, October, and January of the following year) or withheld from monthly salary from June through May of the following year if the salary is paid in Japan.
## Tax audit process
The tax authority of Japan is the National Tax Agency, and individual tax audits are conducted by the tax office where the individual resides and cover the previous three to five years.
## Statute of limitations
The standard statute of limitations under audit is currently five years; however, this can be extended in cases of tax evasion.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
In Japan, permanent resident taxpayers are taxed on their worldwide income. Non-resident taxpayers are taxed only on their Japan-sourced income. Non-permanent resident taxpayers are taxed on their income other than foreign-source income (in particular, potentially, on certain capital gains) that are not remitted into Japan plus potentially part of their foreign-sourced income that is paid in or remitted to Japan.
## Personal income tax rates
The current national income tax rates are:
| Taxable income (JPY) | | Tax rate (%) | Deduction | Tax on Column 1 (JPY) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over (Column 1) | Not over |
| 0 | 1,950,000 | 5 | 0 | 0 |
| 1,950,000 | 3,300,000 | 10 | 97,500 | 97,500 |
| 3,300,000 | 6,950,000 | 20 | 427,500 | 232,500 |
| 6,950,000 | 9,000,000 | 23 | 636,000 | 962,500 |
| 9,000,000 | 18,000,000 | 33 | 1,536,000 | 1,434,000 |
| 18,000,000 | 40,000,000 | 40 | 2,796,000 | 4,404,000 |
| 40,000,000 |  | 45 | 4,796,000 | 13,204,000 |
## Surtaxes
A surtax took effect 1 January 2013. The surtax consists of a 2.1% tax that is assessed on an individual’s national income tax.
## Local income taxes
Generally, in Japan, the local inhabitant’s tax is imposed at a flat rate of 10%. Japanese local governments (prefectural and municipal governments) levy local inhabitant’s tax on a taxpayer’s prior year income. This applies when the taxpayer is a resident of Japan as of January 1 of the current year. For local inhabitant’s tax purposes, an equalisation *per capita* tax is also assessed. The standard annual amount is JPY 5,000, although this may vary based on the prefecture and municipality in which the taxpayer resides. Local inhabitant’s tax is not deductible.
## Non-residents
A non-resident taxpayer’s Japan-source compensation (employment income) is subject to a flat 20.42% national income tax on gross compensation with no deductions available. This rate includes 2.1% of the surtax described above (20% × 102.1% = 20.42%). A non-resident taxpayer may be subject to the local inhabitant’s tax at a rate of 10% if they are registered as a resident on the local municipality ledger as of 1 January of the following year.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
A foreign corporation is taxed only on its Japan-source income. A foreign corporation with a permanent establishment (PE) in Japan is liable for corporate income taxes only on the income attributable to the PE.
## Corporate tax
Corporate tax rates for fiscal years beginning on or after 1 April 2024 are provided in the table below.
| Company size and income | Corporate tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Paid-in capital of over 100 million Japanese yen (JPY) | 23.2 |
| Paid-in capital of JPY 100 million or less, except for a company wholly owned by a company that has paid-in capital of JPY 500 million or more: |  |
| First JPY 8 million *per annum* | 15.0 |
| First JPY 8 million *per annum* if the annual average taxable income for the three fiscal years prior to the fiscal year in question exceeds JPY 1.5 billion | 19.0 |
| Over JPY 8 million *per annum* | 23.2 |
## National local corporate tax
National local corporate tax for fiscal years beginning on or after 1 April 2024 is a fixed rate of 10.3% of the corporate tax liability.
## Enterprise tax (and special corporate business tax)
Enterprise tax is calculated in different ways depending on the capital base of the taxpayer. For small and medium sized enterprises, enterprise tax is calculated based on the taxpayer’s income only. However, for large enterprises, the calculation will also refer to the taxpayer’s capital base and its 'value added base' (which will include items such as personnel costs and rent). Therefore, loss-making large enterprises may still be liable to pay enterprise tax.
As part of the 2024 Tax Reform Act, taxpayers subject to size-based enterprise tax in the previous fiscal year will now be subject to size-based enterprise tax in the current year if the total amount of paid-in capital and capital surplus exceeds JPY 1 billion, regardless of whether their paid-in capital is JPY 100 million or less at the end of the current fiscal year. Additionally, taxpayers that are wholly owned subsidiaries of corporations whose total paid-in capital and capital surplus exceeds JPY 5 billion and where the total paid-in capital of the taxpayer is JPY 100 million or less but the total paid-in capital and capital surplus together exceeds JPY 200 million will also be subject to size-based enterprise tax.
As a transitional measure, a tax credit is available for certain taxpayers to relieve the additional enterprise tax burden that may arise until 1 April 2026.
The standard enterprise rates for fiscal years beginning on or after 1 April 2024 are shown in the table below. Rates for Tokyo, which applies a higher-than-standard rate are shown in parentheses. Note that special enterprise tax rates are applicable to corporations engaged in energy or gas supply and in insurance, which are not provided here.
Special corporate business tax is a national tax but is collected through the enterprise tax return.
| Taxable base | Paid-in capital of JPY 100 million or less | Paid-in capital in excess of JPY 100 million |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Value added base | - | 1.26 |
| Capital base | - | 0.525 |
| Income base \* |  |  |
| First JPY 4 million | 3.5 (3.75) | 1.18 |
| Next JPY 4 million | 5.3 (5.665) |
| Over JPY 8 million\*\* | 7.0 (7.48) |
| Special local corporate tax (the rate is multiplied by the income base of enterprise tax) | 37 | 260 |
\* Tax rates shown in parentheses for corporations with paid-in capital of JPY 100 million or less reflect a higher-than-standard tax rate, which will apply to where the corporation has annual income over JPY 25 million or annual revenue over JPY 200 million (notwithstanding the lower capital amount). \*\* If the paid-in capital of a corporation is less than JPY 100 million but at least JPY 10 million, and the corporation has places of business in more than two prefectures, the graduated rates are not applicable, and only the highest rate will be applied.
## Inhabitants' tax
Inhabitants’ tax is imposed on a corporation’s income allocated to each prefecture and city (or municipal borough). The allocation is generally made on the basis of the number of employees, in the same way as enterprise tax. Applicable rates for fiscal years beginning on or after 1 April 2024 are shown below.
| Inhabitants' tax | Standard rate (%) | Maximum rate (%) | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Prefectural portion | 1.0 |  | 2.0 |
| Municipal portion | 6.0 |  | 8.4 |
In addition to the above, inhabitants’ tax is imposed on a *per capita* basis, in the range from JPY 70,000 (in cases where the amount of paid-in capital is JPY 10 million or less and the number of employees in each prefecture and city is 50 or less) to JPY 3.8 million (in cases where the amount of paid-in capital is over JPY 5 billion and the number of employees in each prefecture and city is over 50). The actual inhabitants’ tax amount will be determined by each local government by the factors of paid-in capital and the number of employees.
## Effective statutory tax rate
The total corporate income tax burden (i.e. effective tax rate) varies depending upon the size of a company’s paid-in capital. Since enterprise tax is deductible, the effective tax rate is less than the total of the statutory rates of national and local corporate tax, enterprise tax and inhabitants’ tax.The following is the summary of the effective statutory tax rates in the case of corporations operating in Tokyo (without consideration of value-based and capital-based enterprise tax):
|  | Paid-in capital of JPY 100 million or less | Paid-in capital in excess of JPY 100 million |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Corporate tax | 23.2% | 23.2% |
| Local corporate tax | 2.390% (23.2% x 10.3%) | 2.390% (23.2% x 10.3%) |
| Enterprise tax | 7.48% | 1.18% |
| Special corporate business tax | 2.59% (7.0% x 37%) | 2.600% (1.0% x 260%) |
| Inhabitants’ tax | 2.413% (23.2% x 10.3%) | 2.413% (23.2% x 10.3%) |
| Total | 38.073% | 31.783% |
| Effective statutory tax rate \* | 34.59% | 30.62% |
## Global Minimum Tax (Pillar 2)
Effective for consolidated accounting years beginning on or after 1 April 2024, the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) as part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD’s) Global Minimum Tax (‘Pillar 2’) will be applicable to Japanese headquartered multinational corporations, and to Japanese subsidiaries of foreign headquartered multinationals, where the worldwide gross revenue of the ultimate parent entity in two or more of the four fiscal years immediately preceding the fiscal year is 750 million euros (EUR) or more. Such corporations will be subject to the new Global Minimum Tax on the minimum taxable amount, and the new Global Minimum Local Corporate Tax on the resulting Global Minimum Corporate Tax amount, for each applicable fiscal year.
In addition, filing of the GloBE Information Return to the tax authorities is also required for consolidated accounting years beginning on or after 1 April 2024.

## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## 2024 Tax Reform
On 28 March 2024, the 2024 Tax Reform Act was approved by the Diet, and, on 30 March 2024, the 2024 Tax Reform Act, and related Enforcement Orders and Regulations, were promulgated. In principle, these are effective for corporate tax years beginning on or after 1 April 2024.
These measures include the following:
In order to fund increased defence spending, the 2024 Tax Reform Act clarified in its supplementary provisions measures to secure tax revenue. These include amendments to individual income tax, corporate tax, and tobacco tax. The timing of these amendments has not been clarified, but future legislative changes are anticipated.
## Consumption tax
A new Qualified Invoice System (QIS) was introduced as part of Japan’s 2016 Tax Reform, which is effective from 1 October 2023. Under the QIS, a consumption taxpayer (a ‘taxpayer’ who files consumption tax returns and pays or receives a refund of consumption tax) can in principle only take an input tax credit if such taxpayer receives a ‘qualified invoice’ from a seller that is registered as both (i) a consumption taxpayer and (ii) a qualified issuer (QII). Effectively, the new system will require sellers to include their QII number in invoices so that the purchaser receiving such invoice will be able to take the input credit for the consumption tax included in the invoice. The requirement is similar to that of a seller to include its value-added tax (VAT) number on an invoice in the European context.
Businesses (other than exempt entities) must file an application with their tax office to become a QII in order to be able to issue qualified invoices.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Domestic and foreign corporations
A corporation that has its head office in Japan is a domestic corporation. The nationality of its shareholders or place of central management is not relevant.
A corporation other than a domestic corporation is regarded as a foreign corporation.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Under domestic tax law, the scope of Japan-source income in respect of which a foreign corporation is taxable depends upon the type of taxable presence that it has in Japan. The types of taxable presence that a foreign corporation may have in Japan align with those set out in Article 5 of the OECD’s Model Tax Convention and include the following:
In the above case, the enterprise shall be deemed to have a PE in that state in respect of any activities that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless the activities of such person are limited to preparatory or auxiliary character.
If a person acts exclusively or almost exclusively on behalf of one or more enterprises to which it is closely related, that person shall not be considered to be an independent agent.
As a matter of law, the articles of Japan’s tax treaties have precedence over the above scope described under domestic tax law.
Once a PE has been established for a foreign corporation, all Japan-source income is taxable to the PE to the extent it is ‘attributable to’ the PE.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation is deductible in the calculation of taxable income for corporation tax purposes. Depreciable assets include tangible property (e.g. buildings, attachments to buildings, structures, machinery and equipment). Certain intangible assets are also eligible for amortisation (e.g. goodwill, patents, trademarks).
With regard to depreciation methods, a taxpayer may adopt one of the allowable methods for each type of depreciable property, except for buildings and structures and attachments to buildings. For selected structural improvements, only the straight-line method will be permitted (i.e. the declining-balance accelerated depreciation method will no longer be allowed). Tangible property is generally depreciated using either the straight-line method or the declining-balance method. Intangible property is generally amortised under the straight-line method.
Useful lives for assets for tax depreciation purposes are proscribed in detail. For reference, the following is a list of the useful lives of typical assets.
| Types of assets | Useful life (years) |
| --- | --- |
| Concrete buildings | 21 to 50 (depending on use) |
| Metal building | 12 to 38 (depending on use) |
| Electrical facilities and lighting | 15 |
| Heating and air conditioning | 15 |
| Motor vehicles | 3 to 6 (depending on use) |
| Personal computers | 4 |
| Digital telephone equipment | 6 |
| Machinery and equipment | 3 to 22 (depending on use) |
| Patents | 8 |
| Software | 3 or 5 (depending on use) |
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses, such as corporation organisation costs and opening costs (i.e. costs to begin the business after the corporation is established), are treated as deferred assets and allowed to be amortised on a voluntary basis.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses on borrowing are deductible in the calculation of taxable income in principle. However, interest payments to related parties in the corporate group may be disallowed in certain cases. *See ‘Thin capitalisation’ and ‘Interest expense deduction limitation’ in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*.
## Reserves
Reserves recorded in the books of accounts, except for reserves for doubtful receivables and return of goods not sold, are not deductible for corporate tax purposes.
### Reserve for doubtful receivables
A reserve for doubtful receivables is available to SMEs, banks, insurance companies, and other similar financial corporations.
The deductibility of a reserve for doubtful receivables is limited by the following two components: (i) an estimate of the irrecoverable amounts from the debtor and (ii) a calculation of the limit in the aggregate based on either the actual historical bad debt percentage or statutory percentage (reduced for large corporations), excluding the irrecoverable amount in (i) above.
### Reserve for return of goods not sold
A deductible reserve for return of goods not sold is available to corporations such as publishers, wholesalers of books, and others, provided that the corporation sells the merchandise under an unconditional repurchase agreement.
The deductible reserve for return of goods not sold will be abolished after a transitional period (fiscal years beginning from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2030), during which the deduction limitation will be reduced by one tenth annually over ten years to zero.
## Charitable contributions
Except for certain designated donations, the tax deduction for charitable contributions is limited, as follows:
| Donation | Deduction limit |
| --- | --- |
| General donation | ((0.25% of capital plus capital surplus for JGAAP purpose) + (2.5% of income)) x ¼ |
| Donation made to designated public purpose company | ((0.375% of capital plus capital surplus for JGAAP purpose) + (6.25% of income)) x ½ |
| Donation to foreign affiliate | 100% non-deductible |
In cases where a donation occurs between domestic group companies, there will be no tax implications for either the donor or donee (i.e. no deduction for the donor and no taxation for the donee).
## Directors’ remuneration
The remuneration paid to directors is deductible only in the following four cases:
Notwithstanding the above, if the amount of remuneration is deemed unreasonable by the tax authority, only the amount deemed reasonable is deductible for tax purposes.
## Entertainment expenses
In principle, entertainment expenses are not deductible for tax purposes. However, an SME, defined as a company with paid-in capital of JPY 100 million or less (except for a company wholly owned by a company that has paid-in capital of JPY 500 million or more) may take a tax deduction up to the smaller of the actual disbursement for the entertainment expense or JPY 8 million. With regard to expenses for eating and drinking ('meal expenses'), a company may deduct such meal expenses as far as the expense does not exceed JPY 10 ,000 per person (excluding expenditures for internal purposes) for tax purposes, since such expense does not fall under the category of entertainment expense, effective for disbursements made on or after 1 April 2024. A company with paid-in capital over JPY 100 million is permitted to deduct 50% of meal expenses only.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are not deductible.
## Taxes
Enterprise tax and business premises tax are deductible in the calculation of taxable income for corporation tax purposes on a cash basis. However, corporation tax and inhabitant’s tax are not deductible. Fixed assets tax and other taxes are deductible when assessed. Foreign income taxes also may be deductible if the Japanese corporation does not elect to claim a foreign tax credit.
## Net operating losses
Limitations on the amount of carryforward losses that can be utilised against current taxable income, together with the carryforward period, are shown in the table below. SMEs are not subject to the loss deduction limitation.
|  | Tax year 2015\* | Tax year 2016\* | Tax year 2017\* | Tax year 2018\* |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Limitation ratio for large corporations | 65% | 60% | 55% | 50% |
| Carryover period for loss utilisation as well as assessment by tax authorities and request for downward adjustment by taxpayer (assuming loss period financial documentation is maintained) | 9 years | 9 years | 9 years | 10 years |
\* Tax years beginning on or after 1 April of the year shown.Certain newly established corporations and companies coming out of a rehabilitation process will not be subject to the loss limitation rules for a limited period.
| Type of corporation applicable | Years in which full deduction is allowable | Years where regular limitation applies even if full deduction otherwise allowable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Newly established corporations\* and corporations coming out of the rehabilitation process\*\* | Seven years from establishment of the corporation or seven years from the decision of the court to exit the rehabilitation process. | For years ending on or after (i) a company is listed on a stock exchange, or (ii) the company is deemed to be rehabilitated. |
\* SMEs, 100% subsidiaries of large corporations, or 100% parent corporations after a share transfer has occurred are excluded.
\*\* SMEs are excluded.
Where there is a change in ownership of a corporation followed by certain trigger events, such as the cessation of business or a significant change in the business within a five-year period following a business acquisition, the utilisation of any carryforward tax loss is restricted.
SMEs may carry back tax losses for one year for national corporation tax purposes. Large corporations may only carry back tax losses incurred in the year(s) of liquidation or dissolution or for disaster losses. No carryback of losses is allowed for enterprise tax and inhabitant’s tax.
## Payments to foreign affiliates

# Japan
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Consolidated tax regime
The consolidated tax regime has been replaced by the group tax relief regime, *as described below*.
## Group tax relief regime
Effective tax years beginning on or after 1 April 2022, group tax relief replaced the previous consolidated tax regime. In order to qualify for group tax relief, (i) the applicable member corporations must be 100% subsidiaries owned (directly or indirectly) by a single Japanese parent, (ii) an application to apply group tax relief requires the filing of an application to the NTA, (iii) local tax is not subject to the group tax relief, (iv) built-in gains or losses of assets owned by a group corporation will be realised under certain circumstances prior to beginning or joining the group tax relief system, (v) tax losses of a group corporation can be carried forward into a group tax relief system if certain conditions are met, but may only be offset against that group corporation’s own taxable income, (vi) the basis of a group corporation is adjusted when it exits the group, and (vii) gains or losses from the intra-group transfer of certain assets are deferred.
Under group tax relief (i) the parent corporation and each subsidiary file their own (blue form) corporate tax returns through the e-tax system, (ii) the parent corporation is allowed to deduct losses carried forward up to its own income amount in the same manner as its subsidiaries, and (iii) in principle, other members of the group will not be required to file an amended return if one member of the group files an amended return.
In addition, the current loss of member corporations will be allocated to the group on a pro-rated basis. To reduce the administrative burden on group corporations, however, most income calculations or tax credits will be applied on a stand-alone basis (e.g. donation and entertainment expense deductions, income tax credits, incentive tax credits, etc.). On the other hand, R&D tax credits and foreign tax credits will be calculated on a group-wide basis, and the creditable amount will be allocated to member corporations based on their respective corporate tax liabilities.
## Group taxation regime
A group taxation regime is applicable to domestic companies that are wholly owned by a domestic company, foreign company, or individual ('group companies'). Unlike the group tax relief regime, the group taxation regime automatically applies to group companies.
The key points of this regime are as follows:
A group company that would otherwise qualify as an SME on a stand-alone basis is not eligible for SME benefits (e.g. reduced corporate tax rate, preferable allowable ratios for deductible portion of bad debt provisions, partial deductibility of entertainment expenses, carryback of tax losses) if the SME is owned by a parent company or two or more parent companies of the group that have paid-in capital of JPY 500 million or more.
Where a corporation that is a member of a 100% group is in the process of liquidation and is expected to be dissolved, any loss from the impairment or devaluation of the shares of the liquidating corporation cannot be recognised by the parent company as a tax-deductible expense.
## Transfer pricing
If a corporation that is subject to corporation tax sells property to or buys property from a foreign-related person, or provides services or conducts other transactions with a foreign-related person, and consideration is received or paid by the corporation, the transaction is required to be carried out at an arm’s-length price for corporation tax purposes.
A foreign-related person is a foreign corporation that has a special relationship with the subject corporation, such as parent-subsidiary, brother-sister, or a substantial control relationship.
The ‘most appropriate’ transfer pricing method to determine the arm’s-length price shall be determined using one of the following methods:
An advanced pricing agreement (APA) system is available to confirm the arm’s-length pricing proposed by a taxpayer. APAs may be unilateral, bilateral, or multilateral.
Transfer pricing compliance requirements are described in the table below.
| Document | Required information | Submission deadline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Country-by-Country (CbC) Report | Country revenue, pre-tax income, taxes payable, etc. | Must be e-filed within one year of the last tax day of the ultimate parent |
| Master File | Group company structure, business outline, financial conditions, etc. |
| Local File | Transfer pricing documentation | By due date of tax return, to retain for seven years |
## Thin capitalisation
Interest paid on debt to controlling foreign shareholders is disallowed to the extent the average balance of debt on which that interest is paid is more than three times the equity of controlling foreign shareholders.
## Interest expense deduction limitation (earning stripping rule)
The deductible portion of a corporation’s net interest expense to a related party is restricted to 20% of the adjusted income. This includes net interest expense paid to third parties that is guaranteed by a related party, unless the interest income is subject to Japanese income tax in the hands of the recipient.
Net interest expense is calculated as interest expense less corresponding interest income. Interest expense does not include (i) interest expenses on specified bonds (issued to limited number of unrelated parties and not the public), (ii) interest payments subject to the Japanese taxation or paid to qualifying public service corporations, and (iii) interest on back-to-back repos.
Adjusted income is defined as taxable income, adding back interest expense and depreciation expense, but excluding extraordinary income or loss.
Limitations (*de minimis* and group basis) on application of the interest expense deduction limitation include (i) where the net interest expense in a tax year is JPY 20 million or less, or (ii) the aggregated net interest expense on a Japanese corporate group basis (where there is more than a 50% capital relationship) is 20% or less of the aggregated adjusted income of the same group.
Non-deductible interest incurred in the past seven years will be deductible up to 20% of the current adjusted taxable income. Under the 2024 Tax Reform Act, the carryover period of seven years is extended to ten years for interest incurred in the years beginning 1 April 2022 until 31 March 2025.
## Anti-tax haven (controlled foreign company or CFC) rules
Undistributed profits of a CFC (which is defined as a foreign related corporation [FRC] by (i) equity ownership [owned more than 50% by Japanese corporations or residents] or (ii) *de facto* control) where the applicable tax rate is 30% (in the case of a paper company) or 20% in other cases are included in the Japanese parent company’s taxable income in certain circumstances. To cope with the increased compliance burden for corporate taxpayers as a result of the introduction of Pillar 2, the 30% trigger rate for ’paper companies‘ or ’cash box companies‘ under the CFC rules will be lowered to 27% for tax years of the Japanese parent company beginning on or after 1 April 2024.
Income earned by a CFC is 'aggregated' (i.e. included within the Japanese parent’s taxable income) in three different ways:
1. Entity-based aggregation: Where all of the income of the CFC is taxable to the Japanese shareholder if (a) the main business of the foreign controlled subsidiary is not ’active‘ (the criteria of the ’active business‘ test are described in the law) and (b) the foreign tax rate is lower than a 20% ’trigger‘ rate.
2. Entity-based aggregation: Where all of the income of the CFC is taxable to the Japanese shareholder if (a) the CFC fails certain 'substance' and 'administration and control' tests and is thereby treated as a 'paper company' or 'cash box company' and (b) the foreign tax rate is lower than a 30% ’trigger‘ rate (27% for tax years of the Japanese parent company beginning on or after 1 April 2024).
3. Income-based aggregation: Where even if the entity-based aggregation rules are not applicable, the relevant income of the CFC is taxable to the Japanese shareholder if (a) income of the CFC includes certain 'passive' categories of income and (b) the foreign tax rate is lower than a 20% 'trigger' rate.
A Japanese corporation owning a 10% or more direct or indirect interest in a CFC is required to include its pro-rata share of the taxable retained earnings of the CFC in its gross income under certain circumstances. Dividends paid by a CFC are not deductible when calculating the undistributed profits for aggregation purposes.
To cope with the increased compliance burden for corporate taxpayers as a result of the introduction of Pillar 2, the 30% trigger rate for ’paper companies‘ or ’cash box companies‘ under the CFC rules will be lowered to 27% for tax years of the Japanese parent company beginning on or after 1 April 2024.
## Anti-tax avoidance rule requiring reduction in basis of subsidiary’s shares after receiving dividends from subsidiary
Where a Japanese parent receives from certain subsidiaries\*, dividends that exceed in the aggregate 10% of the book value of the shares of that subsidiary in a given year, and subject to certain exceptions that are provided in the law, the parent must reduce its basis in the shares of the subsidiary by the amount of the dividends subject to the dividend income exclusion. This rule is designed to prevent the parent from reducing any capital gain arising on a subsequent transfer of such subsidiary’s shares by first receiving dividends from the subsidiary.
\* A subsidiary with which the parent has a more than 50% control relationship as of the date of the dividend resolution.
## Corporate tax measures for reorganisations
Most forms of corporate reorganisation can be treated as tax qualified if certain conditions are met. One of the main conditions is that there should be no ’boot‘ (i.e. there should be no cash consideration); there is some relaxation of this rule in the case of minority squeeze outs. In addition, there should be continuity of direct or indirect shareholder ownership; if the relationship continues at less than 100% ownership, various other conditions must be met.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Foreign tax credit
A Japanese corporation is subject to Japanese corporate income taxes on its worldwide income. However, to avoid double taxation of foreign-source income, Japanese corporations are allowed to claim a tax credit against corporation and inhabitant’s taxes for foreign income taxes paid directly.
Creditable foreign taxes are defined as taxes that (i) are incurred directly by the taxpayer; (ii) are levied by foreign governments and local authorities in accordance with local tax laws; (iii) are levied on corporate income; and (iv) have the same characteristics as Japanese income tax, corporation tax, and local income-based taxes. A tax for which a refund can be claimed optionally by the taxpayer after the tax payment, or a tax whose payment grace period can be decided by the taxpayer, is not regarded as a foreign tax.
In order to prevent the credit from reducing corporation tax on Japan-source income, certain limitations are set on the amount of foreign taxes that can actually be credited. The ceiling is currently 35% of the foreign taxes paid. The creditable foreign tax is calculated using the following formula:
Corporate tax liabilities x (Foreign source income / Worldwide income taxable in Japan)
Any excess amount over the ceiling is carried forward for three years.
A foreign tax credit is not applicable for enterprise tax purposes, although foreign branch income attributable to business conducted outside Japan is exempt from enterprise tax.
Generally speaking, the foreign tax credit system does not apply to the extent dividend income from a foreign subsidiary is subject to the dividend exemption system.
Foreign corporations with a PE in Japan should note that when the PE of a foreign corporation in Japan is subject to taxation in Japan as well as in another jurisdiction other than its country of residence, double taxation may arise. To alleviate any unfair tax burden, a foreign tax credit regime is also applicable to PEs in Japan similar to that which applies to Japanese corporations. However, foreign tax (including WHT) paid in the foreign corporation’s country of residence would not, in principle, be creditable.
Foreign taxes paid under the following circumstances are not creditable: (i) foreign taxes levied on payments between foreign corporations, on the grounds that such payments were deemed to have been made to the Japanese corporation, and (ii) foreign taxes levied on a payment from a foreign PE to its Japanese head office or another related party as a result of the foreign tax authorities disallowing a deduction at the level of the PE.
## Innovation box
R&D tax incentives (the R&D tax credit system) are available for expenditure on R&D where the intellectual property arising therefrom is owned by the Japanese taxpayer.
The R&D tax credit formula is shown in the following table:
| Movement in R&D ratio (increase or decrease in ratio) | Tax credit ratio |
| --- | --- |
| 12% < | 11.5%＋(movement in R&D ratio - 12%) × 0.375 (upper limit of 14%) |
| 12% ≧ | 11.5% – (12%－movement in R&D ratio) × 0.25 (lower limit is 1%) |
As a result of the introduction of the innovation box regime, the R&D tax credit formula has been revised as follows:
| Fiscal year | Tax credit ratio |
| --- | --- |
| Beginning on or after 1 April 2026 | 8.5%＋(movement in R&D ratio) × 8.5/30 (lower limit is 0%) |
| Beginning on or after 1 April 2029 | 8.5%＋(movement in R&D ratio) × 8.5/27.5 (lower limit is 0%) |
| Beginning on or after 1 April 2031 | 8.5%＋(movement in R&D ratio) × 8.5/25 (lower limit is 0%) |
The tax credit limitation for certain R&D is 20% of the corporate tax liability, with additional rate up to 10% added depending upon the movement in the R&D ratio. An additional R&D credit of up to 10% for open innovation is also available.
## Salary increase tax credits
The salary increase tax credit is available for corporations filing 'blue form' tax returns that meet certain conditions relating to increased expenditure on salary and other employee-related expenses.
As a result of the 2024 Tax Reform Act, the application for this credit will be extended for three more years, the existing minimum tax credit will be reduced from 15% to 10%, and the maximum tax credit rate (the rate multiplied by the increased salary amount) will be increased from 30% to 35%, while the upper ceiling of the tax credit (20% of corporate tax payable) will remain unchanged. The eligibility requirements for the maximum rate will be tightened in some cases; however, the maximum rate will also be extended to new cases.
## Tax credit for domestic production in strategic sectors
As a part of the 2024 Tax Reform Act, a tax credit designed to encourage domestic production in sectors considered strategically important by the government is established. Products that qualify for the tax credit include electric vehicles, green steel, green chemicals, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and semiconductors. The credit amount is based on either the quantity of goods produced and sold within ten years after the date of certification of an approved business plan under the Industrial Competitiveness Enhancement Act (ICEA) but before 31 March 2027 or the acquisition cost of qualified assets used for such production, whichever is smaller. The maximum tax credit in each year will be 40% (20% for semiconductor) of the corporate tax liability, with a carryover period of four years. In addition, a required level of either wage increase or capital investment must be met to be eligible for the benefit.
## Incentives for the revitalisation of local ‘hubs’
A taxpayer may be eligible for tax incentives if it relates to or expands certain kinds of operations in local areas (generally other than Tokyo, Osaka, or Nagoya).
## Local government contributions

## Requirement for banks to collect and remit information regarding bank accounts owned by non-residents
A tax reporting system is applicable under which non-resident individuals are required to report certain information to the tax authorities in Japan. The individual will provide the information to the relevant branch of the Japanese financial institution with which they have a deposit, and the financial institution will provide it to the tax authorities. The required information is: (i) name, (ii) address, (iii) date of birth, (iv) resident country, and (v) taxpayer identification number. The financial institution will also provide account details (balances, transactions, etc.). The information is required as of 31 December and must be submitted by the following 30 April.
## Requirement for crypto asset traders to collect and remit information regarding crypto asset transaction reports of non-residents
Based on the OECD's Crypto Asset Reporting Framework (CARF: Crypto­Asset Reporting Framework) designed by the OECD’s tax committee, a tax reporting system similar to that in place for bank account information will be introduced effective 1 January 2026. Under the reporting system, non-resident individuals are required to report certain information to the Japanese tax authorities. The required information includes (i) name, (ii) address, (iii) date of birth, (iv) resident country, and (v) taxpayer identification number.
## E-Storage requirements
The Electronic Bookkeeping Act prescribes rules for how different categories of documents should be stored in electronic format. The categories include:
1. National tax-related books, which are defined as accounting books required to be kept pursuant to the provisions of national tax laws, including journals, general ledgers, etc.
2. National tax-related documents, which are defined as documents required to be kept pursuant to the provisions of national tax laws, including invoices, contracts, financial statements, etc, where the original document is in paper.
3. Electronic transactions ('e-transactions'), which refers to national tax-related documents where the original document is in electronic format only, for example, a PDF invoice sent via email.
Generally, documents under (i) and (ii) must be stored in paper copy. Taxpayers may elect to keep such documents in electronic format, but in order to do so must comply with the requirements of the Electronic Bookkeeping Act. In contrast, from 1 January 2024, it is mandatory for documents under (iii) to be stored electronically in accordance with the specific rules for e-transactions provided in the Electronic Bookkeeping Act. Exemptions to this mandatory requirement may be available in certain circumstances.

## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Foreign tax relief
Resident taxpayers can credit foreign income taxes against their Japanese national tax and local inhabitant’s tax liabilities (with certain limitations), where foreign-source income is taxed in Japan. Non-resident taxpayers are not entitled to take foreign tax credits on their Japan income tax returns unless they have a permanent establishment (PE) in Japan.

Notes
1. These jurisdictions have tax conventions in Japan that were formed primarily to eliminate double taxation and prevent tax evasion and avoidance. 73 conventions cover 80 jurisdictions. The number of tax conventions is not equal to the number of jurisdictions due to multiple cases where conventions were succeeded by multiple jurisdictions.
2. These jurisdictions are in a tax information exchange agreement with Japan that was formed primarily to exchange information regarding tax matters. 11 conventions cover 11 jurisdictions.
3. These jurisdictions are signatories of the Convention of Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters and have bilateral agreements with Japan. Out of the 142 jurisdictions who are a part of this multilateral agreement, 79 have formed bilateral agreements with Japan.
4. The government of Japan does not have an international agreement with the government of Taiwan; however, a private-sector tax agreement is in place between the Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association of Japan and the Taiwan-Japan Relations Association of Taiwan.
### Mutual Administrative Assistance
Japan is a signatory to the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, which is currently in effect.
### Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Agreement
On 7 June 2017, Japan signed the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS, which will not take effect until the instrument of ratification is submitted. As of 11 June 2024, this treaty is in effect in Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Kazakhstan, the Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, Sweden, Thailand, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam.
### Totalisation agreements
Designed to avoid overlaps in social security enrolment, Japan has entered into social security agreements with several countries. This agreement has two effects, which are the following:
1. Prevention of double enrolment: Social insurance systems are coordinated to prevent dual enrolment.
2. Totalisation of period of pension participation: The period of pension participation is summed between the two countries so that it is easier for insured persons to meet the requirements for the period of participation needed to receive pension benefits.
As of June 2024, the agreements currently in effect are with Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, the Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the Philippines, the Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Agreements with China, Italy, the Republic of Korea, and the United Kingdom include ‘elimination of dual coverage’ only.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Individual income tax
### Implementation of new measures for significantly high individual income (minimum tax)
An additional tax burden will be imposed on individuals who have a significantly high level of income. Specifically, if the minimum tax (threshold) calculated based on the following formula (i) is greater than the individual’s income tax liability for the year (ii), such excess (i.e. [i] minus [ii]) will be added to the income tax liability for the year:
Threshold: 22.5% x (standard taxable income - 330 million Japanese yen [JPY])
For example, where income in a given year is only capital gains with the amount of JPY 3 billion (subject to separate taxation at a rate of 15.315% including surtax), the excess of 140 million (JPY 600 million minus JPY 460 million, *as illustrated below*) will be levied as an additional tax liability.
1. (JPY 3 billion - JPY 330 million) x 22.5% = approximately JPY 600 million
2. JPY 3 billion × 15.315% = approximately JPY 460 million
This revision will apply to individual income tax for tax year 2025 onwards.
## Inheritance tax and gift tax
The two revisions below will be applied to the inheritance tax on assets acquired by gift on or after 1 January 2024.
### Revision to the taxation system for settling gift taxes at the time of inheritance
Under the current rule, if assets are gifted to an heir of a decedent and the special measures for settlement at the time of inheritance apply, the value of the gifted assets as of the time of the gift is added to the value of inherited assets and is subject to the inheritance tax. The gift tax already paid at the time of the gift is deducted from the inheritance tax. Under this special measure, a special deduction of JPY 25 million is applied in calculating the taxable amount of the gift tax.
Under the 2023 tax reform, an additional special deduction of JPY 1.1 million will be available in addition to the previous special deductions of JPY 25 million.
### Add-back period for gifts received prior to inheritance
Under the current inheritance tax law, the value of the assets acquired by heir(s) by way of gift from the decedent within three years prior to the inheritance should be added back to the taxable amount of the inheritance.
Under the 2023 tax reform, the add-back period of three years will be extended to seven years, and a deduction of JPY 1 million will be applied in calculating the taxable amount of the inheritance. Note that if the assets are acquired by gift within three years prior to the inheritance, this deduction of JPY 1 million is not applicable.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Personal deductions
Interest is not tax deductible. Japanese social security contributions are fully deductible. Medical expenses (irrespective of where they were paid) are tax deductible, with certain limitations.
### Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions designated by the Ministry of Finance in Japan are tax deductible, with certain limitations (generally, only charities in Japan qualify). Qualified contributions or donations that total, in aggregate, over JPY 2,000 are deductible in computing the national tax. The total deduction is limited to 40% of income, less JPY 2,000. The definition of a qualified contribution is extremely restrictive (*see the [Other tax credits and incentives](other-tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for more information*).
### Life insurance premiums
Life insurance (or private pension) premiums paid to a Japanese agency in local currency are deductible to a limited extent in computing national and local inhabitant’s taxes.
Earthquake insurance premiums are also deductible for the purpose of both national and local inhabitant’s tax to a limited extent.
## Earned income deduction
A permanent and/or non-permanent resident employee can take an earned income deduction, computed by applying an appropriate rate to gross employment income as follows (the minimum standard deduction is JPY 550,000 or gross employment income, whichever is lower). The deduction is currently capped at JPY 1.95 million.
| Employment income (JPY) | | Formula for exclusion amount calculation | Salary income exclusion (JPY) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 1,625,000 |  | 550,000 |
| 1,625,000 | 1,800,000 | 40% of employment income - 100,000 | 550,000 minimum, up to 620,000 |
| 1,800,000 | 3,600,000 | 30% of employment income + 80,000 | 620,000 minimum, up to 1,160,000 |
| 3,600,000 | 6,600,000 | 20% of employment income + 440,000 | 1,160,000 minimum, up to 1,760,000 |
| 6,600,000 | 8,500,000 | 10% of employment income + 1,100,000 | 1,760,000 minimum, up to 1,950,000 |
| 8,500,000 |  |  | 1,950,000 |
## Personal exemptions
From tax year 2020, resident taxpayers are entitled to a personal exemption for both national income tax and local inhabitants tax purposes based on their total income during the tax year, as follows:
| Total income (JPY) | Personal exemption for national income tax (JPY) | Personal exemption for local inhabitants tax (JPY) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Under 24 million | 480,000 | 430,000 |
| Over 24 million and under 24.5 million | 320,000 | 290,000 |
| Over 24.5 million and under 25 million | 160,000 | 150,000 |
| Over 25 million | Not eligible | Not eligible |
In the case of a non-dependent spouse, a special spouse exemption (a maximum JPY 380,000 and JPY 330,000 for national income tax purposes and local inhabitant’s tax purposes) can be taken, depending on the spouse’s income, by taxpayers whose income amount does not exceed JPY 10 million.
In general, a non-resident taxpayer is not eligible for any of these deductions.
## Business deductions
Business expenses are tax deductible in some limited cases. An employer’s reimbursements of business expenses, such as commuting, travel, and entertainment expenses, do not constitute taxable income to the employee, provided the expenses are required for the employer’s business.
A self-employed taxpayer is allowed to claim business expenses against income, provided it can be substantiated that the expenses are necessary.
## Losses
With effect from 1 January 2016, capital losses arising from the sale of publicly traded shares and specified bonds (‘publicly traded investments group’) through a qualified Japanese broker will be offset against dividends from publicly traded shares and interest from specified bonds, provided separate taxation by filing is elected.
Under the current tax law, capital losses through sales from a qualified Japanese broker within a publicly traded investments group after offset against dividends from publicly offered shares and interest from bonds or bond funds may be carried over for three years.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
Gross income consists of all forms of taxable income (e.g. income from employment, investment, rental real estate).
## Employment income
Salary, bonuses, stock or share-based income, foreign-service premiums, cost-of-living allowances, tax reimbursements, and other benefits in kind (except for certain tax-exempt items) are classified as taxable remuneration (employment income). Japan-source employment income is remuneration earned for services rendered in Japan, regardless of where or when the remuneration is paid.
Where an employer provides housing, the amount of the taxable benefit is determined based on a formula, and, provided the housing arrangements are structured properly, only a percentage of the rent paid is generally treated as taxable.
In the case of housing provided for a director (a board member) of a domestic or foreign company, the taxable value would generally be 50% (35% if it can be substantiated that the house is also used for business purposes by the employer) of the actual rent. However, if the housing provided by the company is considered unnecessarily luxurious, the market rent may be deemed to be the taxable value.
Retirement or severance income is treated preferentially under the current Japan tax law. However, retirement payments that are approved by a company’s shareholders and are to be made to a director of the company are only eligible for preferential tax treatment if the individual has served as a director for a period of more than five years. This five-year service period must have been with the same company.
## Equity compensation
For directors and employees, income arising from the exercise of stock options is generally taxed at the date of exercise (fair market value at exercise - exercise price) while income from restricted stock units is taxable at the point of vesting. Income arising from certain qualified stock options (qualified for Japan tax purposes) is not taxable at exercise but is taxed instead as a capital gain when the stocks received at exercise are sold, if certain conditions are met. The point of taxation of equity compensation will depend on the specifics of the plan.
In general, for residents, income derived from the exercise of an employee stock option issued by a non-Japanese company is treated as employment income and subject to Japanese national and local inhabitant’s tax at the graduated income tax rates. In addition, gains from the sale of the equity acquired are subject to income tax at 15.315% national and 5% local tax (if the individual is a tax resident) unless certain other conditions are met.
## Business income
If taxpayers engage in their own business, a business enterprise tax will be levied on their business income by the local prefectural government. Business enterprise tax is deductible for the calculation of business income. In general, business enterprise tax is assessed on business income in excess of JPY 2.9 million at a rate of 3%, 4%, or 5%, depending on the type of business.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are, in principle, aggregated with other income after deductions for necessary expenses and after a statutory deduction of a maximum of JPY 500,000.
If the transferred assets were owned for more than five years, the gain is regarded as a long-term capital gain, and the taxable basis is reduced to 50% of the net capital gain.
Capital gains from sales of real property (land, building and structures) are taxed separately from other sources of income. Gains on property that had been held for over five years as of 1 January of the year when the transfer was made are considered long-term capital gains and are taxed separately from other sources of income at a flat rate of 20.315% (15.315% national tax + 5% local inhabitant’s tax). Gains on property that was held for five years or less are classified as short-term capital gains and are taxed at a flat rate of 39.63% (30.63% national tax + 9% local inhabitant’s tax).
Capital gains from sales of certain securities (including shares and equity interest in corporations, warrant bonds, etc.) are taxed separately from other sources of income at a flat rate of 20.315% (15.315% national tax + 5% local inhabitant’s tax).
Listed shares are shares listed on Japanese or foreign stock exchanges and government bonds, etc. Unlisted shares are shares other than listed shares as indicated above.
Capital gains or losses arising from the sale of listed shares cannot be used to offset capital losses or gains arising from the sale of unlisted shares.
## Dividend income
In principle, dividends are taxed at graduated rates after being aggregated with other sources of income. However, dividends paid by corporations listed on an exchange can optionally be taxed separately from other sources of income at a flat rate of 20.315% (15.315% national tax + 5% local inhabitant’s tax). Certain capital losses may be used to absorb dividend income (*see Losses in the [Deductions](deductions.html) section for more information*). If paid by Japanese corporations, dividends are subject to withholding tax (WHT).
## Interest income
Interest on domestic bank deposits and/or certain designated financial instruments is taxed separately from other income and is subject to 20.315% WHT (15.315% national tax + 5% local inhabitant’s tax) if paid onshore. Interest paid by offshore financial institutions is taxed at graduated rates. Interest on bonds listed on an exchange is taxed at a flat rate of 20.315% (15.315% national tax + 5% local inhabitant’s tax).
## Rental income
Rental income consists of gross rent received in connection with the letting of real estate to either an individual or commercial tenant. To arrive at the taxable amount, any allowable expenses and depreciation are deducted from the gross income. To the extent a taxpayer has a net rental loss excluding loss generated from offshore real estate, this loss can be used to offset other types of income. Note that mortgage interest payments allocable to the ownership of land can’t be used to offset other types of non-rental income.
## Non-resident’s income
Assuming the non-resident does not have a permanent establishment (PE) in Japan, a non-resident’s income from Japan-source interest, dividends, rental income, and royalties is generally subject to tax at a rate of 20.42% (15.315% in the case of interest on bank deposits, certain designated financial instruments, and/or dividends on listed shares) or lower treaty rates through WHT at source. A tax return must subsequently be filed to report rental income and determine the final tax liability.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
A resident taxpayer is an individual taxpayer (i) who has a ‘*jusho*’ (i.e. a residence) in Japan; or (ii) who has maintained a ‘*kyosho*’ (i.e. a temporary place of abode) in Japan for a period of one year or more. A resident taxpayer who is not a Japanese national and who has an aggregate stay in Japan of five years or less within the preceding ten years (60 months within the preceding 120 months) would be classified as a non-permanent resident taxpayer. If a resident taxpayer is a Japanese national, or a foreign national with an aggregate stay in Japan of more than five years within the preceding ten years, the taxpayer is considered a permanent resident taxpayer.
