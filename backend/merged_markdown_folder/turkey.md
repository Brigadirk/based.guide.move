## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 02 May 2024
In Turkey, companies (other than those in the financial sector) are subject to a standard CIT rate of 25%. For financial sector companies, the CIT rate is 30%.
The taxable income of a company is computed based on its net accounting profits after adjustment for exemptions and deductions and including prior-year losses carried forward, to a limited extent.
Resident entities are subject to tax on their worldwide income, whereas non-resident entities are taxed only on their Turkish-sourced income.
## Minimum CIT rule
With effect from 1 January 2025, a domestic minimum tax regime is applicable that aims to ensure the corporate tax is not less than 10% of corporate income before certain exemptions and deductions. Under the new rule, the corporate taxpayers will compute their tax liability under both the standard tax regime (i.e. 25% tax on taxable income after deductions and exemptions) and a parallel regime (i.e. 10% tax on taxable income before certain deductions and exemptions). The larger amount will then be payable.
Certain exemption items are excluded from the base for the 10% tax (In other words, these specific exemptions will not be added to the base for the 10% tax). These exemptions include:
## Local income taxes
There are no provincial or municipal taxes on corporate income in Turkey.

## Taxable period
The Turkish tax year is a calendar year.
## Tax returns
The annual tax return for the year has to be filed by 31 March. No extensions are available.
## Payment of tax
Income tax is withheld every month from salaries paid through a Turkish payroll under the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system.
The tax, when a return is filed for any outstanding liability under the aforementioned principles, is paid in two equal instalments; by the time of filing and in the fourth month thereafter. Non-residents leaving Turkey have to settle full liability within 15 days before departure.
Taxpayers filing income tax returns for their commercial or professional income must pay advance income tax (under the title of 'temporary tax'), calculated as 15% of their cumulative income as of the end of each quarter during the calendar year.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 02 May 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
Deliveries of goods and services are subject to VAT at rates varying from 1% to 20%. The general rate is 20%.
VAT payable on local purchases and on imports is regarded as 'input VAT', and VAT calculated and collected on sales is considered 'output VAT'. Input VAT is offset against output VAT in the VAT return filed at the related tax office. If output VAT is in excess of input VAT, the excess amount is paid to the related tax office. Conversely, if input VAT exceeds output VAT, the balance is carried forward to the following months to be offset against future output VAT. With the exception of a few situations, such as exportation and sales to an investment incentive holder, there is no cash refund to recover excess input VAT.
Turkish VAT principles contain a 'reverse-charge VAT mechanism', which requires the calculation of VAT by resident entities on payments to persons in foreign countries. Under this mechanism, VAT is calculated and paid to the related tax office by the resident entity. The resident entity treats this VAT as input VAT and offsets it in the same month. This VAT does not create a tax burden for the resident or non-resident entity, except for its cash flow effect on the former if there is insufficient output VAT to offset the input VAT.
VAT is also collected at the point of import. The VAT rate is the same rate as the one that is applied for transactions in the country of origin. The base for VAT is the value of the goods for customs tax purposes plus any kind of tax payable at the point of import and all the expenses incurred until the single administrative document is registered.
### Reduced rates
For the deliveries and services mentioned in List No. I (e.g. agricultural products such as raw cotton, dried hazelnuts, supply and leasing of goods within the scope of the Finance Leasing Law), the reduced rate is 1%.
For the deliveries and services mentioned in List No. II (e.g. basic food stuffs, textiles, books and similar publications), the reduced rate is 10%.
### Foreign trade: Imports and exports
Importation of goods and services is a taxable transaction, whether or not the importation is made for business purposes. Export transactions are exempt from VAT, and credit and refund is available for input VAT for the export goods.
### Importation of goods and services
For VAT purposes, any importation of goods or services into Turkey is a taxable transaction, regardless of the status of the importer or the nature of the transaction. To equalise the tax burden on importation and domestic supply of goods and services, VAT is levied only on the importation of goods and services that are liable to tax within Turkey. Accordingly, any transaction exempt in Turkey may also be exempt on import. The VAT on importation is imposed at the same rates applicable to the domestic supply of goods and services. In the case of importation, the taxable event occurs at the time of actual importation. Importation of machinery and equipment under an investment incentive certificate (IIC) is exempt from VAT.
## Banking and insurance transactions tax (BITT)
The transactions being performed by licensed banks and insurance companies are generally exempt from VAT but are subject to BITT at a rate of 5% in general (although some transactions are subject to 1% or 0% BITT), which is due on the gains of such corporations from their transactions.
The purchase of goods and services by banks and insurance companies are subject to VAT, but this is considered an expense or cost item. Therefore, it is not recoverable (i.e. for VAT purposes by offsetting against the output VAT) in the hands of these corporations.
## Special consumption tax
There are four main product groups that are subject to special consumption tax at different tax rates, depending on the GTIP numbers (tariff numbers):
Unlike VAT, which is applied on each delivery, special consumption tax is charged only once (except for some activities, such as production).
## Customs and foreign trade
Following the changes in Turkish economic policy in the 1980s, there has been rapid growth in the foreign trade volume of Turkey.
Turkey is a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and World Customs Organization (WCO). Turkey signed the ‘Decision No:1/95 on Implementation of the Customs Union’ with the European Union on 1 January 1996 and has amended its customs code and legislation in line with those of the EU customs code.
According to the Customs Union, with the exception of certain goods (e.g. agricultural and steel products), no customs tax is incurred on trade between Turkey and the European Union as long as the goods are imported to Turkey with an A.TR Movement Certificate proving that the goods are in free circulation in the European Union.
In order to harmonise its foreign trade, Turkey has also signed several Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with the trade partners of the European Union.
The Turkish Customs Code is very similar to that of the EU, and its aim is to harmonise the customs practices of Turkey with EU customs practices.
The Turkish Customs Code has also brought into force the customs regimes with economic impact that have been in use in the EU countries for a long time. The import taxes, VAT, other taxes, and funds are collected at the time of importation. The main tax collected at customs is the import tax. The import tax differs according to the classification of the commodity and to the country of origin.
VAT is also collected at the point of import. The VAT rate is the same rate as the one that is applied for the transactions in the country of origin. The base for VAT is the value of the goods for customs tax purposes plus any kind of tax payable at the point of import and all the expenses incurred until the single administrative document is registered.
The VAT rates are 1%, 8%, and 18%, varying according to the type of goods imported.
Dumping and anti-dumping duties are collected at the point of import.
In certain cases, such as temporary importation or inward processing, the customs administration shall require a kind of guarantee letter to secure the taxes. The amount of this guarantee shall cover all the taxes payable in the case of an importation.
There is no customs tax on trade between the EU and Turkey except for certain products (e.g. agricultural and steel products). However, it is crucial that the imported goods are imported together with an A.TR Movement Certificate proving that the goods are in free circulation.
In the case of FTAs, the goods must be imported with a EUR.1 certificate, giving proof of their country of origin in order to benefit from the FTA.
Turkey applies the Common Customs Tariff of the EU to third countries, except for agricultural and steel products.
## Property taxes
Buildings and land owned in Turkey are subject to an annual real estate tax at different rates.
## Stamp tax
Stamp tax applies to a wide range of documents, including, but not limited to, agreements, financial statements, and payrolls. Stamp tax is levied as a percentage of the value stated on the agreements at rates varying between 0.189% and 0.948%.
According to the current legislation, regressive RUSF rates apply to foreign exchange and gold borrowings provided to Turkish residents (banks and financing institutions are exempt) from abroad depending on the maturity.
The RUSF rates on foreign currency denominated loans are as follows:
The RUSF rates on Turkish lira denominated loans are as follows:
Moreover, RUSF bases differ based on the type and the currency of the loan. RUSF is calculated:
## Payroll taxes
The social security premiums and the unemployment premiums should be declared by the employers filing the social security premium declaration on a monthly basis.
Income tax, stamp tax, social security premiums, and unemployment premiums are the legal deductions from the salary.
## Social security premiums
As of 1 January 2025, social security premiums for both the employer and the employee are 34.75% in total, of an employee’s salary; 14% for the employee and 20.75% for the employer. In addition to social security payments, unemployment contribution is 3% of the salary; 1% for the employee and 2% for the employer.
The social security ceiling is determined as 195.041,40 Turkish lira (TRY) as of 1 January 2025.

## Social security contributions
Social security premiums, which are calculated on salary limits of a minimum of TRY 26.005,50 and a maximum of TRY 195.041,40 per month as of 1 January 2025, must be paid by the employer and the employee at rates defined according to labour categories. For Turkish nationals, the general rates are 20.75% (if certain conditions are satisfied, it is reduced by 4% to 16.75% (5% for manufacturing sector) for the employer and 14% for the employee.
The employee's portion of the social security contributions is deductible in determining taxable income.
## Unemployment insurance
Unemployment insurance premiums are calculated over an upper earnings level of TRY 195.041,40 per month as of 1 January 2025. The premiums are paid by the employee, employer, and the state at the following rates:
| Payer | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Employee | 1 |
| Employer | 2 |
| State | 1 |
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no national wealth taxes in Turkey.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Recipients of property through inheritance or donation are subject to inheritance and gift tax at rates ranging from 1% to 30%. Tax paid in a foreign country on inherited property is deducted from the tax base as a deductible expense. Inheritance and gift tax is payable over a period of three years, in biannual instalments in May and November, except for lottery prizes, for which the related taxes are collected through withholding at the time of payment.
## Property taxes and high-value residence tax
Property tax is calculated in respect of each property at the tax value set at the year of acquisition, which is then re-evaluated annually with the half of the revaluation rate announced by the Ministry of Finance. The rate of the tax on the taxable values of buildings is 0.1% if the building is used as residence and 0.2% for other buildings. The rate of tax on the taxable values of property in lands is 0.3%. These rates will be doubled in metropolitan areas.
Apart from the property tax, for residences located in Turkey with a value of more than TRY 15,709,000 for 2025, a new type of tax was introduced in 2019 to be calculated on the excess value of the residence. The applicable rates vary between 0.3% to 1.0%, depending on the value of the residence.
## Stamp tax
Stamp duty currently applies at the rate of 0.759% over the gross salary for individuals receiving their income from a local payroll. For individuals filing tax returns, this duty is replaced with fixed filing fees currently amounting to TRY 672.40.
## Local non-income taxes
There are no local taxes apart from some minor transaction charges and immovable property taxes imposed and collected by municipalities.

# Turkey
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 02 May 2024
All Turkish taxes are imposed under laws drafted by or with the involvement of the Turkish MoF and are promulgated by the Turkish Parliament. The central government, acting through the MoF, imposes most of them, although local authorities have certain rights over some minor transaction charges. Tax procedures are governed by the Turkish tax procedural law.
## Taxable period
The taxable period is the calendar year. Note that a different fiscal year is also allowed.
## Tax returns
A self-assessment system is used in Turkey.
In principle, residents and non-resident entities having a PE in Turkey are obligated to be registered for all taxes in Turkey (e.g. CIT, VAT, WHT, stamp tax) and file annual CIT returns.
The last date of submission of the CIT return is the 30th day of the fourth month following the fiscal year-end. This date will be 30 April if CIT returns are filed on a calendar-year basis.
## Payment of tax
Taxable income is declared on a quarterly-basis as advance tax on the 17th day of the second month following each quarter, and corresponding tax is payable on the 17th day of the same period. Advance CIT paid is offset against the final (i.e. fiscal year-end) CIT calculated in the annual CIT return.
The last date of payment of CIT is the 30th day of the fourth month following the fiscal year-end.
## Tax audit process
The tax authorities in Turkey do not have a regular audit cycle for every taxpayer. Tax audits are usually performed based on selection through risk assessment software, where they can conduct either sector-specific or issue-specific audits.
## Statute of limitations
The Turkish tax system is based on self-assessment, and there is no procedure to agree the filed tax returns with the tax authorities that can prevent further inspections. Tax returns filed by companies remain open to tax inspection until the end of the five-year statute of limitations according to the provisions of Turkish Tax Procedural Law.
## Corporate income tax certification
In Turkey, a special kind of tax control mechanism is established called 'corporate income tax certification'. Under this mechanism, the tax authority accepts accounts and tax returns of taxpayers whose accounts are audited and certified by Sworn Fiscal Advisors (SFAs) to be true and correct unless proved to be incorrect. On the other hand, the MoF has announced that those companies that do not have their tax returns certified as such will be on the priority list for tax inspection. The Ministry sets standards of work to be done for any taxpayer wanting to use an SFA. At the end of each year, SFAs have to prepare a comprehensive report to be submitted to the MoF and to certify the accuracy of the CIT return.
The work is carried out over the statutory financials that are subject to tax calculations. Note that this service is not of a 'statutory audit' nature, technically it is 'non-audit assurance' work.
The tax certification process helps to identify and take corrective measures against erroneous applications that may otherwise be detected only upon a tax investigation by the Turkish MoF.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 02 May 2024
## Inventory valuation
The weighted average and first in first out (FIFO) methods are allowed for calculating the value of year-end stock or goods sold. Last in first out (LIFO) is not permitted. Stock-count deficits are recorded as disallowable expenses, whereas stock-count surpluses are treated as income at year-end for CIT purposes. Necessary VAT adjustments should also be made accordingly.
## Capital gains
Capital gains derived by a company are generally taxable as ordinary corporate income. However, 50% of capital gains derived from the sale of domestic participations is exempt from CIT where:
A 25% exemption applies to capital gains derived from the sale of immovable property that has been held for at least two years, provided that the immovable property was acquired before 15 July 2023.
Capital gains derived by a Turkish international holding company from the sale of foreign participation are exempt from CIT, provided the foreign participation has been held for at least two years. To qualify as an international holding company, a Turkish company must meet the following requirements:
## Dividend income
Dividends received by a resident company from another Turkish company are exempt from CIT in the hands of the shareholder. Dividends received from a non-resident company are fully exempt from CIT where:
In addition, the recently introduced law number 7491 has brought tax exemption on 50% of the dividends from non-resident companies. The only requirements to benefit from the 50% exemption are:
Turkish companies that previously could not benefit from the full tax exemption (i.e. because the foreign subsidiary did not meet the requirement of being subject to 15% taxation) now may have possibility to claim a partial (50%) exemption on their dividend income from foreign companies.
## Interest income
In principle, all interest income is subject to tax. Interest income on bank deposits denominated in both Turkish lira and foreign currency is subject to WHT. Interest income is recorded at gross, and any WHT incurred on this income is offset against CIT calculated.
## Royalty income
Royalty income derived by a Turkish company is taxable as ordinary corporate income.
## Foreign-sourced income
In principle, foreign-sourced income is taxable in Turkey. However, foreign-sourced dividend income may be subject to participation exemption if certain conditions are met (*see Dividend income above*).
Other foreign-sourced income, such as royalties and interest, is fully taxable in Turkey. Partial relief from taxation is granted insofar as the foreign tax paid does not exceed the rate of tax payable for the same income in Turkey.
Although undistributed income of foreign subsidiaries should not be taxable in Turkey, controlled foreign company (CFC) rules should also be taken into consideration in this respect. *See Controlled foreign companies (CFCs) in the [Group taxation](turkey/corporate/group-taxation.html) section for more information*.

## WHT on dividends
Dividends paid to a resident or non-resident individual, or a non-resident company, are subject to WHT at the rate of 15%. There are DTTs signed by Turkey that provide WHT rates less than 15% on dividends under certain conditions. Treaty benefits are applicable subject to the fulfilment of the treaty eligibility conditions. Please note that dividend distributions to resident companies are not subject to WHT.
The following table provides a summary of dividend WHT rates applicable under the respective DTTs entered into by Turkey:
| Recipient | Shareholding interest | WHT rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Non-treaty |  | 15 |

Notes
1. The local rate is 15% for dividends. Unless a lower rate is stated in the Agreement, the local rate is applied.
2. As per the provisions of the protocol amending the agreement, the rate may be (partially or wholly) reduced:
3. Subject to 5% of the gross amount of the dividends if the recipient is the government, or a public institution that is wholly owned by the government or its political subdivisions, or local authorities of the United Arab Emirates.
4. The tax rate shall be 15% where the amount of the Turkish tax imposed on the income of the company paying dividends is less than 40% of such income derived in the accounting period ending immediately before the date when such dividends become payable.
5. The income should be subject to full corporate taxation in the hands of the Turkish tax-resident subsidiary.
6. If the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of Saudi Arabia, the tax so charged shall not exceed 5% of the gross amount of the dividends provided: (i) the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) that directly holds at least 20% of the capital of the Turkish company paying the dividends or (ii) the beneficial owner is a central bank or an entity that is wholly owned by the government.
7. In case of Turkey, the tax rate shall not exceed 5%, to the extent that they are paid out of profits that have been subject to full rate of CIT in Turkey (i.e. without benefiting from tax exemption).
8. The rate of the income tax shall not exceed 5% if it is derived by the Government Pension Fund (*Statens Pensjonsfond*) or by the Government Social Security Fund (*Sosyal Guvenlik Fonu*), provided that such dividends are exempt from tax in the contracting state where the beneficial owner is a resident.
9. The treaty-reduced rate of 5% shall apply if such dividends are exempt from tax in the contracting state of which the beneficial owner is a resident.
10. As per the provisions of the agreement, the rate may be reduced to 5% of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) that directly holds at least 20% of the capital of the company paying the dividends, provided that a relief from Swiss tax is granted for such dividends by way of an abatement of the profits tax in proportion corresponding to the ratio between the earnings from participations and the total profits or by way of an equivalent relief.
11. As per the provisions of the agreement, 5% of the gross amount of dividends that are subject to Turkish Corporate Income Tax at the full rate if the Australian company (other than a partnership) holds at least 25% of the capital of the Turkish company. Regardless of these, if the dividends are taxed in Australia, Turkey could tax the dividends at a rate not exceeding 15%.
12. The WHT shall be lowered to 5% if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) that directly holds at least 50% of the capital of the company paying the dividends or has invested more than 10 million United States dollars (USD), or the equivalent in Turkish or Vietnamese currency, in the capital of the company paying the dividends.
## WHT on interest and royalties
In case of royalty payments to non-residents, 20% WHT has to be deducted by the Turkish entity making the payment. The WHT rate may be reduced by the application of DTT provisions (generally to 10%).
Interest paid to non-residents is subject to 10% WHT under local legislation. The WHT rates set out in the DTTs that Turkey has signed are mostly equal to (or higher than) the local rate. A reduction in the WHT rate further to a DTT is possible only in very limited situations.

## Overview
Last reviewed - 02 May 2024
Türkiye (hereafter Turkey), known officially as the Republic of Turkey, is a transcontinental Eurasian country. Its location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia makes Turkey a country of significant geostrategic importance. The capital of Turkey is Ankara, and the official currency is the Turkish lira (TRY). The official language of Turkey is Turkish.
The modern Republic of Turkey was established in 1923, with Mustafa Kemal Atatürk as its first president. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, constitutional republic. It has become increasingly integrated with the West through membership in organisations such as the Council of Europe, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and the G-20 major economies. Turkey began full membership negotiations with the European Union (EU) in 2005, having been an associate member of the European Economic Community (EEC) since 1963 and having reached a customs union agreement in 1995.
Turkey has also fostered close cultural, political, economic, and industrial relations with the Eastern world, particularly with the Middle East and the Turkic states of Central Asia, through membership in organisations such as the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO).
The Turkish economy, the 19th largest economy in the world , where he CAGR (Compound Average Growth Rate) realised was 5% over the last decade, With the latest figures, the size of the Turkish economy is 906 billion United States dollars (USD) as of year-end 2022, with a *per capita* GDP of USD 10,655.
In addition to its strong fundamentals, demographic structure; near-shoring and reshoring opportunities led foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows to Turkey to continue. Including real-estate investments, Turkey attracted USD 13 billion each year on average over the last ten years.
Inflationary environment and external vulnerabilities necessitates structural measures to be implemented whereas Turkey continued to decouple positively in fiscal metrics compared to its peers. within economic issues that have to be dealt with.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 02 May 2024
## Social security contributions
Social security premiums, which are calculated on salary limits of a minimum of TRY 26.005,50 and a maximum of TRY 195.041,40 per month as of 1 January 2025, must be paid by the employer and the employee at rates defined according to labour categories. For Turkish nationals, the general rates are 20.75% (if certain conditions are satisfied, it is reduced by 4% to 16.75% (5% for manufacturing sector) for the employer and 14% for the employee.
The employee's portion of the social security contributions is deductible in determining taxable income.
## Unemployment insurance
Unemployment insurance premiums are calculated over an upper earnings level of TRY 195.041,40 per month as of 1 January 2025. The premiums are paid by the employee, employer, and the state at the following rates:
| Payer | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Employee | 1 |
| Employer | 2 |
| State | 1 |
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no national wealth taxes in Turkey.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Recipients of property through inheritance or donation are subject to inheritance and gift tax at rates ranging from 1% to 30%. Tax paid in a foreign country on inherited property is deducted from the tax base as a deductible expense. Inheritance and gift tax is payable over a period of three years, in biannual instalments in May and November, except for lottery prizes, for which the related taxes are collected through withholding at the time of payment.
## Property taxes and high-value residence tax
Property tax is calculated in respect of each property at the tax value set at the year of acquisition, which is then re-evaluated annually with the half of the revaluation rate announced by the Ministry of Finance. The rate of the tax on the taxable values of buildings is 0.1% if the building is used as residence and 0.2% for other buildings. The rate of tax on the taxable values of property in lands is 0.3%. These rates will be doubled in metropolitan areas.
Apart from the property tax, for residences located in Turkey with a value of more than TRY 15,709,000 for 2025, a new type of tax was introduced in 2019 to be calculated on the excess value of the residence. The applicable rates vary between 0.3% to 1.0%, depending on the value of the residence.
## Stamp tax
Stamp duty currently applies at the rate of 0.759% over the gross salary for individuals receiving their income from a local payroll. For individuals filing tax returns, this duty is replaced with fixed filing fees currently amounting to TRY 672.40.
## Local non-income taxes
There are no local taxes apart from some minor transaction charges and immovable property taxes imposed and collected by municipalities.

## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 02 May 2024
## Withholding tax rate on dividends increased
The withholding tax rate applicable on dividend payments has been increased to 15% effective from 22 December 2024. Accordingly, any dividends paid to a resident or non-resident individual, or a non-resident company on or after 22 December 2024 will be subject to 15% withholding tax, unless the rate is reduced under a tax treaty.
No withholding tax is imposed on dividends paid to a resident company and hence the recent amendment does not have impact on profit distributions from a resident company to another resident company.
## The law implementing Pillar Two rules enters into effect
The law number 7524 introducing implementation of the Pillar Two rules appeared in the Official Gazette of 2 August 2024. Similar to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Rules and the Pillar Two Directive, the Turkish Pillar Two legislation will apply to constituent entities that are members of a multinational enterprise (MNE) group that has annual revenue of Turkish equivalent of 750 million euros (EUR) or more in the consolidated financial statements of the ultimate parent company in at least two of the four fiscal years immediately preceding the tested fiscal year.
## Implementation of a domestic minimum corporate tax regime
Law number 7524, published in the Official Gazette on 2 August 2024, introduces a domestic minimum tax regime that aims to ensure the corporate tax is not less than 10% of corporate income before certain exemptions and deductions. Under the new rule, the corporate taxpayers will compute their tax liability under both the standard regime (i.e. 25% tax on taxable income after deductions and exemptions) and under a parallel regime (i.e. 10% tax on taxable income before certain deductions and exemptions). The larger amount is then payable. The domestic minimum tax regime will apply to fiscal years starting from 1 January 2025.
## Amendment to the participation exemption regime for foreign-sourced dividends
Law number 7491, published in the Official Gazette on 28 December 2023, introduced a new provision allowing tax exemption on 50% of the dividends from non-resident companies, while the full exemption still stands for those who can qualify. The only requirements to benefit from the 50% exemption are:
Turkish companies that previously could not benefit from the full exemption (i.e. because they could not meet the required conditions) may now have the possibility to claim a partial (50%) exemption on their dividend income from foreign companies.
## Change in CIT rate
With the Law number 7456 published on 15 July 2023:
## Withholding tax (WHT) on share buybacks increased to 15% for unlisted companies
With the Presidential Decree no. 6791, published in the Official Gazette on 14 February 2023, the WHT rate on deemed dividends in connection with share buybacks by Turkish resident companies was reduced to 0% from 15%.
Presidential Decree no. 7343, published on 7 July 2023, has narrowed the scope of application of the 0% WHT on deemed distributions on share buybacks, so that it no longer applies to share buybacks by unlisted companies. Accordingly, the WHT rate has been reset at 15% for unlisted companies. The amendment is applicable to deemed distributions in relation to shares acquired after 7 July 2023.
## Increase in value-added tax (VAT) rates
The Presidential Decree no. 7346, published in the Official Gazette on 7 July 2023, has increased the VAT rates as follows:
The new rates will apply as of 10 July 2023.
The Presidential Decree does not bring any change to the reduced VAT rate of 1%.
## The new supplementary tax for corporate taxpayers
Law number 7440, published in the Official Gazette on 12 March 2023, introduced a supplementary tax of 10% (5% in certain situations) for corporate taxpayers. The supplementary tax is payable on the portion of 2022 corporate income that is taxed at a reduced rate or is exempt. The additional tax should be assessed regardless of whether the taxpayer has a CIT liability in 2022 or not.
The deadline for payment of the first instalment of the new tax is the same as the deadline for payment of the CIT for 2022 (30 April 2023). The second instalment is payable in the fourth month following this period (31 August 2023).
## Limitation to the notional interest deduction rule
The right to claim notional interest deductions, which was available for an indefinite period under the old legislation, has been limited to the fiscal year in which the capital increase is registered and the following four fiscal years. For newly established companies and for companies that increased their capital before the amending law was published on 5 July 2022, the five-year limitation will start in 2022.
## Inflation accounting postponed to 2023
Law number 7352, published in the Official Gazette on 29 January 2022, postpones the implementation of inflation accounting until the end of 2023. The gains and losses arising from inflation accounting in 2023 will not be taxable or tax-deductible (i.e. it will have no effect on the tax calculations).
## CIT reduction for exporters and manufacturers
Law number 7351, passed on 19 January 2022, allows for a CIT rate reduction of 1% on income generated from manufacturing and exportation. The regulation is effective for years 2022 and onward. This means that while the tax rate for other companies is 23% in 2022, for qualifying manufacturers and exporters it is 22% for the portion of their income resulting from exporting and manufacturing activities.
Manufacturers who also engage in exportation shall benefit from the reduction only for manufacturing; they may not claim a second reduction for exportation.
## Declaration of ultimate beneficial ownership (UBO) now required in Turkey
A new compliance requirement is now imposed on companies doing business in Turkey, calling for annual declaration of the UBO information to the tax office.
In addition, designated institutions and professions covered by the anti-money laundering law (e.g. banks, payment agencies, finance companies, lawyers, accountants, notaries) are also required to report the beneficial ownership information of their clients, when and if requested by the Revenue Administration.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 02 May 2024
If both the legal and the business headquarters of a company are located outside Turkey, the company is regarded as a non-resident entity for Turkish tax purposes. If one of these headquarters is located within Turkey, the company is regarded as a resident entity for Turkish tax purposes.
Note that there is no distinction between CIT and VAT registration in Turkey. Therefore, corporations or permanent establishments (PEs) are liable for all taxes (e.g. CIT, VAT, WHT, stamp tax) once they are registered for tax purposes in Turkey.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Unlike the provisions of the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital, there is no minimum period of presence in Turkey before a presence is regarded under the Turkish tax legislation as a PE. In this regard, we believe that the PE evaluation should be made for each case depending on the merits of the case, both from a local legislation perspective and from a treaty (if applicable) perspective.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 02 May 2024
Turkish CIT legislation allows a deduction for all the 'ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred for the generation and sustenance of income during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business'.
The general principle for tax deductibility is that the payment should be a necessary business expense and it should be properly documented in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Turkish transfer pricing regulations and those in the local tax procedural law.
## Depreciation and amortisation
Fixed assets are subject to depreciation at rates determined by the Turkish Ministry of Finance (MoF), based on their useful life.
Intangible assets (i.e. licence, franchise, copyright, etc.) and goodwill are depreciated over 15 years and five years, respectively. Additionally, leasehold improvement is depreciated based on lease period.
Depreciation can be calculated by applying either the straight-line or declining-balance method (limited to 50%), at the taxpayer’s discretion. The taxpayer may also change the option from declining-balance to straight-line (but not *vice versa*) at any time during the life of the asset. The applicable rate for the declining-balance method is twice the rate of the straight-line method, subject to certain limitations. Furthermore, in special cases, the tax authorities may determine higher depreciation rates.
Intangible assets are amortised by the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, if objectively determinable.
Profits or losses on disposal of fixed assets (i.e. the difference between the proceeds and the written-down values) are included in taxable income in the year of disposal. If the renewal of disposed-of assets is considered necessary by the owners of the business concern, the profit accrued may be retained for a certain amount of time. After the purchase of new fixed assets, the profits may be offset against the depreciation of the new assets.
A limitation has been introduced with the introduction of Communiqué No. 311 on Income Taxation and Law No. 7194, limiting the deduction of expenses relating to passenger vehicles to 70% of these expenses and a maximum of TRY 26,000 for rental expenses of personal automobiles (with an exemption of financial leasing) in determining commercial and professional earnings.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses are considered as deductible expenses as incurred. Also, the taxpayer has the option to capitalise such expenses and to depreciate them over five years at equal amounts.
## Interest expenses
In Turkey, interest is generally treated as an ordinary business expense and is tax deductible. There are certain limitations, such as the arm’s-length principle and thin capitalisation rule for related-party borrowings (*please see Thin capitalisation in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section for more information*).
Starting from year 2021, a new restriction also applies in situations where the amount of external financing of the taxpayer exceeds the taxpayer's equity. In such situations, 10% of the borrowing costs (such as interest, commission, exchange rate differences) corresponding to the excess borrowing become non-deductible for corporate tax purposes. Interest and similar payments capitalised to the cost of investment are not subject to deduction limitation. Different than the thin capitalisation rule, this new limitation applies to all borrowings, related party or third party. Credit institutions, financial institutions, financial leasing companies, factoring companies, and financing companies are excluded from the application of this restriction.
## Notional interest deduction
For capital contributions in cash, a tax incentive of notional interest deduction is available, allowing companies (except for those that operate in banking, finance, and insurance sectors) to deduct from their taxable income a notional interest calculated based on their capital amounts contributed after 1 July 2015.
The deduction is equal to 50% of the notional interest that is calculated on the qualifying capital increase (net of qualifying decrease). The deduction rate is 75% for capital sourced from abroad. The notional interest rate is determined based on the interest rates the Turkish Central Bank announces annually in relation to commercial bank credits.
With the Law no. 7417, published in the Official Gazette on 5 July 2022, the right to claim notional interest deductions, which was available for an indefinite period, has been limited to the fiscal year in which the decision on capital increase is registered and the following four fiscal years. For newly established companies and for companies that increased their capital before the amending law was published on 5 July 2022, the five-year limitation started in 2022.
## Bad debt
Bad and doubtful accounts receivable are deductible under certain conditions. Amounts of the receivables collected afterwards are added to the profits of the year in which they are collected.
## Charitable contributions
## Pensions and employee termination benefits
Payments for pensions and employee termination benefits are deductible for CIT purposes under certain conditions.
## Fines and penalties
In principle, fines and penalties incurred due to the wrong-doings of the taxpayer or its employees are not tax deductible.
## Taxes
Essentially, the CIT itself and VAT are, subject to certain exceptions, not deductible for CIT purposes.
Fees and duties paid in relation to assets of the company are, in principle, deductible in determining taxable corporate income.
## Net operating losses
Corporate losses may be carried forward for five years. Losses cannot be carried back.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Charges for royalties and interest by foreign affiliates may be deductible for CIT purposes, provided that transfer pricing and thin capitalisation rules are followed (*see the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section for more information*).

# Turkey
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 02 May 2024
Consolidation of the accounts of group companies for tax purposes is not allowed in Turkey since each company is regarded as a separate taxpayer.
## Transfer pricing
The Corporate Tax Law (CTL) includes transfer pricing regulations, using the OECD's guidelines as a basis. If a taxpayer enters into transactions regarding the sale or purchase of goods and services with related parties in which prices are not set in accordance with the arm's-length principle, the related profits are considered to have been distributed in a disguised manner through transfer pricing. Such disguised profit distribution through transfer pricing is not accepted as deductible for CIT purposes. The methods prescribed in the law are the traditional transaction methods described in the OECD's transfer pricing guidelines.
### Transfer pricing documentation
The three-tiered approach that was adopted in many countries after the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project was included into the General Communique Serial No. 4 on Disguised Profit Distribution through Transfer Pricing, published in Turkey on 1 September 2020. Based on the current Turkish transfer pricing legislation effective as of 1 September 2020, there are four types of documentation requirements for taxpayers:
## Thin capitalisation
According to local thin capitalisation regulation, if the ratio of the borrowings from shareholders or from persons related to the shareholders exceeds triple the shareholders' equity of the borrower company at any time within the relevant year, the exceeding portion of the borrowing will be considered thin capital and the corresponding interest will not be deductible. Accordingly, the ratio of loans received from related parties to shareholders' equity must be no more than 3:1 in order to eliminate Turkish thin capitalisation issues.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Turkish taxpayers are generally not subject to Turkish taxation on the earnings of their foreign corporate subsidiaries. Instead, Turkish taxation on such earnings is generally deferred until the earnings are distributed to the Turkish shareholder. The major exception to this rule is the CFC regime regulated under Article 7 of the CIT Law. Under this regime, Turkish shareholders (individual or corporation) are subject to Turkish taxation on their pro rata share of a CFC’s undistributed earnings, as if such earnings had been distributed currently, based on certain conditions.
The CFC's profit is included in the CIT base of the controlling resident corporation at the rate of the shares controlled, irrespective of whether it is distributed.

Branches are taxed solely on the income derived from activities in Turkey since they are regarded as non-resident entities for Turkish tax purposes. Branch profits are subject to Turkish CIT at the rate of 25% (same as subsidiaries).

# Turkey
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 02 May 2024
## Foreign tax credit
A tax credit is granted for foreign tax paid, up to the amount of Turkish CIT attributable to the foreign income. Any unused credit may be carried forward to the following three years. The foreign tax paid must be documented through foreign tax office receipts approved by the Turkish consulate in the country in which the foreign tax was paid. Special conditions apply to foreign tax credits relating to dividends received by Turkish resident companies from their foreign participations.
## Exemption for income from foreign construction and repair activities
The profit from construction and repair activities carried out by Turkish corporations in foreign countries may be exempt from CIT in Turkey under the Turkish CTL. It should be noted that if loss occurs from these activities, it is not possible to deduct this loss amount from the income generated through domestic activities since deduction of a loss relating to foreign activities that are exempt from CIT in Turkey is not allowed for deduction.
## Investment incentives
Investment incentives are available to investors through an Investment Incentive Certificate (IIC), which is obtained from the General Directorate of Incentive Practises and Foreign Capital under the Ministry of Industry and Technology.
In order for an investment to be granted an IIC, the minimum investment expenditures should be at least TRY 3 million for the first two regions and TRY 1.5 million for other regions. To be granted incentives, investment projects are subject to evaluation by the Ministry of Industry and Technology. The incentives under an IIC can be summarised as follows:
In general, the investment incentive legislation is comprised of general, regional, and strategic investment incentive schemes.
### General investment scheme
Investments that are not qualified as special types of investments are subject to general incentives. The incentives available to general investments are customs duty and VAT exemption on the purchase of investment goods (i.e. machinery and equipment).
### Regional and sector-based investments scheme
### Strategic investments scheme
Based on the related legislation, investments in production of products that are highly dependent on imports and meet all the following criteria will be regarded as strategic investments:
Prioritised investments with over TRY 3 billion of minimum fixed investments will be qualified as strategic investments.
### Project-based investment incentive package
### Technology Focused Industry Move program
Preferential Product List: Products in medium-high and high technology sectors, according to the definition of the OECD, as well as products that have critical importance for the development of these industries as determined by the Ministry.
In order for projects to be evaluated within the scope of the Decision, the minimum fixed investment amount for the Technology Focused Industry Move program should be TRY 50 million. For other investments, the minimum fixed investment amount should be TRY 500 million.
## Free trade zones
In general, activities such as manufacturing, storage, packing, general trading, banking, insurance, and trade may be performed in Turkish free trade zones. Goods moving between Turkey and the zones are treated, for all purposes, as exports or imports. However, operations within the zones are subject to the supervision of the zone management (and customs authorities), to whom regular activity reports must be submitted. Consequently, there is a requirement for zone users to maintain full accounting records (in Turkish) with respect to their activities. These accounting requirements extend to inventory records. Customs duty is levied on any unexplained inventory losses as though the goods had been imported into the country.
The right to operate in a free trade zone is conferred by an operating licence obtained from the Ministry of Economy, which reviews the application for conformity with the objectives and types of activity specified by the Economic Affairs Coordination Council.
R&D legislation:
#### R&D deduction (100%)
In addition, in the event of providing an increase of at least 20% in any of the following indicators in R&D or design centres compared to the previous year, then 50% of the increase in the amount of R&D, innovation, or design expenses compared to the previous year will also be taken into consideration as an extra deduction in the calculation of the CIT base:
#### Income tax exemption (95%, 90%, or 80%)
#### VAT exemption and amortisation on machines and equipment acquired for R&D and design activities
Deliveries of machines and equipment that will be used for R&D, innovation, and design projects by the R&D Centres are exempt from VAT.
Stamp tax exemption
#### Customs duty exemption

Please note that, contract-based R&D activities will be out of the scope as stated in the aforementioned Decision, as the companies do not need any intellectual property (IP) registration for contract-based R&D activities to utilise CIT exemption.
If the project results in a loss, it is not possible to deduct this loss from the CIT base. In addition, the income from other activities (other than R&D and software income) is subject to CIT.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 02 May 2024
## Employment income
Resident individuals are taxed on salary earned for work performed anywhere in the world, regardless of where payment is made and regardless of whether it is remitted. Non-residents are taxable on remuneration for work performed in Turkey or any remuneration paid out from Turkey, regardless of whether or not it relates to Turkish services, but may be exempted under double tax treaty (DTT) provisions.
The following individuals must file an annual tax return in Turkey for 2025, until March 2026:
## Equity compensation
Turkish tax laws do not contain specific provisions regarding the taxation of employee share incentive plans in Turkey; consequently, any benefits granted to employees under these plans are subject to the general principles of the local legislation.
The administrative aspects, security registration requirements for the employer, and timing of taxation vary based on the structure and characteristics of each plan. Therefore, professional advice should be sought before implementation.
## Business income
There may be some restrictions on self-employment activities of foreign nationals in Turkey. Profits or gains from trades, professions, or vocations that are carried out within Turkey are subject to tax whether or not the individual is resident. If resident in Turkey, a liability may arise on such profits or gains even if the trade or profession is conducted abroad. Professional advice should be taken at the earliest possible stage.
## Capital gains
Currently, there are two different taxation regimes under Turkish tax legislation regarding the taxation of capital instruments.
Under Temporary Article 67, certain income (e.g. capital gains derived from certain instruments, such as listed equities purchased after 1 January 2006 and Turkish domestic government bonds and Treasury bills issued after 1 January 2006) derived through the intermediation of brokerage houses, banks, and custodian banks operating in Turkey (’intermediary institutions’) is subject to WHT depending on the legal status of the investor.
Under the WHT regime, certain portfolio investment income (e.g. capital gains derived from the listed equities acquired after 1 January 2006 or from Turkish local government bonds issued after 1 January 2006) derived by resident and non-resident individuals is subject to 10% WHT. Furthermore, 0% WHT is applicable for all type of investors with respect to capital gains derived from listed equities on the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE) purchased after 1 January 2006 (excluding securities investment trust shares) and income derived from transactions on equity index futures carried out under Turkdex and warrants with underlying equities traded on ISE and participation shares of investment funds that intensively invest in listed shares (’equity intensive funds’).
WHT is administered by intermediary institutions and is the final taxation for non-residents. It is not necessary to file a tax return or appoint a representative.
However, if any income derived from the capital instruments does not fall within the scope of the WHT regime (e.g. the capital gains are derived from Turkish domestic government bonds and Treasury bills issued prior to 1 January 2006), they are taxed according to permanent tax rules. If the gains are taxed under permanent tax rules rather than under Temporary Article 67, the tax collection is carried out via self-assessment (e.g. individual should file a tax return).
## Dividend income
Except for the specific cases stated below, half the gross amount of dividends obtained from resident entities is exempt from income tax. If the remaining amount, together with other income (i.e. salaries, income from movable property, and real estate income subject to WHT), exceeds the threshold of TRY 330,000 (for 2025), this amount should be declared with the annual tax return. WHT charged on the total gross dividend (15%) can be credited against the income tax calculated.
Dividend income obtained from abroad that exceeds TRY 18,000 (for 2025) is taxable and should be included to income tax return of the individual. Half of the foreign source dividends is exempt from income tax if both of the below conditions are met.
Income tax paid abroad is offset against the income tax calculated as long as the proof documentation required by Turkish income tax law is provided. The provisions of bilateral tax treaties are reserved.
## Interest income
The following descriptions apply to interest payments to resident and non-resident individuals:
- In current call accounts and deposit accounts with a maturity of less than six months (including six months): 10%.
- In deposit accounts with a maturity of less than one year (including one year): 7.5%.
- In accounts with a maturity of more than one year: 5%.
Interest income obtained from abroad that does not fall under the scope of the Turkish WHT regime and exceeds TRY 18,000 (for 2025) is declared. In determination of whether or not this declaration threshold is exceeded, income from movable assets (such as interest and dividends) and immovable property (such as rental income) shall be taken into account, while any income that has already been taxed at source in Turkey and any exempt income will not be taken into consideration. WHT paid abroad is offset against the income tax calculated. Provisions of bilateral tax treaties are reserved.
## Rental income
For non-residents, rental income from real estate or other assets located in Turkey are taxable income. However, certain exemptions and adjustments may apply for both residents and non-residents. For rental income generated from the properties used as residence, income less than TRY 47,000 (for 2025) is exempt from taxation and not required to be reported. Reporting obligations for the properties used as work places is dependent on certain thresholds with other income combinations.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 02 May 2024
Residents are persons whose legal residences are in Turkey or who intend to settle in the country. Persons with uncertain residence status are considered to be resident if they have lived in Turkey uninterruptedly for more than six months in one calendar year.
Residents are treated as full taxpayers. Individuals whose legal residence is not in Turkey or who do not reside in Turkey for more than six months in a calendar year are treated as limited taxpayers. In general, those who stay in Turkey for more than six continuous months exclusively for the fulfilment of specific and temporary assignments are not considered as resident, and they will still be treated as limited taxpayers.
Foreign individuals who have to remain in Turkey for more than six months due to *force majeure* (e.g. illness, arrest) would still be considered as non-resident in Turkey.
