## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 31 January 2025
Bermuda historically imposed no taxes on profits, income, dividends, or capital gains, has no limit on the accumulation of profit, and has no requirement to distribute dividends.
The Bermuda Corporate Income Tax Act 2023 (CITA 2023) became law on 27 December 2023. This applies a 15% corporate income tax (CIT) to Bermuda businesses that are part of a multinational enterprise (MNE) groups with annual revenue of EUR 750 million or more beginning in 2025.
The taxable income for Bermuda CIT is based on book income (similar to the GLoBE rules) with adjustments for certain transactions such as creditable foreign taxes and the Economic Transition Adjustment (ETA).
Bermuda businesses that are not within the scope of the newly enacted Bermuda CIT will continue to not be subject to income tax in Bermuda.
The Bermuda government has routinely granted Tax Assurance Certificates to exempted undertakings (i.e. exempted companies, permit companies, exempted partnerships, and exempted unit trust schemes) on application to the Minister through the Bermuda Monetary Authority. These Tax Assurance Certificates state that any future Parliamentary imposition of such taxes will not be applicable to the company and its operations until 31 March 2035. Of note, the Bermuda CIT applies notwithstanding the existence of previously issued Tax Assurance Certificates for Bermuda businesses that are within the scope of being subject to Bermuda CIT.

# Bermuda
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 31 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
There is no VAT or sales tax in Bermuda.
## Customs duties
Customs import duties are imposed on almost all goods arriving on the island at varying rates. The most common rate of customs import duties is at 25%.
## Excise taxes
There are no excise taxes imposed in Bermuda.
## Property taxes
The land tax rates are as follows, effective 1 July 2019:
| Type of property | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Commercial property | 9.50 |
| Commercial property - Designated Economic Empowerment Zone | 7.00 |
| Tourist property | 8.90 |
| Private dwelling | 0.80 to 55.00\* |
\* Private dwellings ae subject to graduated land tax rates based on the ARV of the unit.
## Vacation rental tax and annual fee
Effective November 2018, the proprietor of a vacation rental unit or a holder of a vacation rental (rent control) certificate, or an agent acting on behalf of either, shall pay to the Bermuda tax authorities a vacation rental fee equal to 4.5% of the rack rate charge made by the proprietor in respect of the vacation rental unit.
Effective 1 September 2023, Bermuda imposes an annual rental property fee between 1,500 and 2,500 Bermudian dollars (BMD) based on the ARV of the property.
## Transfer taxes
There is no transfer tax imposed in Bermuda.
## Stamp taxes
Bermuda imposes stamp duty on a wide variety of legal instruments, such as transfers of property, deeds, and rental agreements. However, international businesses and partnerships ordinarily register as exempted companies and, as such, are not subject to stamp duty.
## Payroll tax
Historically, the Bermuda payroll tax was imposed on the employer, and the employer had the right to recover up to a prescribed percentage of the payroll tax from its employees. Effective April 2017, the payroll tax is ‘split’ into being imposed upon the employer and the employee; however, the tax payment obligation remains with the employer.
Bermuda imposes a payroll tax on employers at a rate determined by the employer category or the total annual payroll as detailed below. Special rates may apply for certain businesses, such as farmers, fisherman, restaurants, hotels, and retailers. International businesses, which normally register as exempted undertakings, are liable for the employer category only at a rate of 10.25% of applicable employee remuneration of any kind. There is an employer portion exception for new Bermudian hires, among other special situations.
| Annual payroll (BMD) | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Less than 200,000 | 1.00 |
| 200,000 to 350,000 | 2.50 |
| 350,000 to 500,000 | 5.25 |
| 500,000 to 1 million | 7.50 |
| Greater than 1 million | 10.00 |
| All exempt undertakings | 10.25 |
Employees include officers and directors of exempt companies if there is a contract for services and they regularly perform managerial functions on a day-to-day basis. However, a person who ordinarily works outside of Bermuda and whose period of employment in Bermuda does not exceed four consecutive weeks is exempt from payroll tax entirely. We note the application of these rules is complex; as such, we recommend you consult your tax adviser.
Remuneration is interpreted broadly and includes salaries and the value of employee benefits paid or given to an employee for services to the employer wholly or mainly in Bermuda. Specifically, employee benefits include, but are not limited to, fees, bonuses, leave pay, profit sharing, redundancy settlements, housing allowances, any positive difference between the fair market value of stock options and the option price as of the vesting date, and all other payments or value given from an employer to an employee. In case of dispute, the burden of proof is on the employer to prove that any payment or benefit from the employer to an employee was not compensation. For further guidance on the details of taxable remuneration, we recommend you consult your tax adviser.
The maximum taxable remuneration per employee is set at BMD 1 million, above which there is no liability for payroll tax.
Payroll tax is payable on a quarterly basis, commencing on the first day of April, July, October, and January. Payments are due within 15 days of the end of each tax period.
Effective 1 April 2023, a reduction in payroll tax was introduced for all workers earning less than BMD 48,000, with incremental increases being made to the payroll taxes in respect of the four remaining bands. As such, the employee portion of the payroll tax will be calculated using a marginal tax rate structure as follows:
| Annual remuneration (BMD) | 2024/25 rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Less than or equal to 48,000 | 0.50 |
| 48,001 to 96,000 | 9.25 |
| 96,001 to 200,000 | 10.00 |
| 200,001 to 500,000 | 11.50 |
| 500,001 to 1,000,000 | 12.50 |
As noted above, the obligation to remit payroll tax (in its entirety) remains with the employer.
Tax returns must be submitted reflecting payment using the revised employer and employee portions of tax. There is a 5% rate of tax on the employer portion and regular rate for the employee portion as provided above for hotels and restaurants.
## Social insurance
Bermuda’s contributory pension scheme requires employers to make monthly contributions to the Contributory Pensions Fund for every employee above 17 years of age for each week in which the employee works more than four hours. An employer must ensure that each qualifying employee registers with the department and obtains a social insurance number. Civil and criminal penalties may apply to employers for failure to register or pay in for each qualifying employee.
Employees contribute a matching sum via weekly payroll deduction, with several exceptions. Full-time students under the age of 26 who are employed during holidays, weekends, and summer breaks, and their employers, are entirely exempt from social insurance contributions. Employees over the age of 65 are exempt from contributing their half, although the employer must still contribute its part.
The current total contribution per employee per week is BMD 71.84. The employer portion is BMD 35.92 and the employee portion is BMD 35.92. Self-employed individuals must contribute the total BMD 71.84 contribution.
## Corporate services tax
Bermuda imposes a 7% corporate services tax on the providers of corporate services on the gross revenue earned from exempted companies and partnerships. Corporate services are defined to include corporate administration, corporate management, corporate secretarial, the provision of a registered office, and accounting and financial services. Directors and resident representation services are subject to the tax where the provider is in the business of providing corporate services.
Banking, auditing, and managing an insurance company are not considered corporate services when determining corporate services tax.
## Financial services tax
A financial services tax is charged on the following financial services providers at the following rates effective 1 April 2019:
Financial service providers must submit a return and pay financial services tax quarterly within 30 days of each tax period. The tax periods end 30 June, 30 September, 31 December, and 31 March.
## Foreign Currency Purchase Tax
Foreign Currency Purchase Tax is imposed at the rate of 1.25% on foreign currency purchased by a resident from a local bank. *See Foreign exchange controls in the [Other issues](bermuda/corporate/other-issues.html) section for exemption information*.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 31 January 2025
Since income taxes have not previously been imposed on corporations in Bermuda, tax returns have historically not been required to be completed for corporate income tax compliance purposes.
Public communications discussing certain administrative matters related to Bermuda CIT have been released including:
Filing BCEs are required to submit CIT returns for their BCE groups annually. Returns are proposed to be due by the 15th day of the 10th month following the fiscal year-end.
Taxes are paid in installments. The first installment is proposed to be due by the 15th day of the 8th month after the beginning of the fiscal year, amounting to 50% of the expected tax liability for the year. The second installment is due by the 15th day of the 12th month after the beginning of the fiscal year, bringing the total installments to 90% of the expected tax liability.
Upon filing the CIT return, a "true-up" payment must be made no later than the due date of the return, regardless of when the return is filed.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 31 January 2025
Since Bermuda did not previously impose income taxes on corporations, income determination has not historically been relevant in the context of Bermuda taxation.
However, the Bermuda CITA 2023, provides specific guidelines for income determination applicable to the Bermuda CIT which is effective in 2025 for Bermuda businesses within its scope. Corporate taxable income is generally based on book income, with adjustments for certain transactions and credits.

## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 31 January 2025
With the assent of the Governor on 27 December 2023, the Bermuda Corporate Income Tax Act 2023 (CITA 2023) became law. Subsequent to this date, a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) has been released with an updated version including additional guidance on this subject.
Effective as of 1 January 2025, a 15% corporate income tax (CIT) will be generally applicable to Bermuda businesses that are part of a multinational enterprise (MNE) group with annual revenue of 750 million euros (EUR) or more. The Bermuda CIT aligns with the Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) rules and qualification as a Covered Tax. However, Bermuda currently has no proposals to introduce the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) or the Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR).
Historically, Bermuda had not imposed taxes on profits, income, dividends, or capital gains. Bermuda businesses that are not within the scope of the newly enacted Bermuda CIT, which is effective in 2025, will continue to not be subject to income tax in Bermuda.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 31 January 2025
Since Bermuda did not previously impose income taxes on corporations, deductions from income have not been historically relevant in the context of Bermuda taxation.
However, the Bermuda CITA 2023 introduces specific guidelines for deductions in determining taxable income and tax loss carryforwards from years prior to the effective date of the Bermuda CIT, which is applicable to Bermuda businesses within scope of the Bermuda CIT and effective in 2025.

## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 31 January 2025
## Choice of business entity
Corporations registered in Bermuda are either ‘local’, ‘exempted’, or ‘permit’ companies. International businesses are normally exempted companies and partnerships.
Local companies are incorporated by Bermudians to trade primarily in Bermuda. To meet requirements of a local company, the overall shares must be at least 60% Bermudian owned. We note there are proposals that are reconsidering this 60% requirement.
Exempted companies are often international businesses incorporated by non-Bermudians to conduct business outside Bermuda. Exempted companies are classified as an exempted undertaking and routinely apply for Tax Assurance Certificates. Exempted companies must meet the requirement to retain a minimum of one director, secretary, or representative who is resident in Bermuda.
Permit companies are overseas companies that have received a permit to carry on business in or from within Bermuda. A permit is obtained through application to the Minister of Finance to be able to engage in and carry on any trade or business in Bermuda. A mutual fund is exempt from obtaining a permit if a person who is resident in Bermuda is engaged to be the fund’s administrator to perform duties such as corporate secretarial, accounting, administrative, registrar, and transfer agency, or dealing with shareholders.
Note: the Bermuda CIT applies notwithstanding the existence of Tax Assurance Certificates previously issued by the Bermuda Minister of Finance which an ‘in scope’ entity may hold that exempts such entity from new enacted Bermuda taxes until March 31, 2035.
## Foreign exchange controls
## Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and the Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
It is important to note that Bermuda also had a similar agreement with the United Kingdom (UK) to facilitate the implementation of the UK’s FATCA reporting requirements; however, UK FATCA has now transitioned to the CRS.
In 2014, Bermuda committed to the early adoption and implementation of the CRS, a multilateral automatic exchange of information regime developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
CRS reporting requirements have been introduced for financial accounts in existence from 1 January 2016. Applicable newly formed financial institutions will need to register or notify the Bermuda government by 30 April, and reporting is due by 31 May of the following year unless otherwise extended. A CRS Compliance Form is required to be submitted no later than 30 September following the end of the reporting period.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
Bermuda has agreed to CbC reporting as part of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan set forth by the OECD. With the goal of promoting transparency and accuracy in tax reporting, CbC reporting requires applicable multinational enterprises to include detailed financial and tax information relating to the global allocation of their revenue, profits, and taxes, among other indicators of economic activity.
Bermuda’s competent authority will annually exchange, on an automatic basis, the CbC report received from each reporting entity that is resident for tax purposes in Bermuda with all such other competent authorities of jurisdictions with respect to which Bermuda has an agreement in effect and in which, on the basis of the information in the CbC report, one or more constituent entities of the multinational group of the reporting entity are resident for tax purposes or are subject to tax with respect to the business carried out through a Bermuda permanent establishment (PE).
CbC reporting is in effect for fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2016. The due date for reporting is 12 months after the fiscal year end and notification (if applicable) is required no later than the last day of the reporting fiscal year.
## Tax treaties
Bermuda has a tax treaty with the United States, which was signed in 1986 and entered into force in 1988. The agreement limits its applicability to insurance enterprises and specifically exempts insurance business profits of qualified Bermuda insurance companies from US taxation, unless the company has created a PE in the United States. Of note, the treaty provides no relief for US federal excise tax (FET) on insurance or reinsurance premiums. In brief, the requirements to maintain this tax benefit include greater than 50% direct or indirect ownership by Bermuda residents or US citizens, and that the income is not substantially used to make distributions to non-Bermuda residents or non-US citizens. For further guidance in this complex area, please consult your tax adviser.
### Tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs)
Bermuda has an extensive tax agreement network via its bilateral TIEAs and participation in the OECD’s Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, which includes over 100 countries.
## Economic substance
The Economic Substance Act 2018 ('the Act' or 'ESA') was passed by the Bermuda government in response to concerns raised by the European Union’s Code of Conduct Group (Business Taxation). The Act is effective from 1 January 2019 and addresses the issue of economic substance for relevant businesses by defining 'relevant activity', and, for each such activity, the 'core income generating activities' that are to be examined.
'Relevant activity' means carrying on as a business any one or more of: (i) banking, (ii) insurance, (iii) fund management, (iv) financing, (v) leasing, (vi) headquarters, (vii) shipping, (viii) distribution and service centre, (ix) intellectual property, and (x) holding entity.
Under the Regulations, an in-scope entity is to satisfy requirements that:
Affected entities in existence prior to 31 December 2018 were required to comply with the provision of the Act by 1 July 2019, and to file an annual Economic Substance Declaration (ESD) with the Bermuda Registrar of Companies (ROC). The first ESD filings were due in 2020. Affected entities formed after 31 December 2018 are subject to the ESA from inception. The annual ESD filing is due six months after an applicable entity's financial year end.

Bermuda residency may be granted to non-Bermudians in the form of a work permit. Note that it is illegal to work in Bermuda without a work permit.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the increase in levels of persons working remotely, the government of Bermuda introduced the Work from Bermuda Certificate, allowing certain persons and students to work and study remotely from Bermuda with a temporary 'permit', which must be reapplied for annually.
