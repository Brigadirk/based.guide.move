# Eswatini
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 15 August 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year runs from 1 July to 30 June. Companies are required to have a 30 June year-end unless another year-end date is approved by the Commissioner of Taxes; such approval is routinely given.
## Tax returns
Income tax returns should be submitted within 120 days of 30 June, unless an extension of time for submission is granted, which also is routinely given if all tax requirements for the prior year are up to date and the provisional tax has been paid in accordance with the law. The extension of time is usually granted for a further 60 days, which effectively gives the taxpayer six months to submit their income tax return.
## Payment of tax
Notice of the date of payment is usually given on the tax assessment.
### Provisional tax payments
With respect to companies, provisional tax is payable in two instalments: one payment is due within six months of the company's financial year-end, and the other payment is due no later than the last day of the company's financial year.
The estimate of taxable income for provisional tax purposes should not be less than the taxable income assessed for the latest preceding year of assessment for which an assessment has been issued that is not less than 21 days before the date the estimate is made. This rule does not apply if the taxpayer can convince the Commissioner of Taxes that the taxable income for the current year will be less than the taxable income for the preceding year.
A provisional taxpayer becomes liable to pay a penalty if the estimate for taxable income for the second payment of provisional tax is found to be both less than 90% of the taxable income as finally determined and less than the taxable income as assessed for the immediately preceding tax year.
## Tax audit process
All assessments are subject to a tax audit. Current departmental practice is to perform tax audits going back four years.
## Statute of limitations
There is no statute of limitations in Eswatini.
Currently, the tax authorities are conducting full tax audits.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 15 August 2024
Income tax is levied on all income derived from a source within or deemed to be within the country, irrespective of whether the recipient of the income is actually resident in Eswatini.
## Personal income tax rates
Swaziland assesses resident and non-resident individuals on a graduated/progressive tax rate basis.
| Taxable income (SZL\*) | | Tax rate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 100,000 | SZL 0 plus 20% of taxable income in excess of SZL 0 |
| 100,000 | 150,000 | SZL 20,000 plus 25% of taxable income in excess of SZL 100,000 |
| 150,000 | 200,000 | SZL 32,500 plus 30% of taxable income in excess of SZL 150,000 |
| 200,000 | and above | SZL 47,500 plus 33% of taxable income in excess of SZL 200,000 |
\* Eswatini lilangeni
A rebate of SZL 8,200 (SZL 10,900 for those over age 60) *per annum* is applied to the annualized tax calculated. In essence, no tax is payable below an annual taxable salary of SZL 41,000 *per annum*.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 15 August 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year runs from 1 July to 30 June.
## Tax returns
All persons liable to taxation, whether personally or in a representative capacity, are required to file returns within 120 days of 30 June. The Commissioner may allow an extension of time as deemed appropriate.
## Payment of tax
Individuals in paid employment are subject to the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system.
Every provisional taxpayer (e.g. a company director who earns directors fees that are not subject to PAYE) is required to submit to the Commissioner, on the prescribed form, an estimate of the total tax payable for the year of assessment. The estimate of taxable income for provisional tax purposes should not be less than the taxable income assessed for the latest preceding year of assessment, for which an assessment has been issued not less than 21 days before the date the current estimate is made. This rule does not apply if the taxpayer can convince the Commissioner of Taxes that the taxable income for the current year will be less than the taxable income for the preceding year.
A provisional taxpayer becomes liable to pay a penalty if the estimate for taxable income for the second payment of provisional tax is found to be both less than 90% of the taxable income as finally determined and less than the taxable income as assessed for the immediately preceding tax year.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 15 August 2024
Non-resident WHTs are levied as follows.
## Dividends
WHT for dividends is payable at the rate of 15% (12.5% for companies registered in Botswana, Lesotho, and the Republic of South Africa). The rate drops to 10% under the double taxation agreement (DTA) with South Africa where the holding company owns more than 25% of the shares. Non-resident shareholders' WHT is payable within 30 days of the date on which the dividend is payable.
## Interest
WHT for interest is payable at the rate of 10%. Non-resident WHT on interest is payable within 14 days of the date of the accrual of the interest.
## Royalties and management fees
WHT for royalties and management fees is payable at the rate of 15%. Upon application, 5% may be refunded if there is a DTA in place.
## Entertainers and sportsmen
WHT is payable at the rate of 15% on income earned in Eswatini by entertainers and sportsmen. This tax relates only to public entertainers and sportsmen not ordinarily resident in Eswatini. The payer is required to deduct the tax and pay it within 15 days.
## Contractors or professionals
WHT is payable at the rate of 15% on services provided by contractors or professionals in Eswatini (materials are not taxed to the extent that materials are incidental to the overall charge). The Commissioner of Taxes must be notified of any agreement relating to construction operations or professional services under which payments are made to non-resident persons within 30 days after entering into the agreement. It is required that the tax be paid within 15 days from the date of payment.

# Eswatini
## Overview
Last reviewed - 15 August 2024
Eswatini, a landlocked country located in Southern Africa between Mozambique and South Africa, is divided into four districts, with the royal and legislative capital in Lobamba and the administrative capital located in Mbabane. Granted independence from British rule in 1968, Eswatini is the world's last absolute monarchy. The official languages of Eswatini are English and SiSwati. The currency of Eswatini is the lilangeni (SZL), which is pegged to the South African rand.
The economy of Eswatini is dominated by the service industry, manufacturing, and agriculture, with approximately 70% of the population engaged in subsistence agriculture. Sugar, wood pulp, coal, and quarry stone are the main exports. Eswatini is heavily dependent on South Africa, from which it receives more than 90% of its imports and to which it sends 60% of its exports. Customs duties from the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) account for two-thirds of Eswatini's government revenues, and worker remittances from South Africa substantially supplement domestically earned income.

Last reviewed - 15 August 2024
New tax legislation has been introduced effective 1 July 2024.
The corporate tax rate has decreased from 27.5% to 25%.
A presumptive tax has been implemented where the turnover is 500,000 Eswatini lilangeni (SZL) and less.
Withholding taxes (WHTs) on non-residents has been fixed at 15%. There had previously been dispensation of 12.5% for certain countries.
Allowance for the construction of a farmhouse has increased from SZL 60,000 to SZL 100,000.
Initial allowance has been changed from 50% to 30% on expenditure of SZL 5 million and more.
There will be gains and losses on the disposal of business assets.
Ring-fencing of losses has been introduced. This is applicable to business income of an individual, property income of an individual, manufacturing income of a resident company, and farming income of an individual.
Losses carried forward will be limited to five years. Timber and orchard plantations are not impacted.
The commissioner can deem shareholder loans to be taxable where such amounts have not been repaid.
Transfer pricing rules have been introduced (arm’s-length determination, transfer pricing methods, and the tested party).

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 15 August 2024
## Depreciation
Depreciation (wear-and-tear) allowances calculated by the net-reducing-balance method are available as follows:
| Asset | Depreciation rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Aircraft | 25 |
| Casino equipment | 15 |
| Construction equipment | 25 |
| Computer hardware | 33.33 |
| Computer software | 33.33 |
| Furniture and fittings | 10 |
| Hotel soft furnishings, including carpets | 10 |
| Legal and professional libraries | 5 |
| Lifts and elevators | 25 |
| Motor vehicles: |  |
| Buses | 33.33 |
| Cars | 20 |
| Light delivery vehicles | 25 |
| Lorries | 33.33 |
| Office equipment | 10 |
| Plant and machinery | 10 |
| Sound and projection equipment | 20 |
| Television sets | 20 |
| Tractors | 25 |
| Trailers | 20 |
| Video recorders | 33.33 |
| Videotapes | 25 |
For the first year after the addition of an asset, the wear-and-tear allowance is calculated on a monthly basis. With respect to leased assets, the lessor's claim for wear-and-tear allowance is usually spread over the lease period.
An initial allowance of 50% is granted for plant and machinery used in a manufacturing process, including hotel equipment. An initial allowance of 50% is granted for industrial buildings used for manufacturing purposes and hotels, together with a 4% annual allowance.
## Goodwill
The write-off of any goodwill is not allowed for tax purposes.
## Start-up expenses
It is departmental practice to not allow the deduction of any start-up expenses.
## Interest expenses
Interest is deductible as long as it is incurred in the production of income.
## Bad debt
Eswatini does allow a deduction for bad debts, subject to the Commissioner's approval and provided that the debts were included in the taxpayer's income in the year of assessment or in years past.
## Charitable contributions
Subject to the Commissioner's approval in regard to the amount allowable as a deduction in the year of grant and subsequent years, Eswatini allows a deduction for, among other things, grants made to the government for the building of schools and hospitals.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties resulting from late payment of any tax or levied as payable under any Act administered by the Commissioner will be a non-deductible expense.
## Taxes
Taxes are not deductible.
## Net operating losses
Losses may not be carried back but may be carried forward for as long as trading continues (i.e. indefinitely). If any break in trading occurs, however, the losses are forfeited.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Deductions may be claimed for payments of management service fees, interest, and royalties to foreign affiliates, provided the payments are made under a written agreement, are reasonable, and receive exchange control approval for transfers outside the rand monetary area. Note that this approval is routinely given without any significant delay for *bona fide* transactions.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 15 August 2024
Income tax on registered branch profits is calculated as for a resident company, and a branch profits tax of 15% is assessed for deemed repatriated income. In practice, however, branches are rare since most foreign companies incorporate local subsidiary companies.
|  | SZL |
| --- | --- |
| Net profit before tax | 100.00 |
| Tax @ 27.5% | (27.50) |
| Repatriated income | 72.50 |

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 15 August 2024
Residence is not specifically defined, but effectively anyone in employment or business in Eswatini will be regarded as resident for tax purposes. Work permits are required for non-citizens to take up employment in Eswatini, and, as such, expatriates who work under a permit held by their employers or who are self-employed are deemed to be resident for tax purposes.
