# Lao PDR
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 07 February 2025
The PT calculation is based on an entity's actual accounting profits, prepared in accordance with the Lao Accounting Manual, and adjusted for tax purposes. The Lao PDR tax regulations are silent on the treatment of many items. Generally, in such cases, the tax treatment will follow the accounting treatment. Some of the more common differences are depreciation, entertainment expenses, and the non-deductibility of certain reserves and provisions (until actually paid).
## Inventory valuation
Inventory valuation for tax purposes follows the method used for accounting purposes in Lao PDR. All allowances are non-deductible expenses.
## Capital gains
There is no separate tax on capital gains in Lao PDR. However, profits from the sale of shares are subject to tax at the rate of 2% of the selling price.
There is no tax on the gain on sale of shares listed in the LSX.
The buyer of shares, except shares listed in the LSX, is required to withhold and remit the tax.
The rate of income tax on sales or transfers of real property are as follows:
## Dividend income
Dividends (including share in partnership income) received are taxed at a flat rate of 10%. Dividends distributed by companies listed in the LSX are exempt from tax.
## Interest income
Interest income (except exempt interest income) shall be appropriately subject to income tax of 10%. Exempt interest income includes:
## Rental/royalty income
Rental and royalty income are appropriately subject to income tax at the flat rate of 10% and 5%, respectively.
## Unrealised exchange gains/losses
Unrealised exchange gains are not taxable, and losses are not deductible.
## Foreign income
Companies registered under Lao PDR laws are taxed on their worldwide income. Foreign income derived from a treaty country is taxed according to the applicable DTT.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 07 February 2025
WHT is applied to various types of payments made to domestic and foreign recipients.
| Payment | WHT rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Dividend (including distribution of partnership income) | 10 |
| --- | --- |
| Interest from lending activities (non-bank) and guarantee fees | 10 |
| Profit from sale of shares | 2 |
| Prizes and lottery prizes in cash and kind | 5 |
| Royalty | 5 |
| Sale or transfer of real property | 2 |
| Commission and consultancy fees | 5 |
Lao PDR has DTTs with the following countries, and WHT rates under the treaties are as follows:
| Recipient | WHT (%) | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dividends | Interest | Royalties |
| Brunei | 5/10 (1) | 10 | 10 |
| China | 5 | 5 | 5 |
| Indonesia | 10 | 10 | 10 |
| Luxembourg | 5/15 (2) | 10 | 5 |
| Malaysia | 5/10 (1) | 10 | 10 |
| Myanmar | 5 | 10 | 10 |
| North Korea | 10 | 10 | 5 |
| Russia | 10 | 10 | 0 |
| Singapore | 5/8 (3) | 5 | 5 |
| Thailand | 15 | 10/15 (4) | 15 |
| Vietnam | 10 | 10 | 10 |
Notes
1. 5% if the company directly holds at least 10% of the capital of the company paying the dividend; 10% in all other cases.
2. 5% if the company directly holds at least 10% of the capital of the company paying the dividend; 15% in all other cases.
3. 5% if the company directly holds at least 10% of the capital of the company paying the dividend; 8% in all other cases.
4. 10% if received by financial institutions (including insurance companies); 15% in all other cases.
## Foreign withholding tax (FWHT)
An FWHT applies where a registered entity in Lao PDR contracts with a foreign supplier of goods and services not registered in Lao PDR regardless of whether the services are provided in Lao PDR or outside Lao PDR. The FWHT comprises both a PT and VAT (on services only) element and is the final tax on the foreign supplier. The FWHT withholding and filing obligation rests with the Lao PDR customer, and it is applied before payment to the foreign supplier.
For foreign suppliers, PT must be withheld at a deemed percentage of taxable turnover. The deemed rates are determined according to the nature of the contract or activity.
| Activity | Deemed profit margin (% of business revenue) | Deemed PT rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agricultural manufacturing and handicraft production | 7 | 1.4 |
| Industrial production and other processing industries | 10 | 2 |
| Commerce and services | 15 | 3 |
These PT rates are then added to the VAT at 10% (if applicable) to determine the total FWHT. For example, a professional fee of LAK 100,000 would result in a total FWHT of LAK 13,000 (i.e. withholding PT of LAK 3,000 and withholding VAT of LAK 10,000).

# Lao PDR
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 07 February 2025
## Profit tax (PT)
All companies (including all forms of legal entities, like partnerships) that are registered under Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) law are subject to PT on their worldwide income. Companies formed under foreign law, operating a business in Lao PDR, and conducting business in Lao PDR are subject to tax on their income derived in Lao PDR.
The standard rate of PT for companies in Lao PDR is as follows, calculated on net profit after adjustments for non-taxable income, non-deductible expenses, and others in accordance with the Lao Income Tax Law:
| Types of companies | PT rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Companies listed in the Lao Securities Exchange (LSX): For the first four years from registration | 13 (previously 19) |
| Companies that produce, import, and distribute tobacco products (2% to be contributed to the Tobacco Control Fund) | 22 (previously 26) |
| Companies in the mineral industry with concession agreement | 35 |
| Companies using green technology | 7 |
| All other companies, both domestic and foreign | 20 (previously 24) |
## Lump-sum tax
The lump-sum tax is imposed on companies with small and medium businesses (400 million Lao kip [LAK] or less) that do not maintain Lao accounting books and derive income that is not subject to income tax pursuant to the Lao Tax Law. The lump-sum tax is paid in lieu of the PT, based on an agreement with the tax office; consequently, the lump-sum tax is regarded as a tax within the PT category. The lump-sum tax rates are as follows:
| Annual turnover (LAK) | Lump-sum tax rate (%) | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Manufacturing, agriculture, and other processing industries | Commerce | Services |
| 50 million or less (previously less than 12 million) | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| More than 50 million to 400 million | 1 (previously 3 to 5) | 2 (previously 4 to 6) | 3 (previously 5 to 7) |
## Local income taxes
There are no provincial or local income taxes in Lao PDR.

# Lao PDR
## Overview
Last reviewed - 07 February 2025
Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), a landlocked country in Southeast Asia, is bordered by Myanmar and China to the northwest, Vietnam to the east, Cambodia to the south, and Thailand to the west. Lao PDR is ruled by a single party Communist government. It was a former French colony that gained independence in 1954. The population is approximately 7 million, with most living in rural areas. Lao is the official language, with French still utilised in some parts of the capital of Vientiane. Thai is also common along the border areas and in the capital. The official currency of Lao PDR is the kip (LAK), but the Thai baht (THB) and United States dollar (USD) are also common in many border areas. Recently the Bank of Lao PDR issue the regulation to accept Chinese Yuan as a official currency.
The major industries in Lao PDR are mining, hydro power, agriculture, and light manufacturing. There has been significant foreign investment in the hydro power and mining industries. Lao PDR's major trading partners (i.e. foreign investors) are Thailand, China, and Vietnam.
The government has instituted several measures to encourage foreign investments and increase private investment. The Lao Securities Exchange opened on 10 October 2010 and the first day of trade was 11 January 2011. As of 31 December 2016, there are ten listed companies. Lao PDR is a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the World Trade Organization (WTO).

# Lao PDR
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 07 February 2025
## Taxable period
PT is determined on a calendar-year basis.
## Tax returns and payment of tax
Employers must withhold the PIT payable from their employees' salaries each month and submit the PIT declaration and payment before the 20th (previously 15th) day of the following month.
Employees are now required to obtain a Tax Identification Number (TIN) and file annual PIT returns by 31 March of the following year. If any additional PIT should be paid, the PIT should be paid within 15 working days from the date that the tax authority issues the tax payment form. If the total monthly PIT paid is more than the annual PIT, the tax authority should refund the excess PIT within 10 working days.
For individuals who are subject to PT, the tax return is due, and the tax is payable, based on the agreement with the tax authority.
### Penalties
Some of the penalties are as follows:
## Tax audit process
In practice, the tax authorities will audit the individuals subject to PT after the annual tax filing and issue tax payment certificates to the individuals after they complete their audit process.
## Statute of limitations
Generally, the tax department has the right to audit within three accounting years.
There are no areas of special focus in tax examinations in Lao PDR.

# Lao PDR
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 07 February 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT of 10% generally applies on the following activities:
The supply and importation of certain goods and services are exempt from VAT, including unprocessed agricultural products, seeds, fertilisers, equipment for agricultural purposes, international transportation services, educational goods and services, certain medical goods and services, certain bank services, and financial institution services.
Exports of goods are zero-rated, except the export of natural resources that are not finished goods, which are subject to 10% VAT.
The conventional credit method is used to calculate the VAT payable (i.e. output VAT less allowable input VAT). Input VAT can be claimed within three months from the date incurred. Input VAT incurred in relation to the supply of goods for exports may be refundable.
There is no concept of export services in the VAT Law. It appears that all services from all sources are subject to the standard VAT of 10%.
Companies who register an enterprise and obtain their taxpayer identification number (TIN) and/or get investment approval from the relevant authorities shall automatically be registered in the VAT system, except for the micro enterprises.
One unique feature of the Lao PDR VAT is that VAT is imposed on the services rendered by overseas service providers to domestic service users. Domestic service users have an obligation to withhold VAT on the service fees paid to overseas service providers and pay the VAT to the tax authority. The rate of withholding VAT is 10%.
If a company has transactions with a supplier that is not registered in the VAT system or doesn't receive the VAT certificate from the supplier (both corporate and individual), the company should contact the tax authority to make the VAT payment VAT. Such VAT can be utilised as input VAT.
On 26 March 2024, Instruction 0558/MoF dated 14 February 2024 was published in the Official Gazette, replacing Notification 0541/MoF dated 24 February 2022. The Instruction introduces significant changes, especially concerning the VAT obligations of overseas suppliers providing goods or services via digital platforms in Laos.
An overseas supplier must:
The Lao tax authorities are identifying non-registered overseas suppliers as part of effectively implementing this Instruction. Non-compliance with this Instruction may result in a warning, fines, or temporary suspension of digital service channels. Penalties will be decided on a case-by-case basis.
## Import duties
Lao PDR has adopted the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) valuation principles.
Duty rates are based on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) harmonised tariff nomenclature for imports from ASEAN member countries (ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement [ATIGA]).
Lao PDR has also signed free trade agreements (FTAs) with ASEAN dialogue countries: Australia and New Zealand (under their Closer Economic Relations FTA), China, India, Japan, and Korea; otherwise, normal rates are applied. Duty rates range between 0% and 40%, depending on whether the goods are from an ASEAN country or another country.
## Excise taxes
## Property taxes
The land tax is based on both the location and the size of the land and is levied at annual rates per square metre.
## Transfer taxes
There are no transfer taxes in Lao PDR.
## Stamp taxes
The stamp taxes in Lao PDR range from LAK 2,000 to LAK 20,000, depending on the types of documents.
## Payroll taxes
Income from salaries and wages, including allowances, over-time pay, bonuses, meeting allowances for members of the executive board of the companies, and other benefits received in cash and in kind, is subject to income tax withholding by employers at the progressive rates ranging from 0% to 25% (previously 24%). Personal income tax (PIT) is calculated based on gross revenue, on a monthly basis, and is recalculated again on an annual basis.
## Social Security Scheme contributions
The government is encouraging all enterprises to register themselves and their employees in the Social Security Scheme and make contributions to the scheme. Both the enterprise and its employees are obligated to contribute to the Social Security Scheme a combined 11.5% of the employees’ basic salaries or wages. The enterprise contributes 6%, and each employee contributes 5.5%.
According to Notification No. 0824/NSSFO issued by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, the basic amount for Social Security Scheme calculation is LAK 4.5 million.
The Social Security Scheme contribution shall be paid by the 20th (previously 15th) day of the following month.
## Environmental tax
Under the Lao Tax Law, environmental tax is imposed on companies operating a business involving certain prescribed activities that are considered to cause pollution; damage the health and lives of any human, animal, or plant; or disrupt the balance of the ecosystem. The taxable amount and tax rate depend on the business activity.
## Fees and administrative charges
Under the Lao Tax Law, government sectors can collect fees for issuing fiscal licences, business licences, permits, visas, advertisement boards, broadcasting rights, and other services. The charges and service fees are set periodically by Presidential Decree.

# Lao PDR
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 07 February 2025
## Taxable period
PT is determined on a calendar-year basis.
## Tax returns
According to the Lao Tax Law, the annual tax return is due by 20 January (previously 10 January) of the subsequent year, and the filing of the financial statements is due by 31 March of the following year. Submission of the financial statements will generally be followed by an audit by the Tax Department.
## Payment of tax
PT is payable twice a year in advance, with a final payment (if any) after the tax assessment. The first two payments must be paid by 20 July of the current tax year and 20 January of the subsequent year. The final payment (if any) is due 15 working days after the tax assessment. The first two payments are either based on the actual or prior year's PT (or expected tax for the current year). Any excess PT payment can be carried forward to the subsequent year.
### Penalties
Some of the penalties are as follows:
## Tax audit process
In practice, the tax authorities will audit the company after the annual tax filing and issue a tax payment certificate to the company after they complete their audit process. Most large companies (i.e. assets of more than LAK 5 billion) are audited.
## Statute of limitations
Generally, the tax department has the right to audit within three accounting years.
There are no areas of special focus in tax examinations in Lao PDR.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 07 February 2025
There is no definition of residence or permanent establishment (PE) provided in the Lao Tax Law, as well as the Value Added Tax Law (VAT Law).xml:namespace prefix = "o" /
According to the double tax treaties (DTTs) of Lao PDR, ‘permanent establishment’ generally means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on.
Currently, the government is reassessing tax privileges and DTTs that they have offered to some businesses/signed with some countries in the past, and they have planned to cancel some; however, this is not yet final.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 07 February 2025
Generally, business expenses (including accrued expenses) are deductible unless specifically indicated as non-deductible under the Lao Income Tax Law. Reserves and provisions are not deductible until actually incurred, with certain exceptions (*see* *Provisions* *below for more information*).
## Depreciation
Depreciation rates prescribed under the Lao Tax Law may differ from financial accounting. Depreciation shall commence from acquisition date. Depreciation may be calculated on the cost of a business asset by straight-line, double-declining, or activity-based methods over the prescribed useful lives, as follows:
| Assets | Years |
| --- | --- |
| Buildings used for industrial purposes: |  |
| With useful life of 20 years or less | 20 |
| With useful life over 20 years | 50 |
| Buildings used for commercial and residential purposes: |  |
| Permanent structures | 20 |
| Semi-permanent structures | 10 |
| Machinery, equipment, vehicles | 5 |
| Software | 5 |
| Land and water transport vehicles | 5 |
| Ships, cruises, ferries, and other similar boats | 10 |
| Office equipment | 5 |
| Passenger and cargo aeroplanes | Based on flight hours |
## Goodwill
There is no specific guidance on the deductibility of the amortisation of goodwill. However, the Lao Income Tax Law states that depreciation of intangible assets with undetermined useful life is not allowed.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses can be amortised over a two-year period.
## Interest expenses
Interest that is not capital in nature is generally deductible, subject to certain conditions.
## Provisions
Provisions for expenses not yet incurred and reserves (e.g. bad debts) are not tax-deductible. A deduction for bad debts is allowed if a certain procedure has been followed.
Provisions entered by banks or other financial institutions based on the accounting standards and requirements of Bank of Lao PDR can be claimed as tax deductions.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions are not deductible.
## Entertainment expenses
Entertainment expenses are not deductible.
## Pension expenses
Pension expenses are deductible.
## Bribes, kickbacks, and illegal payments
Bribes, kickbacks, and illegal payments are not deductible.
## Fines and penalties
Generally, fines and penalties are not deductible.
## Taxes
Taxes levied on income and VAT on fixed assets used in the business are not deductible for PT purposes.
## Net operating and capital losses
Tax losses accepted by the authority may be carried forward for five years (previously three years) but need independently audited financial statements. A change in control will not impact a company's loss carryforward. Capital losses are treated as ordinary losses.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Subject to the normal and specific rules on deductibility, a deduction may be claimed for payments to foreign affiliates.

A credit is not allowed for foreign tax paid on foreign income. However, certain DTTs have provisions for either deductibility or credit of foreign tax.

PT incentives are provided under the Investment Law for investments in the prescribed business activities (concession businesses), subject to certain conditions. The law divides the investment areas into three zones. The PT exemptions are as follows:
| Zone | Areas | PT exemption (years) | Additional PT exemption (years)\* |

\* Applicable to investment in the following concession businesses set out in item 2, 3, 5, and 6 of Article 9 of the Investment Law, as follows:
The PT exemption period may be extended by one more accounting year if the company re-invests its net profits to expand its business.
PT exemption starts from the date the investing enterprise starts generating business revenue.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 07 February 2025
There is no definition of residence provided in the Lao Income Tax Law.
It is understood that the reason for having no definition of residence in the law is because there is PT or PIT levied on income derived by foreign individuals in Lao PDR.
