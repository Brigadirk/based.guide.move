# Ecuador
## Overview
Last reviewed - 06 September 2024
Ecuador is located on the Northwest Coast of South America, bordering the Pacific Ocean between Colombia and Peru.
Ecuador was a part of the northern Inca Empire until Spanish conquest in 1533. Quito, as it was called then, became a seat of Spanish colonial government in 1563 and part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada in 1717. The territories of the Viceroyalty (i.e. New Granada [Colombia], Venezuela, and Quito) gained their independence between 1819 and 1822 and formed a federation known as Gran Colombia. When Quito withdrew in 1830, the traditional name was changed to 'Republic of Ecuador'. In September 2008, voters approved a new constitution, which was Ecuador's 20th since gaining independence.
The Republic of Ecuador is divided into 24 provinces, with Quito as its capital. The official language of Ecuador is Spanish.
In March 2000, Congress approved a series of structural reforms that provided for the adoption of the United States dollar (USD) as legal currency. Dollarisation stabilised the economy, and positive growth occurred in the following years mainly because of high oil prices and increased non-traditional exports.
Ecuador is substantially dependent on its petroleum resources, which have accounted for more than half of the country's export earnings and one-fourth of the public sector revenues in recent years.
Ecuador has been experiencing fluctuating growth over the last few years. According to the Ecuadorian Central Bank, the economy reached a growth rate of -9.1% in 2020 (COVID-19 impact), 4.5% in 2021, 3.8% in 2022, and 2.4% in 2023. According to forecasts, the annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 2024 is estimated to be around 0.8% to 0.9%.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 06 September 2024
Dividends paid to non-resident entities are generally subject to WHT.
The WHT rate upon dividend distribution is 25% over 40% of the distributed amount, or 37% if the Ecuadorian company has not duly disclosed its ownership structure before the Ecuadorian tax authorities.
Revenues from occasional services provided by non-resident individuals are levied at 25% WHT. Payments made abroad to non-resident individuals and companies are subject to a 25% WHT. Other payments made abroad, other than dividends or profits to neutral jurisdictions, are subject to a 25% WHT.
The Internal Revenue Service of Ecuador establishes WHT percentages on local payments, which are not greater than 10%. Current rates are 1%, 1.75%, 2%, 2.75%, 8%, and 10% withholding. Specifically:
The tax administration will appoint the taxpayers that must act as income tax withholding agents via Resolution.
## Tax treaties
Benefits from tax treaties can be applied automatically from 29 November 2021 onwards, according to the latest tax reform (treaty benefits were previously limited to a specific amount of USD 560,000 per year and supplier, the WHT on the excess was subject to refund by the tax authority).
As a member of the Andean Community, Ecuador has adopted Decision 578, which provides relief from double taxation for individual or company members. Furthermore, Ecuador has similar tax treaties with the countries provided in the table below.

## Social security contributions
Social security contributions must be paid to the Ecuadorian Social Security System. There are two different rates, according to the individuals' employment relationship.
Private employees under a labour relationship will contribute at the rate of 9.45% of remuneration arising from employment (except certain statutory social benefits received). Special rates apply to employees working on special sectors of the economy. Voluntary contributors must pay a rate of 17.6% over their income.
The employer contribution amounts to 12.15% of total remuneration.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
No VAT applies on employment services under a labour relationship. Personal services provided under a professional fee contract relationship are subject to VAT at 15%, which, when provided to companies, is subject to 100% withholding by them.
Professionals are required to file VAT returns.
## Municipal taxes
### Municipal asset tax
The municipal asset tax is levied on all individuals and companies required to keep accounting records in accordance with Ecuadorian tax legislation. This tax is levied annually at a rate of 1.5 per thousand (or 0.15%) of total assets less current and contingent liabilities, as shown on the balance sheet.
### Municipal real estate tax
The city governments assess an annual municipal property tax, which ranges between 0.25 per thousand and 5 per thousand (0.025% to 0.5%) of the commercial value of the property, as determined by valuation carried out by the city government, for both urban and rural properties (rural property is taxed at a maximum of 0.3%).

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 06 September 2024
Resident entities are taxed on their worldwide income. Non-resident entities are subject to tax on Ecuadorian-source income only.
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are in force for all entities. Local tax authorities have established that for corporate income tax (CIT) purposes, and corresponding pre-payments, companies are obligated to follow these accounting principles.
Taxes on corporate income are levied at the following rates:
| Type of income | CIT rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Distributed or undistributed profits of local corporations and branches | 22, 25, or 28 |
Ecuadorian companies owned by residents or non-residents located in non-tax-haven jurisdictions are subject to a 22% or 25% CIT rate. The general CIT rate is 25%; however, a 28% rate should apply if non-resident shareholders are located in a tax haven jurisdiction and additionally there is an Ecuadorian individual shareholder in the ownership structure. Such increase is also applicable when the company's ownership structure is not duly disclosed before the Ecuadorian tax authorities.
A reduced CIT rate (from 3% to 5% benefit) exists for new investments to the extent some conditions are met.
## Temporary security contribution
Ecuadorian companies and permanent establishments (PEs) that obtained taxable income in the fiscal year 2022 are subjected to a 3.25% contribution, based on the taxable profits of such year. The deadline for the payment of the contribution is 31 March 2024 and 2025.
The contribution will not be deductible for income tax computation purposes, and the lack of payment within the deadline will result in a penalty equivalent to 3% of the obligation per month plus the corresponding interests.
## Temporary contribution on profits of banks and credit unions
A temporary contribution applies for banks and credit unions that are tax residents in Ecuador and obtained taxable profits in the 2023 fiscal year. The deadline for the payment is 31 May 2024.
The percentage rate varies on the taxable profits, from 5% (for profits below 5 million United States dollars [USD]) to 25% (for those exceeding USD 100 million).
The contribution will not be deductible for income tax purposes, and the lack of payment is subject to fines and penalties similar to the contribution for companies.
## Single income tax on sports betting operators *(Impuesto a la Renta Único a los Operadores de Pronósticos Deportivos)*
## Local income taxes
No local or provincial government taxes on income are imposed on companies.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 06 September 2024
Ecuador currently taxes its citizens and foreigners mostly on their Ecuador-source income, which is defined as any income derived from activities executed in Ecuador, regardless of where the income is received or paid.
Income generated abroad by Ecuador-resident individuals, local or foreign, is taxable. Income tax credit is granted up to the income tax attributable to such income in Ecuador.
Non-residents are subject to tax on their Ecuador-source income regardless of their domicile or place of residence. Non-residents are subject to 25% income tax on income received from local sources, which is withheld at source. Payments made to non-residents occasionally working in Ecuador, when not charged to an Ecuadorian company or branch of a foreign entity, do not give rise to income tax. Foreigners with resident visas are subject to income tax on any earnings and are not entitled to exclusion of income for periods of temporary absence from Ecuador.
## Personal income tax rates
The personal income tax (PIT) table applicable for year 2024 is as follows:
| Taxable income (USD\*) | | Tax on column 1 (USD) | Tax on excess (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over (column 1) | Not over |
| 0 | 11,902 | 0 | 0 |
| 11,902 | 15,159 | 0 | 5 |
| 15,159 | 19,682 | 163 | 10 |
| 19,682 | 26,031 | 615 | 12 |
| 26,031 | 34,255 | 1,377 | 15 |
| 34,255 | 45,407 | 2,611 | 20 |
| 45,407 | 60,450 | 4,841 | 25 |
| 60,450 | 80,605 | 8,602 | 30 |
| 80,605 | 107,199 | 14,648 | 35 |
| 107,199 | onwards | 23,956 | 37 |
\* United States dollars
## Local taxes on income
There are no local (provincial, county, or municipal) taxes on income.
Note that any individual who performs an economic activity, without a labour relationship, must obtain the commercial registry or ‘*patente municipal*’. Professionals must pay this tax ranging from USD 10 to USD 700, depending on their economic activity and the condition of being required to keep accounting records or not.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 06 September 2024
## Taxable period
The fiscal year is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Annual tax returns should not be filed if the taxpayer's income does not exceed the non-taxable base (i.e. USD 11,902 for fiscal year 2024). The employer's annual withholding return is considered the employee's income tax return. If taxable income is obtained from other sources, or from more than one employer, the employer must consolidate both incomes in a single annual return.
Individuals who end their economic activity prior to the end of the fiscal year are required to file their corresponding income tax return upon termination of their activities. Once this return is filed, the individual must cancel the Tax Identification Number (TIN) connected with their own activity within 30 days of termination.
## Payment of tax
In the case of employees, there is mandatory monthly withholding by the employer as long as the total annual net income exceeds the non-taxable base of USD 11,902. The filing date is determined by the ninth digit of the individual’s TIN.
Other individuals must file their income tax return in March of the following year.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 06 September 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is levied at the rates of either 15% or 0% on the transfer of goods, import of goods, and the rendering of services, as well as on services rendered within the country or imported. Royalties and intangible property, imported or locally paid, are also levied with a 15% VAT.
The following transactions are exempt from VAT:
Goods and services that are subject to the 0% rate are explicitly listed in the law.
Among others, the following goods are taxed at a 0% rate upon either importation or local transfer of ownership:
Among others, the following services are taxed at a 0% rate:
The 15% VAT paid on imports and local purchases can be deducted from the 15% VAT charged on sales or services rendered. VAT paid on raw materials, fixed assets, or components required for the production of goods or rendering of services is also creditable when the final product is considered taxable at 15%. Input VAT can be deducted/offset within a period of five years.
VAT paid on raw materials, services, components, or fixed assets necessary for production of export goods is recoverable.
The 15% VAT paid in the acquisition of goods and services utilised for the production or rendering of services levied at 0% VAT is not creditable. Therefore, it will be considered as part of the cost.
Companies appointed as 'special taxpayers' are required to withhold 30% and 70% of VAT paid on the purchase of goods and services, respectively. On purchases made to professionals, 100% VAT must be withheld. When the transaction is carried out between two ‘special taxpayers’, VAT withholding rates are reduced to 10% (goods) and 20% (services). The tax administration will appoint the taxpayers that must act as VAT withholding agents through a Resolution.
For importation of services, 15% VAT must be self-assessed and withheld at 100% by the local entity. This VAT is creditable.
Since 2020, the importation of digital services is levied with 15% VAT.
Exporters of services may request refund of input VAT.
Additionally, as of March 2024, the VAT rate for local transfers of construction materials is 5%.
## Customs duties
Since Ecuador is a member of the Andean Community, goods to be imported are classified under the Common Nomenclature of the Andean Countries participating in the Cartagena’s Agreement (NANDINA) Pact, which is based on the Customs Cooperation Council Nomenclature (also known as the Brussels tariff nomenclature). Most consumer goods imports pay 25%, while intermediate goods are usually imported at a 10% or 15% rate. Raw materials and capital goods generally pay 0% to 5%. Ecuador has negotiated exceptions under the Andean common tariff that allow lower duties on certain capital goods and industrial inputs. There is duty-free import of agricultural goods and equipment.
The price listed on the commercial bill or invoice is the basis for the assessment of duties, except when the Ecuadorian Central Bank (ECB) considers the listed price unreasonable, in which case market prices in arm's-length transactions will be used. The burden of proof lies with the importer.
In addition to import duties, all imports are subject to 12% VAT and other minor taxes that do not exceed 1%. Charges are based on the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) value of the merchandise.
All Ecuadorian imports and exports are subject to inspection by authorised international verification companies operating in the country (there are some imports exempt from verification). Goods are appraised for value, quantity, quality, and weight at the port of origin.
Since 2017, a commercial agreement between the European Union (EU) and Ecuador is in place, which provides relief on duties upon the importation of certain goods.
The Free Trade Zone regime is subjected to the following general regulations, among others:
## Special consumption tax (*Impuesto a los Consumos Especiales* or ICE)
ICE is imposed on domestic and imported goods that are explicitly listed in the law, including plastic bags and sugared, non-alcoholic, and carbonated drinks, among others. This tax is levied at a progressive rate from 5% to 35% on certain automobiles and 10% on airplanes, helicopters, and boats. The taxable basis on cigarettes and alcoholic beverages is obtained by the number of produced or imported cigarettes or degrees of alcohol, respectively.
## Foreign assets tax (*Impuesto a los Activos en el Exterior*)
The tax base for the foreign assets tax is the average monthly balance of cash deposits held in foreign entities by private entities registered in the stock market and regulated by the Superintendent of Banks and Companies. The monthly tax rate is 0.25% (0.37% for assets held in tax haven jurisdictions).
## Remittance tax (*Impuesto a la Salida de Divisas*)
Remittance tax is imposed on the transfer of money abroad in cash or through pay checks, transfers, or courier of any nature carried out with or without the mediation of the Ecuadorian financial system, including transfer from foreign bank accounts. Dividends and foreign loans may be exempt from this tax under certain considerations.
In January 2022, the remittance tax rate of 5% was reduced progressively. As of December 2023, the rate was 3.5%, expected to be reduced to 2% in 2024. Notwithstanding the above, as of 1 April 2024, the 5% rate was reintroduced.
## Stamp taxes
No stamp taxes are levied in Ecuador.
## Payroll taxes
There are no additional payroll taxes applicable other than Social Security contributions (*see below*).
## Social Security contributions
Employers and employees pay contributions to the Social Security at the rates of 12.15% and 9.45%, respectively, on the minimum monthly taxable wages as established for the different contributing categories by the Social Security. Such categories are revised annually.
## Labour profit sharing
Although it is not considered a tax, companies are obligated to pay 15% of their pre-tax earnings to their employees. This payment is considered a deductible expense for CIT computation purposes.
## Redeemable Tax on Non-Returnable Plastic Bottles
A tax is levied on the bottling of beverages in non-returnable plastic bottles utilised for containing alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, carbonated and non-carbonated beverages, and water. In the case of imported beverages, this tax is levied upon their customs clearance.
For each plastic bottle levied with this tax, the rate is up to USD 0.02 per plastic bottle. This amount is fully reimbursed to whoever collects, delivers, and returns the bottles.
Taxpayers of this tax are the bottlers of drinks contained in plastic bottles and importers of drinks in plastic bottles.
Milk products and medicines filled in plastic bottles are exempt from this tax.
This tax is not considered as a deductible expense for CIT purposes.
## Municipal taxes
### Business permit tax
City governments assess an annual municipal permit tax levied on all individuals and companies that carry out economic activities within the municipal jurisdiction. The tax rate is based on the equity of the taxpayer, where the minimum payable amount is USD 10 and the maximum cannot exceed USD 25,000 per year.
### Municipal assets tax
The municipal assets tax is levied on all individuals and companies required to keep accounting records in accordance with Ecuadorian tax legislation. This tax is levied annually at a rate of 1.5 per thousand (or 0.15%) of total assets less current and contingent liabilities, as shown on the balance sheet.
### Municipal real estate tax
The city governments assess an annual municipal property tax, which ranges between 0.25 per thousand and 5 per thousand (0.025% to 0.5%) of the commercial value of the property, as determined by valuation carried out by the city government, for both urban and rural properties (rural property is taxed at a maximum of 0.3%).

# Ecuador
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 06 September 2024
## Taxable period
The fiscal year is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
The tax system operates on the basis of self-assessment, with subsequent inspection by the tax authorities.
Tax filing deadlines begin on 9 April and continue up to 28 April. The tax return due dates are determined by the ninth digit of the company’s Tax Identification Number (TIN) and taxpayer classification defined by the tax authority.
## Payment of tax
Local tax authorities have established that for CIT purposes, and its pre-payments, companies are obligated to follow IFRS accounting principles.
In general terms, most companies are required to keep accounting records and are allowed to make voluntary CIT prepayments based on the following calculation: 50% of the previous year CIT due less income tax withholding applied in such fiscal year.
The final CIT payment is due between 9 April and 28 April.
### Self-withholding applicable to major taxpayers
As of January 2024, major taxpayers duly qualified by the IRS are required to file and pay self-withholding income tax based on their monthly taxable income. Percentage is determined by the IRS for each taxpayer through resolution and may vary from 1% to 10%.
## Tax audit process
In general terms, tax authorities look at the consistency of the information delivered by the taxpayers and information reported by third parties. Tax authorities can issue communications in order to require explanations on any detected inconsistency. Additionally, accounting inspections can be performed.
## Statute of limitations
Fiscal authorities have four years from the date of filing to start proceedings for tax audits or assessment and collection of taxes.
The statute of limitations is extended from four to six years if the corresponding tax returns have not been filed. A tax audit can be reopened, verified, or amended within one year from the date of completion.
Tax authorities usually focus on substance, formal compliance requirements, and consistency of information filed.

Social security contributions must be paid to the Ecuadorian Social Security System. There are two different rates, according to the individuals' employment relationship.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 06 September 2024
Corporate residence is determined by the place of incorporation. For foreign branches, it is the place stated in the domiciliary deed.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
According to the local tax legislation, a company can be deemed to have a PE in Ecuador if it maintains any place or fixed centre, within the country, in which a foreign company develops all or part of its activities.
The corresponding regulations point out that a PE also exists when a foreign company maintains, within the country, a person or an entity that acts on its behalf and habitually exercises an economic activity. It contemplates several instances where this is applicable, among them:

# Ecuador
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 06 September 2024
As a general rule, payments on operations that exceed USD 500 should be made through an institution of the financial system; otherwise, such operations will become non-deductible.
## Depreciation and amortisation
Straight-line depreciation applies at rates specified by law. The Director of the Internal Revenue Service (*Servicio de Rentas Internas* or IRS) of Ecuador can authorise higher depreciation rates in cases such as obsolescence, excessive use, and faster than expected wear-out of assets.
Annual depreciation rates are as follows:
| Asset | Depreciation rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Real estate (except land), aircraft, naval crafts, and similar property | 5 |
| Facilities, machinery, equipment, and furniture | 10 |
| Vehicles, trucks, and tractors used for construction | 20 |
| Computer equipment and software | 33.33 |
Depreciation rates apply to the cost of assets.
In the case of vehicles, if, at the time of purchase of the vehicle, its appraisal exceeds USD 35,000, the deductions for depreciation, leasing payments, interests paid for the acquisition, and vehicle property taxes will not be allowed. Some exceptions apply.
Intangible assets are amortised either within the terms specified in the contract or over a 20-year period.
## Goodwill
Goodwill cannot be amortised in Ecuador, but there are limited exceptions.
## Organisational and start-up expenses
Organisation, experimentation, and pre-operational expenses can be amortised over five years at the rate of 20% per year.
## Interest expenses
Interest on debts incurred for business purposes are deductible.
In general, foreign loan interests are deductible for CIT purposes to the extent that the credits are registered before the ECB and the interest rates do not exceed the referential rates established by the ECB.
Interest paid for loans granted by a non-registered related party are subject to WHT at 25% over the gross amount.
## Bad debt
If the bad debt provision is less than 1% of the portfolio granted in the year, it will be deductible. Any excess will be non-deductible.
## Charitable contributions
Payments for charitable contributions are non-deductible for CIT purposes.
## Fines and penalties
Interest, fines, and penalties imposed on late payments of any tax obligation are not deductible for CIT calculation purposes.
## Taxes
Taxes, rates, and levies related to the generation of taxable income, as well as contributions to the Social Security system, are deductible.
## Other significant items
Advertising, pension plans, severance, travel, and foreign related-party expenses are subject to deductibility limits.
## Net operating losses
The carryforward of losses is allowed to a maximum of five years, with an amortisation limit of 25% per year over the taxable base. There is no loss carryback.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
In most cases, payments made abroad are deductible, as long as income taxes have been withheld (at the rate of 25% or 37% over the taxable base) and do not exceed some maximum limits. Professional fees, royalties, commissions, or any payment made abroad is subject to WHT at a rate of 25% or 37% over the taxable base. Payments on imports are deductible and not subject to WHT.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 06 September 2024
Group taxation is not permitted in Ecuador.
## Transfer pricing
The transfer pricing regime in Ecuador is based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines. Related-party transactions must be carried out at arm’s length. Formal documentation requirements exist.
A regulation has established the procedures to apply for an Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) in regard to transfer pricing methods for related-party transactions. Accordingly, the taxpayer may submit a formal application for a binding rule.
## Thin capitalisation
A thin capitalisation rule applies for interest deductibility on loans granted by related parties equivalent to 20% of the fiscal year profit before taxes plus compulsory profit sharing, interest, depreciation, and amortisation expenses.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
A new tax regime for CFCs was introduced. Overall, a CFC is a non-resident entity that has: (i) at least one beneficial owner tax resident in Ecuador with an effective participation of 25% or more of the entity and (ii) an effective CIT rate lower than 15%.
Specific types of income obtained by the foreign entity will be attributable to the beneficial owner tax resident in Ecuador and, as such, must be included in the yearly income tax return. This regime is applicable as from 1 January 2024.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 06 September 2024
## Foreign tax credit
As of November 2021, foreign tax credit is allowed in Ecuador. The tax credit is equal to the tax paid abroad on the foreign income, up to the amount corresponding to the tax attributable to such income in Ecuador.
In May 2022, the ordinary imputation method was formally established by the tax authority by way of Resolution.
## Handicapped employees hiring incentive
An amount equivalent to 150% of remunerations of handicapped employees can be considered as an additional deduction for income tax calculation purposes. The deduction will apply over the excess of the minimum handicapped employees that the employer is required to hire.
## Environmental-friendly investments
Additional deductions can be applicable to investments in environmental-friendly assets.
## CIT rate reduction
A reduction of 3 points on the CIT rate is available for new productive investments executed after the Organic Law for Economic Development and fiscal sustainability after the COVID-19 pandemic for up to 15 years. A reduction of up to 5 points is available in case the taxpayer signs an Investment Agreement with the government.
## Tax credit on remittance tax paid
Remittance tax paid on imports of raw material and goods, included in a list issued by the Tax Policy Board, and used in productive activities can be considered as tax credit for CIT computation purposes.
Other remittance tax exemptions upon payments of capital and interests derived from foreign loans are available under certain conditions.
## Tax holiday of interest, fines, and surcharges on pending obligations
A tax holiday of 100% of interest, fines, and surcharges on obligations generated until 31 December 2023 was introduced. The effectiveness of the rule ended on 31 July 2024.
The rule applied on the total or partial payment of tax obligations generated until 31 December 2023.

## Decree Law for Family Economy
The Decree Law for Family Economy, in force since June 2023, incorporates reforms to the personal expenses regulations.
For individuals without dependants, the reduction amount for personal expenses is equivalent to 18% of the lower value between the personal expenses declared in the respective fiscal year and the value of the basic family basket multiplied by seven.
Likewise, for individuals with dependants, the amount of the personal expense reduction is equivalent to 18% of the lower amount between the personal expenses declared in the respective fiscal year and the basic family basket multiplied by the number of baskets corresponding to the number of dependants, according to the following table:
| Number of dependants | Number of basic family baskets |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 9 |
| 2 | 11 |
| 3 | 14 |
| 4 | 17 |
| 5 or more | 20 |
The Economic Efficiency and Employment Generation Law of December 2023 establishes that for individuals economically responsible for individuals with disabilities and catastrophic, rare, and/or orphan diseases the amount of the reduction for personal expenses will be equivalent to 18% of the lower value between the personal expenses reported in the respective fiscal year and the value of the basic family basket multiplied by 100.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 06 September 2024
## Employment expenses
Social security contributions are deductible against income arising from employment.
## Personal expenses
As of 2022, there is no longer a deduction for personal expenses; however, personal expenses will be considered for the tax discount or reduction (applicable before allocating tax credits).
## Personal allowances
An annual personal allowance of USD 11,902 represents the minimum taxable income in the current progressive PIT table, which means that an individual will pay income tax when one's income exceeds USD 11,902.
## Business deductions
Independent professionals are allowed to deduct their social security contributions as well as other business expenses.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 06 September 2024
For PIT purposes, it is necessary to differentiate between two main contractual relationships that may exist between a company and a person: labour and professional fee-based relationships.
A labour relationship exists where a person provides personal and legitimate services to a company under the provisions of the Labour Code. The employee is then under a labour contract, and the individual is included in the company's payroll, thus receiving a fixed monthly remuneration.
A professional fee-based relationship exists when an individual provides professional services to a company on a freelance basis or under a civil contract. This individual is not included in the company's payroll and is not subject to regulations established in the Labour Code. Usually this contractual relationship is used for independent contractors. Their remuneration will always be denominated as ‘fees’.
## Employment income
Residents (national or foreign) are taxed on their total labour compensation, net of social security contributions. Total compensation includes any payments in cash, kind, or services made by the employer. Allowances such as car, vacation travel, housing, and utilities (profit-shares) are considered taxable.
Individuals under labour relationship must exclude the Christmas Bonus (13th salary), as well as Educational Bonus (14th salary), from the taxable income (exclusions must be considered by the employer).
In cases where the employer pays PIT and social security contributions on account of an employee (net salaries), the income tax liability on the net salary is added only once to the total income to get the taxable base, and the social security deduction is not allowed.
## Independent professional gross income
Residents (national or foreign) are taxed on the total fees invoiced. Independent professionals are required to pay social security contributions.
## Capital gains
Capital gains (defined as those obtained in the sale of real estate and stock transactions) are levied with income tax. The financial yield on long-term investments (over 180 days) negotiated through the stock market is tax exempt, provided some conditions are met.
## Dividend income
Dividends received from local corporations are taxable.
## Interest income
Interest on savings accounts is tax exempt.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 06 September 2024
Since fiscal year 2015, an individual's tax residency in Ecuador is established in accordance with the conditions and criteria stated by tax regulations, which are focused on the individual's presence in Ecuador and on the individual’s economic and personal interests and activities.
Specifically, Ecuadorian tax residency is determined when the individual’s presence in Ecuador is greater than 183 days, including sporadic absences, calendar or not, consecutive or not, within the same fiscal year (or in a 12-month time period within two fiscal years). Other conditions may apply.
As of January 2024, a new ‘temporary tax residency’ regime is established for individuals without previous Ecuadorian tax residents status, provided some other conditions are met. Under this regime, the individual will pay income tax only on Ecuadorian-source income during a five-year term.
