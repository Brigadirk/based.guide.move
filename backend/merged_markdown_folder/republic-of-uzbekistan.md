## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Uzbekistan.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There are no inheritance, estate, and gift taxes in Uzbekistan. However, PIT may be payable by individuals receiving property by way of gifts, depending on the type of the property and its source.

The Tax Code provides excise tax rates for locally produced excise-liable goods as well as goods imported in the Republic of Uzbekistan, including tobacco and alcohol.

# Uzbekistan, Republic of
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 09 February 2025
## Inventory valuation
Uzbek legislation permits the application of the weighted average cost method (AVECO) and the first in first out (FIFO) method for the valuation of inventory for tax purposes.
## Capital gains
A capital gain is, generally, the difference between the sale price or amount realised for a business asset and its acquisition price, reduced by the incidental costs of sale and acquisition and depreciation costs. That said, there is no specific definition of capital gains in Uzbek tax legislation. The capital gain/loss is included in taxable profits by Uzbek legal entities and PEs of foreign legal entities.
## Dividend income
Dividends paid by a domestic subsidiary to: (i) a non-resident are subject to 10% WHT and (ii) a resident are subject to 5% WHT at the source. The net dividends received by its domestic parent company are then excluded from the parent’s CIT base. Such net dividends received by a foreign parent company are taxed in accordance with the respective country’s internal legislation or DTT provisions (if Uzbekistan has a DTT with this country).
Income of non-residents subject to WHT (including income in the form of dividends, interest, and royalties) is to be paid without withholding of WHT at source or with application of a reduced WHT rate as provided by a tax treaty, provided that there is a tax certificate confirming that non-residents are registered for tax purposes in the state with which Uzbekistan has the effective tax treaty (with certain exemptions).
For Uzbek legal entities paying out dividends, a new mechanism of tax credit was introduced to avoid cascade taxation of dividends.
Until 31 December 2028:
## Interest income
Interest income paid to non-residents is subject to WHT at the source at the rate of 10%. Such net interest income received by foreign companies is taxed in accordance with the respective country’s internal legislation or DTT provisions (if Uzbekistan has a DTT with this country). Similar to other types of income of non-residents subject to WHT (including income in the form of dividends and royalties), interest income is to be paid without withholding of WHT at source or with application of a reduced WHT rate by automatic application of a DTT, provided that there is a relevant residence certificate.
As per the Tax Code, as of 1 January 2020, interest paid to residents (except payments to non-profit and budget organisations) is not subject to taxation at source and should be included in the income of the recipients and is subject to taxation in the manner specified by the Tax Code.
Interest income of legal entities (both residents and non-residents) on corporate bonds is exempt from CIT.
Until 31 December 2028, income of individuals and legal entities, both residents and non-residents of Uzbekistan, in the form of interest on corporate bonds, is exempt from PIT and CIT.
## Royalty income
Royalty income includes payments for:
Royalty income of Uzbek legal entities and PEs of foreign legal entities is included in taxable profits.
Royalties paid to non-resident companies with no PE are subject to WHT at 20% as 'other' income. The obligation to withhold and pay the tax on income of a non-resident of the Republic of Uzbekistan is levied on the payer of the royalty, a tax agent.
## Foreign income
Gross foreign income of a resident corporation (e.g. income from its foreign branch) should be included in its aggregate income on an accrual basis, regardless of remittance date. Expenses incurred abroad in relation to such foreign income can be deducted, subject to provisions of the Uzbek Tax Code. Foreign income tax paid on such income should be credited against the Uzbek CIT only if this branch is registered in a country with which Uzbekistan has a DTT. There are no deferrals for foreign income to be recognised for Uzbek tax purposes.

# Uzbekistan, Republic of
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 09 February 2025
WHT is to be withheld and remitted to the state budget by entities paying income to non-residents if these entities qualify under a tax agent definition (i.e. by [i] Uzbek legal entities and [ii] non-residents operating in Uzbekistan via PE).
Income of non-residents subject to WHT (including income in the form of dividends, interest, and royalties) is to be paid without withholding of WHT at source or with application of a reduced WHT rate as provided by the tax treaty (with certain exemptions), provided that there is a duly formalised tax certificate issued by a competent authority confirming that non-residents are registered for tax purposes in the state with which Uzbekistan has the effective tax treaty.
The domestic WHT rates are as follows:
| Payment | WHT (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Dividends and interest to residents | 5 |
| Dividends and interest to non-residents | 10 |
| Insurance and reinsurance payments | 10 |
| Freight | 6 |
| Royalties, services (including management, consulting services), rents, other income | 20 |
## Double taxation treaty (DTT) relief
Foreign legal entities that do not carry on activities in Uzbekistan through a PE are subject to WHT on income from sources in Uzbekistan, subject to the terms of a relevant DTT. Uzbekistan has enforced DTTs with 55 countries.
DTTs in force establish WHT rates as follows:
| Recipient | WHT (%) | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dividends | Interest | Royalties |
| Austria | 5 (2b)/15 | 0 (7c, 7e, 7f)/10 | 5 |

# Uzbekistan, Republic of
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 09 February 2025
## Taxable period
The tax period for PIT purposes is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
A tax return is to be filed by Uzbek residents if/once they earn:
The declaration should be submitted by the individual to the tax authorities at the location of the individual's registration in Uzbekistan not later than 1 April of the year following the reporting year. A tax return is not due in cases where the taxpayer’s income from non-principal (second) place of work was taxed at the maximum rate based on one's written application.
If a foreign national becomes a tax resident in Uzbekistan prior to 1 April of the current reporting year, one should submit a declaration on the income earned during the previous reporting year. For instance, if an expatriate has not become tax resident in Uzbekistan as of 31 December 2022 but will become so by 1 April 2023, one would be required to file the annual PIT return for the calendar year 2022 (as a non-resident).
Expatriate individuals leaving Uzbekistan should file a ‘departure’ PIT return for the period from 1 January to the departure date one month in advance of the departure. However, if the expatriate leaves Uzbekistan before 1 February, one is not required to file a tax return.
## Payment of tax
PIT withholding is mandatory for the employers paying salaries and related income to their staff under employment contract (income paid by a company under civil contracts is also subject to income tax withholding). The employers should withhold PIT and remit it to the state budget along with payment of income to the employees but not later than the respective PIT reporting deadline.
PIT liability as per the tax return should be settled by 1 June of the year following the reporting year.
## Tax audit process
Tax legislation does not provide tax audits of individuals. Individual PIT declarations are audited by tax authorities at the filing.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations for tax purposes is three years.
There are no officially announced areas of focus during tax audits.

## Overview

The Republic of Uzbekistan, a double-landlocked country in Central Asia, shares borders with Kazakhstan to the west and to the north, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan to the east, and Afghanistan and Turkmenistan to the south. The official language of Uzbekistan is Uzbek, and Russian is the language for international communication. Uzbekistan's capital is Tashkent, and the official currency is the Uzbekistani soum (UZS).
The Republic of Uzbekistan has an immensely rich heritage in terms of culture, art, and natural resources. The monuments that remain throughout the country bear witness to a long and eventful history in which Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan, and Tamerlane the Great all left their marks. The Uzbeks are descendants of nomadic Mongol tribes who mixed with the sedentary inhabitants of Central Asia during the 13th century. The Khanates of Khiva and Kokand and the Emirate of Bukhara ruled the region during the 18th and 19th centuries. Russia became increasingly interested in the region in the 18th century. This interest intensified in the 19th century as Russia and Britain competed for influence in a diplomatic and occasionally military struggle known as 'The Great Game'.
There had been little industrial development in Central Asia under Tsarist rule, although some raw materials were extracted. During World War II, Uzbekistan's industrial base was enlarged by the re-location of factories from the war-zone. Post-war Soviet development policies focused on the exploitation of the country's raw materials, with particularly heavy investment in the production of cotton. By the late 1980s, the republic was producing 90% of the Soviet Union's cotton, one third of its gold, and half of its uranium.
Independent since 1991, Uzbekistan seeks to gradually lessen its dependence on agriculture while developing its mineral and petroleum reserves. Uzbekistan is a dry, double-landlocked country of which 10% consists of intensely cultivated, irrigated river valleys. Around 50% of the population lives in densely populated rural communities. Energy supplies and hydrocarbons, including natural gas and petroleum, provide a significant share of exports. Other major export earners include cotton, food, services, and metals. Uzbekistan is now the world's eleventh-largest cotton exporter and sixth-largest producer.

# Uzbekistan, Republic of
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 09 February 2025
## Taxable period
The tax period for CIT is a calendar year, and the reporting period is a quarter.
## Tax returns
CIT is reported quarterly before the 20th day of the month following the reporting quarter both by Uzbek legal entities and PEs. The annual tax return is due by 1 March following the reporting year.
## Payment of tax
Legal entities are required to make payments of their tax liability not later than the filing deadline for the respective reporting quarter.
Legal entities with annual income for the previous tax period exceeding UZS 10 billion are required to make advance payments on a monthly basis.
Monthly advance payments should be made by the 23rd day of each month.
Possible excess of advanced payments can be deferred to the future periods, set-off against liabilities on other taxes, or refunded by the tax authorities within 15 days after filing an application for refund.
## Tax audit process
A new mechanism of tax control has been introduced, which prescribes that tax audits will be appointed based on the results of risk analysis. Specifically, taxpayers will be divided into three risk groups: high risk (red), average risk (yellow), and low risk (green). It is expected that taxpayers in the green group will not be audited, while taxpayers in the red group may be audited each year.
Risk analysis will be performed based on the following:
An on-site tax audit is carried out to collect information on the calculation and payment of taxes and fees, as well as other obligations. Following the results of an on-site tax audit, additional taxes will not be charged.
A tax audit is a full-fledged study of compliance with tax legislation by a taxpayer who has a high degree of risk with significant turnover. Tax audits are conducted for taxpayers selected based on the results of the analysis of risk factors for non-payment of taxes. After a tax audit, additional taxes and financial sanctions may be applied.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations for tax purposes in Uzbekistan is set to three years.
There are no officially announced areas of focus during tax audits. In practice, the tax authorities usually focus on currency control, cash discipline, deductibility of expenses for CIT purposes, and taxes on resources (e.g. excess profits tax, subsurface use tax).

# Uzbekistan, Republic of
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 09 February 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
Legal entities are subject to VAT, which is applied to the turnover of goods and services. The taxable base is determined as the sale price of supplied goods/services.
Foreign legal entities carrying out activities in Uzbekistan via PE become VAT payers. Moreover, certain categories of taxpayers, including agricultural producers and law firms, may also be subject to VAT.
Foreign legal entities that supply e-services to individuals whereby the place of supply is considered Uzbekistan are subject to VAT in Uzbekistan. In such a case, the foreign service provider is liable for registering for VAT purposes in Uzbekistan. The taxable base shall comprise the actual sales price of such services inclusive of VAT.
The rate for taxable turnover is 12%. This rate also applies to taxable imports, for which the tax base is determined as the customs value plus import duties and excise tax (on excise-liable goods). Export of goods is generally zero-rated. Insurance and most types of financial services are exempt from VAT.
From 16 November 2023 till 1 January 2028, sales turnover, as well as the import of goods (services) purchased within the framework of projects financed through loans from the International Financial Institutions and foreign governmental financial organisations (except those refinanced through banks of Uzbekistan), attracted by state organisations and entities with a state share of 50% and above are exempt from VAT.
All entities with turnover exceeding UZS 1 billion, as well as PEs of foreign legal entities, are considered as VAT payers. Legal entities selling gas, diesel fuel, and gas through gas stations to end consumers and all business entities that are importers of goods and products are considered as VAT payers regardless of the amount of their annual turnover.
Reporting and tax payments are made on a monthly basis.
As of 1 April 2024, the following VAT incentives have been abolished:
These turnovers were previously taxed at 0% VAT.
Starting from July 1, 2025, the VAT exemption on passenger transportation services at uniform rates will be abolished to ensure the continuity of the value-added chain.
Starting from January 1, 2025, VAT exemptions for the turnover from the sale of goods and services by legal entities, whose sole founder is an association of persons with disabilities, are abolished.
## Customs duties
Import of certain goods to Uzbekistan is subject to customs duties. The taxable base is determined as the customs value of imported goods. Rates of customs duties vary from 5% to 70%, depending on the type of imported goods. Fixed rates are also set for certain goods as a minimum (e.g. the rate for coconuts is 20% but cannot be less than 0.2 United States dollars [USD] per kg).
From 1 January 2021, customs clearance fees were revised and should be calculated at the rates nominated in Base Calculation Units (BCUs), depending on range of the customs value of the goods. For example, the customs clearance fee for goods valued USD 100,000 to USD 200,000 should comprise 15 BCU (approximately USD 430).
A number of goods (per government approved list) imported for construction, renovation, and equipping of hotels, business centres, and retail stores will be exempt from customs duties between 1 March 2024 and 1 March 2026 (e.g. special equipment, appliances, raw materials, components, furniture, construction materials).
Until 1 January 2027, there will be an exemption from customs duties on imported raw materials and other materials, components, and spare parts necessary for the production of textile products and not produced in the republic, according to the list.
Starting from January 1, 2025, customs authorities are required to provide tax authorities with:
## Excise taxes
Due to the expiration of the Protocol on the Application of the Agreement on the Free Trade Area of the CIS Member States with Uzbekistan (dated 31 May 2013), Uzbekistan has cancelled excise tax for 73 product lines from 1 January 2021.
Legal entities producing or importing excise-able goods (e.g. cigarettes, petrol, alcohol drinks) are subject to excise tax. Rates vary from 15% to 70%, depending on the type of goods produced/imported. The taxable base is determined as the value of produced/imported goods, excluding VAT. Excise tax is reported monthly.
Excise tax is charged for provision of sale of petrol, diesel, liquefied gas, and compressed gas to final consumers. Since 1 April 2025, excise taxes on petroleum products (gasoline, aviation kerosene, diesel fuel, environmentally friendly diesel fuel), engine oils, and liquefied and compressed gases have been increased by 10%. For cigarettes, starting from January 1, 2025, the *ad valorem* rate of 10% of the cost is excluded from the excise tax rate calculation, and from July 1 2025, the rates for imported and local cigarettes will be equalised. Excise tax on mobile communication services is abolished from January 1, 2025.
Fixed excise tax rates on local alcohol and tobacco products have been indexed by 12%.
Starting 1 April 2024, fixed excise tax rates on petroleum products have been indexed by 12%.
As of 1 April 2024, excise tax is also charged on:
Starting from April 1, 2025, the excise tax will be extended to all soft drinks with sugar content. An excise tax of 500 UZS per 1 liter is imposed on non-carbonated beverages (fruit drinks, lemonades, kvass and others), with the exception of juices made from fruits and (or) vegetables that are naturally sweet and do not contain additional sugar and other sweetening or aromatic substances.
In addition, excise tax on polyethylene granules was reduced to 10% .
The gas excise tax rate has been reduced from 20% to 12%. At the same time, the excise tax on imported gas was returned, which also amounts to 12%.

It is planned to introduce a single excise tax rate on both locally manufactured and imported petrol. Imported gasoline is subject to an excise tax rate of 5%.
In addition, excise tax on liquefied gas was reduced to 20%, and excise tax on polyethylene granules was abolished.
Excise tax rates for some products increased by an average of 10% from 1 February 2023.
## Property taxes
The headline property tax rate is 1.5% for legal entities (3% for overdue construction in progress). The tax is computed annually, based on the net book value of the immovable property and the value of overdue construction and idle equipment/construction. Along with reduction of the property tax rate, the minimum taxable base for each square metre of immovable property was introduced. The amount of such a taxable base depends on the location of the immovable property and varies from UZS 1 million to UZS 2.5 million.
The property tax rate for legal entities remains unchanged at 1.5%, but the minimum tax base for 1 sqm has been increased as follows:
Alternative energy producers (meeting certain criteria on rated power) are exempt from property tax on renewable energy installations for a period of ten years from the date of registration.
Property tax is reported annually by 1 March following the reporting year.
The Tax Code provides for the list of certain non-taxable property, mostly including public service facilities (e.g. waterwork facilities), gas and heat distribution lines, land plots, and highways.
The ‘reduced tax rate’ established for particular objects is 0.6% in relation to:
New oil and gas wells are exempt from property tax in the first two years starting from the month of their commissioning and benefit from a 50% rate reduction for the consequent three years.
Taxpayers for newly constructed industrial high rise buildings (excluding those located in the cities of the republic, as well as in the Zangiata, Kibray and Tashkent districts of the Tashkent region) pay the amount of the accrued tax using a reduction coefficient of 0.5-0.9 to the accrued amount of this tax depending on the number of stories of a building from the month of its commissioning for a period of no more than three years.
## Land tax
Enterprises, including foreign legal entities operating in Uzbekistan via a PE, owning land plots or rights of their use are subject to land tax or land lease payment annually. Land tax is charged at fees that are set in absolute values with precise amounts determined by the Law on State Budget of the Republic of Uzbekistan that vary depending on the quality, location, and level of water supply of each land plot. Land lease payment is charged at negotiable rates; however, the minimum amount cannot be less than the land tax rate for the respective land plot. Land tax and land lease payment are computed based on the area of the land in use.
Land tax base for non-agricultural land and for individuals have been indexed by 10%.
Producers of energy from renewable sources are exempt from payment of tax on land plots occupied by renewable energy installations for a period of ten years from the date of their commissioning.
Beginning from 1 January 2020, the Tax Code introduces a norm, which provides that in case of improving the quality of agricultural land (increasing the yield class), the tax is paid by legal entities on the normative value of agricultural land based on a new yield class from the beginning of the year following the year of soil bonitation, without recounting it in periods when the agricultural activities were completed.
Starting from 1 January 2022, land plots allotted for exploration works are not subject to land tax.
## Transfer taxes
There are no transfer taxes in Uzbekistan.
## Stamp duties
According to Uzbek legislation, stamp duty (state due) is an obligatory payment charged for performance of legal actions and/or issuance of legal documents.
The following actions, among others, are subject to stamp duties: filing claims, performing notary actions, civil registration, state registration of a legal entity, obtaining licences/permits to carry out certain activities, etc.
The rates of stamp duties generally vary from 0.5 to 20 times the BCU, depending on the type of action executed. For instance, the duty for filing a claim depends on the amount and nature of the claim. Under the civil claim, the duty comprises 4% of claim amount, but not less than 1 BCU; for business claims, the duty is 2% of the claim amount, but not less than 1 BCU. Duty for notarisation of copies of documents for legal entities is 2% of the BCU per each page of the document. Duty for registration of legal entities with foreign investment comprises 10 times the BCU if submitted in person and 50% of this if submitted through the automated online registration system.
## Social Tax (ST)
Employers are subject to ST assessed on total payroll cost related to local and expatriate staff. This tax is collected by the tax authorities. The rate of ST is stated as 12% for all kind of entities with extension to certain new categories of taxpayers, including individual entrepreneurs and their employees, members of family enterprises, farming enterprises, and artisans, etc. Budget organisations pay ST at the rate of 25%.
Income of foreign personnel paid to non-resident legal entities as part of secondment fees under personnel provision agreements is subject to ST. The taxable base for calculation of ST on such income shall be the income of foreign personnel provided, but not less than 90% of the secondment fee payable under the personnel provision agreement. ST is reported monthly.
From January 1, 2025 to January 1, 2028, companies that hire low-income employees with salaries above 1.5 minimum wage will pay a social tax rate of 1%.
From September 1, 2024 to September 1, 2027, the social tax for companies that employ students from schools, colleges and technical schools under the age of 30 for vocational training is paid a 1% social tax on income paid to them in the form of wages.
Companies that hire foreign teachers are exempt from social tax until January 1 2030.
From 1 January 2025, an ST rate of 1% previously applied to businesses engaged in retail, catering, hospitality, passengers and freight transportation by vehicle, repair and maintenance of vehicles, computer services, repair of household appliances, agro- and veterinary services, and services provided in entertainment centres was not extended and considered abolished.
## Payroll taxes
In addition to ST, employers are responsible for withholding PIT and pension fund contributions from salaries and remitting them to the state budget.
The following types of income are exempt from PIT:
## Water-use tax
Enterprises (including PEs) using water in their production are subject to water-use tax. The tax rate is set by the Tax Code and depends on the source of water consumption (i.e. surface or underground). Water-use tax is calculated based on the volume of the water consumed. Water-use tax is reported annually.
Since January 1, 2025 tax rates for the use of water resources have been increased by 10% for water users, including power plants, utilities, producers of soft drinks and alcoholic beverages, except beer and wine, and industrial enterprises. In accordance with the Presidential Decree No. 107 dated April 1, 2023, water tax rates for other sectors will be gradually unified with industrial tariffs.
## Taxes of subsurface users
In addition to standard taxes, subsurface users (i.e. legal entities and individuals exploring and extracting natural resource) are subject to subsurface users’ specific taxes, as listed below:
### Subsurface use tax (royalty)
Subsurface use tax is charged on the volume of produced (extracted) natural resources that are ready for sale or transfer (including free of charge) and consumption for internal purposes. The taxable base is determined as the average weighted sales price.
Starting from January 1, 2025, separate tax rates for the use of mineral resources for marble, granite, natural facing stone, sand and gravel mixtures (including construction sand and sandstones) have been established, given that the share of tax in relation to their purchase price is very low.
Some examples of the tax rates are:
| Business activity | Tax rate examples |
| --- | --- |
| Extraction of natural resources (tax rates effective from 1 January 2023) | natural gas 10%, oil and gas 10%, gold and copper 7%, silver 7% |
| Utilisation of by-products received during the extraction of natural resources | 50% of tax rate applicable to main natural resources extracted |
Subsurface use tax is reported monthly by legal entities and annually by individuals.
### Mineral extraction rent tax
Starting from 1 January 2022, legal entities extracting precious, non-ferrous, and radioactive metals, rare and rare-earth elements, as well as hydrocarbons (natural gas, gas condensate, and oil), will be subject to a new rent tax. The taxable base comprises the amount of rent income, which is defined as the difference between the revenue from sales of respective products (net of VAT and excise tax) and expenses directly related to their extraction. If there is a rent loss, the taxable base shall be nil. The taxable base is calculated separately for each licensed subsoil plot (group of licensed plots).
Rent tax will not apply to rent income connected with extraction of natural resources on subsoil fields where the extraction started between 1 January 2024 and 31 December 2025. This exemption will apply for the entire period of extraction works.
Enterprises with foreign investments engaged in extraction of metals and hydrocarbons may determine the taxable base in US dollars based on the accrual method. In such a case, the taxable base indicated in foreign currency is converted into national currency at the exchange rate of the Central Bank of Uzbekistan established as at the date of tax filing. If a loss is incurred after the first tax period, the taxpayer is allowed to account for it in a separate account in US dollars and apply an uplift each year at the rate equal to the Uzbekistan sovereign bonds yield with maturity in ten years increased by two percentage points. Expenses of the first tax period may include historical costs.
The minimum tax rate comprises 25% of the taxable base. During a competitive bidding (tender) for the right to use a subsoil plot for geological exploration or extraction, the organiser or participants have a right to propose a higher rent tax rate to be paid.
The tax period for rent tax is a calendar year. The reporting period is a quarter. Rent tax is paid quarterly not later than the 20th day of the next month, and, for annual payments, not later than 1 March of the year following the reporting one.
### Excess profits tax
Excess profits tax is abolished from 1 January 2020.
### Subscription and commercial discovery bonuses
Subscription and commercial discovery bonuses are one-off payments to the state budget. The subscription bonus is payable for the right to engage in exploration and extraction of natural resources and range from 50 to 5,000 times the BCU, depending on the type of minerals. The commercial discovery bonus is paid for each field where a subsurface user discovers the natural resources and comprises 0.1% from the cost of the proved reserve volume.
Starting from 1 January 2022, a special procedure is introduced for tendering of subsoil rights for geological exploration and/or production in respect of previously explored fields having significant commercial potential (i.e. hydrocarbons, precious metals, non-ferrous, rare, and radioactive metals, and other types of minerals). At this, the cost of subsoil rights acquired replaces commercial discovery and subscription bonuses, which are abolished.

# Uzbekistan, Republic of
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 09 February 2025
Resident corporations pay CIT on their worldwide income, whereas non-residents (i.e. foreign legal entities that have a PE in Uzbekistan or have income from sources in Uzbekistan not associated with a PE) pay CIT on income resulting from activities/sources in Uzbekistan.
Non-resident corporations are taxed directly at the level of their Uzbek PE, if there is one, or via withholding tax (WHT) at the source of payment of the Uzbek-source income.
CIT is charged on taxable profit calculated as a difference between gross income and deductible expenses reduced by applicable incentives granted by the Tax Code, other laws, or presidential decrees.
The CIT rate is set in the Tax Code (previously, annually by presidential decree). Enterprises (i.e. legal entities) are generally subject to CIT at the rate of 15%. Commercial banks, producers of cement (clinker) and polyethylene granules, mobile services providers, and markets/shopping malls are subject to CIT at the rate of 20%.
0% CIT rate for the export of goods (services) is abolished, income from exports will be included in the tax base for turnover tax from January 1, 2025.
The rate of CIT applicable to the following categories of the taxpayers may be reduced by 50%:
From February 1, 2025 to January 1, 2030, foreign companies that are not tax residents of countries with which Uzbekistan has a double taxation agreement are exempt from CIT if their annual volume of export IT services to residents of the IT park (including services for which royalties are paid) exceeds 10 million dollars.
## Simplified tax regime (i.e. turnover tax)
An optional simplified tax regime is available for all legal entities with annual turnover less than UZS 1 billion and individual entrepreneurs with turnover ranging from UZS 100 million to UZS 1 billion. Under this regime, turnover tax replaces CIT and VAT.
Turnover taxpayers whose revenue exceeds UZS 1 during the year will, however, become subject to the general income tax regime from the month following the month in which the annual revenue threshold was exceeded.
The reporting period for turnover tax has been set to a month (instead of a quarter previously).
Legal entities that provide intermediary services under a commission agreement, instructions, and other intermediary services agreements, including individual entrepreneurs providing intermediary services to telecom operators, calculate revenue from sale of goods/services on the basis of the transaction amount.
Certain taxpayers are not eligible for application of turnover tax (e.g. importers, producers of excise-liable goods, legal entities engaged into subsurface extraction, sale of petrol, diesel/gas fuel).
The general turnover tax rate is 4% but may vary from 1 to 25% depending on type of entity and services provided.
From January 1, 2025, 1% turnover tax is no longer available to legal entities located in established touristic zones.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 09 February 2025
For Uzbek tax purposes, corporations are classified as resident or non-resident. The new edition of the Tax Code introduced amendments into the definition of tax residency.
A resident corporation includes the following legal entities:
Other legal entities are regarded as non-resident corporations for tax purposes.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
PE is defined by the Tax Code as a “fixed place, through which the foreign legal entity carries out, in full or partially, entrepreneurial activity in the Republic of Uzbekistan”. The Tax Code further provides that a PE is also existent where (i) building site, installation or assembly object, or related activities exist/last for more than 183 days in any consecutive 12-month period, or (ii) service, including consulting services, is provided by a non-resident if they last (for one or more related projects or related entities) for not less than 183 days in any consecutive 12-month period.

# Uzbekistan, Republic of
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 09 February 2025
The tax base for CIT purposes varies significantly from the computation of taxable profits in most Western jurisdictions.
There are additional costs that cannot be deducted by PEs of foreign legal entities, such as interest on head office loans; commission fees charged by the head office; and royalty, administrative, and management expenses of the head office incurred outside Uzbekistan. However, PEs are eligible to deduct expenses incurred outside of Uzbekistan if they directly relate to their business in Uzbekistan.
## Depreciation and amortisation
For tax purposes, depreciation/amortisation is calculated with application of rates defined by the Tax Code. If depreciation for accounting purposes is charged at higher rates (compared with the Tax Code rates), the difference is treated as a temporary difference for CIT purposes (i.e. deducted in future periods).
Depreciation is calculated from the date on which the asset was put into use until it is fully depreciated, disposed of, or written off. The maximum annual depreciation rates applicable to different types of fixed assets are outlined in the table below.
| Depreciable item | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Buildings | 5 |
| Constructions (e.g. bridges, oil-wells, landing strips, dams, greenhouses) | 10 |
| Pipelines, power supply lines, and communication lines | 15 |
| Machines and equipment except for transport vehicles | 20 |
| Railway, river, and air transport vehicles | 10 |
| Cars, trailers, lorries, buses, and other transport vehicles | 20 |
| Computers and other related devices | 40 |
| Depreciable assets not mentioned above | 15 |
For statutory accounting purposes, fixed assets can be depreciated using one of the following methods:
For tax purposes, depreciation is calculated based on the straight-line method using the above marginal rates.
Intangible assets, including leases and other property rights, are amortised over the shorter of an asset's useful life or the period of activity of the enterprise. Where an asset's useful life cannot be determined, the asset can be amortised over five years.
Expenses related to geological exploration and developmental works necessary for the extraction of natural resources are deductible for CIT purposes through depreciation at the rate of 15% *per annum*.
The taxpayer has the right to apply investment deductions for depreciable assets subject to depreciation for up to (i) 20% from the cost of a new technological equipment and (ii) 10% for the expansion of production in the form of a new construction.
## Goodwill
For tax purposes, expenses incurred for acquisition of goodwill should be deductible through monthly amortisation charges at norms calculated by the taxpayers based on historical cost of goodwill and its useful life.
## Start-up expenses
Current legislation does not provide specific guidance on tax treatment of start-up expenses. However, as per Uzbek accounting legislation, certain types of start-up expenses (e.g. expenses for acquisition of right for production, right for rendering services and carrying out works, right to use economic or other privileges) can be considered as expenses for procurement of intangible assets and, respectively, can be deducted through monthly depreciation charges.
## Interest on short-term loans
Interest is deductible, except for interest on overdue/delayed loans (i.e. ‘penalty interest’).
## Bad debt
Bad debts related to the receipt of taxable income in the previous reporting periods are deductible for tax purposes in cases where they are written off and recognised in accordance with Uzbek accounting legislation. Otherwise, such expenses should be considered as non-deductible. According to the current Uzbek legislation, arrears are recognised as bad debts upon expiration of three-years from their due date.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions are generally treated as non-deductible expenses and added-back to the taxable base.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are considered as non-deductible expenses.
## Taxes
Generally, taxes are deductible for CIT purposes.
## Other tax losses
Production wastes and defects within statutory norms, and losses resulting in force-majeure circumstances, are generally deductible.
Losses from the disposal of fixed assets also may be deducted.
## Net operating losses
Tax losses can be carried forward indefinitely, thus reducing the taxable profit of the respective year. Loss carrybacks are not permitted.
## Payments to foreign affiliates

# Uzbekistan, Republic of
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 09 February 2025
New legislation provides the opportunity to form a consolidated group of taxpayers, which may comprise of two or more Uzbek legal entities. The taxpayers should meet the ‘ownership’ criteria, i.e. participation share of one legal entity in the charter capital of other legal entity(ies) should comprise at least 90%. However, legal entities should not be undergoing liquidation or bankruptcy processes, and their net assets should be higher than the charter capital.
Moreover, all legal entities forming a consolidated group of taxpayers shall satisfy other criteria related to turnover, taxes paid, and assets value. The advantages of applying this regime may include, without limitation, ability of filing one set of reports for the group and offsetting profits of one group company against losses of another group company.
The legislation of consolidated groups of taxpayers is enforced from 1 January 2022.
## Transfer pricing
The Tax Code introduces elaborate transfer pricing provisions, including definition of related parties, controlled transactions, pricing methods, documentation and reporting requirements, pricing agreements, etc. There are five methods of transfer pricing, similar to those used in the international transfer pricing practise (i.e. based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations) to analyse the arm’s-length nature of the controlled transactions.
Taxpayers qualified as ‘large taxpayers’ are eligible to apply to tax authorities for an ‘advance pricing agreement’ (APA).  APAs may be valid for the period of up to three years and may be extended for an additional two years upon taxpayer’s request.
Transfer pricing rules have been enforced as of 1 January 2022.
## Thin capitalisation
The Tax Code introduced regulations on deductibility of taxpayer's interest expense on controllable debt from a foreign participant. Controllable liability is defined as liability owed to a:
The deductibility limitations apply if the amount of debt exceeds the amount of equity by 3 times (13 times for banks and leasing companies). There is a specific mechanism for determining the deductibility limits.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Generally, CFC rules are applicable to individuals and legal entities, Uzbekistan tax residents, owning or controlling foreign legal entities and/or structures. The main purpose of the new CFC rules is to tax undistributed profits of foreign companies and structures like trusts, foundations, etc.
Rules of CFCs are enforced from 1 January 2022.

# Uzbekistan, Republic of
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 09 February 2025
The Civil Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan provides that enterprises can establish and operate branches. However, the by-laws governing procedures for establishing entities with foreign investments do not provide sufficient guidance on establishing branches of foreign legal entities, creating a practical problem with registering of branches of foreign legal entities. Instead, such entities use a PE registration to perform business activities without establishing an Uzbek company.
Generally, taxation of a PE’s income is similar to that of an Uzbek legal entity (i.e. the income of a PE is subject to CIT at the rate of 15%). As of 1 January 2022, net profits (i.e. a PE's taxable income less CIT) are subject to taxation at a tax rate of 10%, which aligns the PE taxation with Uzbek legal entities that pay a 10% dividends WHT. Starting from 1 January 2023, the rate of net profits tax may be reduced if provisions of the DTT between Uzbekistan and the jurisdiction of a non-resident’s tax residency provides for a reduced WHT rate on dividend income.

## Intergovernmental agreement (IGA) on the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
On 3 April 2015, a Model 1 IGA between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Uzbekistan to Improve International Tax Compliance and to Implement FATCA was signed. Uzbekistan approved the IGA as of 5 July 2017, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Uzbekistan was ordered to notify on completion of domestic procedures. The IGA is in force starting 7 July 2017.
More than 110 countries around the world have concluded IGAs on FATCA with the United States, while, as per a statement by the US Embassy in Uzbekistan, Uzbekistan is the first country in Central Asia to sign an IGA on FATCA with the United States.
The IGA will ensure compliance with US tax laws for US citizens working in Uzbekistan. According to the FATCA regulations, foreign financial institutions (FFIs) (i.e. all financial institutions outside of the United States) are faced with disclosure requirements regarding their account holders who are US persons. This means that FFIs in Uzbekistan are obligated to periodically transmit information on financial accounts held by US persons to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or face a 30% WHT on payments made from the United States. In order to fulfil this obligation, FFIs should implement procedures to ensure information collecting systems are in place and required information in respect to US investors is duly reported to the US IRS.
## Uzbekistan joins OECD plan on base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS)
On 9 June 2023 Uzbekistan joined the OECD/G-20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS.
Through its decision, Uzbekistan has committed to address tax challenges arising from digitalisation of the economy and joined the two-pillar plan to reform the international taxation rules. Collaborating with all other members of the Inclusive Framework, Uzbekistan will participate in implementation of the BEPS package of 15 measures (actions) to improve coherence of international tax rules and ensure a more transparent tax environment.
It is worthwhile noting that among the potential measures to be implemented are the prevention of tax treaty abuse and country-by-country (CbC) reporting.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 09 February 2025
## Personal deductions
There are no personal deductions under Uzbek law. However, income directed for some purposes may be viewed as exempt for PIT purposes and is effectively a deduction (*see Exempt income in the*[*Income determination*](income-determination.html) *section*).
## Standard deductions
There are no standard deductions under Uzbek law.
## Personal allowances
Certain categories of individuals are either fully exempt from PIT (e.g. diplomats) or granted a monthly deduction of four times the statutory BCU (e.g. veterans, disabled people, widows/widowers with children, women with many children).
## Business expenses
The only other deductions available relate to income derived from entrepreneurial activities and represent expenses and mandatory payments and charges associated with such activities.
## Losses
Uzbek legislation does not provide for any treatment of losses for individuals.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 09 February 2025
## Employment income
Taxable income of an individual includes the following items:
## Equity compensation
There are currently no special rules for the taxation of stock option plans. Tax treatment is based on the general provisions of the tax law, which do not prescribe taxation of the income unless an employee exercises one's option and purchases stock at the below-market cost.
## Business income
Individuals receiving income from entrepreneurial or similar activities are supposed to be properly registered as individual entrepreneurs. If revenue from the sale of goods/services does not exceed UZS 100 million in a calendar year, individual entrepreneurs can choose to pay income tax on the basis of PIT declaration at the rate 12% or pay tax in a fixed amount depending on the type of activity. In case sales turnover exceeds UZS 100 million but not more than UZS 1 billion, it will be subject to turnover tax. If the sales turnover is more than UZS 1 billion, then VAT and corporate income tax (CIT) is applicable instead of turnover tax.
If applicable, individual entrepreneurs are subject to payment of other taxes, including:
## Capital gains
Capital gains of residents are taxed at the generally applicable PIT rate. Capital gain from sale of immovable property is taxed at 12%. Taxable basis shall comprise the difference between the sales price and the acquisition price (in case the acquisition price cannot be determined, taxable base should comprise sales price of the asset, while for immovable property taxable base shall be the difference between sales price and inventory value of the property).
## Dividend income
Taxable income of an individual includes dividend income.
Dividends received by residents are taxed at the 5% rate, and dividends received by non-residents are taxed at the 10% rate.
For the period from 1 April 2022 to 31 December 2028, income of individuals (both residents and non-residents of the Republic of Uzbekistan) in the form of dividends from shares in joint stock companies is exempt from PIT (yet to be included into the Tax Code).
## Interest income
Taxable income of an individual includes interest income. However, interest income received from bank deposits is exempt from PIT.
Interest income received by residents is taxed at the 5% rate, and interest received by non-residents is taxed at the 10% rate.
## Rental income
Taxable income of an individual includes rental income. Income of residents from rent of property is taxed at the 12% PIT rate, on the contract price. However, the rental fee shall not be less than the fixed rate established for 1 square metre.
Rental income received by non-residents should be taxed at source of payment at the 12% rate.
## Royalty income
A royalty is payment for the use of, or right to use, any intangible asset, including:
Royalties paid to non-residents companies with no permanent establishment (PE) are subject to a withholding tax (WHT) at 20% as 'other' income. The obligation to withhold and pay the tax on income of a non-resident of Uzbekistan is levied on the payer of the royalty, a tax agent.
Royalty income of residents is taxed at the generally applicable PIT rate of 12%.
## Other income
Taxable income of an individual also includes, without limitation, prizes and lottery winnings.
## Exempt income
The following is a representative list of items exempt from personal taxation:
