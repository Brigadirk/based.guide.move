## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
## Taxable period
The Malaysian tax year is the calendar year (i.e. 1 January to 31 December).
## Tax returns
Separate returns are issued to husband and wife and filed separately by each spouse. The income of a wife who is living with her husband is assessed separately from that of the husband. However, a wife who is a resident or a Malaysian citizen can elect to be taxed jointly with her husband. A husband who has no income may also elect to be assessed jointly with his wife under the wife’s name.
### Self-assessment for individuals
Malaysia adopts the self-assessment system where the taxpayer is responsible for computing one’s own chargeable income and tax payable, as well as making payments of any balance of tax due. The amount of tax payable for the year must be self-computed, and the tax return is deemed to be a notice of assessment upon its submission. The tax return is submitted not later than 30 April (without business income) and 30 June (with business income) in the following calendar year.
E-filing or online filing of tax returns via the Internet is available for those who wish to file their returns using this method. Those who have chosen to file their returns for a year of assessment by way of e-filing will not be issued a tax return form for subsequent years.
Individuals whose total income tax is equivalent to the amount deducted under the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system can elect not to submit a tax return, subject to certain conditions being fulfilled.
## Payment of tax
Tax payments by employees are collected through compulsory deductions from salary. All deductions are made on a PAYE basis. If tax deemed assessed on an individual upon the submission of one’s return exceeds the total amount deducted from the individual’s salary, the difference must be paid on or before the submission date. Tax for a year of assessment is due and payable on the following dates in the year following that year of assessment:

## Overview
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
Malaysia, located in Southeast Asia, is separated by the South China Sea into two non-contiguous regions: the Peninsula Malaysia region bordering Thailand (i.e. West Malaysia) and the Malaysia Borneo region bordering Indonesia and Brunei (i.e. East Malaysia). Malaysia is divided into 13 states and three federal territories, with Kuala Lumpur as the capital and Putrajaya as the seat of the federal government. The official language of Malaysia is Bahasa Malaysia, and the currency is the Malaysian ringgit (MYR).
Over the last 60 years, Malaysia has developed from a primary commodities exporter to a strong industrial base for foreign electrical and electronics multinational corporations. As an oil and gas exporter, Malaysia has profited from higher world energy prices, but the government recognises the need to reduce the dependence on petroleum as the main source of revenue. In the last decade, as it moved up the industry value chain, Malaysia has emerged as an attractive regional hub for services, including financial services, information and communications technology (ICT), and logistics sectors. Malaysia is increasingly being recognised as an innovative international Islamic financial centre. It is also emerging as a springboard or centre for regional expansion into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in view of its strategic, central location and multi-lingual ‘Truly Asia’ mix of Malay, Chinese, and Indian populace.

# Malaysia
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
## Taxable period
Assessment of income is on a current-year basis. A company is taxed on income from all sources (whether business or non-business) arising in its financial year ending in the calendar year that coincides with that particular year of assessment. For example, a company that closes its accounts on 30 June of each year is taxed on income earned during the financial year ending on 30 June 2025 for year of assessment 2025.
## Tax returns
Under the self-assessment system, companies are required to submit a return of income within seven months from the date of closing of accounts. Particulars required to be specified in the return include the amount of chargeable income and tax payable by the company. The tax return is deemed to be a notice of assessment and is deemed served on the company upon the date the tax return is submitted.
'E-filing’ or online filing of tax returns via the Internet is available. E-filing is encouraged by the Inland Revenue Board.
## Payment of tax
Tax payable under an assessment upon submission of a tax return is due and payable by the last day of the seventh month from the date of closing of accounts.
Companies are required to furnish estimates of their tax payable for a year of assessment no later than 30 days before the beginning of the basis period (normally the financial year). However, a newly established company with paid-up capital of MYR 2.5 million or less that meets with certain specified conditions is exempted from this requirement for two years, beginning from the year of assessment in which the company commences operation. A revised estimate can be submitted in the sixth and ninth months of the basis period for a year of assessment.
Companies are required to pay tax by monthly instalments (based on the estimates submitted) commencing from the second month of the company’s basis period.
A company commencing operations in a year of assessment is not required to furnish estimates of tax payable or to make instalment payments if the basis period for the year of assessment in which the company commences operations is less than six months.
### Penalties
Various penalties are imposed for failure to comply with the tax obligations under the self-assessment system. These include penalties for failure to furnish tax returns, submitting an incorrect return or understating income, late payment of taxes, underestimation of tax estimates, wilfully and intentionally evading tax, or assisting any other persons to evade tax.
## Tax audit process
Following the issuance of the general tax audit framework, tax audit frameworks for the financial and insurance industry and for WHTs were issued. These tax audit frameworks outline the rights and responsibilities of audit officers, taxpayers, and tax agents in respect of a tax audit. A tax audit may cover a period of one to three years of assessment determined in accordance with the audit focus. The years of assessment to be covered in a tax audit may, however, be extended depending on the issues identified during an audit.
## Statute of limitations
Additional assessments can be made within five years after the expiration of the relevant year of assessment. This time limit is not applicable where fraud, wilful default, or negligence has been committed.

# Malaysia
## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
## Social security contributions
### Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF)
The Malaysian EPF is a compulsory pension scheme for all Malaysians. The EPF receives and manages retirement savings, encompassing compulsory contributions by all Malaysian citizens and permanent residents who are working in Malaysia. It is not compulsory for non-Malaysian citizens and non-permanent residents to contribute to the EPF, but they may elect to do so.
| Contribution by | Malaysian citizens and permanent residents (mandatory) | | Expatriates and foreign workers (without permanent resident status) (voluntary) | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| % of contribution of employee’s wages (minimum) | | | |
| Employer | Employee | Employer | Employee |
| Below age 60: | | | | |
| Income > MYR 5,000 | 12.0% | 11.0% | MYR 5 per person | 11.0% |
| Income ≤ MYR 5,000 | 13.0% |
| Age 60 and above: | | | | |
| Income > MYR 5,000 | Malaysian: 4.0%; Permanent resident: 6.0% | Malaysian: 0%; Permanent resident: 5.5% | MYR 5 per person | 5.5% |
| Income ≤ MYR 5,000 | Malaysian: 4.0%; Permanent resident: 6.5% |
### Social Security Organisation
Malaysia also has a Social Security Organisation (SOCSO) who administers the Employment Injury Scheme (EIS) and the Invalidity Scheme (IS). SOCSO coverage and protection is limited to Malaysian citizens and permanent residents. A monthly contribution must be made and may fall under one of two categories:
## Employment Insurance System (EIS)
The EIS provides certain benefits and a re-employment placement programme for insured persons in the event of loss of employment to promote active labour market policies. The EIS covers only Malaysian citizens, permanent residents, and temporary residents.
Both the employer and employee make monthly contributions of 0.2% of employee's wage, restricted to a maximum of MYR 11.90, respectively.
## Real property gains tax (RPGT)
| Disposal | **Citizens and permanent residents** | Non-citizens/non-permanent residents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Up to 3 years | 30% | 30% |
| In the 4th year | 20% | 30% |
| In the 5th year | 15% | 30% |
| Exceeding 5 years | 0% | 10% |
## Consumption taxes
### Sales tax and service tax
Sales tax is generally an *ad valorem tax.* The *ad valorem* rates are 5% or 10% depending on the class of goods.
The rate of service tax is 8% for all taxable services except for the following, which are at 6%:
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Malaysia.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There are no inheritance, estate, or gift taxes in Malaysia.
## Property tax
Property tax is levied on the gross annual value of property as determined by the local state authorities.
## Luxury and excise duties
A high value goods tax is expected to be introduced at the rate of 5% to 10% on certain high-value items, such as jewellery and watches, based on the threshold of price. Details of the effective date has yet to be announced.
## Stamp duty

# Malaysia
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
## Inventory valuation
Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost may be determined using one of several methods (e.g. unit cost, average cost, or first in first out [FIFO]), as long as the basis used is consistent for each year.
## Capital gains
Companies, LLPs, co-operatives, and trust bodies are subject to CGT from 1 January 2024 on:
However, exemption is given for:
The CGT rates are as follows:
### Capital asset situated in Malaysia
| Acquisition date of capital asset | CGT rate | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| On net gain (chargeable income) | On gross disposal price | |
| Before 1 January 2024 | 10% | or 2% | |
| From 1 January 2024 | 10% | Not applicable | |
### Disposal of all types of capital asset situated outside Malaysia, remitted into Malaysia
Based on prevailing income tax rate of the taxpayer:
### Other gains on capital assets
## Dividend income
Malaysia is under the single-tier tax system. Dividends are exempt in the hands of shareholders. However, it has been proposed that a 2% dividend tax be imposed on individuals on dividend income exceeding MYR 100,000. This proposal is expected to take effect from year of assessment 2025 (*see the [Income determination](malaysia/individual/income-determination.html) section in the Individual tax summary for more information*). Companies are not required to deduct tax from dividends paid to shareholders, and no tax credits will be available for offset against the recipient’s tax liability. Corporate shareholders receiving exempt single-tier dividends can, in turn, distribute such dividends to their own shareholders, who are also exempt on such receipts.
### Stock dividends
A Malaysian corporation may distribute bonus shares tax-free to shareholders.
## Interest income
Interest income accruing in or derived from Malaysia or received in Malaysia from outside Malaysia is subject to CIT. Exemptions granted include interest income earned by a non-resident person from deposits placed in designated financial institutions in Malaysia.
## Royalty income
Royalty income accruing in or derived from Malaysia or received in Malaysia from outside Malaysia is subject to CIT. Malaysia has a wide definition of royalty that also includes software, visual images or sounds transmitted via satellite, cable, or fibre optic, and radio frequency spectrum. Payments to non-residents falling within the definition of royalty will be subject to WHT requirements. However, certain royalty income earned by a non-resident person may be exempted from tax.
## Foreign income
A tax-resident is taxed on income derived from Malaysia and foreign-sourced income remitted to Malaysia, except for the following foreign-sourced income received in Malaysia (subject to conditions):
Income of a resident company from the business of air/sea transport, banking, or insurance is taxed on a worldwide basis.
Taxation on a worldwide basis does not apply when income attributable to a Labuan business activity of a Labuan branch or subsidiary of a Malaysian bank is subject to tax under the Labuan Business Activity Tax Act 1990. This exception will not apply if the Labuan entity has made an irrevocable election to be taxed under the Income Tax Act 1967 in respect of its Labuan business activity.
Relief from double taxation is available by means of a bilateral credit if there is a governing tax treaty or unilateral relief where there is no treaty. The relief is restricted to the lower of Malaysian tax payable or foreign tax paid if there is a treaty, or one-half of the foreign tax paid if there is no treaty.
Undistributed income of foreign subsidiaries is not taxable.

## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
## Forest City Special Financial Zone (SFZ)
The Forest City Special Financial Zone (‘Forest City SFZ‘) is a special financial zone located within the Iskandar Special Economic Zone in the southern region of Peninsular Malaysia. Its development is part and parcel of the enhancement of the business ecosystem between Malaysia and Singapore, under the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone.
The following are the tax incentives announced for the Forest City SFZ:
## New Investment Incentive Framework
A New Investment Incentive Framework is expected to be implemented in the third quarter of 2025, which focuses on high-value activities as opposed to a product-based approach. Among the initiatives that can be expected under the new framework are:
## New Industrial Master Plan 2030: Reinvestment incentives
The reinvestment incentive under the New Industrial Master Plan 2030 (NIMP 2030) was introduced with the objective to encourage existing companies that have exhausted their reinvestment allowance incentive period to continue to invest in high-growth and high-value activities under the NIMP 2030. The following reinvestment incentives are provided to existing manufacturing companies undertaking expansion or diversification projects, which adopts Industrial Revolution 4.0 (IR 4.0) technologies:
Applications can be submitted from 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2028.
## Global minimum tax (GMT)
## Sales and service tax
It is proposed that from 1 May 2025:
## High value goods tax
A high value goods tax is expected to be introduced at the rate of 5% to 10% on certain high-value items, such as jewellery and watches, based on the threshold of price. The implementation date was proposed to be on 1 May 2024. Its implementation has since been deferred as the government focuses on other fiscal reforms.
## e-Invoicing
The government is in the process of implementing e-Invoicing. The implementation will be carried out in stages as follows:
## Windfall profit levy
With effect from 1 January 2025, the crude palm oil threshold value for windfall profit levy will be increased to MYR 3,150 per metric ton for Peninsular Malaysia and MYR 3,650 per metric ton for Sabah and Sarawak.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
A company is tax resident in Malaysia in a basis year (normally the financial year) if, at any time during the basis year, the management and control of its affairs are exercised in Malaysia. Generally, a company is regarded as resident in Malaysia if, at any time during the basis period for a year of assessment, at least one meeting of the Board of Directors is held in Malaysia concerning the management and control of the company.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Under the tax treaties Malaysia has with its treaty partners, a non-resident of a treaty partner that derives business profits from Malaysia is generally subject to Malaysian income tax only if the non-resident has a PE in Malaysia. Under tax treaty arrangements, PE is determined in accordance with the provisions of the tax treaty.
Generally, under a tax treaty, a non-resident entity is regarded as having a PE in Malaysia if it has a fixed place of business in Malaysia, where the business of the entity is wholly or partly carried on. A non-resident company may also be deemed to have a PE in Malaysia under certain circumstances, such as the following:
Where there is no tax treaty, the business profits of a non-resident that are attributable to a place of business in Malaysia, as defined under the domestic law, will be subject to Malaysian income tax. The definition of place of business under the domestic law is largely based on the PE definition under the tax treaties; however, it is written more liberally and is therefore wider than the scope of the PE definition in tax treaties.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
## Capital allowance
Capital allowance (tax depreciation) on industrial buildings, plant, and machinery is available at prescribed rates for all types of businesses. Initial allowance is granted in the year the expenditure is incurred and the asset is in use for the purpose of the business. Annual allowance at the prescribed rates calculated on cost is given for every year during which the asset is in use at the end of the basis year for the purposes of the business. The following are examples of capital allowance rates currently available:
| Qualifying asset | Initial allowance (%) | Annual allowance (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Industrial building, whether constructed or purchased | 10 | 3 |
| Heavy machinery | 20 | 20 |
| General plant and machinery | 20 | 14 |
| Furniture and fixtures | 20 | 10 |
| Office equipment | 20 | 10 |
| Information and communications technology (ICT) equipment and computer software, including customised software | 40 | 20 |
| Motor vehicles\* | 20 | 20\* |
| Small value assets of less than MYR 2,000 (subject to a maximum total cost of MYR 20,000) | - | 100 |
\* Restrictions apply on maximum qualifying capital expenditure.
Accelerated capital allowance is available for certain types of industrial building, plant, and machinery, some of which include buildings used as a warehouse, buildings used as a school or an educational institution, computers, information technology equipment, environmental protection equipment, waste recycling equipment, and plant and machinery used in specific industries.
## Goodwill
Cost of acquisition of goodwill/amortisation of goodwill is not deductible, as these expenses are capital in nature.
## Start-up expenses
In general, start-up expenses incurred before the commencement of a trade, profession, or business are capital in nature, as they were expended to put the person in a position to earn income. However, there are specific deductions allowed, such as incorporation expenses and recruitment expenses (conditions apply).
## Interest expenses
Interest expense is allowed as a deduction if the expense was incurred on any money borrowed and employed in the production of gross income or laid out on assets used or held for the production of gross income. Where a borrowing is partly used to finance non-business operations, the proportion of interest expense will be allowed against the non-business income. For deductibility of interest expense in a cross-border controlled transaction, earnings stripping rules may apply. *See the*[*Group taxation*](group-taxation.html)*section for details*.
## Bad debt
Debts must be specifically identified and reasonably estimated to be irrecoverable to qualify for a tax deduction.
## Donations to charitable institutions
A deduction is allowed for cash donations to approved institutions (defined) made in the basis period for a year of assessment. The deduction is limited to 10% of the aggregate income of that company for a year of assessment.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are generally not deductible.
## Taxes
Taxes on income are generally not deductible, whereas indirect taxes are deductible.
## Net operating losses
Business losses can be set off against income from all sources in the current year. Utilisation of carried-forward losses is restricted to income from business sources only. Utilisation of capital allowance is also restricted to income from the same underlying business source.
Unutilised losses in a year of assessment can only be carried forward for a maximum period of ten consecutive years of assessment while unabsorbed capital allowance can be carried forward indefinitely. For dormant companies, the carryforward of business losses and capital allowances is not available for deduction in subsequent years of assessment if the company does not meet the shareholders’ continuity test.
Currently, there are no provisions to carry back losses to prior years of assessment.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
A Malaysian company can claim a deduction for royalties, management service fees, and interest charges paid to foreign affiliates, provided that these are made at arm’s length and the relevant WHTs, where applicable, have been deducted and remitted to the Malaysian tax authorities.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
## Group relief
A company that qualifies for group relief may surrender a maximum of 70% of its adjusted loss for a year of assessment to one or more related companies. The period in which a company may surrender its adjusted loss is limited to the first three consecutive years of assessment following the basis period for the year of assessment in which it commences operations, provided the basis period consists of a period of 12 months. The following conditions must be met by both the claimant and surrendering companies:
‘Related company’ is defined in the Income Tax Act 1967 and involves the application of a two-tier test. The companies are regarded as 'related' if:
Companies that wish to avail themselves of group relief must make an irrevocable election to surrender or claim the tax loss in the return to be filed with the Inland Revenue Board for that year of assessment.
## Transfer pricing
The Director General of Inland Revenue (DGIR) is empowered to make adjustments on transactions of goods and services if the DGIR is of the opinion that the transactions were not entered into on an arm’s-length basis.
The transfer pricing rules that apply to controlled transactions (defined, including financial assistance) specify the methods to determine the arm’s-length price and the circumstances under which the DGIR may re-characterise transactions. The advance pricing arrangement (APA) rules that apply only to cross-border transactions outline the application procedures for unilateral, bilateral, or multilateral APAs.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
The CbC Rules require that Malaysian multinational corporation (MNC) groups with total consolidated group revenues of MYR 3 billion to prepare and submit CbC reports to the tax authorities no later than 12 months after the close of each financial year. Malaysian entities of foreign MNC groups will generally not be required to prepare and file CbC reports as the obligation to file will be with the ultimate holding company in the jurisdiction it is tax resident in. However, the Malaysian entities of the foreign MNC group will have an obligation to inform/notify the tax authorities, by the end of its financial year, if it is the holding company or has been appointed as the surrogate holding company. If it is neither the holding company nor surrogate holding company, the Malaysian entities must notify the tax authorities of the identity and tax residence of the entity responsible for preparing the CbC report.
## Earnings stripping rules
The earnings stripping rules apply on interest expense (of more than MYR 500,000 in a basis period) in connection with or on any financial assistance granted in controlled transactions (as defined), whether directly or indirectly, to a person. The earnings stripping rules guideline narrows the application of the prescribed rules to cross-border controlled transactions.
The prescribed rules specify that the maximum amount of interest deduction allowed is 20% of the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) from each source consisting of a business. The interest expenses in excess of the maximum deduction allowed may be carried forward indefinitely to be deducted against future income. However, in the case of a company, the carry forward of the above-mentioned interest expenses would not be allowed if there is a substantial change in the company's shareholders in the following year.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no CFC rules in Malaysia.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
Malaysia has a wide variety of incentives covering the major industry sectors. Tax incentives can be granted through income exemption or by way of allowances. Where incentives are given by way of allowances, any unutilised allowances may be carried forward indefinitely to be utilised against future statutory income, except for certain incentives, such as reinvestment allowance and investment allowance for approved service projects, where a seven-year limitation applies.
In compliance with the Forum on Harmful Tax Practices (FHTP) criteria under the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action 5 (Countering Harmful Tax Practices More Effectively, Taking into Account Transparency and Substance), Malaysia has amended the legislation in relation to the tax incentives to:

## Pioneer status (PS) and investment tax allowance (ITA)
Companies in the manufacturing, agricultural, and hotel and tourism sectors, or any other industrial or commercial sector, that participate in a promoted activity or produce a promoted product may be eligible for either PS or ITA.
PS is given by way of exemption from CIT on 70% of the statutory income for five years and the remaining 30% is taxed at the prevailing CIT rate. ITA is granted on 60% qualifying capital expenditure incurred for a period of five years and is utilised against 70% of the statutory income, while the 30% balance is taxed at the prevailing CIT rate.
A company that intends to undertake reinvestment before expiration of its PS or ITA status may opt for reinvestment allowance, provided it surrenders its PS or ITA status.
The PS and ITA incentives are enhanced for the following types of projects:
| Qualifying industry | Pioneer status | | Investment tax allowance | |

## Intergovernmental agreements (IGAs)
The Malaysia-United States IGA was signed on 21 July 2021 to implement the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA).
Under the IGA, reporting Malaysia-based financial institutions will provide the Malaysian Inland Revenue Board with the required information of accounts of US persons. The information of which will then be exchanged between the Malaysian and US tax authorities.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
Malaysia is committed to exchanging CRS information from 2018. Under the CRS, Malaysian financial institutions (MYFIs) are required to collect and report financial account information on non-residents.
The reporting financial Institution is defined to mean any financial institution (FI):
Once an MYFI has applied the due diligence procedures in respect of the accounts it holds and has identified reportable accounts, it must report certain information regarding those accounts to the tax authorities. A reporting MYFI with no reportable accounts is required to make a nil return annually to the Malaysian Inland Revenue Board.

It is proposed that, with effect from year of assessment 2025, annual dividend income exceeding 100,000 Malaysian ringgits (MYR) received by resident individuals, non-resident individuals, and individuals holding shares through nominees is subject to a 2% tax on the chargeable dividend income after eligible tax deductions. This tax applies to dividend income distributed by resident companies.
## High value goods tax
A high value goods tax at the rate of 5% to 10% on certain high-value items, such as jewellery and watches, was originally planned to be implemented on 1 May 2024.

Interest paid to a non-resident individual by commercial banks, merchant banks, or finance companies operating in Malaysia is exempt from tax.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
The status of individuals as residents or non-residents determines whether or not they can claim personal allowances (generally referred to as 'personal reliefs') and tax rebates, and enjoy the benefit of graduated tax rates. Resident status is determined by reference to the number of days an individual is present in Malaysia. Generally, an individual who is in Malaysia for a period or periods amounting to 182 days or more in a calendar year will be regarded as a tax resident.
