# Guyana
## Overview
Last reviewed - 14 October 2024
Guyana is located on the north-eastern coast of South America and is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean, Venezuela, Brazil, and Suriname. Its total area is approximately 215,000 square kilometres (83,000 square miles). The country is divided into three counties: Essequibo, Demerara, and Berbice and ten administrative regions, with its capital residing in the City of Georgetown. 90% of the population lives on the coastal strip, while the Amerindians (Guyana’s indigenous people) mainly inhabit the savannahs and forest regions.
Guyana is a republic within the British Commonwealth. It became independent on 26 May 1966 and operates under a written Constitution (1980) with a form of government based on the Westminster System, with an elected Head of State. The official language is English and the population, as at the 2012 census, is approximately 747,884. The legal system is based mainly on the English common law; however, vestiges of a Roman-Dutch legal system remain, especially in the area of land tenure. The currency is the Guyanese dollar (GYD).
Guyana’s economy consists mainly of industries dependent on the utilisation of natural resources (e.g. agriculture, mining, fishing, timber). The main agricultural exports are rice and sugar, while bauxite and gold are the major mineral exports. The oil and gas industry is in the early stages of development, with Guyana currently being one of the prime targets for petroleum exploration with its offshore basin and, to a lesser extent, its inland Takatu Basin currently attracting a great deal of interest from petroleum exploration companies.

Last reviewed - 14 October 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year is the calendar year. Tax is assessed during a tax year on income earned during the year of assessment, which is generally the calendar year preceding the tax year. Companies with an accounting year other than a calendar year may, however, be allowed to account for taxes by adopting their accounting year as their income year.
## Tax returns
Tax returns must be filed by 30 April of the tax year.
## Payment of tax
Corporate tax is payable in advance quarterly instalments on the preceding year's tax liability. Advance tax payments are due on 15 March, 15 June, 15 September, and 15 December of the calendar year prior to the tax year. However, the Commissioner General may require the company to calculate the payments based on estimated income for the current year.
Any balance of tax due must be paid by 30 April of the tax year.
### Penalties
Failure to file a tax return and pay the balance due by 30 April of the tax year incurs a further charge of 10% on the outstanding tax. Failure to pay the balance of taxes due by 30 April of the tax year incurs a penalty of 2% per month and interest at 18% per annum. A flat fee of GYD 50,000 will be applied to each loss/deficit return submitted after the prescribed time.
## Tax audit process
The tax authority is the Guyana Revenue Authority.
## Statute of limitations
A company carrying on business in Guyana is required to keep proper accounts and records and is required to retain these accounts for a period of at least eight years after the completion of the transactions, acts, or operations to which they relate.
The Commissioner is empowered to raise an assessment for tax or additional tax within seven years after the expiration of the year of assessment.
The following issues are currently being focused on by the tax authorities:

Social security contributions are due on monthly earnings of employees up to GYD 280,000 and weekly earnings up to GYD 64,615. The rates of contribution are 8.4% for employers and 5.6% for employees.

Resident companies are liable to tax on their worldwide income. Non-resident companies that carry on a trade or business in Guyana are subject to tax on the income that is derived from Guyana.
The current rates of corporate tax are as follows:
| Type of company | Corporate tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Telephone companies | 45 |
| Commercial companies \* | 40 |
| Other companies (non-commercial) | 25 |
| Both non-commercial and commercial | 25/40 |
| Small business engaged in manufacturing and construction services and registered with the Small Business Bureau | 25 |
\* A commercial company is one that derives at least 75% of its gross income from goods not manufactured by it or if it is engaged in telecommunication, banking, or insurance (other than long-term insurance).
## Minimum Corporation Tax (MCT)
Commercial companies (other than insurance companies) are subject to tax at the rate of 40% of chargeable profits or 2% MCT of turnover, whichever is higher. Any excess MCT over tax at the normal rate is carried forward for setoff against corporate tax payable in subsequent years, provided that in no year is the tax payable reduced to less than 2% of turnover.
## Local income taxes
There are no additional income taxes imposed on companies.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 14 October 2024
Corporate residence is determined by reference to the location of the central management and control of the business of a company. There are no specific provisions within the law, and, as such, common law principles established by the courts are generally applied in determining residence. The place of incorporation is regarded as merely one of the factors to be taken into account in determining where central management and control are located.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
There are no specific provisions in the legislation dealing with PEs; however, common law principles are generally applied.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 14 October 2024
There is no provision under the legislation for group taxation in Guyana. All companies are taxed separately.
## Transfer pricing
There is no transfer pricing legislation or rules in Guyana, although the issue has been discussed and is expected to be more formally considered in the future. However, the current Act contains a general anti-avoidance provision, and the tax authority monitors multinationals to ensure that their transactions are conducted at arm’s length and in conformance with the applicable tax legislation.
## Thin capitalisation
There are no thin capitalisation rules in Guyana.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
CFCs are not covered under Guyana tax laws.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 14 October 2024
A branch (an external company registered in Guyana) is subject to tax in Guyana on all income directly or indirectly accruing in or derived from its operations in Guyana. The tax rates applicable on branch profits are the same as on corporate profits. In addition, branch profits, after deduction of corporate tax and reinvestments, are subject to withholding tax (WHT) at the rate of 20%. The position noted may be varied by the provisions of any applicable double tax treaties (DTTs).

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 14 October 2024
Various tax incentives are available, depending on the nature of the industry that the companies are engaged in, including the following:
Tax holidays are granted in respect of pioneering activities, that is, to companies whose trade or business are wholly of a developmental and risk-bearing nature and likely to be instrumental to the development of the resources of and beneficial to Guyana.
This does not include trade or business carried on by a gold or diamond mining company or a company carrying on petroleum operations.
Tax holidays are granted for a period of up to ten years. In exceptional circumstances, the period may extend beyond ten years.
## Foreign tax credit
Foreign tax relief is available under DTTs with Canada, the United Kingdom, and Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM) countries.
Unilateral relief is also available for foreign taxes paid in non-treaty countries with tax systems and legislation similar to those in Guyana. For British Commonwealth countries, the relief is 50% of the relief that would be available if the foreign country were a treaty country. For other countries, the relief is 25% of such available relief. The available relief is the lower of the tax rate in Guyana and the tax rate in the other country.

## Employment income
Employment income includes salaries, wages, director fees, overtime pay, leave pay, sick bonus, stipends, commissions, compensation for termination of service, and the estimated value of any accommodation provided.
### Equity compensation
There are no formal rules or laws governing the treatment of equity compensation, and, as such, any such benefit received by an employee will be taxed in accordance with general principles and case law.
## Capital gains
## Dividend income
Dividends paid by resident companies to resident individuals are exempt from tax, while a 20% withholding tax (WHT) is charged on dividends paid to non-residents, subject to relief under a double taxation treaty (DTT) (e.g. 15%, 10%, or 0%).
## Interest income
Interest from savings accounts and other accounts with banks and financial institutions is subject to a 20% final WHT. If a person's total income from all sources is less than GYD 780,000, that person will be entitled to a refund of the tax withheld on the interest income.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 14 October 2024
An individual is deemed to be resident in Guyana where the individual resides in the country for more than 183 days in any year, resides permanently, or, being in Guyana, intends to reside there permanently. An individual will be regarded as ordinarily resident in Guyana if the individual is habitually resident in Guyana (i.e. resident in Guyana in the normal course of things).
