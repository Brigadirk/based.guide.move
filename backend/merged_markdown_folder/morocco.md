## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
## WHT on dividends
The WHT rate applicable to income from shares, units, and similar income is set at 12.5% for FY 2024.
The WHT rate will progressively evolve, from 2023 to 2026, until it reaches 10%.
## WHT on interests
The standard WHT on interest paid to non-resident entities is set at 10% as provided by the Moroccan law (unless reduced by treaty). However, the Moroccan law provides that interest on loans granted in foreign currency with a maturity exceeding ten years is exempt from WHT.
## WHT on services paid to non-resident entities
According to the Moroccan Tax Code, all payments of all kinds of services rendered by non-resident entities are subject to WHT at the rate of 10%.
However, it shall be noted that treaty dispositions limit the scope of application of WHT only to remunerations that constitute royalties. Such dispositions overrule the domestic tax law provided by the Moroccan law.
## Treaty WHT rates
Payments to non-resident corporations and individuals are subject to WHT, as shown below.
| Recipient | WHT (%) | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

2. The member states of the Arab Maghreb Union are Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia.
3. There is no limitation on WHT under the treaty.
4. The lower rate (i.e. 5%) usually applies to copyright royalties and other similar payments in respect of the production or reproduction of any literary, artistic, or dramatic work (excluding cinematographic and television films), while the 10% rate applies to other types of royalties.
5. The lower rate of 5% applies for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment.

## Overview
Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
The Kingdom of Morocco, a country located in the Maghreb region of North Africa, has a population of nearly 33 million and an area of 710,850 square kilometres. Morocco is a constitutional monarchy with an elected parliament. The political capital is Rabat, and the largest city is Casablanca; other large cities include Marrakesh, Tetouan, Tangier, Salé, Fes, Agadir, Meknes, and Oujda. The official language of Morocco is Arabic, and its currency is the Moroccan dirham (MAD).
Morocco is a young and dynamic country that has attracted increasingly more investments since the privatisation programme started in 1993 and due to the liberalisation of its markets.
Foreign investments in Morocco have expanded from the traditional domains of textiles, fishing, and agriculture to those presenting greater added value, such as energy, infrastructure, transport, telecommunications, financial services, and others.
The European Union (EU) is Morocco’s primary trading partner, providing 65% of Morocco’s imports and receiving 70% of Morocco’s exports.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is levied under the Moroccan Tax Code and is due on all industrial, commercial, and handicraft transactions taking place in Morocco, as well as on importation operations.
The 2024 Finance Act provided for gradual transition to the following rates: 0%, 10%, and 20% over the period from 2024 to 2026.
The following table summarises the VAT rates applicable in FY 2024.
|  | FY 2024 VAT rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Electricity | 16 |
| Electricity generated from renewable energies | 12 |
| Urban transport operations and road transport of passengers and goods | 13 |
| Other passenger and freight transport operations | 16 |
| Services provided to insurance companies by direct marketers or insurance brokers | 12 |
| Economic cars | 10 |
| Water intended for public distribution networks, as well as sewerage services and water meter rental operations, other than those relating to water intended for domestic use. | 10 |
| Refined sugar | 8 |
The sale of goods is considered as taking place in Morocco, and thus subject to VAT, if the goods sold are delivered in Morocco.
The sale of services is considered as taking place in Morocco, and thus subject to VAT, if the services sold are consumed or used in Morocco or when the service is provided remotely in digital form by a non-resident person with no place of business in Morocco to a customer whose registered office, place of business, or tax domicile is in Morocco, or to a customer who occasionally resides in Morocco.
Two types of exemptions from VAT are provided. The first is an exemption with credit, equivalent to the zero-tax concept. The second is an exemption without credit.
The zero-rated supplies include (but are not limited to) supplies of the following goods or services:
Exempt supplies without deduction right include (but are not limited to) supplies of the following goods or services:
### VAT withholding tax (WHT)
The 2024 Finance Act introduced a VAT WHT system applicable to two categories as follows:
#### VAT-registered suppliers of equipment
WHT must be levied on VAT due on taxable transactions carried out by suppliers of equipment who fail to present a recent certificate of tax compliance (issued by tax authorities within the past six months).
Companies carrying out transactions outside the scope of VAT or exempt from VAT without the deduction right are not required to operate the WHT.
#### VAT-registered service providers
75% of invoiced VAT in respect of the supply of services listed by regulation should be withheld by the following entities:
The following operations are excluded from the VAT WHT:
## Customs duties
Importation of goods in Morocco gives rise to payment of importation duties, the VAT on importation, and the special tax on importation called *Taxe Parafiscale à l’Importation* (TPI).
Customs duties are computed on the basis of the *ad valorem* value of the goods at the time of their entrance into Morocco.
Customs duties can be reduced if the imported products are covered by free trade agreements signed by Morocco or other specific regulatory dispositions.
Under Moroccan tax law, the importation operations are subject to VAT at the rate of 20%. A lower rate of 10% applies to specifically designated importations.
The Moroccan tax law also offers some economical customs regimes that provide VAT exemptions with credit (equivalent to zero rate).
The TPI rate is 0.25% levied on the value of the imported goods.
## Excise taxes
Excise taxes apply to specific products imported or produced in Morocco, such as tobacco, alcohol, and lubricants.
## Professional tax
A professional tax is levied on individuals and enterprises that carry out a professional activity in Morocco.
The tax consists of a tax on the rental value of business premises (rented or owned) and fixed assets. The tax rates range from 10% to 30%, with exemption for the first five years of activity.
The rental value is exempted for the portion of cost exceeding MAD 50 million.
## Registration duties
Registration duties are due on all written or verbal conventions, such as property transfer of real estate, shares, or rights; company set up; equity increase; and goodwill transfer.
The rates of registration duties range from 1% to 6%. A flat rate of MAD 200 is also applicable to specific operations and conventions.
The applicable rate for the transfer of goodwill is 6%.
## Payroll taxes
Individual income tax on salaries is paid by way of withholdings made by resident employers.
## Social security contributions
The only mandatory social security regime in Morocco is the one managed by the CNSS fund (*Caisse Nationale de Sécurité Sociale*).
The CNSS rates are as follows and apply to the gross salary, excluding exempted allowances and indemnities:
| Contribution | Employee portion (%) | Employer portion (%) | Computation basis ceiling (MAD) |

## Taxable period
The taxable period corresponds to 12 months. The first taxable period can be less than one year but should never exceed it.

In case the CIT of the year exceeds the sum of the four instalments, the company should proceed to tax regularisation along with the submitting of the taxable income return after three months following the closing of the fiscal year (i.e. 31 March for fiscal year corresponding to the calendar year). Otherwise, the exceeding tax amount should be offset against the following instalments without limitations.

Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
## Revision of value-added tax (VAT) rates
The 2024 Finance Act introduced a gradual convergence towards two VAT rates (10% and 20%) over the period 2024 through 2026, as follows:
|  | VAT rate (%) | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fiscal year (FY) | | | |
| 2023 | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 |
| Electricity | 14 | 16 | 18 | 20 |
| Electricity generated from renewable energies | 14 | 12 | 10 | - |
| Urban transport operations and road transport of passengers and goods | 14 | 13 | 12 | 10 |
| Other passenger and freight transport operations | 14 | 16 | 18 | 20 |
| Services provided to insurance companies by direct marketers or insurance brokers | 14 | 12 | 10 | - |
| Economic cars | 7 | 10 | - | - |
| Water intended for public distribution networks, as well as sewerage services and water meter rental operations, other than those relating to water intended for domestic use. | 7 | 10 | 10 | 10 |
| Refined sugar | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
## VAT exemptions
Finance Law 2024 extended VAT exemption to certain basic consumer products as follows:
## VAT withholding tax (WHT)
The 2024 Finance Act introduced a VAT WHT system applicable to two categories as follows:
### VAT-registered suppliers of equipment
WHT must be levied on VAT due on taxable transactions carried out by suppliers of equipment who fail to present a recent certificate of tax compliance (issued by tax authorities within the past six months).
Companies carrying out transactions outside the scope of VAT or exempt from VAT without the deduction right are not required to operate the WHT.
### VAT-registered service providers
75% of invoiced VAT in respect of the supply of services listed by regulation should be withheld by the following entities:
The following operations are excluded from the VAT WHT:
## VAT on digital operations
Finance Law 2024 expanded the scope of VAT to cover digital operations.
Services supplied remotely by a non-resident person with no establishment in Morocco to:
are now subject to VAT.
A service provided remotely in a dematerialised manner is every service rendered via a remote communication tool, including intangible and other immaterial goods.
## Revision of the corporate income tax (CIT) rates
The 2023 Finance Bill fixed the applicable CIT rates as follows:
Still, the target rates of 20% and 35% rates will not be applicable until January 2026. As such, CIT rates will progressively evolve, from 2023 to 2026, as follows:
|  | CIT rate (%) | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fiscal year (FY) | | | | |
| 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 |
| Evolution of the CIT rate for companies with net taxable income lower than MAD 300,000 | 10.00 | 12.50 | 15.00 | 17.50 | 20.00 |
| Evolution of the CIT rate for companies with net taxable income ranging from MAD 300,001 to MAD 1 million | 20.00 | 20.00 | 20.00 | 20.00 | 20.00 |
| Evolution of the CIT rate for companies with net taxable income higher than MAD 1 million and lower than MAD 100 million | 31.00 | 28.25 | 25.50 | 22.75 | 20.00 |
| Evolution of the CIT rate for companies with net taxable income of MAD 100 million or more | 31.00 | 32.00 | 33.00 | 34.00 | 35.00 |
## Social solidarity contribution (SSC)
The 2023 Finance Act extended the application of the SSC for corporate profits and professional income for the years 2023, 2024, and 2025.
The contribution is calculated as follows:
### SSC calculation method and applicable rates for companies
For companies, the SSC is calculated on the net taxable profit of the previous fiscal year according to the following proportional rates:
| Net taxable income (MAD) | SSC rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Between 1 million and 5 million | 1.5 |
| Between 5 million and 10 million | 2.5 |
| Between 10 million and 40 million | 3.5 |
| More than 40 million | 5.0 |
Companies subject to SSC must submit a declaration, by electronic means, according to a model established by the administration within three months following the closing date of the last accounting period. They must pay the amount of the contribution at the same time as the declaration referred to above.
## WHT on dividends
The 2023 Finance Law introduced a reform on the WHT rate applicable to income from shares, units, and similar income that extends to 2026. Thus, the target rate of 10% will not be applicable until January 2026. As such, the WHT rate on dividends will progressively evolve, from 2023 to 2026.
The WHT rate applicable to dividends is the one corresponding to the year in which these products were distributed as follows:
| Fiscal year | Applicable WHT rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| 2023 | 13.75 |
| 2024 | 12.50 |
| 2025 | 11.25 |
| 2026 | 10.00 |

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
Companies, whether or not established in Morocco, are subject to CIT on all profits or income relating to property that they own, activities that they carry on, and profit-making transactions that they carry out in Morocco, even when these are of an occasional nature.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The notion of PE is not explicitly defined under Moroccan tax law.
However, the Moroccan tax authorities apply this concept for non-resident companies according to some determined criteria that are inspired from the various tax treaties that Morocco has signed with other countries.
Indeed, the question of whether an entity will be deemed to have a PE in Morocco is a question of fact, in particular, subject to having, in Morocco, any fixed place of business through which a foreign entity conducts industrial or commercial activity for an indefinite or substantial period of time.
The term fixed place of business includes, for instance, a place of management or operations, a branch, an agency, a premises used as a sales outlet, a construction of assembly project, or a purchasing office. Also, in some specific cases, a non-resident company may be deemed as having a PE if it operates in Morocco through a dependent agent.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
## Depreciation
Fixed assets are normally depreciated according to their economic life duration according to the provision of the accounting regulation.
Depreciation is computed according to two methods: the straight-line method and the declining-balance method.
The tax regulation (through administrative guidelines) has provided indicative depreciation rates applicable when the company activity or the asset to be depreciated is specific or particular.
Indicative depreciation rates are as follows:
| Asset | Depreciation rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Business premises and buildings | 4 to 5 |
| Light construction (metal frame construction) | 10 |
| Production equipment, tools, and construction fittings | 10 to 15 |
| Huge computer facilities | 10 to 20 |
| Office furniture and software | 20 |
| Non-significant tools | 30 |
## Goodwill
Under Moroccan tax law, goodwill cannot be subject to amortisation. However, a decrease of the value of goodwill is allowed to be recorded through provisions.
## Start-up expenses
The development as well as incorporation expenses shall be capitalised and depreciated for tax purposes over a period of five years.
The carryforward of any loss due to the above expenses is limited to a period of four years.
## Interest expenses
Interest on loans granted by direct shareholders is deductible if the capital is fully paid in. Also, the deductible interest is limited to (i) the portion of the loan that does not exceed the share capital equity and (ii) the interest rate provided, annually, by the Ministry of Finance (2.22% in 2018).
## Bad debt
Bad debts that are definitively non-recoverable (after all recovery procedures have been undertaken) are treated, from a tax point of view, as deductible losses.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions made by companies are deductible only if they are granted to foundations and societies explicitly provided by law.
The contributions made to the community enterprise are deductible at up to 0.2% of the company turnover.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are not tax deductible expenses if they relate to infringements to legal and regulatory dispositions.
However, expenses relating to late payment penalties (calculated in accordance with the provisions of the law) should be tax deductible.
## Taxes
Taxes constitute deductible expenses, except CIT itself and recoverable taxes.
## Net operating losses
Tax losses may be carried forward for a period of four years from the end of the loss-making accounting period. However, the portion of a loss that relates to depreciation may be carried forward indefinitely.
A carryback mechanism is not allowed under Moroccan law.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments to foreign affiliates are allowed under Moroccan law. However, such payments should respect the arm’s-length principle and foreign exchange regulations.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
Under Moroccan law, consolidation or group taxation is not allowed.
## Transfer pricing
Morocco has a general provision within its tax legislation requiring transactions between related parties to be at arm’s length.
Where a Moroccan company is directly or indirectly connected with enterprises situated inside or outside Morocco, profits transferred indirectly to such enterprises, by means of increases or decreases in buying or selling prices or by any other means, must be included among taxable profits on the tax return.
In order to determine the amount to be included among taxable profits, Moroccan tax authorities will make comparisons with other similar companies carrying on normal business activities or by means of direct assessment based on information available to the tax authorities.
### Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
The Finance Act of 2020 has introduced CbC reporting.
The relating information will be exchanged automatically, subject to reciprocity, with the tax authorities of countries that have concluded a convention or agreement to this effect.
The filing obligation of the CbC report applies to a company established in Morocco when it meets the following criteria:
The filing obligation might also apply in some other situations.
A penalty of MAD 500,000 applies for not filing the CbC report or for filing it out of the due date.
This provision becomes effective for fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2021.
## Thin capitalisation
No specific thin capitalisation rules exist in Morocco.
However, the tax law restricts the interest rate on debts issued by shareholders and the basis of calculating deductible interests.
Interest incurred is tax deductible if the shareholder’s capital is fully paid. Additionally, the sum of the shareholder loans generating deductible interests should not exceed the equity capital subscribed, and the applicable interest rate should not exceed the official rate calculated annually on the basis of six months treasury bills.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no provisions for CFCs in Morocco.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
Non-resident entities are subject to income tax at normal CIT rates derived from all profits or income relating to property that they own, activities that they carry on, and profit-making transactions that they carry out in Morocco.
The taxation is levied to the portion of income allocable to the branch located in Morocco.
In addition, a 15% 'branch tax' applies to a non-resident’s after-tax profits. Some treaties may provide protection against the application of the branch tax.
For resident entities having branches in Morocco, the income is taxable in the hands of the head office at normal CIT rates.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
The Moroccan tax law provides several tax incentives for specific sectors of activities.
## Tourism companies
For companies operating in the tourism sector, the permanent exemption is replaced by a temporary exemption on their profits related to their export turnover during five years from the first export operation.
## Industrial companies
Industrial companies carrying out activities fixed by regulation and companies carrying out outsourcing activities inside or outside the industrial zones benefit from the total exemption from CIT during the first five consecutive fiscal years from the date of the beginning of their operation.
## Sports companies
Sports companies constituted in accordance with the provisions of Law n° 30-09 relating to physical education and sports, promulgated by the Dahir n° 1-10-150 of Ramadan 13, 1431 (24 August 2010), benefit from the total exemption from CIT for a period of five consecutive financial years from the first fiscal year of operation.
## Capital risk companies
## Casablanca Finance City
A law was enacted in 2010 for the setting up of a finance area in Casablanca, called, Casablanca Finance City.
The Casablanca Finance City statute may be granted to specific financial institutions as well as non-financial institutions that offer such services as auditing, fiscal, legal, financial, actuarial, and human resources management advisory.
The above statute may also be granted to regional and international headquarters.
Entities established in Casablanca Finance City are exempt, for their export turnover, from CIT during the first five years following the date they obtain the Casablanca Finance City statute. However, this exemption ceases to apply on expiry of the first 60 months following the date of incorporation of the companies concerned. These companies benefit from a reduced rate of 20% in subsequent years.
## Free trade zones (FTZs)
The activities that must be necessarily performed by the companies established in the FTZs are mainly the following (the activities may vary for each FTZ):
Entities established in FTZs are exempt, for their export turnover, from CIT during the first five years starting from the date of the beginning of their operation.
However, and notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary, this exemption does not apply to the following companies:
Temporarily, the tax regime in force before 1 January 2021 will remain applicable to companies established in industrial acceleration zones before that date (i.e. exemption for five years and taxation at 8.75% for the next 20 years).
## Listed shares
Non-resident entities are exempt from capital gains derived from the sale of stocks listed on the Casablanca stock exchange, excluding the shares of real estate entities.
## Foreign tax credit
Income tax paid on income earned from outside Morocco may be credited against CIT payable in Morocco if provided by treaty.

## Exchange controls
Foreign investors are allowed, following the accomplishment of some formalities, to freely transfer abroad the whole proceeds of their investments in Morocco (i.e. dividends, shares sale price, and liquidation income under the condition that the initial investment is realised in one of the foreign currencies listed by the Moroccan Central Bank).
However, some specific transfers of funds into and out of Morocco are subject to prior authorisations from the exchange control office.
## Choice of business entity
The legal vehicles used by foreign companies for the purpose of setting up a business in Morocco are the branch and the subsidiary.
Under subsidiary form, the foreign entities generally opt for the corporation (SA) or the limited liability company (SARL).
The SARL is most adequate for companies with low investment capital while the SA is most appropriate for companies that are investing an important amount of capital. In general, the rules relating to the organisation and functioning of an SARL are more flexible than those required for an SA.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
The categories of revenues and capital gains subject to IIT are the following:
## Salary revenues
The net taxable salary corresponds to the gross wage, including benefits and payments in kind or cash, granted to the employee reduced by the amount of social security contributions.
Some exemptions are provided (e.g. allowances granted to cover employment expenses).
### Pension revenues
Finance Laws 2020 and 2023 set a progressive scale for the deductions applied to pension revenues as follows:
Individuals resident in Morocco benefit from a reduction of 80% of IIT relating to pensions of foreign source duly repatriated to Morocco.
## Professional revenues
Under the standard regime, the tax basis of professional revenues is the difference between trading income and expenditure.
## Revenues derived from agricultural farms
### Low-scale individual farmers
Individual farmers that realise annual turnover of less than MAD 5 million qualify for a total exemption of IIT starting from 1 January 2014. If such individuals realise turnover that exceeds MAD 5 million in say year (n), they become liable to IIT in year (n), year (n+1), year (n+2), and year (n+3).
Moreover, such individuals qualify for a reduced rate of 20% during the first five fiscal years following the first year during which they become liable to IIT.
### Medium and large-scale individual farmers
Finance Law 2014 provides for a progressive approach to tax medium and large-scale individual farmers that realise annual turnover exceeding MAD 5 million.
As such, the above individuals realising annual turnover that exceeds MAD 35 million, MAD 20 million, or MAD 10 million should become liable to IIT, respectively, in 2016, 2018, and 2020.
Moreover, such individuals qualify for a reduced rate of 20% during the first five fiscal years following the first year during which they become liable to IIT.
## Real estate revenues and capital gains
### Real estate revenues
Rental income is subject to IIT (based on the gross amount) at the following rates:
### Real estate capital gains
Capital gains earned from the sale of properties by individuals are subject to a flat rate of 20% of capital gains. The tax amount cannot be lower than 3% of the selling price.
The capital gain derived from the sale of real estate is calculated as follows:
Capital gain = (selling price - selling expenses) - (updated purchasing price + purchasing expenses)
Where:
Capital gains derived from the sale of property benefit from an exemption of the IIT if it is used as a principal residence for at least six years.
## Revenues and capital gains on financial instruments
### Revenues on financial instruments
The IIT is levied on revenues of shares (dividends) as well as revenues of fixed income instruments (interests) at the following rates for 2024:
| Nature of revenue | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Dividends | 12.5 |
| Foreign source dividends | 15 |
| Interest earned by individuals, excluding those subject to real or simplified regime | 30 |
The net taxable revenue is determined by the gross amount of the financial instrument revenue less bank charges and account carrying charges.
### Capital gains on financial instruments
The IIT is levied on capital gains derived from the sales of shares, bonds, and other similar financial instruments at the following rates:
| Nature of capital gain | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Capital gains derived from the sale of listed shares | 15 |
| Capital gains derived from the sale of non-listed shares | 20 |
| Capital gains derived from the sale of bonds | 20 |
The net capital gain is the difference between:
Concerning bonds, the selling and acquisition prices correspond to the capital amount, excluding interest receivable but not yet due.
