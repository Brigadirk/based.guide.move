## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
## Social security/Unemployment insurance contributions
South Africa does not have a comprehensive social security system or a national healthcare program; consequently, no significant social security taxes are levied. Employees and employers are each obligated to make contributions to an unemployment insurance fund at the rate of 1% of gross remuneration. The employee's contribution is withheld by the employer. However, both the employer and employee's contributions are limited to a remuneration of ZAR 212,544 *per annum* per employee.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is an indirect tax that is largely directed at the domestic consumption of goods and services in South Africa. The tax is designed to be paid mainly by the ultimate consumer or purchaser in South Africa. It is levied at two rates, namely a standard rate (currently 15%) and a zero rate (0%).
Under the VAT system, vendors generally levy and account for VAT on taxable supplies made and are entitled to a deduction of the VAT incurred on expenses paid for purposes of making such taxable supplies. Only the ‘added value’ is therefore ultimately taxed.
Practically, VAT is a self-assessment tax, and vendors are required to submit periodic VAT returns. The two main tax periods are either monthly (generally for large vendors) and bi-monthly (which is the standard tax period issued by the SARS).
The amount of input tax that the vendor is entitled to for the specific tax period is set off against the output tax due to the SARS, and the net amount is either due and payable to or refundable by the SARS.
Very few business transactions carried out in South Africa are not subject to VAT. The tax is generally collected by businesses that are registered with the SARS as vendors on all taxable supplies throughout the production and distribution chain. Sales or supplies by non-vendors are not subject to VAT.
#### VAT registration and administration
##### Compulsory registration
All suppliers of goods and services having an annual turnover exceeding ZAR 1 million must register as a vendor and charge VAT on taxable supplies made in the course or furtherance of their enterprise.
In addition, where a person expects that its taxable turnover will exceed ZAR 1 million in the next 12 months in terms of a written contractual agreement, such person is also required to register as a vendor and levy VAT on the taxable supplies made in the course or furtherance of their enterprise.
Non-resident suppliers of electronic services are required to register for VAT once the value of taxable supplies has exceeded ZAR 1 million in any consecutive 12-month period.
##### Voluntary registration
A person may elect to register as a VAT vendor if their annual taxable turnover exceeds ZAR 50,000.
Notwithstanding this, where the turnover does not exceed this amount, there are some specific rules to consider in order to register voluntarily, as follows:
#### Taxable supplies
Standard-rated and zero-rated supplies are known as taxable supplies. Other supplies are known as either exempt supplies or non-supplies (i.e. supplies that are not subject to VAT).
#### Goods and services
‘Goods’ are corporeal movable things, fixed property, and real rights in such things and property. ‘Services’ are very broad and encompass not only traditional services like consulting or legal advice but includes the granting, assignment, cession, or surrender of any right or the making available of any facility or advantage.
#### Electronic services
‘Electronic services’ are defined quite broadly and include any supply of services by means of an electronic agent, electronic communication, or the Internet for a consideration. Further changes to these regulations are expected in the near future.
A non-resident supplier of electronic services will be regarded as conducting an enterprise in South Africa if two of the following criteria are applicable:
#### Imports
Goods are subject to VAT on importation into South Africa. However, the VAT Act has a schedule setting out the specific goods that are exempt from VAT on importation.
Services imported by any person and used or consumed otherwise than for making taxable supplies is subject to VAT in South Africa. However, services imported wholly for taxable purposes is not subject to VAT in South Africa.
#### Zero-rated supplies
The VAT Act sets out supplies of goods or services that may be taxed at the zero rate. As VAT is a destination-based tax, exported goods and services may be zero-rated.
Special provision is also made to zero rate the following (amongst others):
Under a zero-rated supply, a vendor charges VAT at 0% on the value of the supply and obtains a credit for the VAT paid on taxable supplies utilised in the making of the zero-rated supplies.
#### Exempt supplies
The VAT Act sets out specific supplies of goods or services that are exempt from VAT. Examples of exempt supplies include financial services, residential rentals, non-international passenger transport by road or rail, and educational services. However, all fee-based financial services are subject to VAT at 15%.
No VAT is deductible on expenses incurred for the purpose of making exempt supplies.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
South Africa does not levy any net wealth/worth taxes.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Estate duty is levied on the dutiable amount of a deceased person’s estate. An abatement of ZAR 3.5 million is deducted from the net value of the estate in order to determine the dutiable amount, on which estate duty is calculated at the rate of 20% on the value of the estate to the extent that it does not exceed ZAR 30 million and at a rate of 25% to the extent that the value of the estate exceeds ZAR 30 million. A non-resident's estate will be subject to estate duty, but only the assets located in South Africa will be included in the estate for the purposes of the duty.
Donations tax is payable by South African resident individuals at a rate of 20% of the value of the donated property to the extent that this value does not exceed ZAR 30 million, and at a rate of 25% to the extent that the value of property donated exceeds ZAR 30 million. Exempt donations include those between spouses, donations to approved public benefit organisations and all other donations by an individual that, during the tax year, do not exceed ZAR 100,000 in aggregate.
## Property taxes
Local municipalities levy rates on land. These rates are based on a percentage of the municipal valuation of land and improvements, and vary by municipality. Generally, a higher rate is levied on properties zoned for business use.
## Luxury and excise taxes
Excise duty is levied on certain locally manufactured goods as well as their imported equivalents. A specific duty at a pre-determined amount is levied on tobacco and liquor. An *ad valorem* duty is levied on certain luxury goods and automobiles.
Relief from excise duty is available for exported products, and for certain products produced in the course of specified farming, forestry, and (limited) manufacturing activities.
## Other non-income taxes
### Transfer duty
Transfer duty is payable on the transfer of immovable property or rights in such property located in South Africa. The duty is payable by the person acquiring the property at the following rates:
| Value of property (ZAR) | Transfer duty rate |
| --- | --- |
| Not exceeding 1,100,000 | 0 |
| 1,100,001 to 1,512,500 | 3% on value above 1,100,000 |
| 1,512,501 to 2,117,500 | 12,375 plus 6% on value above 1,512,500 |
| 2,117,501 to 2,722,500 | 48,675 plus 8% on value above 2,117,500 |
| 2,722,501 to 12,100,000 | 97,075 plus 11% on value above 2,722,500 |
| Exceeding 12,100,000 | 1,128,600 plus 13% on value above 12,100,000 |
Transfers of immovable property that are subject to VAT are exempt from the transfer duty.
### Securities transfer tax (STT)
STT applies to the transfer of listed and unlisted securities. The tax rate is 0.25%, which is applied to the taxable amount in respect of the transfer of a security. The taxable amount is usually the consideration for which the security is purchased, or (if the consideration is less than the market value of the security) the market value of the security. If the consideration declared is less than the market value, or if no consideration was paid, STT will be payable by the company that issued the shares in question (or, in the case of listed shares, by a regulated intermediary). However, the company or regulated intermediary can then recover the tax from the person acquiring the shares. Slightly different rules apply in the case of listed securities.
### Skills development levy (SDL)
SDL is a compulsory levy to fund education and training. It is payable by an employer and cannot be deducted from the remuneration payable to an employee. Small employers with an annual payroll of less than ZAR 500,000 are exempt from the levy. SDL is levied at the rate of 1% of payroll. It is payable monthly, together with income tax that the employer has withheld on its employees’ salaries.
### Workmen’s compensation
Employers are liable for workmen’s compensation, calculated by applying to the employee’s earnings varying rates depending on the employer’s industry. An exemption applies where an employee is employed in a private household only.
## Withholding taxes (WHTs)
The following WHTs apply to South-African sourced income payable to a foreign resident. The statutory rates may be reduced by double tax treaties (DTTs).

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
## Taxable period
The corporate tax year is the same as the company’s financial year. It may be changed upon application showing reasonable cause.
## Tax returns
Annual income tax returns must be submitted within one year from the end of the company’s tax year. The annual tax return includes a supplementary reconciling return where requested. Furthermore, schedules apply for CFCs, short-term insurers, mining companies, headquarter companies, and learnership allowances.
‘Signed off’ financial statements are required to be submitted with the annual tax return.
## Payment of tax
Payments are made with provisional returns filed at six-month intervals from the tax year-end based on an estimate of taxable income for the year. Interest is charged on any underpayment outstanding for more than six months after the tax year-end, except in the case of February year-ends, in which case it is seven months. Any balance (together with interest) is then paid following assessment.
## Tax audit process
There is no prescribed audit process, and an audit can be initiated by any factor as determined by the SARS. The audit or inspection will commence with a request from the SARS for the taxpayer to make available any such records or information as may be required.
## Statute of limitations
Tax debts to the state prescribe after a period of 15 years. Tax returns submitted that have been assessed may not be reopened after a period of three years from date of assessment by the SARS or five years if it is a self-assessment by the taxpayer, unless there has been fraud, misrepresentation, or non-disclosure by the taxpayer.
The prescription period may be extended by three years in the case of an assessment by the SARS or by two years in the case of self-assessment in respect of certain complex matters, such as transfer pricing and general anti-avoidance cases.
The SARS, in their 2020/21 to 2024/25 Strategic Plan, stated that the key strategic focus of the SARS will be the following:

#### Voluntary registration
A person may elect to register as a VAT vendor if their annual taxable turnover exceeds ZAR 50,000.
Notwithstanding this, where the turnover does not exceed this amount, there are some specific rules to consider in order to register voluntarily, as follows:
### Taxable supplies
Standard-rated and zero-rated supplies are known as taxable supplies. Other supplies are known as either exempt supplies or non-supplies (i.e. supplies that are not subject to VAT).

‘Electronic services’ are defined quite broadly and include any supply of services by means of an electronic agent, electronic communication, or the Internet for a consideration. Further changes to these regulations are expected in the near future.
A non-resident supplier of electronic services will be regarded as conducting an enterprise in South Africa if two of the following criteria are applicable:
### Imports
Goods are subject to VAT on importation into South Africa. However, the VAT Act has a schedule setting out the specific goods that are exempt from VAT on importation.
Services imported by any person and used or consumed otherwise than for making taxable supplies is subject to VAT in South Africa. However, services imported wholly for taxable purposes is not subject to VAT in South Africa.

Examples of exempt supplies include financial services, residential rentals, non-international passenger transport by road or rail, and educational services. However, all fee-based financial services are subject to VAT at 15%.
No VAT is deductible on expenses incurred for the purpose of making exempt supplies.
## Customs duties
Customs duties are charged on importation of goods into South Africa at rates ranging between 3% and 45%. In addition, import duties may also include anti-dumping and countervailing duties of up to 150%. No customs duties are charged on trade between South Africa and Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, and Swaziland, as these five countries constitute the Southern African Customs Union.
The Agreement establishing the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) came into effect on 1 January 2021 with the aim to boost intra-African trade. On 31 January 2024, South Africa launched the start of preferential trade under the Agreement, and the following countries are now eligible to trade with South Africa under the Agreement: Algeria, Cameroon, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, and Tunisia. For other African countries (excluding South African Development Community [SADC] countries, which trade under the SADC Trade Protocol), preferential trade under AfCFTA is only possible once the tariff schedules have been negotiated.
## Excise duties
Excise duty is levied on certain locally manufactured goods as well as their imported equivalents. A specific duty at a pre-determined amount is levied on tobacco and liquor products, and an *ad valorem* duty (calculated as a percentage of price) on certain luxury goods and automobiles. Relief from excise duty is available for exported products and for certain products produced in the course of specified farming, forestry, and (limited) manufacturing activities.
## Property taxes
Local municipalities levy rates on land. These rates are based on a percentage of the municipal valuation of land and improvements and vary from municipality to municipality. Generally, a higher rate is levied on properties zoned for business use.
## Transfer duty
Transfer duty levied on the sale of immovable property is payable by the person acquiring the property within six months from the date of acquisition at the following rates:
| Purchase price (ZAR) | Transfer duty rate |
| --- | --- |
| Not exceeding 1,100,000 | 0% |
| 1,100,001 to 1,512,500 | 3% on value above 1,100,000 |
| 1,512,501 to 2,117,500 | 12,375 plus 6% on value above 1,512,500 |
| 2,117,501 to 2,722,500 | 48,675 plus 8% on value above 2,117,500 |
| 2,722,501 to 12,100,000 | 97,075 plus 11% on value above 2,722,500 |
| Exceeding 12,000,001 | 1,128,600 plus 13% on value above 12,100,000 |
Transfers of immovable property subject to VAT are exempt from transfer duty.
## Securities transfer tax (STT)
STT is levied at a rate of 0.25% of the taxable amount in respect of the transfer of a security. The taxable amount is usually the consideration for which the security is purchased or the market value of the security if the consideration declared is less than the market value or if no consideration was paid. STT is payable by the company that issued the securities in question. However, the company can recover the tax from the person acquiring the shares. Slightly different rules apply in the case of listed securities.
## Payroll taxes
Employers are liable to withhold pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) on behalf of their employees. PAYE is payable to SARS on a monthly basis, calculated on the remuneration paid to an employee. The rates vary depending on the employee’s remuneration.
## Skills Development Levy (SDL)
SDL is a compulsory levy to fund education and training. It is payable by an employer and cannot be deducted from the remuneration payable to an employee. Small employers with an annual payroll of less than ZAR 500,000 are exempt from the levy. SDL is levied at the rate of 1% of payroll. It is payable monthly, together with income tax that the employer has withheld on its employees’ salaries.
## Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) contributions
Employers are required to contribute on behalf of their employees on a personalised basis to the UIF. The rate of contributions is 1% of gross remuneration payable to an employee, with a monthly cap of ZAR 177.12 per employee. Another 1%, subject to the same cap, is payable by the employee and withheld by the employer.
## Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act (COIDA) fund
Employers are liable for making annual contributions to the COIDA fund. COIDA contributions are a payroll cost that cannot be deducted from the employee’s salary, with a maximum salary cap per employee of ZAR 506,473 *per annum*. The rates vary depending on the employer’s industry.
## Donations tax
Disposals of assets below an adequate consideration are a deemed donations and subject to donations tax. Donations tax is payable by resident companies at a rate of 20% of the value of property donated to the extent that this value does not exceed ZAR 30 million, and at a rate of 25% of the value of property disposed of that exceeds ZAR 30 million. An annual exemption of ZAR 10,000 is available for companies.
Public companies, comprised of mostly listed companies, are exempt from donations tax. An exemption is also available for donations made to certain charities and other non-profit organisations.
## Vehicle emissions tax
An environmental levy is levied on passenger motor vehicles at a rate of ZAR 146 per gram of CO2 produced per kilometre over the first 120g of CO2 per kilometre, and at a rate of ZAR 195 per gram of CO2 produced per kilometre over the first 175g of CO2 per kilometre (in the case of double cab passenger vehicles). These rates are applicable from 1 April 2024.
## Fuel levy
A fuel levy is included in the price of petroleum fuel sold. The general fuel levy for 2024/25 is 394 cents per litre of petrol and 380 cents per litre of diesel. From 3 April 2024, a carbon tax levy of 11 cents per litre (petrol) and 14 cents per litre (diesel) apply. A full or partial refund of the diesel general fuel levy may be claimed in certain industries, such as agriculture, fishing, mining and, temporarily, for manufacturers of foodstuffs.
## Electricity levy
## Tyre levy
A tyre levy is applicable at a rate of ZAR 2.30/kg.
## Sugar tax
A tax on sugar-sweetened beverages, in the form of the Health Promotion Levy on Sugary Beverages, was introduced on 1 April 2018. The base on which the levy is applied is the sugar content of the beverage. The current levy is 2.1 cents per gram for sugar content in excess of 4g/100ml.
## Air passenger tax
Passengers departing on international flights must pay air passenger tax at the rate of ZAR 100 on flights to Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, and Swaziland, and ZAR 190 on other flights. The tax is added to the price of the ticket.
## Carbon tax
With effect from 1 June 2019, carbon tax is levied on entities that conduct activities in South Africa and that have 'scope 1' greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions exceeding a certain threshold. Generally, the threshold is thermal capacity of 10MW, but the exact threshold is determined with reference to the activity conducted by the entity.
The tax is levied in respect of the sum of the GHG emissions of a taxpayer in respect of a tax period (i.e. every calendar year, with the exception of the first tax period, which commenced on 1 June 2019 and ended on 31 December 2019).
Generally, scope 1 GHG emissions comprise direct emissions, being emissions from owned or controlled sources (as opposed to scope 2 or 3 GHG emissions, which are indirect emissions).
Carbon tax returns are required to be submitted (and any carbon tax due must be paid) in July of the year following the relevant tax period.
The tax rate for carbon tax for 2024 is ZAR 190 per ton of CO2-equivalent emissions. The rate trajectory increases steeply from 1 January 2025 onwards (i.e. 2025 - ZAR 236, 2026 - ZAR 308, 2027 - ZAR 347, 2028 - ZAR 385, 2029 - ZAR 424, and 2030 - ZAR 462).
Tax-free allowances are currently available to reduce the carbon tax liability to a maximum of 95% of taxable emissions. Taking into account the allowances, the effective tax rate is currently much lower and ranges between 5% and 40% of the statutory rate. Allowances will likely decrease over time.

Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year for individuals ends at the end of February. In exceptional cases accounts may be drawn up to a different date. Spouses are taxed separately and must submit separate returns.
## Tax returns
The date for the filing of returns is fixed each year by government notice. Individuals with a single source of taxable employment income below ZAR 500,000 do not need to submit tax returns.
SARS also issues auto-assessments to certain individuals calculated using data received from employers, medical schemes, banks, retirement annuity funds, and other institutions. If the taxpayer is in agreement with the auto-assessment, no further action is required in the case of a refund due, while payment must be made before the due date if owing SARS. The taxpayer must complete and file a tax return if not in agreement with the auto-assessment. The date for the filing of the return is fixed by government notice.
## Payment of tax
Pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) WHT is withheld on remuneration for employment. Where PAYE deductions are made from remuneration, these deductions constitute nothing more than advance payments toward the liability for normal tax.
Individuals earning non-remuneration income are required to register as provisional taxpayers and must make two provisional tax payments per year, the first by the end of August and the second by the end of February, based on an estimate of taxable income for the year.
## Tax audit process
There is no prescribed audit process and an audit can be initiated by any factor as determined by SARS. The audit or inspection will commence with a request from SARS for the taxpayer to make available any such records or information as may be required.
## Statute of limitations
Tax debts to the state prescribe after a period of 15 years. Submitted tax returns that have been assessed may not be reopened after a period of three years from date of assessment unless there has been fraud, misrepresentation or non-disclosure by the taxpayer.
High net worth individuals and trusts are currently a focus of SARS, as well as automatic exchange of information between tax authorities. Since October 2021, SARS has appointed a new director of its unit for high net worth individuals to renew its focus on conducting investigations into individuals and families, as well as commencing lifestyle audits for individuals.

# South Africa
## Overview
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
South Africa, which became a republic in 1961 and transitioned to a constitutional democracy in 1994, is a middle-income, emerging market with an abundant supply of natural resources, such as gold, platinum, and diamonds. It has well-developed financial, legal, communications, energy, and transport sectors. The Johannesburg Stock Exchange is the 16th largest in the world and the largest in Africa by market capitalisation. South Africa's currency is the rand (ZAR). South Africa has 12 official languages, including English, and three capitals: Pretoria (administrative), Bloemfontein (judicial), and Cape Town (legislative).
Following a substantial slowdown in economic growth resulting from the global financial crisis of 2007/08 (South Africa experienced negative growth of nearly 2% in 2009), the South African economy experienced a muted recovery, with gross domestic product (GDP) growth peaking at 2.2% in 2013. From 2014 to 2019 GDP growth ranged between 0.2% and 1.5%. In 2020, GDP shrank by 6.4% in real terms due to the COVID-19 pandemic. GDP growth for 2021 and 2022 was 4.9% and 2%, respectively, while the economy grew at 0.6% in 2023. The 2024 growth forecast remains at 1.1%.
The Monetary Policy Committee of the SARB has a targeted inflation band of 3% to 6%. The average inflation rate for 2023 was 6.0%. Headline inflation dipped in 2024 to 2.8% (October 2024) and is projected to stay below 4% until mid-2025.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
A South African (SA)-resident company is subject to CIT on its worldwide income, irrespective of the source of the income. Non-residents are taxable on SA-source income.
For tax years ending before 31 March 2023, the CIT rate applicable to the corporate income of both resident and non-resident companies is a flat 28%. This rate is reduced to 27% with effect for years of assessment ending on or after 31 March 2023.
Small business corporations that meet the requirements (including only natural persons as members/owners and with gross income of not more than ZAR 20 million) are taxed at the following rates for tax years ending on any date between 1 April 2024 and 31 March 2025:
Special CIT rates apply in certain industries, such as gold mining and long-term insurance (*see below*).
## Alternative turnover-based tax for very small companies
To reduce the compliance costs for very small companies, a turnover-based presumptive tax is available. Companies with a turnover of less than ZAR 1 million per year can elect to pay this tax instead of normal CIT, at a rate ranging from 0% to 3%, depending on the level of turnover.
## Dividends tax
Dividends tax is imposed at 20% on dividends declared and paid by all resident companies as well as by non-resident companies in respect of shares listed on a South African exchange.
Dividends are tax exempt if the beneficial owner of the dividend is an SA-resident company, SA-retirement fund, or other prescribed exempt person.
The tax must be withheld by the company that pays the taxable dividend or, where the dividend is paid by a ‘regulated intermediary’, by the regulated intermediary (generally, this applies to listed shares). In the case of *in specie* dividends (i.e. dividends paid 'in kind’ or dividends other than dividends paid in cash), the company declaring the *in specie* dividend is liable for the dividends tax (and not the beneficial owner of the dividend).
Exemptions from dividends tax and treaty-imposed reduced rates only apply if the beneficial owner of the dividend has made a prescribed declaration and undertaking to the paying company or regulated intermediary.
## CIT for mining companies
Special rates of normal tax, based on a standard formula, are prescribed for companies mining for gold. Companies mining for other minerals are subject to the same rate of normal tax that applies to ordinary companies.
## CIT for long-term insurance companies
Life insurance companies are required to follow the ‘five-funds approach’, with policies divided into five funds, depending on the nature of the beneficiary. Each fund is then allocated assets according to the risk carried by the fund. Each of the five funds is treated as a separate taxpayer and taxed at the rate applicable to that type of fund. These rates are 30% for individual policyholder funds, 0% for untaxed policyholder funds, and the standard CIT rate for company policyholder funds, risk policy funds, and corporate funds (a corporate fund being the company itself).
## Local income taxes
No local government taxes on income apply to either SA-resident or non-resident companies.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
## Social security/Unemployment insurance contributions
South Africa does not have a comprehensive social security system or a national healthcare program; consequently, no significant social security taxes are levied. Employees and employers are each obligated to make contributions to an unemployment insurance fund at the rate of 1% of gross remuneration. The employee's contribution is withheld by the employer. However, both the employer and employee's contributions are limited to a remuneration of ZAR 212,544 *per annum* per employee.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is an indirect tax that is largely directed at the domestic consumption of goods and services in South Africa. The tax is designed to be paid mainly by the ultimate consumer or purchaser in South Africa. It is levied at two rates, namely a standard rate (currently 15%) and a zero rate (0%).
Under the VAT system, vendors generally levy and account for VAT on taxable supplies made and are entitled to a deduction of the VAT incurred on expenses paid for purposes of making such taxable supplies. Only the ‘added value’ is therefore ultimately taxed.
Practically, VAT is a self-assessment tax, and vendors are required to submit periodic VAT returns. The two main tax periods are either monthly (generally for large vendors) and bi-monthly (which is the standard tax period issued by the SARS).
The amount of input tax that the vendor is entitled to for the specific tax period is set off against the output tax due to the SARS, and the net amount is either due and payable to or refundable by the SARS.
Very few business transactions carried out in South Africa are not subject to VAT. The tax is generally collected by businesses that are registered with the SARS as vendors on all taxable supplies throughout the production and distribution chain. Sales or supplies by non-vendors are not subject to VAT.
#### VAT registration and administration
##### Compulsory registration
All suppliers of goods and services having an annual turnover exceeding ZAR 1 million must register as a vendor and charge VAT on taxable supplies made in the course or furtherance of their enterprise.
In addition, where a person expects that its taxable turnover will exceed ZAR 1 million in the next 12 months in terms of a written contractual agreement, such person is also required to register as a vendor and levy VAT on the taxable supplies made in the course or furtherance of their enterprise.
Non-resident suppliers of electronic services are required to register for VAT once the value of taxable supplies has exceeded ZAR 1 million in any consecutive 12-month period.
##### Voluntary registration
A person may elect to register as a VAT vendor if their annual taxable turnover exceeds ZAR 50,000.
Notwithstanding this, where the turnover does not exceed this amount, there are some specific rules to consider in order to register voluntarily, as follows:
#### Taxable supplies
Standard-rated and zero-rated supplies are known as taxable supplies. Other supplies are known as either exempt supplies or non-supplies (i.e. supplies that are not subject to VAT).
#### Goods and services
‘Goods’ are corporeal movable things, fixed property, and real rights in such things and property. ‘Services’ are very broad and encompass not only traditional services like consulting or legal advice but includes the granting, assignment, cession, or surrender of any right or the making available of any facility or advantage.
#### Electronic services
‘Electronic services’ are defined quite broadly and include any supply of services by means of an electronic agent, electronic communication, or the Internet for a consideration. Further changes to these regulations are expected in the near future.
A non-resident supplier of electronic services will be regarded as conducting an enterprise in South Africa if two of the following criteria are applicable:
#### Imports
Goods are subject to VAT on importation into South Africa. However, the VAT Act has a schedule setting out the specific goods that are exempt from VAT on importation.
Services imported by any person and used or consumed otherwise than for making taxable supplies is subject to VAT in South Africa. However, services imported wholly for taxable purposes is not subject to VAT in South Africa.
#### Zero-rated supplies
The VAT Act sets out supplies of goods or services that may be taxed at the zero rate. As VAT is a destination-based tax, exported goods and services may be zero-rated.
Special provision is also made to zero rate the following (amongst others):
Under a zero-rated supply, a vendor charges VAT at 0% on the value of the supply and obtains a credit for the VAT paid on taxable supplies utilised in the making of the zero-rated supplies.
#### Exempt supplies
The VAT Act sets out specific supplies of goods or services that are exempt from VAT. Examples of exempt supplies include financial services, residential rentals, non-international passenger transport by road or rail, and educational services. However, all fee-based financial services are subject to VAT at 15%.
No VAT is deductible on expenses incurred for the purpose of making exempt supplies.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
South Africa does not levy any net wealth/worth taxes.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Estate duty is levied on the dutiable amount of a deceased person’s estate. An abatement of ZAR 3.5 million is deducted from the net value of the estate in order to determine the dutiable amount, on which estate duty is calculated at the rate of 20% on the value of the estate to the extent that it does not exceed ZAR 30 million and at a rate of 25% to the extent that the value of the estate exceeds ZAR 30 million. A non-resident's estate will be subject to estate duty, but only the assets located in South Africa will be included in the estate for the purposes of the duty.
Donations tax is payable by South African resident individuals at a rate of 20% of the value of the donated property to the extent that this value does not exceed ZAR 30 million, and at a rate of 25% to the extent that the value of property donated exceeds ZAR 30 million. Exempt donations include those between spouses, donations to approved public benefit organisations and all other donations by an individual that, during the tax year, do not exceed ZAR 100,000 in aggregate.
## Property taxes
Local municipalities levy rates on land. These rates are based on a percentage of the municipal valuation of land and improvements, and vary by municipality. Generally, a higher rate is levied on properties zoned for business use.
## Luxury and excise taxes
Excise duty is levied on certain locally manufactured goods as well as their imported equivalents. A specific duty at a pre-determined amount is levied on tobacco and liquor. An *ad valorem* duty is levied on certain luxury goods and automobiles.
Relief from excise duty is available for exported products, and for certain products produced in the course of specified farming, forestry, and (limited) manufacturing activities.
## Other non-income taxes
### Transfer duty
Transfer duty is payable on the transfer of immovable property or rights in such property located in South Africa. The duty is payable by the person acquiring the property at the following rates:
| Value of property (ZAR) | Transfer duty rate |
| --- | --- |
| Not exceeding 1,100,000 | 0 |
| 1,100,001 to 1,512,500 | 3% on value above 1,100,000 |
| 1,512,501 to 2,117,500 | 12,375 plus 6% on value above 1,512,500 |
| 2,117,501 to 2,722,500 | 48,675 plus 8% on value above 2,117,500 |
| 2,722,501 to 12,100,000 | 97,075 plus 11% on value above 2,722,500 |
| Exceeding 12,100,000 | 1,128,600 plus 13% on value above 12,100,000 |
Transfers of immovable property that are subject to VAT are exempt from the transfer duty.
### Securities transfer tax (STT)
STT applies to the transfer of listed and unlisted securities. The tax rate is 0.25%, which is applied to the taxable amount in respect of the transfer of a security. The taxable amount is usually the consideration for which the security is purchased, or (if the consideration is less than the market value of the security) the market value of the security. If the consideration declared is less than the market value, or if no consideration was paid, STT will be payable by the company that issued the shares in question (or, in the case of listed shares, by a regulated intermediary). However, the company or regulated intermediary can then recover the tax from the person acquiring the shares. Slightly different rules apply in the case of listed securities.
### Skills development levy (SDL)
SDL is a compulsory levy to fund education and training. It is payable by an employer and cannot be deducted from the remuneration payable to an employee. Small employers with an annual payroll of less than ZAR 500,000 are exempt from the levy. SDL is levied at the rate of 1% of payroll. It is payable monthly, together with income tax that the employer has withheld on its employees’ salaries.
### Workmen’s compensation
Employers are liable for workmen’s compensation, calculated by applying to the employee’s earnings varying rates depending on the employer’s industry. An exemption applies where an employee is employed in a private household only.
## Withholding taxes (WHTs)
The following WHTs apply to South-African sourced income payable to a foreign resident. The statutory rates may be reduced by double tax treaties (DTTs).

# South Africa
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
## Payments to residents
The only payments to residents that are subject to WHT are in respect of dividends, although dividend distributions to South African resident companies are exempt from dividends tax.
## Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Multilateral Instrument (MLI)
South Africa ratified the BEPS MLI in September 2022.
The MLI entered into force for South Africa on 1 January 2023 and applies to South Africa’s 'Covered Tax Agreements' that are affected:
There are slightly different effective dates for the modifications in respect of dispute resolution.
## Royalties payable to non-residents
Royalties and know-how payments made to non-residents for the use of or right to use IP rights in South Africa are deemed to be from an SA source. The payer of the royalty or know-how payment is obligated to deduct a WHT of 15% of this payment, which is a final tax payable by the recipient of such income.
## Dividends payable to non-residents
A dividend WHT of 20% applies to any dividend paid by a resident company to a non-resident or by a non-resident company to a non-resident where the shares in respect of which the dividends are paid are listed on a South African exchange. The tax is imposed on the beneficial owner of the dividend and not on the company, with the exception of *in specie* dividends. The payer of the dividend or regulated intermediary is required to deduct the 20% WHT from the payment.
## Interest payable to non-residents
A 15% WHT on interest applies to interest payable from an SA source to non-residents on certain debt instruments. The resident payer of the interest is required to deduct the 15% WHT from the payment.
## Service fees payable to non-residents
No domestic WHT is levied on fees payable to non-residents.
## Treaty rates for dividends, interest, and royalties
The WHT may be reduced by the terms of the relevant tax treaty, as shown below.
Note that the treaty rate is the maximum allowable rate to be charged by the treaty countries; where this rate is higher than the domestic tax rate, the latter will apply.

Any person who pays an amount to a non-resident in respect of the sale of immovable property in South Africa must withhold from the amount payable an amount equal to:
No WHT is levied if the amount is less than ZAR 2 million.
The amount so withheld is not a final tax for the non-resident seller. Instead, this amount is regarded as an advance payment of the non-resident seller's normal tax liability for the year of assessment during which the property is disposed of. The non-resident seller is still required to submit an income tax return for that year.

# South Africa
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
## Inventory valuation
Inventories generally are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Write-downs of inventory for slow-moving and obsolete items must be justified, and a general policy on a percentage basis is not permitted. Last in first out (LIFO) is not accepted for tax purposes.
## Capital gains
Although the capital gains tax forms part of income tax, the two taxes are not fully integrated. While gains realised by companies are taxed at the normal CIT rate, only 80% of gains are included in taxable income, making the effective capital gain tax rate for companies 22.4% for tax years ending before 31 March 2023 and 21.6% for tax years ending on or after 31 March 2023.
## Dividend income
Foreign dividends received by or accrued to an SA-resident taxpayer are included in income based on a formula and taxed at the normal CIT rate, which results in an effective tax rate of 20%. Qualifying foreign dividends are also generally not subject to tax where they are received by resident shareholders holding in excess of 10% of the equity shares and voting rights of the company declaring the dividend. Dividends received by residents holding less than 10% of such shares will generally be taxable in South Africa, subject to a tax credit for foreign taxes payable by the recipient shareholder.
### Stock dividends
Stock dividends (capitalisation issues of shares) are not subject to CIT or dividends tax.
## Interest income
Interest income of resident companies is taxed at the normal CIT rate.
Interest received by a non-resident company is only subject to CIT if the debt claim in respect of which it is paid is effectively connected with a PE of that non-resident company in South Africa during the tax year, and where that non-resident company is registered as a taxpayer in South Africa.
A 15% domestic withholding tax (WHT) applies to interest paid on certain debt instruments to non-resident companies and where the interest is not subject to CIT.
## Royalty income
Royalty income of resident companies is taxed at the normal CIT rate.
Royalty income received by a non-resident company is only subject to CIT if the property in respect of which the royalty income is paid is effectively connected with a PE of that non-resident company in South Africa during the tax year, and where that non-resident company is registered as a taxpayer in South Africa.
A 15% WHT applies to royalties paid to non-resident companies where the royalties are from a South African source and where the royalty is not subject to CIT.
## Foreign income
Foreign income of an SA-resident company is subject to tax in South Africa on the earlier of receipt or accrual. However, income that may not be remitted to South Africa in terms of the laws of the country where the amount arose is deferred until the income can be remitted. Double taxation may be avoided under certain DTAs or by way of unilateral credit or deduction for foreign tax payable on foreign income (*see Foreign tax credit in the [Tax credits and incentives](south-africa/corporate/tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section*).

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
A company is resident in South Africa if it is incorporated, established, or formed in South Africa or has its place of effective management in South Africa. However, a company that is deemed to be exclusively resident in another country in terms of a DTA is excluded from SA residency.
In terms of an Interpretation Note issued by the SARS, the place of effective management is regarded as the place where key management and commercial decisions that are necessary for the conduct of its business as a whole are, in substance, made. This approach is consistent with internationally accepted principles.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
South Africa does not, as a general rule, tax non-residents on the basis of having a PE in South Africa. Rather, non-residents are subject to income tax in South Africa on income derived from a South African source. The South African source rules deem income from the disposal of movable property that is effectively connected with a South African PE (as defined from time to time in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] Model Tax Convention) to be from a South African source.
Non-residents are subject to tax on capital gains realised on the disposal of any asset effectively connected with a South African PE (as defined from time to time in the OECD Model Tax Convention) of the person.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
## Depreciation and depletion
A depreciation (wear and tear) allowance may be deducted on movable assets used for the purpose of trade. There are no statutory provisions relating to rates of wear and tear, but the SARS has published a table of periods over which the assets may be written off. The rates of wear and tear, based on the cash cost, are calculated either according to the straight-line or diminishing-balance method.
New and unused machinery used in a process of manufacture or in a similar process is depreciable at the rate of 40% in the first year of use and 20% in the three following years. If the machinery is not new and unused, an allowance of 20% per year over five years is available.
An accelerated depreciation allowance (50% in the first year of use, 30% in the second, and 20% in the third year) applies to the machinery and articles used in farming, production of biodiesel or bioethanol, and production of energy from certain renewable sources. This allowance has been temporarily expanded to allow taxpayers to claim a 125% deduction in the first year for all renewable energy projects. The expanded incentive will only be available for investments brought into use for the first time between 1 March 2023 and 28 February 2025.
Specific allowances are also provided for pipelines, transmission lines, railway lines, rolling stock, ships, mining operations, and other qualifying industrial assets.
Buildings and other permanent structures may not be depreciated, apart from an annual allowance for each of the following:
An allowance for assets disposed of or scrapped during a year of assessment is determined by reference to the cost less allowances already granted and the proceeds on disposal (if any). Recoupments of allowances granted are taxable where disposal proceeds exceed the tax basis at the time of sale. Such recoupments cannot exceed the cost of the asset. Proceeds above cost will be taxed as a capital gain.
Book depreciation does not need to be consistent with tax depreciation.
No cost or percentage depletion is available for natural resources.
## Goodwill
The sale and purchase of goodwill is generally a transaction on capital account, and the person paying for the goodwill will usually be unable to claim a deduction. No capital allowances are available for goodwill.
## Start-up expenses
Special relief is provided for start-up (or pre-trade) expenditure to allow for a deduction in the year that trade commences. The expenses are only deductible if they would have been deductible had they been incurred after the commencement of trade. These expenses and any loss they create are ring-fenced and may only be deducted against income from the trade to which the start-up costs relate.
## Interest expenses
Generally, interest expenditure incurred in the production of non-exempt income and for the purposes of trade is deductible. However, interest that is incurred to produce income that is exempt from tax will not be allowed as a tax deduction. A special dispensation applies to the deduction of interest on debt used to acquire shares in a company, provided certain requirements are met.
Special rules apply to determine the amount of interest and timing of any deductions taking into account all payments and receipts in respect of debt instruments with interest being determined on the basis of an internal rate of return.
Certain debt instruments that are convertible to shares or may be settled in shares or where repayment is subject to solvency or related to connected-party debt with a maturity of 30 years or more are treated as hybrid debt instruments and no interest deduction is allowed in respect thereof. Certain hybrid interest is also treated as a dividend.
In addition, the interest deduction for interest paid between parties in a controlling relationship is limited where such interest is not subject to income tax or WHT on interest at the full domestic rate. Any excess interest may be carried forward to the following year for deduction. Effective for tax years ending on or after 31 March 2023, the scope of the interest limitation rules is expanded to include payments that are economically equivalent to interest, and the percentage for net interest expense will be limited to 30% of adjusted taxable income (i.e. tax EBITDA).
Further interest deduction limitations also apply to interest paid on debt used to fund acquisitions of shares or businesses under certain of the corporate rollover relief provisions (*see the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*).
The deduction of cross-border interest paid to connected persons is subject to transfer pricing rules (*see Transfer pricing and thin capitalisation in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*).
## Bad debt
Bad debts are tax deductible if the debt relates to an amount that has been included in the taxpayer’s taxable income in any tax year if it is due at the end of the year of assessment. A tax allowance is also provided for in respect of doubtful debts.
Any bad debts arising on loaned money is deductible if it was lent in the course of a money-lending business.
## Charitable contributions
Donations to certain charitable organisations approved as public benefit organisations are tax deductible, up to a maximum of 10% of taxable income.
## Cost of inventory
The cost of inventory is, in principle, deductible as soon as the inventory is acquired. However, at the end of each year, the cost of the inventory still on hand has to be added to the company’s income. Then in the next year, it can be deducted again. This has the effect of timing the deduction of the cost of inventory to match the time of its realisation.
## Assets acquired for shares issued
When assets are acquired by a company in return for shares issued to the seller, the purchaser of the assets is deemed to have incurred expenditure equal to the market value of the shares immediately after acquisition. Special rules apply in the case of a mismatch in the value of the shares and assets.
## Fines and penalties
Any fine or penalty imposed in respect of an unlawful activity carried out in South Africa, or in any other country where it would be unlawful in South Africa, is not deductible for tax purposes.
## Taxes
Most taxes (other than income taxes, donations tax, WHT on interest, and dividends tax) are deductible from taxable income for the corporation, provided they qualify for deduction under general rules.
## Net operating losses
Assessed losses may be carried forward indefinitely, provided an active trade or business of a similar nature is carried on without interruption. For tax years ending on or after 31 March 2023, companies with assessed losses will be entitled to set off any balance of assessed loss carried forward to the extent that the set-off amount does not exceed the higher of ZAR 1 million and 80% of the taxable income for that year.
Loss carrybacks are not provided for in South Africa.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Deductions may be claimed for royalties, managerial service fees, and interest charges paid to foreign affiliates, provided such amounts approximate those that would be paid to an unrelated party in an arm’s-length transaction.
Interest deductions may be limited in certain circumstances (*see Interest expenses above and Transfer pricing and thin capitalisation in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*).

# South Africa
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
Group taxation is generally not permitted in South Africa. However, relief is given for transactions between group companies to allow for reorganisations, provided certain requirements are met.
In general, the relief will only apply to transactions between companies within the same group. A group of companies is defined as a controlling company and one or more controlled companies in relation to that controlling company. A controlling company means a company holding, directly or indirectly, at least 70% of the equity shares of any other company. Foreign-incorporated companies do not form part of a group of companies for the purposes of this relief unless effectively managed in South Africa, although relief is extended to controlled foreign companies (CFCs) in certain circumstances.
Corporate rollover relief is available for asset-for-share transactions, amalgamation transactions, intra-group transactions, unbundling transactions, and transactions relating to liquidation, winding-up, and deregistration.
The relief may cover the capital gains tax arising from the disposal of capital assets, income tax arising from the disposal of a depreciable asset, income tax arising from the disposal of trading stock, donations tax arising from the disposal of an asset, dividends tax, VAT, securities transfer tax, and transfer duty.
## Transfer pricing and thin capitalisation
South Africa has transfer pricing legislation applying to cross-border transactions involving connected persons. The transfer pricing legislation applies the arm’s-length standard.
The transfer pricing legislation does not separately address transfer pricing and thin capitalisation. Rather, thin capitalisation is simply treated as a potential breach of the general arm's-length standard (i.e. in relation to the level of funding).
Where a transfer pricing adjustment is required to be made, that adjustment is subject to a secondary adjustment where it is deemed to be either a dividend or a donation.
In addition, South Africa has formally adopted the OECD’s three-tiered documentation approach, and certain taxpayers are required to electronically submit Country-by-Country Reports, Master File, and/or Local File returns within 12 months of the end of their financial year.
The SARS has also, in recent years, expanded the transfer pricing questions contained in the CIT returns. In answering these questions, taxpayers are required to make a full disclosure of all requested information, as well as any information that may be relevant.
A pilot bilateral advance pricing agreement programme will be introduced in the near future.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
If one or more residents together, directly or indirectly, hold more than 50% of the voting or participation rights in a foreign company, then it is a CFC in relation to those residents. The income of a CFC is imputed to the residents in proportion to their holdings, subject to certain exclusions and tax credits, where applicable. The most notable exclusions are for high-taxed CFCs and for income attributable to ‘foreign business establishments’.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
Non-residents of South Africa are subject to tax on income derived from a source in South Africa. SA branches of foreign companies are not considered to be separate legal entities for tax purposes, and no tax is withheld on transfers of profits to the head office. Branches of foreign companies are taxed at a rate of 28% (for tax years ending before 31 March 2023) and are not liable for dividends tax or any branch profits repatriation tax. The CIT rate is reduced to 27% for tax years ending on or after 31 March 2023.
Note that a branch must register as a taxpayer and submit tax returns. Separate financial statements must be drawn up for the SA branch. For all practical purposes, the SARS will treat the branch as a separate entity. For example, inter-branch cost recoveries levied by the head office incurred in the production of SA income normally will be allowed as a deduction by the branch, although this treatment is not extended to interest on inter-branch loans.
In terms of DTAs, the taxation of branches is limited to cases where the branch constitutes a PE.

# South Africa
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
## Foreign tax credit
The South African Income Tax Act makes provision for a rebate against CIT in respect of foreign taxes paid on foreign-sourced income or a deduction against income of foreign taxes paid on SA-sourced income. In both instances, the taxpayer must be an SA resident, the income must be included in taxable income, and that income must have been subject to a foreign tax that is not recoverable. The rebate is limited to the total normal tax payable calculated by applying the ratio of the total taxable income attributable to the foreign tax to the total taxable income. The deduction, however, may not exceed the income on which the foreign tax was levied.
The current costs related to certain R&D activities carried on in South Africa are 150% deductible, subject to pre-approval by a government-appointed approval committee. The cost of machinery and other capital assets acquired for the purposes of R&D may be depreciated 50% in the first year of use, 30% in the second, and 20% in the third year. Buildings used in the process of R&D may be written-off over a 20-year period.
The incentive has been amended (mainly to simplify the current incentive and also to make it easier to administer), and the incentive (in the amended form) is available for a period of ten years from 1 January 2024.
## Headquarter company regime
A ‘headquarter company’ regime encourages the use of South Africa as a location for intermediate holding companies.
The main benefits offered to a headquarter company are:
The requirements for a headquarter company are as follows:
## Industrial policy projects
In 2008, a ZAR 20 billion incentive package for investors in energy efficient projects was announced. The incentive is available for industrial projects participating in the manufacturing sector (other than alcohol or alcohol-related products, tobacco or tobacco-related products, arms and ammunition, and biofuels, which have a negative impact on food security). Companies are divided into those with a qualifying status and those with a preferred status. The status is determined in terms of a point system.
The proposed project must either be a ‘brownfield project’ (expansion or upgrade of an existing industrial project) or a ‘greenfield project’ (a wholly new industrial project, which uses new and unused manufacturing assets). Approved projects may be granted a tax allowance known as an additional investment allowance equal to 55% (100% if located in an industrial development zone) of the cost of any manufacturing asset used in an industrial policy project with preferred status or 35% (75% if located in an industrial development zone) of the cost of any manufacturing asset used in any other approved industrial policy project.
The additional investment allowance may not exceed ZAR 900 million in the case of any greenfield project with a preferred status, ZAR 550 million in the case of any other greenfield project, ZAR 550 million in the case of any brownfield project with a preferred status, or ZAR 350 million in the case of any other brownfield project.
In addition to the above, a company may also claim a deduction known as an additional training allowance.
Note that although the incentive has now expired, industrial-policy projects approved before 31 March 2020 continue to be entitled to the Section 12I benefits.
## Special Economic Zones (SEZs)
An SEZ incentive was introduced for companies carrying on business in certain approved SEZs comprising of a reduced corporate tax rate of 15% as well as a 10% allowance in respect of the cost of new and unused buildings owned by a qualifying company or any new or unused improvements to any building owned by a qualifying company.
In addition, employment incentives were introduced for employers carrying on a trade in an SEZ that will allow for an employees' tax reduction for the employer in respect of qualifying employees, up to a prescribed monthly amount.
VAT and customs relief are also available if the business is located within a Customs Controlled Area.
The incentive ceases to apply in respect of any year of assessment commencing on or after 1 January 2031.
## Energy efficiency savings
The energy efficiency savings incentive provides an income tax deduction to qualifying taxpayers. The deduction equates to ZAR 0.95 for each kilowatt hour (or equivalent) saved by the taxpayer during the relevant year of assessment against a baseline from the beginning of the year.
The incentive has been extended to 31 December 2025.
## International shipping incentive
Income from international shipping of a resident company that holds a share in a South African flagged ship is exempt from income tax. Qualifying shipping companies can also use a currency other than the rand as the functional currency.
## Training contracts (learnership agreements)
There is an incentive that encourages employers to train employees in a regulated environment to facilitate skills development and job creation. This tax incentive is available for registered training contracts and allows for an additional income tax deduction (i.e. in addition to the usual deductions for remuneration expenses) for employers. The sunset date for the incentive has been extended from 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2027.

# South Africa
## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
## Intergovernmental agreements (IGAs)
South Africa entered into an agreement with the United States to improve international tax compliance and to implement the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). The date of entry into force was 28 October 2014.
South Africa is also a party to the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance on Tax Matters as well as a number of bilateral tax information exchange agreements. As a signatory to the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information, also referred to as the Common Reporting Standard (CRS), South Africa enacted domestic enabling legislation. The first exchange date was September 2017. South Africa also has bilateral CRS agreements with Hong Kong, Qatar, and Singapore.
South Africa has also entered into a number of Bilateral Country-by-Country (CbC) Competent Authority Agreements to exchange CbC reports.
## Base Erosion and Profit shifting (BEPS)
South Africa is a member of the OECD’s Inclusive Framework on BEPS and has been amongst the first adopters of BEPS Actions in general. Notably, South Africa:
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
On 9 October 2020, updated CRS regulations were published in the Government Gazette. These regulations replace earlier regulations from 2016 and introduce mandatory disclosure rules and administrative procedures in relation thereto.
The mandatory disclosure rules introduced ensure access to information on CRS Avoidance Arrangements and Opaque Offshore Structures for purposes of ensuring compliance with the CRS and the effective implementation of the anti-avoidance rules.
Broadly, the rules follow the OECD’s model mandatory disclosure rules to identify and counter offshore structures and arrangements that are designed in an attempt to circumvent financial account reporting under the CRS.
Although the definitional portions of the rules are effective from 1 June 2021, an intermediary’s obligation to disclose a CRS Avoidance Arrangement or Opaque Offshore Structures to the SARS comes into effect on 1 March 2024.
## Mandatory Disclosure Rules
The Tax Administration Act provides for the mandatory reporting of certain arrangements by persons who derive tax benefits or financial benefits from such arrangements, are promoters of the arrangement, or are parties to the arrangement.
Broadly, there are two types of reportable arrangement:
If an arrangement is a reportable arrangement, it is required to be reported by a person to the SARS within 45 business days of it becoming a reportable arrangement or of the person becoming a participant in the reportable arrangement. A person need not disclose the reportable arrangement if a written statement is obtained from another participant that the reportable arrangement has been disclosed.
## Crypto Asset Reporting Framework
In November 2023, South Africa joined 47 other countries in agreeing to adopt the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework.
## Exchange control
South Africa has exchange control regulations that aim to restrict the buying and selling of a national currency or to preserve foreign currency reserves.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
## Employment expenses
Certain limited expenses may be deducted by employees from their employment income. Such expenses include business-related travel, automobile, and entertainment expenses, with the amount that is deductible by an employee also being limited to the amount of the relevant allowance that is granted to the employee by their employer. A capital depreciation deduction is also available for allowance assets used in the course of employment. Legal fees incurred in respect of employment income are also deductible.
As a general rule, allowances (subject to certain limits), granted to an employee by an employer to meet business expenditure are taxable in South Africa, but only to the extent that they are not so expended for business or exceed the maximum limit for deduction. Allowances to meet purely domestic or private expenditure, such as the cost of living, are taxable.
## Personal deductions
### Charitable contributions
Donations to certain approved public benefit organisations are allowed as deductions, up to a maximum of 10% of taxable income.
### Medical expenses
Medical scheme contributions for taxpayers and their dependants (subject to certain maximum limits) convert to a specified monetary amount tax rebate. This rebate can be set-off against the person’s tax liability (*see the [Other tax credits and incentives](other-tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for more information*). The conversion rate for persons over the age of 65 and persons with a disability is higher.
The contributions in excess of the specified credit amount as well as any other medical expenses are converted to medical tax rebates at a specified rate. Persons over the age of 65 and persons with a disability are subject to a higher conversion rate and are also not subject to a further threshold for the excess, which applies to persons under the age of 65 who have no disability.
### Income insurance policy
Premiums paid on a loss of income insurance policy as a result of death, disablement, severe illness, or unemployment are not allowed as a deduction. However, a corresponding exemption results in none of the proceeds being taxable.
### Retirement funds
Contributions to a pension, provident, or retirement annuity fund are deductible (subject to certain maximum limits), provided that such funds are registered in South Africa.
## Standard deductions
There are no other standard deductions from income for natural persons. The other deductions that may be claimed by persons earning remuneration income are limited (*see Business deductions below, for more information*).
## Business deductions
If the taxpayer is carrying on a business in their individual capacity or in partnership, the deduction of business expenditure or losses is available to them on the same basis as to companies.
Where the deductions and allowances permissible under the Income Tax Act exceed income, an assessed loss results which may be carried forward for set-off against income earned in future years. Assessed losses that are realised by an individual who falls into the highest tax bracket and that result from so-called 'secondary trades' (such as sports, arts, dealing in collectibles, hobby-farming, and rental of property) are ring-fenced in certain circumstances.
## Losses
Assessed losses incurred (deductible expenses exceed income) can be carried over to the next tax year to be set-off against the taxable income of that following year, provided that the taxpayer trades in that following year.
Taxpayers who earn employment income and are subject to income tax at the maximum marginal rate of 45% may, upon meeting certain requirements, have their losses from carrying on a secondary trade ring-fenced to that specific secondary trade.

## Treatment of trusts
The tax rate on the taxable income of a trust other than a special trust (special trusts being trusts created for the benefit of mentally or physically handicapped individuals and trusts created in terms of a will for the benefit of minor children that are relatives of the deceased) is 45%. Trusts do not qualify for the tax rebates referred to above. Special trusts are taxed at the rates used for individuals.
A trust that has been approved as a public benefit organisation is exempt from tax, unless it earns trading income in which case it would pay tax at a rate of 27% on its trading income.
Capital gains are included in a trust's taxable income at a rate of 40% for special trusts and 80% for all other trusts.
Trusts have to adhere to certain additional disclosure requirements relating to beneficial ownership and are also required to submit returns to the SARS regarding distributions made to beneficiaries.
Trusts are tax transparent for the most part where the income of the trust vests in a beneficiary in the same tax year. As of 2024, if the income of a South African trust vests in a non-resident beneficiary, the trust will be taxable on the income (i.e. instead of the non-resident beneficiary).
## Treatment of partnerships
Partnerships are treated as tax transparent with the partners being taxed on the income of the partnership and being entitled to any deductions that the partnership would have been entitled to in accordance with the profit-sharing ratio. New beneficial ownership disclosure requirements will be implemented in the near future.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
## Employment income
Taxable remuneration includes all cash amounts received for services rendered (including bonuses and allowances) as well as most benefits in kind (such as the use of assets and 'soft' loans). For non-residents, these amounts form a part of South African gross income if they are effectively connected to the person's employment in South Africa. There are no special concessions for short-term foreign employees, except under DTTs.
South African residents who receive employment income for performing their employment-related tasks in a foreign country are exempt from tax on the first ZAR 1.25 million of the employment income, provided that they have, during any 12-month period, spent more than 183 full days (including a continuous period of at least 60 full days) outside South Africa.
As of 2024, non-resident employers who conduct business through a PE in South Africa will be required to register for payroll taxes and withhold these taxes from employees' remuneration (where applicable).
## Equity compensation
Equity instruments acquired by virtue of employment or office held as director, whether from the employer or an associated institution in relation to the employer, are subject to income tax on the difference between the market value of the equity instrument and the consideration paid by the employee or office holder on the date that the equity instrument 'vests'.
Generally, an equity instrument will 'vest' when there are no restrictions attached to the instrument that affect the full and unencumbered ownership of the instrument.
## Business income
Self-employment income is derived from an unincorporated business, partnership, trade, or profession. Persons earning self-employment income could include partners in a partnership or persons earning commission or professional fees or income from independent services.
An amount received or accrued from self-employment will be taxable in South Africa. Non-residents will only be taxed on South African-sourced self-employment income.
## Capital gains
The maximum effective tax rate on capital gains is 18%. 40% of net capital gains realised are taxed at the normal income tax rates. An individual is entitled to an annual exclusion of ZAR 40,000 in determining the net capital gain for a year (in the year that the taxpayer dies, this annual exclusion is increased to ZAR 300,000).
All foreign capital gains realised by a South African resident are included in the South African tax net. For a non-resident, only the gains from the disposal of South African immovable property, interests in ‘land rich’ companies and the property of a South African permanent establishment (PE) are included.
Any disposal of South African immovable property by a non-resident is subject to WHT. Where the seller is a non-South African resident individual, the rate of WHT is 7.5%. This is not a final tax but an advance against the seller's actual tax liability for the year. Where it is expected that the actual tax liability will be less than the WHT, SARS may allow the WHT to be reduced.
Where an individual who is resident in South Africa disposes of a primary residence, up to ZAR 2 million of the capital gain will be exempt from capital gains tax (CGT). If the property has previously been leased or used partly for purposes of trade, an apportionment of the exclusion will apply.
## Dividend income
Dividends paid by South African resident companies (or by non-resident companies if the shares in respect of which the dividends are paid are listed on a South African exchange) to individual shareholders are generally subject to a 20% dividend withholding tax, regardless of residency of the shareholder. Most foreign dividends accrued to or received by South African residents are exempt from tax if the resident holds at least 10% of the equity shares and voting rights in the company. Most other foreign dividends are subject to tax at an effective rate of 20%.
## Interest income
Interest received by or accrued to an individual is taxable. However, an exemption applies to the first ZAR 23,800 of local interest income (ZAR 34,500 for taxpayers who are 65 years of age or older).
Non-resident individuals are exempt from income tax unless the individual is physically present in South Africa for more than 183 days in aggregate during the year preceding the date on which the interest accrues or the debt on which the interest arises is effectively connected to a PE in South Africa. This exemption aligns with the WHT on interest paid from a South African source to a non-resident, levied at a rate of 15%.
## Rental income
Rental income from fixed or movable property is included in taxable income subject to allowable expenses and losses being deductible against such income.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
If not ordinarily resident in South Africa, an individual is considered a South African resident if the individual is physically present in South Africa for more than 91 days, in aggregate, in the relevant tax year and each of the preceding five tax years, and also for more than 915 days, in aggregate, in the preceding five tax years. If a person, who has become a South African resident in terms of this physical presence test, spends a continuous period of at least 330 days outside South Africa, then the individual ceases to be a resident from the date of the beginning of the absence from South Africa.
On ceasing to be tax resident in South Africa, an individual’s qualifying worldwide assets are deemed to be disposed of on the day before their date of departure from South Africa. Any growth in value on the assets could trigger a capital gains tax liability. It should be noted that there are other tax return filing requirements for the year of assessment during which a natural person ceases to be a South African tax resident.
