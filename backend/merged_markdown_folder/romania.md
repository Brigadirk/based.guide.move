## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 25 April 2024
The standard CIT rate is 16% for Romanian companies, foreign companies operating through a permanent establishment (PE) in Romania and foreign companies that are tax resident in Romania due to place of effective management. Resident companies are taxed on their worldwide income unless a double tax treaty (DTT) stipulates otherwise.
The CIT due for nightclubs and gambling operations is either 5% of the revenue obtained from such activities or 16% of the taxable profit, whichever is higher.
## Minimum turnover tax (IMCA)
Taxpayers (other than credit institutions and oil and gas companies) that registered a turnover of over EUR 50 million in the previous year and for which the CIT is lower than the IMCA will be required to pay CIT at the level of the IMCA. In the case of a tax group, the IMCA is calculated by the responsible legal entity by summing all the group members’ turnovers.
As an exception, companies that have activities in the oil and gas sectors and that registered in the previous year a turnover of more than EUR 50 million will owe, in addition to the CIT, a specific turnover tax.
Credit institutions (i.e. Romanian legal entities and Romanian branches of credit institutions – foreign legal entities) are liable for a newly-introduced turnover tax in addition to the CIT.
Economic operators that exclusively conduct activities of distribution/supply/transport of electricity and natural gas that are regulated/licensed by the National Energy Regulatory Authority are exempt from the application of the IMCA.
## Micro-company tax regime
A Romanian legal entity can opt for the application of micro-company revenue tax in lieu of the standard CIT if it cumulatively meets the following conditions as of 31 December of the previous year:
The micro-company regime cannot be applied by Romanian legal entities conducting activities in banking; insurance and reinsurance of the capital market, including intermediation activities in those fields; gambling; or exploration, development, or exploitation of oil and natural gas deposits.
Romanian legal entities, with the exception of those that carry out activities corresponding to the CAEN HORECA (Hotels, Restaurants, Bars, and Coffee shops) codes, can opt to apply micro-company tax as of the fiscal year following that in which they meet the conditions. Romanian legal entities that carry out activities corresponding to the CAEN codes for HORECA can opt for the payment of micro-company tax (without having to fulfil the above conditions) or for the payment of CIT.
The tax rate on micro-company revenues is:
If a micro-company derives revenues of more than EUR 500,000 or its revenues from consulting and management are 20% or more of the total revenues during a fiscal year, it owes CIT as of the quarter in which they exceeded those limits.
The calculation and payment of tax for micro-companies shall be performed quarterly, by the 25th day (inclusive) of the month following the quarter for which the tax is calculated.
The dividend income received from a subsidiary located in another member state of the European Union can be deducted when calculating the micro-company tax, to the extent that both the micro-company and the subsidiary meet the EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive conditions.
## Local income taxes
There are no county or local taxes on corporate income.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 25 April 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate is 19%. The standard VAT rate is applied to all supplies of goods and services (including imports) that neither qualify for an exemption (with or without credit) nor for a reduced VAT rate.
VAT exemption without credit applies to a range of activities, including the supply of services in relation to banking, finance, and insurance. However, some financial services are subject to the standard VAT rate of 19% (e.g. factoring, debt collection, managing and safekeeping certain equity papers).
The VAT exemption without credit also applies to medical, welfare, and educational related activities if performed by licensed entities. Moreover, the following activities are exempt without VAT with the right of deduction:
There are also operations exempt with credit (i.e. deduction right for the related input VAT), such as the following:
### VAT consolidation
Companies established in Romania that are legally independent but are closely related in terms of financial, economic, and organisational purposes may choose to form a tax group, as long as they apply the same fiscal period. However, transactions between the members of the group fall within the scope of VAT.
### Place of VAT taxation
The rules for establishing the place of VAT taxation for supply of goods and services are determined based on the same rules as those presented in the EU 2006/112/EC and EU 2008/8/EC Directives. Services provided by non-resident entities to Romanian companies with deemed place of supply in Romania are subject to Romanian VAT under the reverse-charge mechanism, provided that no VAT exemption is applicable.
### Reverse-charge mechanism
Under the VAT reverse-charge mechanism, VAT is not actually paid, but only shown in the VAT return as both input and output tax, provided that both the beneficiary and the supplier are registered for VAT purposes.
As a rule, the reverse-charge mechanism applies either for intra-Community acquisitions of goods performed in Romania or for services performed by non-resident entities that are not established, nor have a fixed establishment, in Romania. Under the general rule, the place of supply of services is where the beneficiary is established or has a fixed establishment (e.g. consultancy, marketing, legal services).
### Limited VAT deduction right
The VAT deduction right related to the acquisition of road vehicles used for the transport of passengers and vehicles that meet certain characteristics, as well as the acquisition of fuel and all related services used for the respective vehicles, is limited to 50%, except for some specific exceptions (e.g. vehicles used by sales agents, taxis, transport services).
The right to deduct the tax related to the purchase, rental, or leasing of buildings/living spaces, regardless of their destination, located in residential areas or in housing blocks and the tax related to the expenses related to these buildings/spaces has been limited to 50% for the living area if they are not used exclusively for the purpose of the economic activity. The limitation applies as of the first day of the month following the date from which Romania receives for this measure a derogation decision regarding the provisions of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common VAT system.
### VAT compliance
The annual turnover threshold for VAT registration in Romania is the Romanian leu equivalent of EUR 88,500, computed based on the exchange rate from the date of EU accession (i.e. RON 300,000). Companies surpassing the VAT registration threshold will be liable to charge VAT for the advance payments received before registering for VAT purposes related to goods delivered/services performed after the registration date.
As a rule, the fiscal period is the calendar month. For taxable persons registered for VAT purposes whose previous year-end turnover (from taxable operations, VAT exempt, and outside the Romanian VAT scope operations with deduction right) did not exceed EUR 100,000, the fiscal period is the calendar quarter. Also, the fiscal period will change to the calendar month, if the taxpayer performs intra-Community acquisitions.
Taxable persons must keep complete and detailed records for calculation of VAT liabilities.
VAT return (300 Statement) should be submitted to the tax authorities by the 25th day of the month following the end of the fiscal period; the VAT payment is due by the same date. The VAT return can be submitted by electronic means.
The recapitulative statement for intra-Community transactions (390 Statement) should be submitted only by companies performing intra-Community transactions by the 25th day of the month following the one in which the intra-Community transactions were performed. The content of the 390 Statement has been changed by introducing an obligation to declare goods dispatched under the call-off stock regime from Romania to other member states starting with the transactions performed in February 2020.
Taxable persons not registered for VAT purposes in Romania and not required to register are liable to pay VAT and to submit a special VAT return in connection to services rendered by/provided to non-residents. These obligations should be fulfilled by the 25th day of the month following that when the services are supplied.
A taxable person registered for VAT purposes who does not exceed the threshold of RON 300,000 during the course of a calendar year may request de-registration from the VAT registered persons record between the first and tenth day of each month following the fiscal period used (month or quarter).
Starting with 2022, SAF-T has been implemented in Romania and additional reporting obligations arise at the level of the taxpayers. As per the legislation in force, the large taxpayers have the obligation to comply with the SAF-T reporting obligations starting with 2022. As an exception, banks, NBFIs, and assurance/reassurance companies are required to file the SAF-T statements starting with January 2023. Also, medium taxpayers are required to fulfil such obligations starting with 2023. Non-resident taxpayers registered only for VAT purposes in Romania will have the obligation to submit the declaration starting from 1 January 2025; the same deadline is also applicable in case of small taxpayers.
In February 2024, the Romanian tax authorities published the most recent structure of the SAF-T scheme to be used in Romania for SAF-T tax reporting.
### The cash accounting VAT scheme (CAVS)
The CAVS is optional for taxpayers with a turnover lower than RON 4,500,000 registered in the previous year and for newly founded companies. The right to deduct the input VAT for the acquisitions of goods/services from companies applying the CAVS is deferred until the date the payment is performed.
GO no. 278/2021 establishes the possibility of the taxpayer to apply the system at any time during the year. Also, the taxable persons who have been removed from the register of taxable persons applying the CAVS as of 1 March 2021 will have the possibility of continuing the application of CAVS, provided that they would have become eligible for application of CAVS according to the new rules.
### VAT quick fixes
The provisions of Directive 1910/2018, which establishes a common regulatory framework at the EU level for the simplification of call-off stock arrangements, allocation of transport for chain transactions, and the conditions for applying the VAT exemption for intra-Community supplies (the so-called 'quick fixes'), were transposed in the national legislation and entered into force on 3 February 2020, as follows:
#### VAT exemption for intra-Community supplies
The VAT exemption for intra-Community supplies of goods, other than new transport means or excisable goods, is not applicable in case the supplier does not correctly report the transactions in the recapitulative statement.
The provisions regarding the conditions for the application of VAT exemption for the intra-Community supplies are completed with the provisions of Regulation no. 1912/2018, which modifies EU Regulation no. 282/2011, introducing two relative presumptions regarding the documents necessary for proving the transport of the goods to another member state.
According to the Regulation, if the transport of goods is performed by the supplier, in order to prove that such transport took place, the supplier should hold two relevant items of evidence issued by two entities independent of each other, as well as of the supplier and the client. If the transport is performed by the client, additionally to the above-mentioned documents, the latter has to provide the seller with a written statement confirming that the goods were transported by the client. That statement should contain the issue date, the buyer’s name and address, the nature and quantity of the goods, the date and place of receipt of the goods, and, in the case of means of transportation, the vehicle identification number and the identification details of the person who accepted the goods in the buyer’s name. The statement should be provided by the tenth day of the month following the delivery.
In the above, it is presumed that the goods are transported to another member state if two of the following means of proof are held: documents relating to the dispatch or transport of the goods, such as a signed CMR document or note, a bill of lading, an air freight invoice, or an invoice from the goods carrier, or one means of proof of those previously mentioned and one document from the following: (i) an insurance policy with regard to the dispatch or transport of the goods, or bank documents proving payment for the dispatch or transport of the goods; (ii) official documents issued by a public authority, such as a notary, confirming the arrival of the goods in the member state of destination; or (iii) a receipt issued by a warehouse keeper in the member state of destination, confirming storage of the goods in that member state.
#### Call-off stock arrangements
The taxable person has to register for VAT purposes and declare an assimilated intra-Community acquisition of goods in the following situations: if any of the above-mentioned conditions are not met, if the goods stay in stock for more than 12 months, if the goods are destroyed or stolen, or if the goods are sent to another member state or exported.
#### Chain transactions
The transport is allocated only for the delivery performed by the operator to the intermediary operator. By exception, the transport is allocated to the supply performed by the intermediary operator if it communicated to the supplier its VAT registration code from the member state from which the goods are delivered.
## Customs and international trade
### Customs duties
Customs duties are those specified in the EU Common Customs Tariff and are expressed as a percentage applied to the customs value (i.e. *ad valorem* taxes), as a fixed amount applied to a specific quantity (i.e. *specific taxes*), or as a combination of the above.
Agricultural products (i.e. products from Chapters 1 to 24 of the EU Common Customs Tariff) are subject to specific taxation.
In certain cases (e.g. meat), the customs duty rate is established with regard to the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) or the entry price of the products. In other cases, the customs duty rate is established by adding additional duties, such as agricultural components, to the *ad valorem* tax.
### Customs value
The customs value is determined and declared by importers in accordance with the provisions of the Union Customs Code and its Delegated, Implementing, and Transitional Regulations, which took over the rules set up by the World Trade Organization (WTO) Customs Valuation Agreement (i.e. the Agreement pertaining to the implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs [GATT]).
### Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) status
Operators that obtain AEO status benefit from simplifications regarding customs controls, obtaining certain customs authorisations, and performing customs formalities.
Moreover, through the AEO authorisation, the holder is recognised by the customs authorities as a reliable partner, giving comfort as regards observance of the safety and security standards, and can benefit from easier admittance to certain customs simplifications.
Operators authorised as an AEO will be checked at least once every three years for assessing whether they comply with the certification criteria.
### Binding Tariff Information (BTI) / Binding Origin Information (BOI)
Companies can obtain rulings (BTI) from the Romanian customs authorities on the tariff classification of imported goods that are binding for the customs authorities for a three-year period, whenever goods identical to those described in the BTI are imported.
A similar type of ruling can also be obtained regarding the origin of goods (BOI). They are also valid for a period of three years from the date of issue.
The BTI and BOI shall also be binding for the holder of the decisions.
### Trade measures
For some agricultural products, the European Union generally imposes specific measures (e.g. values or quantitative allowances) on imports from other third countries. It is mandatory to obtain an import licence before importing such products.
Moreover, import/export licences from relevant authorities are also required for commodities regarded as potentially hazardous to human health or to the environment (e.g. some chemical products, certain types of waste and scrap), for commodities the end-use of which is controlled (e.g. explosives), or for dual use products (i.e. both civil and military).
## Excise duties
### Harmonised excise products
The following products are subject to harmonised excise duties: alcohol and alcoholic beverages, manufactured tobacco, energy products (e.g. unleaded gasoline, diesel, gas, coal), and electricity.
Excise duties are due when excise products are released for consumption (e.g. imported into Romania, taken out of an excise duty suspension arrangement).
Ethyl alcohol and other alcoholic products are exempt from the payment of excise duties if they are denatured and used in the pharmaceuticals or cosmetics industry.
Some energy products subject to movement control are exempted from excise duty, provided that an end-user authorisation is obtained and the payment of excise duties is secured.
Manufactured tobacco is also exempt from excise duties when exclusively intended for scientific and quality testing.
In some cases, traders can claim a refund of the excise duties paid (e.g. excise duty paid for goods released for consumption in Romania, but intended for consumption in other EU member states; excise duties paid for goods released for consumption and then returned to the production tax warehouse for recycling, reconditioning, or destruction; excise duties paid for goods released for consumption in Romania and then exported).
For cigarettes, the excise duty is equal to the sum of the specific excise duty and the *ad valorem* excise duty. The specific excise duty expressed in RON/1,000 cigarettes is annually determined based on the weighted average retail price, the legal percentage related to the *ad valorem* excise duty, and the total excise duty. The specific excise duty for cigarettes has been set at RON 543.81/1,000 cigarettes for the period 1 April 2024 through 31 March 2025.
The excise duty rate for ethyl alcohol is RON 4,629.75/hectolitre of pure alcohol.
The excise duty level for still fermented beverages, other than beer and wines, is set at RON 555.58/hectolitre of product, while the excise duty level for apple and pear cider and mead and fermented beverages from berries is nil.
The excise duty level for fermented sparkling beverages, other than beer and wines, is set at RON 66.34/hectolitre of product, while the excise duty level for apple and pear cider and mead is nil.
The excise duty level for intermediary products is set at RON 555.58/hectolitre of product, and the level for beer is set at RON 4.62/hectolitre/1 Plato degree.
The current levels of excise duties are RON 2,375.48/1,000 litres for leaded gasoline, 2,019.60/1,000 litres for unleaded gasoline, and RON 1,850.95/1,000 litres for diesel, respectively.
Companies selling fuel in gas stations have to register with the customs authorities. The same obligation applies for companies performing wholesales of fuel, alcoholic drinks, or tobacco products.
### Other excise products
Other excise products are:
Excise duties should be paid no later than the 25th day (inclusive) of the month following the one:
Economic operators performing directly intra-Community acquisitions/imports of such goods are entitled to request a refund of the excise duties paid if the products are exported, supplied to another EU member state, or returned to the supplier. For the production/intra-Community acquisitions/imports of such products, prior authorisation is requested.
## Property taxes
### Building tax
The building tax calculation method differentiates between buildings depending on their destination usage:
Local authorities have been granted the authority to increase local tax rates by 50%.
The increased tax rate for building tax due by legal entities is 5% (if no revaluation was performed during the last five years).
If a building was acquired during a fiscal year, the building tax for the entire year is due by the seller. The buyer is liable to pay the tax starting with the next year.
Building tax is paid annually, in two equal instalments, by 31 March and 30 September. For the payment of the entire annual tax by 31 March, a reduction of up to 10% is granted by the Local Council.
### Land tax
Owners of land are subject to land tax established at a fixed amount per square metre, depending on the rank of the area where the land is located and the area or category of land use, in accordance with the classification made by the Local Council.
Similar to building tax, land tax is paid annually, in two equal instalments, by 31 March and 30 September. A 10% reduction is granted for full advance payment of this tax by 31 March.
## Transfer taxes
There are no transfer taxes for companies for the transfer of property. The income derived from such a transfer will be included into the taxable profits of the company and will be subject to the flat tax rate.
## Stamp duty
For judicial claims, issue of licences and certificates, and documentary transactions that require authentication, stamp duty (in the form of notary fee) has to be paid.
## Payroll taxes and social security contributions
Employers withhold, on a monthly basis, the mandatory employee’s social security contributions (35%) and the income tax (10%) from the employee’s gross/taxable salary and wire the amounts to the Romanian tax authorities.
The employer pays an insurance contribution for work of 2.25% and social insurance contribution of 4% for uncommon work conditions and 8% for special work conditions.
Certain tax incentives apply until 31 December 2028 in the construction sector, agriculture sector, food sector, and IT industry, under certain conditions.
## Environmental taxes
For introducing on the national market packed goods/packaging materials, substances that are hazardous for the environment, tires/industrial oils/transport bags, electric and electronic equipment, batteries and accumulators, etc., companies have the obligation to declare and pay (by the case) related contributions to the Environmental Fund Administration.
### Packaging and packaging waste management
In certain cases (e.g. for the contribution related to packaging materials introduced on the national market), the contribution to the Environmental Fund Administration is enforced for companies that fail to achieve the annual packaging waste recovery/recycling targets (i.e. for FY23-FY24, the global recovery target is 65% and the global target for recycling is 60%). Thus, the contribution to the Environmental Fund Administration is currently RON 2/kg and is owed for the difference between the annual packaging waste recovery/recycling target stipulated by law and the packaging waste recovery/recycling target actually achieved by companies.
### Sale of waste
The economic operators that generate from their activities different types of waste streams and sell these items to waste collectors/recyclers have the obligation to pay a 2% contribution to the Environmental Fund Administration, amounting to 2% of the revenues obtained from the sale of all types of such waste.
Such contribution is withheld at source by the waste collectors/recyclers, which have the obligation to transfer the amounts to the Environmental Fund Administration.
### Transport bags
Companies must declare the number of transport bags introduced on the national market and pay, on a quarterly basis, the related contribution (i.e. ecotax), amounting to RON 0.15/piece, for all types of transport bags, except those made with materials complying with SR EN 13432: 2002 requirements, e.g. biodegradable bags made of compostable materials. The ecotax is distinctly identified on the sales documents and its value is visibly displayed at the point of sale in order to inform end-users. The acquisition and sale of transport bags with a thickness below 50 µ is banned as of 1 January 2019.
### Industrial oils
A tax amounting to RON 0.3/kg is levied (one time only) on industrial oils and lubricants introduced on the national market from outside Romania; the tax must be distinctly stipulated on the sale documents.
### Air emissions
Companies conducting activities that result in the discharge of air emissions from fixed sources (e.g. nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, persistent organic pollutants, heavy metal emissions, such as lead, cadmium, mercury) have to pay the contributions to the Environmental Fund Administration of between RON 0.02/kg and RON 20/kg.
### Electric and electronic equipment
Companies that introduce on the national market electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) have the legal obligation to declare and pay (should the legal targets not be met) to the Environmental Fund Administration a contribution (the amount of the contribution differs considering the type of equipment acquired) for the difference between the quantities of waste of electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) corresponding to annual collection targets imposed by law and the quantities effectively collected.
Economic operators owning WEEE, including those from EEE imported for their own use, are required to hand over WEEE to the entities specialized in collecting WEEE in order to fulfil their WEEE collection/recovery targets.
Companies may fulfil the annual targets imposed by law either individually or by concluding an agreement with an operator specialised in taking over the responsibility regarding WEEE.
### Batteries and accumulators
Economical operators introducing batteries and accumulators on the national market must hold evidence of the quantities and types of products introduced on the national market and must fulfil the minimum collection rates for the used batteries and accumulators. According to the legislation in place, economical operators that introduce on the national market batteries and portable accumulators have the obligation to declare and pay the related contribution of the mentioned products for the difference between the quantities of batteries and portable accumulators waste corresponding to annually collection targets imposed by law and the quantities effectively collected.
### The Deposit-Return System (DRS)
Starting from 30 November 2023, Romanians will pay a deposit of RON 0.50 for each drink purchased in glass, plastic, or metal packaging, ranging from 0.1 to 3 litres. These packages will be marked with the ’Packaging with Guarantee‘ logo, indicating their eligibility for the system. Guarantee recovery will only be possible for these properly labelled packages.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 25 April 2024
## Taxable period
The fiscal year is the calendar year or the period during which the entity existed if it was set up or ceased to exist during that calendar year.
Taxpayers with a financial year different from the calendar year have the option to align the tax year to the financial year. The first amended tax year will start on 1 January and will end on the last day of the amended tax year.
The period in which a taxpayer has to communicate to the territorial tax bodies the intention of changing the fiscal year period is within 15 days as of the beginning of the new fiscal year.
## Tax returns
Taxpayers (except for non-profit organisations and taxpayers deriving most of their income from agriculture) should submit the quarterly CIT returns by the 25th day of the first month following the first, second, and third quarters. The annual CIT return is due by 25 March of the following year for which the CIT is due (if the fiscal years equals the calendar year); for the cases where the fiscal year is different than the calendar year, the annual CIT return is due by 25th day of the third month after the end of the company’s fiscal year.
For the period 2021 - 2025, the deadline for submitting the annual CIT returns and for paying the related CIT applicable for taxpayers subject to OMF 1802/2014 is 25 June of the following year, or the 25th day of the sixth month following the end of the amended fiscal year.
Non-profit organisations and taxpayers that obtain income mainly from agricultural activities have to declare and pay annual CIT by 25 February of the year following the reporting period.
Taxpayers (except those specifically mentioned by law) may opt to declare and pay the annual CIT by performing quarterly advance payments (*see Payment of tax below*). The decision to implement this option has to be communicated by the 31 January of the fiscal year in which the taxpayer intends to apply the option and it has to be maintained for at least two consecutive years.
Starting with 1 March 2022, taxpayers have the obligation to enrol in the virtual private space (SPV) in order to submit to the tax authorities requests, documents, tax returns, or any other notifications. If the taxpayers do not fulfil their obligation to electronically communicate these documents and they are submitted to the tax authorities in letter format, they will not be taken into account.
The electronic signature of the tax returns can only be made using a qualified certificate issued by a legally accredited certification services provider.
Taxpayers required to withhold tax, except for salary payers, are required to submit a return to the tax authorities regarding the tax withheld for each beneficiary of income. This return should be submitted for the previous year by 31 January of the current fiscal year and refers to the tax withheld and paid by Romanian residents on income obtained from Romania by non-resident beneficiaries.
If taxpayers have failed to submit their tax returns, the tax authorities will assess, by way of default, all the tax obligations found in the taxpayer’s fiscal liability records for each fiscal period in which tax returns were not submitted.
## Payment of tax
Taxpayers (except for banks, non-profit organisations, taxpayers deriving most of their income from agriculture) must pay the quarterly CIT by the 25th day of the first month following the first, second, and third quarters. The final CIT payment is generally due by the 25th day of the third month after the end of the company’s fiscal year. Banks and branches of foreign banks in Romania are required to apply the system of advance quarterly CIT payments. For the period 2021 - 2025, the deadline for the final CIT payment for taxpayers subject to OMF 1802/2014 is by the 25th day of the sixth month following the end of the fiscal year.
Other taxpayers, with some exceptions mentioned by law, may use this system as an alternative reporting and payment procedure.
The advanced quarterly payments are calculated as a quarter of the previous year’s CIT increased by the consumer price index (CPI) inflation rate, with the payments due by the 25th day of the month following the end of the quarter. The CPI inflation rate is published by Order of the Ministry of Finance by 15 April of the year for which the advance payments are made. For 2023, the CPI inflation rate is 109.6%. If taxpayers incur fiscal losses in the first year of the application of the option, the advance CIT payments are calculated by applying the CIT rate to the accounting profit for the period in which tax payments are made in advance.
Non-profit organisations and taxpayers that obtain income mainly from crop production have to pay annual CIT by 25 February of the following year for which the tax is due.
Newly established banks and branches of foreign banks in Romania (i.e. without a previous year history) or those that incurred fiscal losses in the previous year make quarterly advance payments at the level of the amount resulted from applying the CIT rate on the accounting profit for the period for which the advance payment is made.
For the last quarter of the fiscal year, the deadline for the obligation to declare and make advance payment will be the 25th day of the last month of that fiscal year.
### Late-payment penalty
The late-payment interest rate is 0.02% for each day of delay. Subsequent late-payment penalties also apply.
The penalty is set at 0.01% per day of delay. This penalty does not apply to main tax obligations not declared or incorrectly declared by the taxpayer and is additionally established by a tax inspection authority decision.
In such a case, instead of penalties, a non-declaring penalty is applicable, at 0.08% per day, starting from the day following the due date until the date of payment. This penalty applies to the main tax obligations declared incorrectly or not declared by the taxpayer and is established by a tax inspection authority decision and is diminished to 0.02% per day if the fiscal liabilities are paid in due time.
## Non-resident companies
Capital gains derived by non-resident legal entities from the transfer of real estate located in Romania or the sale of shares in a Romanian legal entity are taxable in Romania at the 16% CIT rate (except if participation exemption or the DTT applies).
Even if no capital gain tax is due in Romania (or if a loss is generated), there are compliance obligations to fulfil (i.e. the non-resident should register for CIT purposes in Romania, file CIT returns, and then de-register).
Non-residents may appoint a tax agent/representative to fulfil this requirement.
For capital gains tax reporting and payment, the Romanian legislation requires the following tax returns to be submitted:
The quarterly returns and annual return must be submitted during the entire period in which the non-resident is registered with the Romanian tax authorities, even if, throughout that period, it no longer carries out transactions generating taxable revenue in Romania.
## Tax audit process
Tax inspections can be carried out in respect of all legal persons, irrespective of their organisational structure, that are bound to determine, withhold, and pay taxes, duties, contributions, and other amounts owed to the general consolidated budget.
The tax authorities may not inspect the same taxes for a period previously checked unless additional data is obtained of which the tax inspectors were unaware when carrying out the first inspection or computation errors were performed.
Prior to the tax inspection commencing, the tax authorities must notify the taxpayer in writing, by sending a tax inspection notice, except in the cases explicitly laid down in the Fiscal Procedure Code.
Tax inspections are generally carried out at the taxpayer’s business premises and may not exceed a six-month period in the case of large taxpayers or three months for other taxpayers. For taxpayers that have secondary offices, the tax inspections may not exceed six months. The tax authorities may suspend the tax inspection if they deem it necessary for the clarification of the taxpayer’s tax status.
Before finalisation of the tax inspection, the tax authorities are required to inform the taxpayer of their findings and the tax consequences and allow the taxpayer to express its point of view, within five or seven (for the large taxpayers) days from the ending of the tax inspection. Upon completion of the tax inspection, the authorities conclude a tax inspection report, based on which the tax assessment is made, which in turn is to be communicated to the taxpayer within 25 days from the ending of the tax inspection.
## Statute of limitations
As a general rule, the statute of limitation is five years and it begins to run on 1 July of the year following the one for which the tax obligation is due, provided the law does not dispose otherwise. However, the statute can be suspended during of a tax inspection but will recommence after the inspection has been completed.
Due to the COVID-19 crisis, the expiration of the statute of limitation period was suspended; as such, an additional 253 days were added to the five years statute of limitation.
Areas of focus during tax audits include:

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 25 April 2024
## Social contributions
Social contributions due by employers and employees on income derived from dependent activities are applied to a certain computation base.
Social contributions liabilities are assessed in line with the EU social security coordination rules and the provisions of the social security agreements Romania applies.
The general social contributions rates are established as follows:
Employee contributions:
The monthly assessment base is the gross income derived from dependent activities.
Employer contributions:
The monthly assessment base is the gross salary income derived by individuals, resident and non-resident, based on an employment contract (or a service relationship or special status), as well as revenues treated as salaries (administrators’ remuneration, director on mandate contract, etc.). Special exemptions are provided for each category of the social contributions.
Employers compute and withhold the social contributions when paying salaries. Social contributions must be declared and paid by the salary income payer to the relevant state budgets by the 25th day of the month following the one for which such salary income is paid.
For benefits in kind and/or in cash received from third parties based on an employment contract or a contractual relationship between parties, the obligation to compute and withhold social contributions belongs to:
In addition to salary income, social contributions may be levied in respect of the following types of income:
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate is 19%. The standard VAT rate is applied to all supplies of goods and services (including imports) that neither qualify for an exemption (with or without credit) nor for a reduced VAT rate.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Romania.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
No inheritance taxes apply in Romania, except in relation to transfer of real estate in certain circumstances. Gift taxes are not levied in Romania.
## Property taxes
### Building tax
The building tax calculation method differentiates between buildings depending on their destination usage:
New rules will apply starting in 2025. According to OG no. 16/2022, tax of at least 0.1% (for residential buildings) or at least 0.5% (for non-residential buildings) will apply to the value of the building. For buildings used for agricultural activities, the buildings tax will be calculated by applying a rate of 0.4% to the value of the building.
The value will be calculated as the total value of the buildings, including any annexes, and the land areas covered by them included in the market studies of the indicative values ​​of real estate administered by the National Union of Notaries Public in Romania.
### Land tax
Owners of land are subject to land tax established at a fixed amount per square metre, depending on the rank of the area where the land is located and the area or category of land use, in accordance with the classification made by the Local Council.
Similar to building tax, land tax is paid annually, in two equal instalments, by 31 March and 30 September. A 10% reduction is granted for full advance payment of this tax by 31 March.
### Special taxes on high value assets
As of January 2024, the following assets are subject to the special tax of 0.3%:

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 25 April 2024
Romanian citizens domiciled in Romania are considered Romanian tax residents and are taxed on their worldwide income (except for salary income received from abroad for work performed abroad, which is tax exempt) unless they prove by means of tax residence certificates that they qualify as tax residents of a state with which Romania concluded a double tax treaty (DTT).
Romanian citizens domiciled in Romania that prove the tax residency status in a state that does not have in place a (DTT) with Romania continue to be taxable in Romania on their worldwide income for the calendar year in which the change of residence occurs, as well as for the next three calendar years.
Romanian citizens not domiciled in Romania and foreign individuals, regardless of their domicile, are taxed in Romania only on income sourced in Romania, until the moment they become Romanian tax residents taxable on their worldwide income, if the case.
Non-resident individuals become taxable on their worldwide income starting with the date when they become tax residents in Romania (while respecting the provisions of the DTTs, where applicable). *See the*[*Residence*](romania/individual/residence.html)*section for the residence criteria*.
## Personal income tax rates
A flat PIT rate of 10% is generally in place. However, there are certain exceptions from this rule (e.g. the tax rate for dividends and for capital gains in certain cases, the tax rate for income from the transfer of immovable property, the tax rate for income from gambling activities depends on the income level).
## Local income taxes
There are no local taxes on personal income in Romania.

# Romania
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 25 April 2024
## Taxable period
The Romanian tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December.
## Tax returns
In case of salary income derived from a Romanian employer, under a local employment contract, the income tax and mandatory social contributions are withheld from the employee’s salary at the time the salary is paid. The taxes have to be reported and paid by the local employer to the tax authorities by the 25th day of the month following the one the salary income relates to.
Individuals deriving income from Romania or from abroad, such as income from the following categories, might have to file the Annual Return (the reporting obligation should be analysed on a case-by-case basis based on the individual's tax residence position and on the income’s source country):
Through the Annual Return to be filed, the individual has to declare the final income obtained during the previous year, as well as the estimated income to be obtained in the current year, for both income tax and social contributions purposes. The filing deadline is 25 May.
The individual assesses the income tax and social contribution liabilities due for income by applying the rates for income tax/social contributions on the computation base determined in accordance with the provisions of the Fiscal Code for each type of income.
The payment of tax liabilities due (income tax and/or social contributions) is to be made based on a self-assessment made by the individual, in accordance with the information reflected in the Annual Return, within the same reporting deadline (i.e. 25 May).
Spouses are treated as individual (separate) taxpayers; the concept of joint filing is not regulated in the Romanian tax legislation.
## Payment of tax
The standard procedure in case of a local employment contract is for the Romanian employer to withhold the full amount of income tax and social contributions due from the employee’s monthly salary income.
For the salary income received from abroad by individuals working in Romania based on a foreign employment contract, the 10% flat income tax rate, as well as the social contributions, if the case, are due on a monthly basis. For income tax, it is the personal obligation of the individual to report such income and pay the income tax due on a monthly basis. Social contributions might also fall in the individual’s obligation of reporting and payment provided that it was agreed as such with the foreign employer, in case the foreign employer is located in the EEA or in a country that concluded a social security agreement with Romania.
To ensure the reporting and payment of social contributions in Romania in respect of the salary income derived from foreign employers for employment activities performed in Romania, a specific registration procedure has to be undertaken in Romania.
In case of individuals seconded to Romania by employers located in countries with which Romania does not have a social security agreement in place, the mandatory Romanian social contributions due arise directly for the individual undertaking the employment activities in Romania.
In cases where the EU regulation on the coordination of social security systems or the social security agreements concluded by Romania with other countries apply, no social contributions / limited social security contributions are due in Romania on the salary income received from abroad for activities carried out here (as provided by each agreement) if certificates of coverage are available in this respect; in situations where social security contributions are not due at all in Romania, no registration for Romanian social security purposes should be undertaken.
The general deadline for both reporting and paying the income tax and social contributions, if the case, is the 25th day of the month following the one the salary income relates with.
Currently, the level for late-payment interest is set at 0.02% per day of delay. In addition to the late-payment interest, a late-payment penalty of 0.01% per day of delay applies.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 25 April 2024
## Domestic dividend tax
The tax rate for the dividend distribution between Romanian legal entities is 8%. The dividend tax is eliminated if there is a shareholding percentage of a minimum of 10% for an uninterrupted period of at least one year.
## WHT for non-residents
All income obtained by non-residents from Romanian taxpayers for the provision of services rendered in Romania or for management and consultancy services (irrespective of the rendering place) are subject to 16% WHT in Romania.
Non-resident companies not operating through a PE are subject to a 16% WHT on revenue sourced in Romania, such as interest, royalties, revenue from services (*as mentioned above*), commissions, and revenue derived from liquidation of a Romanian legal entity.
The tax rate for dividend revenues derived by non-residents from Romania is 8%.
Certain specific provisions and exceptions apply to non-resident WHT, as follows:
In order to apply EU legislation, non-resident recipients of the income are required to present a certificate of tax residence and a declaration attesting the compliance with the necessary requirements provided by the European Directives.
The Romanian Fiscal Code incorporates the amendments to the European Parent-Subsidiary Directive no. 2011/96/EU. The legislation introduces the anti-abuse rule for preventing unlawful tax practices used to obtain tax benefits contrary to the Directive’s principles. Also, dividends received by a Romanian legal entity from a foreign legal entity under certain conditions will not be taxed as long as those dividends are not treated as deductible expenses by the paying subsidiary.
The following categories of income derived by non-residents from Romania are exempt from WHT:
Legal entities/individuals resident in member states of the European Union or the Economic European Area deriving interest revenues and/or revenues from freelancing activities in Romania may opt for the regularisation of the WHT by way of declaring and paying in Romania the CIT/PIT related to the revenues obtained.
The tax withheld and paid is deemed as an advance payment in connection with the CIT/PIT.
The possibility for regularisation of the WHT is only applied in the case of revenues derived from Romania by residents of member states of the European Union or the European Economic Area, provided that a Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation or a legal instrument for the exchange of information is concluded between Romania and those states.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 25 April 2024
The CIT result of a company is calculated as the difference between the total revenues and expenses booked in accordance with the accounting regulations, adjusted for fiscal purposes by deducting non-taxable revenue and adding non-deductible expenses. Other elements similar to revenue and expenses are also to be taken into account when calculating the taxable result.
For taxpayers that apply International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) (i.e. financial institutions and listed companies), there are specific rules in relation to the fiscal value assessment, CIT computation, adjustments for step-down in value, depreciation, and fiscal treatment of deferred result. A specific calculation method applies to companies falling under the IMCA provisions.
## Inventory valuation
The methods permitted for inventory valuation under Romanian law are standard cost, detailed sale price, average (weighted) cost, first in first out (FIFO), and last in first out (LIFO). The accounting method is also recognised for tax purposes.
Assets are generally valued at their acquisition cost, production cost, or market value. Fixed assets may be re-valued at certain points in time for various purposes.
## Capital gains
Capital gains earned by a Romanian resident company are included in its ordinary profits and are taxed at the 16% CIT rate. Participation exemption applies for income derived by a Romanian legal entity from the sale of shares held in a Romanian legal entity or in a foreign legal entity resident in a state with which Romania has a DTT, in case of participations of at least 10% held for a minimum period of one year.
Capital gains derived by non-residents from real estate property located in Romania or from the sale of participation titles held in a Romanian company or in a foreign company tax resident in Romania due to place of effective management are also taxable in Romania at the 16% CIT rate. However, an exemption could apply as per Romania law in case of the sale of participation titles, under certain conditions (i.e. at least 10% ownership for an uninterrupted period of at least one year, tax residency in a DTT country). Moreover, such capital gains may be subject to treaty protection.
## Dividend income
Dividend income received by a Romanian company from another Romanian company is non-taxable for CIT purposes.
Dividend revenues distributed by a company resident in another EU member state or other DTT state to a Romanian company that pays CIT are non-taxable for CIT purposes at the level of the Romanian company if it has held a minimum of 10% of the shares in the respective non-resident company for an uninterrupted period of at least one year at the date when the dividend income was booked.
The Romanian Fiscal Code incorporates the amendments to the European Directive no. 2011/96/EU, relating to the application of a common system of taxation in the case of parent companies and subsidiaries of different member states. The legislation introduces the anti-abuse rule for preventing unlawful tax practices used to obtain tax benefits contrary to the Directive’s principles.
## Interest and royalty income
Interest and royalty income obtained by Romanian legal entities should be treated as taxable for CIT purposes.
Romanian-sourced interest and royalty payments of an affiliated company, resident in an EU member state, are exempt from WHT, provided that certain conditions are met, e.g.:
## Fiduciary contracts
If the settlor of a fiduciary contract is also the beneficiary, then:
If the beneficiary is the fiduciary or a third party, the expenses incurred with respect to the transfer of the patrimony from the settlor to the fiduciary should be considered non-deductible.
## Other significant items
The other most relevant types of non-taxable revenue stipulated by the Romanian Fiscal Code are:
## Foreign income
Resident companies are taxed on their worldwide income unless a DTT provides otherwise. In case of foreign subsidiaries of Romanian companies, income is not taxed in Romania until remitted back (except from CFCs). Otherwise, there is no specific tax deferral regime in place.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 25 April 2024
## Social contributions
Social contributions due by employers and employees on income derived from dependent activities are applied to a certain computation base.
Social contributions liabilities are assessed in line with the EU social security coordination rules and the provisions of the social security agreements Romania applies.
The general social contributions rates are established as follows:
Employee contributions:
The monthly assessment base is the gross income derived from dependent activities.
Employer contributions:
The monthly assessment base is the gross salary income derived by individuals, resident and non-resident, based on an employment contract (or a service relationship or special status), as well as revenues treated as salaries (administrators’ remuneration, director on mandate contract, etc.). Special exemptions are provided for each category of the social contributions.
Employers compute and withhold the social contributions when paying salaries. Social contributions must be declared and paid by the salary income payer to the relevant state budgets by the 25th day of the month following the one for which such salary income is paid.
For benefits in kind and/or in cash received from third parties based on an employment contract or a contractual relationship between parties, the obligation to compute and withhold social contributions belongs to:
In addition to salary income, social contributions may be levied in respect of the following types of income:
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate is 19%. The standard VAT rate is applied to all supplies of goods and services (including imports) that neither qualify for an exemption (with or without credit) nor for a reduced VAT rate.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Romania.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
No inheritance taxes apply in Romania, except in relation to transfer of real estate in certain circumstances. Gift taxes are not levied in Romania.
## Property taxes
### Building tax
The building tax calculation method differentiates between buildings depending on their destination usage:
New rules will apply starting in 2025. According to OG no. 16/2022, tax of at least 0.1% (for residential buildings) or at least 0.5% (for non-residential buildings) will apply to the value of the building. For buildings used for agricultural activities, the buildings tax will be calculated by applying a rate of 0.4% to the value of the building.
The value will be calculated as the total value of the buildings, including any annexes, and the land areas covered by them included in the market studies of the indicative values ​​of real estate administered by the National Union of Notaries Public in Romania.
### Land tax
Owners of land are subject to land tax established at a fixed amount per square metre, depending on the rank of the area where the land is located and the area or category of land use, in accordance with the classification made by the Local Council.
Similar to building tax, land tax is paid annually, in two equal instalments, by 31 March and 30 September. A 10% reduction is granted for full advance payment of this tax by 31 March.
### Special taxes on high value assets
As of January 2024, the following assets are subject to the special tax of 0.3%:

## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 25 April 2024
## Tax measures
### Pillar 2 Directive
Directive (EU) 2022/2523 (‘Pillar 2 Directive‘) was transposed in the Romanian legislation through Law no. 431/2023, which introduced into the Romanian legislation a complex system of rules for an effective minimum taxation of 15% for multinational enterprise (MNE) groups and large-scale domestic groups with annual consolidated revenues of at least 750 million euros (EUR) in at least two of the four previous financial years. It was published in the Official Gazette no. 8 dated 5 January 2024 and is applicable to financial years starting as of 31 December 2023.
### Entry into effect of the Multilateral Instrument (MLI)
In accordance with the reservation made by Romania based on art. 35 (7) of the MLI, Romania submitted to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) secretariat on 6 March 2023 the notification regarding the fulfilment of the necessary internal procedures in order to produce effects by the MLI for the implementation within the double tax treaties (DTTs) of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) measures currently with 51 out of 89 treaty partners.
Therefore, the MLI will start to produce effects for transactions that will take place on or after 1 January 2024 for the withholding tax (WHT) provisions and beginning with fiscal periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024 for the other tax provisions of the treaties.
### DAC7
OUG 16/2022 introduced rules that transposed the provisions of the seventh update to Council Directive 2011/16/EU on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation into law (DAC7).
DAC7 extends the European Union (EU) tax transparency rules to digital ’platforms‘ and introduces an obligation on ’reporting platform operators‘ to collect, verify, and report specific information with respect to ’reportable sellers‘ that have undertaken ’relevant activities‘ through their platforms.
DAC7 also introduces new automatic exchange of information between the EU tax authorities regarding the taxable events and income generated through these platforms.
Furthermore, DAC7 includes a legal framework to enable joint audits. In a joint audit, two or more countries join to form a single audit team to conduct a taxpayer examination. Joint audits should result in quicker issue resolution, more streamlined fact finding, and more effective compliance.
### Public country-by-country (CbC) reporting
Order 2048/2022 requires qualifying Romanian-based MNEs and MNEs with subsidiaries or branches in Romania, irrespective of whether these are EU or non-EU headquartered groups, to publicly disclose certain information on a country-by-country basis. The threshold of the annual consolidated revenue is 3.7 billion Romanian leu (RON) in each of the last two consecutive financial years.
The public CbC report is effective starting 1 January 2023 and applies to financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2023 (which is earlier than the 22 June 2024 deadline set by the EU Directive). Following these amendments, Romania became the first EU member state to officially introduce public CbC reporting obligations, with a deadline for the CbC preparation and public disclosure significantly earlier than that set by the EU Directive.
## Changes of the Romanian Fiscal Code
### Government Emergency Ordinance (GEO) no. 115/2023
The Government of Romania has adopted Emergency Ordinance no. 115/2023 (GEO no. 115/2023), which introduces new measures for fiscal consolidation and combating tax evasion. We present below the most important amendments to the Fiscal Code brought by GEO no. 115/2023:
#### Value-added tax (VAT)
The reduced VAT rate of 9% will become applicable to milk powder for newborns, infants, and young children.
The right to deduct the VAT related to the purchase, rental, or leasing of buildings/living spaces, regardless of their destination, located in residential areas or in housing blocks, as well as the VAT related to the expenses related to these buildings/spaces, has been limited to 50% for the living area if they are not used exclusively for economic activity purposes. This limitation becomes applicable starting with the first day of the month following the date in which Romania receives the decision to derogate from the provisions of Directive 2006/112/EC in this regard.
The facility of deferring the payment of VAT in customs will be removed for taxable persons registered for VAT purposes who hold an authorised economic operator (AEO) certificate. The possibility of deferring import VAT in the case of submitting a customs declaration through the use of centralised customs clearance has been introduced. In order to obtain the certificate of deferment for the payment of VAT in customs, the applicants will be required to make available to the customs authority a statement on their own responsibility according to which they state that they do not have any outstanding budgetary obligations.
#### RO e-Factura
Changes regarding the deadline for sending e-invoices through the RO e-Factura system, as well as the applicable sanctions for the taxable persons established in Romania, were implemented, as follows:
As of 1 July 2024, the fine for sending the B2B invoices by other methods than through the RO e-Factura system will be 15% of the invoice value (taxable base and VAT), both at the level of the supplier and the beneficiary. The fine applies to taxable persons established in Romania, who are both suppliers or beneficiaries.
It has also been clarified that the following invoices will not be sent through the RO e-Factura national system: simplified invoices, invoices issued for operations to entities not established and not registered for VAT purposes in Romania, and for the provision of services for which the issuance of the invoice is not subject to invoicing rules in Romania.
#### RO e-Transport
Moreover, as of 15 December 2023, RO e-Transport obligations were extended also to international road transport.
The obligation to report in the RO e-Transport system the data related to the international transport of goods and to obtain the UIT codes is with the following users:
Sanctions for non-compliance with the high fiscal risk goods apply as of 1 January 2023, while the sanctions for the new measures introduced with respect to international road transport will apply as of 1 July 2024.
### Law no. 296/2023
#### Minimum turnover tax (IMCA)
Law no. 296/2023 introduced the IMCA.
Taxpayers (other than credit institutions and oil and gas companies) that registered a turnover of over EUR 50 million in the previous year and for which the corporate income tax (CIT) is lower than the IMCA will be required to pay CIT at the level of the IMCA. In the case of a tax group, the IMCA is calculated by the responsible legal entity by summing all the group members’ turnovers.
As an exception, companies that have activities in the oil and gas sectors and that registered in the previous year a turnover of more than EUR 50 million will owe, in addition to the CIT, a specific turnover tax.
Credit institutions (i.e. Romanian legal entities and Romanian branches of credit institutions – foreign legal entities) are liable for a newly-introduced turnover tax in addition to the CIT.
Economic operators that exclusively conduct activities of distribution/supply/transport of electricity and natural gas that are regulated/licensed by the National Energy Regulatory Authority are exempt from the application of the IMCA.
#### VAT
The same Law no. 296/2023 introduced a series of amendments and completions to the provisions of the Fiscal Code with respect to the VAT.
Thus, as of 1 January 2024, the following amendments became effective:
The VAT exemption with deduction right becomes obsolete for the following operations carried out towards public hospitals:
1. Construction, rehabilitation, and modernisation services for hospital units in the public health system.
2. Supplies of medical equipment, apparatus, devices, and the like.
3. Adaptation, repair, rental, and leasing of such goods mentioned at point ii) above.
The related VAT exemption is maintained only when these operations are conducted for non-profit entities registered in the National Agency for Fiscal Administration’s (NAFA’s) (i.e. Romanian tax authority) Public Registry and intended for hospital units owned and operated by the non-profit entity or those in the state public network.
Transitional measures were established for housing supplies for which contracts were concluded by 31 December 2023 and which will be supplied between 1 January and 31 December 2024 in order to apply the reduced VAT rate of 5%.
#### Mandatory e-invoicing
The obligations of issuers sending invoices through the national system for electronic invoicing, RO e-Factura, have been extended. As of 1 January 2024, economic operators (i.e. taxable persons established in Romania, regardless of whether they are registered for VAT purposes or not, and taxable persons not established in Romania but registered for VAT purposes) have the obligation to send invoices that are issued for the supply of goods and taxable services in Romania, under a B2B relationship, in the RO e-Factura system, regardless of whether or not the receivers are registered in the RO e-Factura Register.
Also, invoices related to taxable operations carried out in Romania towards public institutions (B2G) must be sent through the RO e-Factura system.
In the light of the above, it is mandatory to send the invoices to the beneficiaries, in accordance with the provisions of the Fiscal Code, except in cases where both the supplier and the beneficiary are registered in the RO e-Factura Register.
Invoices must be sent through the RO e-Factura system within five working days as of the date of issuance or the deadline provided in the Fiscal Code for issuing the invoice.
For non-compliance to this provision, contraventional fines could be applied depending on the type of taxpayer that the issuer is classified, as follows:
During the period 1 January 2024 to 31 March 2024, no sanctions will be applied for non-compliance with the obligations to send invoices through the RO e-Factura system.
As of 1 July 2024, only invoices sent through the RO e-Factura system will be considered invoices for the supply of goods and the provision of taxable services in Romania conducted in B2B relationships (carried out between taxable persons established in Romania). The use of electronic invoices is subject to acceptance by the beneficiary, with the exception of B2B invoices, which must be sent through the RO e-Factura system.
The receipt and recording in the bookkeeping of invoices other than the ones sent through the RO e-Factura system for B2B transactions is sanctioned with a fine equal to the amount of the VAT inrelated to the invoice in cause.
#### RO e-Sigiliu
### GO no. 16/2022 for amending and completing the Fiscal Code
### Law no. 88/2023 for changing and amending the Fiscal Code has provided new exemptions for VAT in the medical field.
The provisions entered into force within 60 days as of the date of publication of the law in the Official Gazette.
According to Law no. 88/2023, the following activities are exempt from VAT with the right of deduction:
The VAT exemption for the above supplies of goods and services applies as follows:
The following supplies of goods to which the reduced VAT rate of 9% was previously applied will also be exempt from VAT with the right of deduction:
The order of the Minister of Finance and the methodological rules regarding the application of exemptions will be issued within 60 days as of the publication of Law no. 88/2023 in the Official Gazette.
### Law no. 216/2023: Reduced VAT rates in the wood industry and the energy industry
Law no. 216/2023 regarding the reduced rate of 5% VAT for supplies of wood in various forms and for heat pumps introduced a series of changes regarding the application of reduced VAT rates in the wood industry and the energy industry.
#### Reduced VAT rates in the wood industry
Law no. 216/2023 extended the application of the reduced VAT rate of 5% for the supply of sawdust, waste, and agglomerated wood scraps in the form of wood pellets, wood briquettes, or similar forms, classified under CN codes 4401 31 00 and 4401 32 00, and for the supply for use as heating fuel of sawdust, waste, and non-agglomerated wood scraps, classified under CN codes 4401 41 00 and 4401 49 00.
The reduced rate will be applied to supplies performed towards individuals, legal persons, and other entities, regardless of the legal form of organisation, based on a statement of own responsibility made available to the supplier, certifying their quality as end users.
#### Reduced VAT rates in the energy industry
A new provision has been introduced that extends the applicability of the reduced 5% VAT rate to cover:
To benefit from the above reduced VAT rates, legal entity buyers are required to sign a statement of own responsibility, as per annex no. 1 to Law no. 216/2023.
## Corporate taxation
Government Ordinance (GO) no. 153/2020 provides that, during its application period (2021 - 2025), the deadline for submitting returns and paying CIT applicable for taxpayers applying the OMF 1802/2014 for the respective tax year is 25 June of the following year, or the twenty-fifth day of the sixth month following the end of the amended tax year. The same date applies to (i) the deadline for submitting the declaration for the fourth quarter and the payment of the tax for that quarter in the case of microenterprises and (ii) the deadline for submitting the declaration for the second half and the payment of activity-specific taxes.
Starting from 14 May 2020, expenses resulting from assignments of government securities, bonds, and other debt instruments that give the holder a contractual right to receive cash are deductible when calculating the CIT result.
On 31 January 2020, the Ordinance for implementing mandatory disclosure rules pursuant to Council Directive (EU) 2018/822 (DAC6) was published in the Official Gazette. The Romanian version of the law is closely aligned with the DAC6 Directive’s scope, hallmarks, and reporting requirements.
The provisions of ATAD II have been implemented in Romanian tax legislation. The Ordinance implementing ATAD II (published in the Official Gazette on 31 January 2020) is in line with ATAD II provisions.
Starting from January 2022, if the 0.75% turnover limit minus the sponsorship amounts carried forward from previous periods has not been used in full, the taxpayers can redirect that unused value for sponsorships, patronage, and private scholarships within six months as of the date of submission of the annual CIT.
Starting with Q3 of 2018, companies may opt for quarterly distribution of profits to shareholders. Reconciliation of such amounts is performed subsequent to the approval of the annual financial statements. Those who opt for the quarterly distribution of dividends are required to prepare interim financial statements. Any differences resulting from the reconciliation are payable within 60 days of the date of approval of the annual financial statements. Failure to meet that deadline results in penalty interest being due.
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The period of application of the reverse-charge mechanism in connection with certain transactions under VAT law, such as the supply of grain delivery, green certificates transfer, or mobile phone provision, has been extended to 31 December 2026.
Romania transposed the EU provisions regarding the VAT treatment applicable to transactions with vouchers into the national legislation as of 17 April 2019.
A reduced rate VAT of 5% is applicable to the supplies of thermal energy to the following categories of users: population public and private hospitals, public and private schools, NGOs, churches, and social services providers (either public or private).
The supplies of firewood, such as tree trunks, logs, brushwood, branches, as well as sawdust, wood waste, and agglomerated wood scraps in the form of wood pellets, wood briquettes, or similar forms, performed to individuals, to companies, schools, hospitals, medical offices, and social assistance units are subject to the reduced 5% VAT rate based on a declaration on own responsibility of the beneficiary.
As of 1 January 2021, the Fiscal Code is amended as follows:
The turnover threshold for the application of the cash accounting VAT scheme has been increased from RON 2,250,000 to RON 4,500,000.
VAT is not paid in customs for imports by taxable persons registered for VAT purposes in Romania that:

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 25 April 2024
A company is considered tax resident in Romania if:
POEM represents the place where a foreign legal entity carries out operations corresponding to economic, real, and substantial purposes and where at least one of the following conditions is met:
## Permanent establishment (PE)
A PE is generally defined as being the place through which the activity of a non-resident company is conducted, fully or partially, directly or through a dependent agent.
Once a PE is created, Romania has the right to tax the profits of the non-resident parent company derived from the activities performed through the PE.
In defining the PE concept, reference can be made to Article 5 - ‘Permanent establishment’ of the OECD Model Tax Convention, which has been transferred from the Methodological Norms to the Fiscal Code.
The Romanian legislation explicitly states the conditions that trigger a PE:
The registration, reporting, and tax payment requirements for a PE are similar to those for a Romanian company.
Consolidation of PE revenues and expenses belonging to the same foreign legal entity is possible. *For further information, please see the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*.

# Romania
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 25 April 2024
Expenses fall into three categories: deductible expenses, limited deductibility expenses, and non-deductible expenses.
## Deductible expenses
As a general rule, expenses are deductible only if they are incurred for business purposes.
Some of the deductible expenses specifically mentioned by the Romanian Fiscal Code include:
Note that credit institutions apply IFRS rules, and certain deductibility rules are provided for this category of taxpayers.
## Limited deductible expenses
The deductibility of the following expenses is limited:
## Non-deductible expenses
Expenses deemed non-deductible include, among other items, the following:
1. They were destroyed following natural disasters or major force situations in the conditions provided by the methodical norms.
2. Insurance contracts have been set up in respect of these.
3. They were degraded from a qualitative perspective, and the proof of destruction is available.
4. The food intended for human consumption, with a close-to-expiration date, other than those found in the situations/conditions provided in points 1 and 2, if their transfer is carried out according to the legal provisions on reducing food waste.
5. The animal by-products not destined for human consumption, other than those found in the situations/conditions provided in points 1 to 3, if their disposal is carried out in accordance with the legal provisions on reducing food waste.
6. The agri-food products that have become improper for human or animal consumption, if the targeting/guiding is aimed at transforming them into compost/biogas or neutralising them, according to the legal provisions on reducing food waste.
7. Other goods than those found in the situations/conditions provided in points 1 to 6, if the term of validity/expiry is exceeded, according to the law.
Note that credit institutions apply IFRS rules, and certain non-deductibility rules are provided for this category of taxpayers.
## Depreciation
Romanian law makes an explicit distinction between fiscal and accounting depreciation. Fiscal depreciation is treated as a deductible element within the CIT computation, while accounting depreciation should be treated as a non-deductible expense. Companies should maintain a separate record to reflect the separate computation of the fiscal and accounting depreciation. Any accounting revaluations of fixed assets are not taken into account in computing the tax depreciation.
Assets are generally depreciated using the straight-line method. However, accelerated or reducing balance depreciation methods may be used to determine fiscal depreciation for certain assets, while the accounting depreciation method may be different.
The useful lives to be used for tax purposes are the ones stated in the Official Fixed Assets Catalogue, published under government decision. Ranges are provided for classes of fixed assets, from which the taxpayers can choose the useful life (e.g. office and housing buildings: 40 to 60 years, commercial buildings: 32 to 48 years, commercial furnishings: 9 to 15 years, automobiles: 4 to 6 years).
For vehicles with up to nine seats, the fiscal depreciation is limited to a maximum of RON 1,500 per month for each vehicle. Certain categories of vehicles are exempt from this monthly deduction limitation (e.g. used exclusively for emergency, security, or delivery service; used for paid passenger transport; or used for paid supply of services).
Land cannot be depreciated for tax purposes.
### Accelerated depreciation
Under the Romanian Fiscal Code, machinery and technical equipment, computers and their peripherals, as well as patents, may be depreciated by using the accelerated method, under which a maximum of 50% of the asset’s fiscal value may be deducted during the first year of usage, while the rest of the asset’s value can be depreciated using the straight-line method over the remaining useful life.
## Goodwill
As a rule, goodwill is deemed non-depreciable from a Romanian fiscal perspective.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses recognised as intangible assets according to the applicable accounting regulations can be depreciated over a maximum period of five years.
## Provisions and reserves
As a general rule, provisions and reserves are non-deductible for CIT purposes. However, there are certain provisions and reserves that are deductible, such as:
- Reimbursement plan.
- Asset liquidation.
- Simplified procedure.
The reduction or cancellation of any provision or reserve deducted from the taxable profit, due to changing the destination of the provision or reserve, distribution towards shareholders in any form, liquidation, spin-off, merger, or any other reason, should be included in the taxable revenue and taxed accordingly.
Note that special rules are applicable to credit institutions that are required to apply IFRS rules.
## Fiscal losses
Starting from 2024, companies are allowed to carry forward fiscal losses declared in the annual CIT returns for a period of up to five years, within 70% of the taxable profits threshold, based on the FIFO method. No related adjustment for inflation is allowed.
Any loss incurred by a PE of a Romanian company located in a non-EU/European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member state or in a country that has a DTT in place with Romania is only deductible for tax purposes from the revenue derived by that PE, and losses can be carried forward only for a period of five years.
For foreign legal persons, carryforward of losses applies only to revenue and expenses attributable to their PE in Romania.
Losses incurred by a company can be transferred within a merger/spin-off operation and can be recovered by the successors, in proportion to the assets and liabilities transferred. The successors of these restructuring operations are able to use such losses during the remaining period.
Carryback of losses is not available in Romania.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Transactions with Romanian-affiliated companies and with non-resident related parties fall within the scope of the investigations regarding compliance with transfer pricing legislation (*see Transfer pricing in the*[*Group taxation*](group-taxation.html) *section*).

# Romania
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 25 April 2024
The fiscal consolidation system for CIT has been established starting 1 January 2021. The relevant aspects include the following:
## Consolidation of PEs
Foreign legal entities that perform economic activities in Romania through several PEs must register one of them as their PE designated to fulfil the fiscal obligations for all the PEs owned.
The revenues and expenses of all the PEs belonging to the same foreign legal entity will be accumulated at the level of the designated PE.
## Transfer pricing
Transfer pricing requirements are applicable to transactions between Romanian related parties as well as foreign related parties.
Transactions between related parties should be carried out considering the arm’s-length principle. If transfer prices are not set at arm’s length, the Romanian tax authorities have the right to adjust the taxpayer’s revenue or expenses in order to reflect the market value.
Traditional transfer pricing methods (i.e. comparable uncontrolled prices, cost plus, and resale price methods), as well as any other methods that are in line with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines (i.e. transactional net margin and profit split methods), may be used for setting transfer prices.
### Transfer pricing documentation
Taxpayers engaged in related party transactions must prepare and provide their transfer pricing documentation file to the Romanian tax authorities upon the latter's request.
Transfer pricing audit activity has significantly increased during the past few years, and requests for presenting the transfer pricing documentation file have started to become common practice. We are aware of recent cases where the Romanian tax authorities adjusted the taxable result of local taxpayers in accordance with the applicable regulations.
The content of the transfer pricing documentation file has been approved by order of the president of the National Agency for Tax Administration. The Order is supplemented by the Transfer Pricing Guidelines issued by the OECD and the Code of Conduct on transfer pricing documentation for associated enterprises in the European Union Transfer Pricing Document (EUTPD). The content of the transfer pricing documentation as per the Romanian legislation is broadly aligned with the content of the local file and master file documentation under BEPS Action 13.
Upon request of the tax authorities, the deadline for presenting the transfer pricing file documentation is as follows:
Failure to present the transfer pricing documentation file or presenting an incomplete file may trigger estimation of transfer prices by the tax authorities based on generally available information.
### Advance pricing agreement (APA)
Taxpayers engaged in transactions with related parties have the possibility to apply for an APA. These taxpayers can also schedule a pre-filing meeting to discuss the feasibility of the APA.
The request for an APA is filed together with the relevant documentation and payment evidence of the fee (ranging between EUR 10,000 and EUR 20,000). The required documentation is based on the EUTPD and suggests, up front, the content of the APA.
The term provided by the Fiscal Procedural Code for issuance of an APA is 12 months for unilateral APAs and 18 months for bilateral and multilateral APAs. The APA is issued for a period of up to five years. In exceptional cases, such as long-term agreements, it may be issued for a longer period.
If taxpayers do not agree with the content of the APA, they can notify the National Agency for Tax Administration within 15 days. In this case, the agreement does not produce any legal effects.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
Romania implemented CbC reporting requirements, transposing the provisions of Directive (EU) 2016/881 into the national legislation. The new CbC reporting provisions follow the OECD BEPS Project Action 13 initiative.
As such, a Romanian tax-resident entity that is the ultimate parent entity of a multinational enterprise (MNE) group with consolidated revenues of EUR 750 million or more, and is required to prepare consolidated financial statements of the group, has to file a CbC report with the Romanian tax authorities within 12 months of the last day of the MNE group’s reporting fiscal year. The Romanian legislation also provides for filing of CbC reporting by a so-called ‘surrogate parent’ (i.e. a Romanian tax-resident entity may be appointed by the MNE group to file a CbC report in Romania on its behalf).
In addition, other Romanian resident entities will be required to file a CbC report if one of the criteria below is met:
Moreover, failure to provide the CbC report in time or with incomplete/incorrect data will trigger the following penalties:
## Interest deductibility rule
The exceeding borrowing costs (calculated as the difference between any debt-related costs, including foreign exchange expenses and capitalised interest, and income from interest and other economically equivalent income) incurred in a fiscal period that exceed the deductible threshold of EUR 1 million are deductible for CIT purposes up to the limit of 30% of the calculation base. However, the EUR 1 million threshold is reduced to EUR 500,000 in case of the exceeding borrowing costs resulting from related-party transactions that do not finance the acquisition or production of certain specific fixed assets provided by the legislation. The non-deductible exceeding borrowing costs can be carried forward indefinitely. The limitation also applies to any debt-related costs in connection with loans granted by financial institutions.
The calculation base is determined as the gross accounting profit, minus non-taxable revenues, plus CIT, exceeding borrowing costs and deductible tax depreciation.
The above-mentioned interest deductibility rules also apply to financial institutions, but not to independent entities (i.e. entities that are not part of a consolidated group for financial accounting purposes and do not have related parties and PEs), which can fully deduct exceeding borrowing costs.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Under the Romanian CFC rules, a taxpayer should include in its taxable base, in proportion with its holding in the CFC, the latter’s non-distributed income derived from the following categories:
A company is considered a CFC if the following conditions are both met:
## Exit taxation
Romania transposed the provisions of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD) into national law, introducing rules on exit tax. Thus, a taxpayer will be subject to CIT (at 16% tax rate) for transfer of business carried out by a PE, transfer of assets, or transfer of residence. The taxable base should be calculated as the difference between the market value of the assets and their fiscal value.
## Anti-hybrid rules
The provisions of ATAD II have been implemented in the Romanian tax legislation. The Ordinance implementing ATAD II (published in the Official Gazette on 31 January 2020) is in line with ATAD II provisions.
A hybrid mismatch is described as a situation involving a taxpayer or an entity that leads to deduction without inclusion or double deduction. The 'hybrid element' is defined in the legislation as follows: the same payment/entity/instrument/transfer/economic activity that qualifies differently in two tax jurisdictions involved.
If a hybrid mismatch results in double deduction, the deduction should be denied in the investor member state as a primary rule or, as a secondary rule, in the member state of the payer (if the investor’s jurisdiction allows the deduction).
In case a hybrid mismatch results in a deduction without inclusion, the deduction should be denied in the member state of the payer, as a primary rule, or, as a secondary rule, the amount of the payment shall be included as taxable income in the beneficiary’s member state (if the jurisdiction of the payer allowed the deduction).

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 25 April 2024
## Branch
A foreign company can set up a branch in Romania, as long as the branch only operates in the same field of activity as the parent company. A branch is considered to have the same legal personality as the parent company and is not a separate legal entity (no own share capital, no separate name, etc.).
Profits derived by the branch are taxed at the standard 16% CIT rate.
## Representative offices
Representative offices are often established as a first step to operating in Romania. A representative office can undertake only auxiliary or preparatory activities, cannot trade in its own name, and cannot engage in any commercial activities. A representative office can perform only a limited range of activities without being considered a PE for CIT purposes.
A tax on representative offices is due by any foreign legal person with a representative office authorised to operate in Romania according to the law. The tax is paid on an annual basis. The amount to be paid for a fiscal year is RON 18,000. If a representative office is set up or closed during a tax year, the tax due for that year is pro-rated for the months that the representative office was operational in that fiscal year calculated proportionally with the number of months of its existence in the respective tax year.
The representative office of a foreign legal person should declare and pay the tax to the state budget by the last day of February of the tax year.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 25 April 2024
## Foreign tax credits
## Tax exemption for reinvested profits
The profit invested in technological equipment assets used for production, processing, and refurbishment activities, electronic computers and peripheral equipment, cash registers and machinery, control and invoicing machinery and devices, as well as in software, produced and/or acquired, including on the basis of the financial leasing contracts, and commissioned/used for the purpose of pursuing the economic activity, is tax exempt under the Romanian Fiscal Code, under certain conditions. The equipment subject to this incentive cannot be depreciated by using the accelerated method.
Companies can benefit from an additional deduction of 50% of the eligible expenses for their R&D activities. Moreover, accelerated depreciation may be applied for devices and equipment used in the R&D activity.
## Exemption from profit tax for taxpayers engaged exclusively in innovation and R&D activities
## Tax incentives related to professional and technical education
When determining the taxable profit, expenses for organising and developing professional and technical studies as per specific education legislation are considered deductible.
## Reductions for maintaining/increasing equity
Reductions are granted when determining the CIT, micro-company tax, and activity-specific tax, depending on the maintenance/increase of equity, for a period of five years, from 2021 to 2025, as follows:
Where two or three of the above-mentioned reductions apply, the corresponding percentages are added together to determine the total amount of the reduction.
## Local tax exemptions for business located in industrial parks
No property tax is due for buildings and constructions located in an industrial park. Also, land within industrial parks is exempt from land tax.
The incentives granted for the set up and development of industrial parks include:
The companies operating within the industrial park benefit from:
Local Councils may grant land tax exemptions for owners of land situated in degraded or polluted areas, but not included in the area of improvement, at taxpayer’s request and with the approval of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and the Ministry of Environment.
Land tax exemptions apply from the first day of the month following approval being obtained.
## Other incentives granted to taxpayers
For justified claims of the taxpayers, the tax authorities may grant incentives for the payment of taxes, such as the rescheduling of tax payments due.
Rescheduling of tax payment obligations may be granted by the tax authorities to individuals and legal entities upon request. The time-frame for the rescheduling is a maximum of five years.
In order to benefit from the rescheduling of tax payment obligations, taxpayers must meet certain conditions and also provide a guarantee.

# Romania
## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 25 April 2024
## Mergers and acquisitions
Mergers, spin-offs, transfers of assets, and exchanges of shares between two Romanian companies should not trigger capital gains tax.
In the case of a relocation of the registered office of a European Company (SE) and a European Cooperative Society (SCE) from Romania to another EU member state, no tax will apply on the difference between the market value of the transferred assets and liabilities and their fiscal value, provided certain conditions are met. There will also be no tax on such movements at the shareholder level.
If a Romanian company has a PE in another EU member state, and the Romanian company is dissolved as a result of a cross-border reorganisation, the Romanian tax authorities will not have the right to tax the PE.
There are provisions for the recovery of fiscal losses in the case of restructuring operations carried out by Romanian legal entities and those involving Romanian legal entities and residents of other EU member states. Herewith, the right to recover fiscal losses by legal entities that are successors of merger or spin-off operations is regulated. The recovery is correlated with the assets and liabilities transferred according to the merger/spin-off project. Also, some amendments are provided to the Romanian Company Law simplifying and, in some cases, reducing the time-frame for performing the legal steps that have to be followed in case of mergers and spin-offs.
For taxpayers going through a restructuring process, the right to carry forward non-deductible interest expenses and net foreign exchange losses is split between the beneficiary and the assignor in proportion to the assets and liabilities transferred.
The amendments applicable to domestic mergers, total or partial spin-offs, transfer of assets, and exchange of shares have been harmonised with those applicable to similar cross-border transactions. The neutrality of in-kind contributions to a company’s equity has been eliminated, except for cases involving a transfer of a going concern. Transfers carried out during a partial spin-off will not be subject to CIT only if a transfer of a going concern takes place and the transferor maintains at least one line of activity.
## EU state aid investigations
There are no investigations launched by the EC on whether Romania granted selective tax advantages to certain companies in the form of state aid.
## Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS)
Romania is actively involved in implementing anti-BEPS measures (i.e. implementation of ATAD I, ATAD II, DAC 6, CbC reporting) and the OECD’s BEPS minimum standards, especially as an associate member of the Inclusive Framework on BEPS.
Moreover, Romania has signed the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (Multilateral Instrument or MLI). As of 31 January 2022, the MLI has been ratified by Romania, and it will enter into force after the instrument of ratification is submitted to the OECD secretary.
Also, Directive (EU) 2022/2523 (‘Pillar 2 Directive‘) was transposed in the Romanian legislation through Law no. 431/2023 starting 1 January 2024, which introduced into the Romanian legislation a complex system of rules for an effective minimum taxation of 15% for MNE groups and large-scale domestic groups with annual consolidated revenues of at least EUR 750 million in at least two of the four previous financial years.
## Intergovernmental agreements (IGAs)
A Model 1 IGA is treated as 'in effect' by the United States (US) Treasury as of 2 April 2014.
The Model 1 IGA between the US and Romanian governments was signed on 28 May 2015 in order to improve international tax compliance and to implement the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). The agreement will enhance transparency between the two countries in the field of taxation, promote growing cooperation in combating tax evasion practises, simplify implementation of financial information transmission, and increase legal certainty for financial institutions in Romania.
The agreement between Romania and the United States to improve international tax compliance and implementation of FATCA was ratified by the Romanian Parliament and published in the Official Gazette on 30 October 2015.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
The status regarding the implementation of the CRS, as developed by the OECD, is the following:
These two official documents are part of the process of implementing the CRS issued in February 2014 by the OECD.
Based on the MCAA, Romania implemented the first automatic information exchange by September 2017.
In addition, Romania transposed the provisions of Directive 2011/16/EU as amended and supplemented by Directive 2014/107/EU regarding the mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation. As such, Romania introduced in the national legislation a requirement for financial institutions to implement reporting and due diligence rules, which are fully consistent with the CRS developed by the OECD.
Under the CRS and FATCA, reporting financial institutions (e.g. depositary institutions [banks, credit co-operative organisations, savings and credit banks for housing, mortgage loans banks], custodial institutions, investment entities, and specified insurance companies) are required to report to the tax authorities the following information:
## EU Mandatory Disclosure Rules (DAC6)
On 31 January 2020, the Ordinance for implementing Mandatory Disclosure Rules pursuant to Council Directive (EU) 2018/822 (DAC6) was published in the Official Gazette. The Romanian version of the law is closely aligned with the DAC6 Directive’s scope, hallmarks, and reporting requirements. Briefly, DAC6 requires certain intermediaries or taxpayers to report to the tax authorities any cross-border tax planning arrangements that fall within certain 'hallmarks', i.e. characteristics.
The reporting obligation generally applies to any intermediary that designs, markets, organises, makes available for implementation, or manages the implementation of a reportable cross-border arrangement in line with the provisions of the Directive or provides, directly or by means of other persons, aid, assistance, or advice with respect to the above actions concerning a reportable cross-border arrangement.
The DAC6 Directive covers direct taxes (i.e. VAT, customs duties, and excise duties are excluded). The law refers only to cross-border arrangements, the domestic ones being outside the scope of this legislation.
Starting 1 January 2021, intermediaries and, under certain conditions, taxpayers, have the obligation to report each cross-border arrangement within 30 days, which begins with the day following the date on which any of the following moments first occurs: the arrangement is made available for implementation, is ready for implementation, or the first step in the implementation was made.

## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 25 April 2024
## Foreign tax relief
A foreign tax credit may be granted, in accordance with the relevant DTT, provided that the tax paid abroad for the income obtained abroad was actually paid directly by the natural person or by their legal representative. The payment of the tax abroad must be proved with justifying official documents issued by the foreign country’s tax authorities or, in certain circumstances, with documents issued by the payer of the income withholding the income tax or by means of tax returns and the proof of income tax payment.
The tax credit is granted at the level of the tax paid abroad for income derived from abroad, but it may not exceed the part of the income tax payable in Romania related to the taxable income from abroad. In case the taxpayer in question obtains incomes from abroad from several countries, then the tax credit admitted to be deducted from the tax payable in Romania shall be calculated, according to the above-mentioned procedure, for each country and each category of income.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 25 April 2024
## Employment expenses
For the primary workplace, the following amounts are currently to be deducted from the gross salary income when calculating the taxable income:
For the salary income obtained in other cases, taxable income is assessed as the difference between the gross salary income and the individual mandatory social contributions, due according to the law, in line with the provisions of the European Union or other social security agreements to which Romania is a party.
Individual taxpayers may generally direct up to 3.5% of their annual income tax to charitable purposes.

## Individual - Other issues
Last reviewed - 25 April 2024
## The right to work and reside in Romania of the nationals of the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and Swiss Confederation nationals
### The right to work in Romania for EU/EEA and Swiss nationals
Nationals of the EU/EEA countries and of the Swiss Confederation working in Romania, either based on a Romanian employment contract or based on a secondment agreement, have free access to the Romanian labour market and no work authorisation has to be obtained for them. Still, they have to comply with the provisions of the Romanian Labour Law when concluding an employment contract in Romania.
Within the framework of provisions of transnational services, the EU/EEA/Swiss Confederation-based employer has the obligation to inform the competent Romanian labour authority whenever their employees are seconded in Romania and their secondment is extended beyond 12 months. In this respect, a specific notification in a format provided by the law has to be filed with the competent authority, within a specific deadline. Failure in fulfilling this obligation is subject to fines.
Also, the Romanian beneficiary of the service has the obligation to have available certain documents related to the individual’s secondment to Romania (e.g. Romanian notarised translation of the employment contract, service contract between companies, secondment letter, A1 certificate) in case of an audit from the labour authorities.
### Right to reside in Romania for EU/EEA and Swiss Confederation nationals, as well as for their family members
EU/EEA and Swiss nationals residing in Romania for a period longer than three months should register with the Romanian immigration authority and apply for an administrative document named 'registration certificate'. Such document is issued by the competent immigration authority within one to two days from the date of filing the application.
Depending on the purpose of stay of the individual, different documents may be required to sustain the registration certificate application (i.e. secondment letter, employment contract, proof of family relationship, etc.).
Non-EU family members of EU/EEA/Swiss Confederation nationals/Romanian nationals may be subject to different immigration compliance requirements for entering and staying in Romania, such as:
A Romanian permanent residency card could be obtained as well if certain conditions are fulfilled. Such a document has a validity of five years, with the possibility of further extension.
## The right to work and reside in Romania of third country nationals (non-EU)
### Working right in Romania of non-EU nationals
A 'non-EU national' is an individual not holding Romanian, EU/EEA, or Swiss Confederation citizenship.
As a general rule, a non-EU national may perform working activities in Romania, as a local employee or a secondee, only if a work authorisation for employment or secondment is obtained in advance.
Any type of work authorisation is issued by the competent Romanian immigration authorities, based on the official request of the Romanian company, either as employer or beneficiary of the service.
The work authorisation for employment is issued for several categories of workers: permanent workers, highly skilled employees, seasonal workers, trainee workers, cross-border workers, and au pair workers.
The work authorisation for secondment is issued for secondees performing activities in Romania based on a service agreement concluded between their employer and the Romanian beneficiary of their services or under an intra-corporate transfer (ICT).
As a matter of exception, in certain circumstances and subject to the fulfilment of certain specific conditions, some categories of non-EU nationals may perform working activities in Romania without having previously obtained a work authorisation for employment/secondment, such as: non-EU nationals having a right to reside in Romania as family members of Romanian citizens or non-EU nationals employed by companies based in the EU/EEA or Swiss Confederation and seconded to Romania, students concluding an employment contract with limited working time, etc.
The issuance of the work authorisation is conditioned by the fulfilment of certain general conditions (required for all types of work authorisations), as well as specific conditions applicable to each category of worker. Some of the specific conditions required for the most common work authorisations are listed below.
#### Work authorisation for permanent workers
Some of the main special conditions required for obtaining such work authorisation are:
#### Work authorisation for highly skilled workers
The main special conditions required to be proved for obtaining the work authorisation for highly skilled workers are:
#### Work authorisation for secondment purposes
Such work authorisation could be obtained for non-EU nationals seconded to Romania by their employers headquartered outside the EU/EEA/Switzerland area if:
#### Work authorisation for secondment purposes for ICT workers
Some of the main special conditions required to be fulfilled in order to obtain a work authorisation for an ICT worker are:
Foreigners, holders of valid residency permits as ICT workers issued by other EU member states authorities, could be transferred to Romania:
For both the above-mentioned structures, the Romanian beneficiary has the obligation to obtain a work authorisation. However, there are differences in the list of documents required for the applications and the moment when the non-EU national is allowed to start working as an ICT worker.
Additional obligations to inform the labour authorities about the secondment conditions are falling under the Romanian company’s responsibility.
### Right to reside in Romania for non-EU nationals
A non-EU national may travel to Romania and stay here for a period up to a maximum of 90 days within a six-month period, with or without a short-term visa priorly obtained from a Romanian Consulate abroad (depending on the individual’s nationality). However, based on such short-term visa, the non-EU national is not allowed to work in Romania but only to perform specific activities allowed under the visa granted.
Generally, non-EU nationals having a stay in Romania exceeding 90 days within any six-month period need to apply for a long-term visa and subsequently for a temporary residency permit. Nationals of the United States (US), Canada, and Japan are exempted from obtaining Romanian long-term visas.
The documentation required for obtaining Romanian long-term visas/residency permits depends on the type of immigration document required (e.g. secondment, employment, family reunion).
The residency permit may have different names and validity, depending on the purpose for which it was issued.
Obtaining the status of a Romanian long-term resident and the long-term residency permit depends on fulfilling certain conditions provided by the law, generally related to the duration of the stay in Romania of the non-EU national, the value of one's investment, level of knowledge of Romanian language, etc.
#### Personal numerical code
The personal numerical code granted by the competent immigration authority to non-Romanian nationals, through their residency documents (i.e. registration certificate, single permit, EU Blue Card etc.), also represents their fiscal number.
#### Fiscal registration number
The individuals who are not required to obtain residency documents in Romania may fulfil their fiscal obligations here by registering with the fiscal authorities through a fiscal agent or a representative in order to obtain such a fiscal number.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 25 April 2024
## Taxation of residents
### Employment income
Salary is defined as income in cash and/or in kind received by resident or non-resident individuals, based on an individual employment agreement, a job relation, secondment agreement, or a special statute provided by the law, and is taxed at a flat tax rate of 10%.
Salary assimilated income includes remuneration paid according to non-competition clauses and taxable benefits as provided by the Romanian tax legislation. Moreover, administrators’ fees received by members of the General Meeting of Shareholders, the Management Council, the Board of Director, and the Supervision Council are treated as income assimilated to salaries.
From a salary income tax perspective, taxpayers include:
Mandatory employee social contributions are deductible for Romanian salary income tax purposes.
For benefits in kind and/or in cash received from third parties based on an employment contract or a contractual relationship between parties, the obligation to compute, withhold, and pay the income tax belongs to:
### Income from pensions
Contributive pensions are taxable at a flat tax rate of 10%, the taxable pension income being set by deducting from the pension income (determined as a result of the application of the contribution principle, regardless of its level) the non-taxable amount of RON 2,000 per month.
For other types of pensions, progressive tax rates (10%, 15%, and 20%) are applicable.
### Income from independent activities
Income from independent activities is taxed at a flat rate of 10% and covers income from the activities of production, trade, supplies of services, and incomes from liberal professions, earned individually and/or in a form of association, including incomes from adjacent activities.
Individuals earning income from independent activities, from one or more sources of income, are also liable to pay the social insurance and health insurance contributions (capped) if their income exceeds the thresholds provided by the law as detailed below.
The individuals deriving income from independent activities are liable to pay social insurance contributions for a chosen amount that cannot be lower than 12 national minimum gross salaries or 24 national minimum gross salaries, depending on the level of income derived. Individuals whose income does not reach this ceiling can still opt to pay social insurance contributions.
Health insurance contributions are also due for income from independent activities, and, for the year 2024, the taxable basis is capped at 60 minimum gross salaries per year.
The following social contributions rates apply during 2024:
The value of the national minimum gross salary for 2024 is RON 3,300/month.
In general, the annual net income is being determined on a real system basis. In order to report the estimated income obtained from independent activities and to pay the estimated income tax and social contributions due on such income, if the case, the individuals have to submit the annual income tax and social contributions return (*Declaratia unica privind impozitul pe venit si contributiile sociale datorate de persoanele fizice*) within 30 days from the start of the activity and to pay the related taxes by 25 May of the following year. The calculation of the tax obligations and their payment is done through the individual’s self-assessment, made based on the information filled in the annual income tax and social contributions return. Additionally, a separate annual return has to be filed by 25 May of the year following the one in which the income was obtained in order to report the actual income obtained. Alternatively, specific categories of income from independent activities are taxed on the basis of a fixed income quota, as communicated yearly by the local tax authorities. The income tax assessed and paid under a fixed income quota is considered as final tax.
The taxable income from freelance activities is assessed based on the bookkeeping ledgers that providers of independent activities are compelled to keep. The taxable income is calculated under the real system as gross income minus deductible expenses.
Certain expenses are non-deductible, as follows: fines, late-payment penalties (other than contractual penalties as per the contractual agreements with the authorities), donations, private scholarships, sponsorship and protocol expenses in excess of the upper limits set by law, 50% of the expenses incurred with company cars that are not used exclusively for business purposes (with certain exceptions), and other expenses exceeding limits provided by current law, as well as the expenses incurred for the personal usage of the taxpayer's family members. The list is not exhaustive.
### Income from independent activities obtained based on sport activity contracts
Individuals deriving income from independent activities obtained based on sport contracts are subject to income tax, social insurance, and health insurance contributions in Romania. The legal entity or other entity that is paying the income and is required to keep accounting records has the obligation to compute, report, withhold, and wire to the tax authorities 10% income tax applied on the taxable income, the income tax being final. Similar obligations apply for social insurance and health insurance contributions for those cases when the estimated annual gross income is at least equal to 12 national minimum gross salaries in the case of social insurance contributions with the applicable cap for each type of contribution. This obligation exists for income derived from a single income payer or for income derived by individuals from multiple income payers, with the condition that from at least one payer the income derived is at least equal to the above-mentioned level; in case of multiple income payers, the taxpayer designates by contract the income payer required to calculate, withhold, and pay the contributions.
Otherwise, *similar to the provisions mentioned above under Income from independent activities*, for social contributions purposes, the annual return has to be filed by the individuals in order to report the income obtained based on sport activities contracts and to assess the social insurance and health insurance contributions due on such income. The payment deadline for the annual social contributions due is represented, *as above*, by the same reporting deadline (i.e. 25 May of the following year for the previous year).
### Income from intellectual property (IP) rights
Income from IP rights is subject to income tax and social contributions. In case the income from IP rights is paid by a legal entity or other entity required to keep accounting records, the income tax is calculated by applying the 10% rate to the taxable income and is withheld at source. In such case, the payer of the income is required to compute, report, withhold, and pay to the tax authorities the following:
Individuals who derive IP rights income from other payers than those mentioned above and individuals who chose to determine their net income on a real system basis have to calculate, declare, and pay the income tax and the social contributions through the annual return to be filed by 25 May of the year following the one when the income was derived (*similar to the general provisions mentioned above for Income derived from independent activities*).
Retired individuals and individuals who derive salary income or income treated as such are exempt from paying social contributions on income obtained from IP rights.
### Capital gains
Generally, the net capital gain is subject to income tax at the flat rate of 10%. The taxable amount is calculated based on the difference between the sale price and the acquisition price of the shares. In general, broker/transaction fees in connection with the acquisition or sale are tax deductible.
The individual has to report any sale of shares (i.e. capital gain/loss) through the annual return by 25 May of the year following the one in which the sale was performed and pay the related taxes, based on a self-assessment made considering the information reflected in the annual return, within the same reporting deadline (i.e. 25 May).
By way of exception, income from the transfer of securities (other than investment gold) shall be subject to income tax withholding if the transfer is made by intermediaries defined according to the relevant legislation, investment management companies, self-managed investment companies, managers of alternative investment funds, Romanian tax residents, or non-residents who have a permanent establishment (PE) in Romania that has the capacity of an intermediary carrying out the transfer of securities. Such intermediary entities shall be required to determine the gain and withhold the income tax both for revenues obtained from Romania and for those obtained from abroad.
The income tax to be withheld is determined by the intermediary entities at each transfer by applying an income tax rate of:
The health insurance contribution (10%, capped) is also due in case the capital gain, alone or together with other categories of income derived by the individual during the year, as provided by the Fiscal Code, reaches the annual threshold of 6 minimum gross salaries, but not more than 24 minimum gross salaries. It is the obligation of the individual to declare the health insurance contribution in the annual return and pay it by 25 May of the year the income relates with.
### Income from real estate transactions
Income from the transfer of real estate is taxed at the following tax rates applicable on the transaction value, depending on the period for which the property was owned/held:
No income tax is due for ownership of real estate acquired under special laws, for donation deeds between relatives or in-laws up to the third degree inclusively and between spouses, and in cases of inheritance, provided the procedure is finalised within two years as of the date of death of the author of the inheritance (an income tax of 1% of the value of the corpus is levied if the procedure is not completed within those two years).
Income tax due for transfer of real estate ownership is withheld by the notary public and calculated based on the value declared by the parties within the transaction documents. If the value declared by the parties is lower than the estimated minimum value established by the expert appraisal conducted by the Chamber of Public Notaries, the notary public notifies the Romanian tax authorities on this transaction. The tax is to be remitted by the 25th day of the month following that when the income tax was withheld.
### Dividend income
Dividend income is subject to an 8% income tax rate that is to be withheld by the payer of income. This income is considered for assessing the annual minimum cap based on which the health insurance contribution might be due. For example, individuals receiving, in 2024, income from dividends, which, alone or together with other categories of personal income, as provided by the Fiscal Code, are in a value of at least RON 19,800 (6 x minimum gross salary for 2024), have to submit the annual return and pay the health insurance contribution (10% applied on the aforementioned threshold) and the taxable basis is capped at 24 minimum gross salaries per year.
### Interest income
Interest income is subject to the 10% flat tax rate, withheld by the payer of the income, the tax being final. Similar to income from dividends, health insurance contribution (capped) is due if the annual income, alone or together with other categories of personal income, as provided by the Fiscal Code, is of at least the value mentioned above.
### Rental income
Gross annual rental income, other than lease of land, represents the income earned by the owner for a certain year, as stipulated in the rental agreement concluded between the parties.
Rental income is subject to the 10% tax rate and 20% deductible expenses are allowed for assessing the net rental income to be taxed.
In case of payers of income, legal entities or entities who are required to run a bookkeeping, there is an obligation to withhold the 10% income tax, after deducting the 20% deductible expenses out of the gross rental income.
The withheld tax is final and it is to be paid to the state budget by the payer of income by the 25th day of the month following that in which it was withheld. For all other situations, the individual is required to report one’s annual rental income in one’s annual tax return for income tax purposes.
Health insurance contribution (capped) is due if the annual net rental income, alone or together with other categories of personal income, as provided by the Fiscal Code, exceeds the minimum threshold set by the law (e.g. for 2024, the threshold is of at least 6 minimum gross salaries amounting to RON 19,800). The annual taxable basis for the health insurance contribution is capped at 24 minimum gross salaries amounting to RON 79,200.
Individuals obtaining, during the tax year, income from renting out more than five rooms for touristic purposes, starting the following tax year, will treat the income obtained as income from independent activities, and the taxation rules provided for independent activities have to be considered. The individuals have to report such income and pay the related tax obligations through the annual return to be filed by 25 May.
### Income from prizes
Tax on income from prizes is withheld at source and determined by levying 10% on the amount exceeding RON 600 paid for each prize, the tax withheld as such being considered final.
### Income from gambling
Income tax due on income from gambling activities is withheld at source by the organiser/payer of income of gambling activities, by applying the following income tax rates on each gross income received:
The tax calculated and withheld upon disbursement is final.
For gambling income derived from remote or online gambling, the income tax due, as per the above, is determined and withheld at source with the occasion of each transfer realised from the gambling platform into the individual’s bank account or similar.
Income tax due on income derived from gambling activities specific to casinos, poker clubs, slot-machines, and lottery tickets exceeding RON 66,750 is calculated by applying the earlier mentioned income tax rates and by deducting the amount of RON 11,650 from the resulted amount.
### Other income subject to the 10% flat tax rate
The following types of taxable income are included in this category (the list is not exhaustive):
Generally, the income tax due for income from other sources is calculated, withheld, and paid by the income payer. In certain cases (such as for income from virtual currency transfers), the individuals have to file the annual return by 25 May of the year following the one in which the income was obtained and pay the related taxes, based on a self-assessment made considering the information reflected in the annual return, within the same reporting deadline (i.e. 25 May). The health insurance contribution (10%, capped) is also due in case the income from other sources, alone or together with other categories of income derived by the individual, as provided by the Fiscal Code, reaches the annual threshold of 6 minimum gross salaries.
### **Other taxable income**
Income identified by the Romanian tax authorities, in accordance with the Fiscal Procedural Code, for which the source is not identified is taxable with 16% tax rate applied to the taxable basis, as set by the Romanian tax authorities.
Starting with 1 July 2024, the tax rate for this type of income will be 70%.
### Non-taxable income
In the categories of non-taxable income, among others, the following types of income are included, provided that certain conditions are met:
### Exempt income
The following income is exempt from income tax:
## Taxation of non-resident individuals
Income derived by non-resident individuals from activities performed in Romania and income sourced in Romania is generally subject to 10% tax for individuals who are residents of an EU country or a country that has a DTT in place with Romania, with certain exceptions (exceptions may also apply if the tax rate is reduced or eliminated under an applicable DTT concluded by Romania with the country of residence of the individual).
Withholding tax (WHT) of 10% flat rate for non-resident individuals is currently levied on income such as the following types of income sourced in Romania, assuming such income, as provided by the law, is not derived under transactions that are qualified as having an artificial nature (do not have an economic substance):
For the below-mentioned types of income sourced in Romania, taxation is made based on the same rules as for Romanian tax residents:
Also, as an exception to the above-mentioned flat tax rate of 10%,:
On capital gains from Romania, non-resident individuals are subject to the same tax treatment as resident individuals. To fulfil tax obligations arising in Romania, where the case non-residents may appoint a Romanian fiscal representative or a tax agent.
Income from real estate transactions is taxed at the same specific rates as in the case of residents.
Where non-resident individuals can claim treaty protection, the more favourable rates/provisions under the relevant tax treaty can be applied by Romanian payers of income if the beneficiaries have provided the required tax residency certificate.
