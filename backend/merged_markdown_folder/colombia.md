# Colombia
## Overview
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Colombia, a constitutional republic in Northwest South America with coasts on the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, was established in 1886. It is divided into 32 departments and one capital district. Colombia's capital is Bogotá. The official language is Spanish, and the currency is the Colombian peso (COP).
Colombia experienced an accelerated period of growth between 2002 and 2013, and such growth have been maintained until 2019, mainly due to improvements in domestic security, rising commodity prices, and favourable economic market policies. Foreign direct investment experienced an increase in the first semester of 2019 of 20.1%, reaching 4.9 billion United States dollars (USD). The Colombian government has entered into several free trade agreements with European and Asian partners. Currently, the United States and the European Union have been the most important trading partners in services and good exportation and reaching an important rise of foreign direct investment.

# Colombia
## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
The concept of fiscal residency defines the nature of the source that the individual has to declare as follows:
## Personal income tax rates
### General income basket
The following are the types of income included in the general income basket:
The rates for fiscal residents (nationals or foreign) applicable to the general income basket, pension income basket, and dividend income basket (*see below*) are:
| Taxable income (TU \*) | | Marginal rate (%) | Tax liability |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 1,090 | 0 | 0 |
| 1,090 | 1,700 | 19 | (Taxable income translated into TU less TU 1,090) x 19% |
| 1,700 | 4,100 | 28 | (Taxable income translated into TU less TU 1,700) x 28% + TU 116 |
| 4,100 | 8,670 | 33 | (Taxable income translated into TU less TU 4,100) x 33% + TU 788 |
| 8,670 | 18,970 | 35 | (Taxable income translated into TU less TU 8,670) x 35% + TU 2,296 |
| 18,970 | 31,000 | 37 | (Taxable income translated into TU less TU 18,970) x 37% + TU 5,901 |
| 31,000 | And up | 39 | (Taxable income translated into TU less TU 31,000) x 39% + TU 10,352 |
\* In December 2006, the Colombian government approved a reform of the Colombian tax system. Such reform incorporated the TU to measure the different limits and thresholds originally set in absolute numbers, adjusted every year by decree. The value of each TU is equivalent to COP 49.799  for fiscal year (FY) 2025.
### Pension income basket
Includes retirement and disabilities pensions or income received from labour risks, compensations that substitute pensions or refunds (*for rates, see table in General income basket above*).
The recent tax reform considers foreign pension income as exempt of taxation up to TU 1,000.
### Dividend income basket
Dividends subject to tax at the corporate level and paid to fiscal residents will be subject to the progressive marginal rates previously mentioned applicable for the general and pension income basket (0% to 39%).
Nevertheless, residents subject to this tax on their dividend income will be able to claim a tax credit determined as follows:
| Taxable income (TU) | | Marginal tax credit (%) | Tax credit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 1,090 | 0 | 0 |
| 1,090 | And up | 19 | (Taxable income translated into TU less TU 1,090) x 19% |
On the other hand, dividends that were not subject to tax at the corporate level will be taxed at a 35% flat rate, and the net income resulting from subtracting such tax from the gross income will be subject to the individual tax (0% to 39%) previously addressed.
As for non-residents, the applicable tax rate for dividend income was increased to 20% (previously 10%).
## Local income taxes
There are no local taxes on individual income in Colombia.

# Colombia
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Taxable period
For CIT purposes, the taxable period is the calendar year, with no exceptions being admissible.
## Tax returns
CIT return filing due dates are set by the government every year. Usually, they fall in the month of April.
## Payment of tax
For CIT purposes, corporate taxpayers are divided into ‘large taxpayers’ and ‘other taxpayers’. Large taxpayers pay their estimated outstanding CIT liability (outstanding after deducting applicable WHT from the estimated final liability) in three instalments over the year in which they file their annual CIT return (usually in February, April, and June). The due date varies according to the last digits of its NIT (Number of Tax Identification).
Other taxpayers pay their estimated outstanding CIT liability in two instalments over the year in which they file their annual CIT return (usually in April and June). The due date varies according to the last digit of its NIT.
## Tax audit process
The audit cycle corresponds to the taxable period, which for the case of CIT is one year.
## Statute of limitations
The standard statute of limitations is three years from the due date or the date in which the return has been filed if extemporary.
Returns where losses are incurred will have a statute of limitations of five years.
The statute of limitation for returns where losses are used or subject to the transfer pricing regime will be five years from its filing due date or from the latest filing date.
VAT and WHT statute of limitation is linked to the CIT return.
The new statute of limitations (three years or five years) should not impact filings made prior to the end of 2019.
Note that income taxpayers subject to taxation on a worldwide basis are required to present an annual return to disclose and identify any form of assets held outside Colombia.
## Anti-abuse regulations
Colombian regulations establish some anti-abuse provisions, which allow the tax authority to disregard the transactions considered not to have a valid commercial or business purpose and which tend to modify, reduce, eliminate, or defer the applicable tax consequences.
Under the anti-abuse provisions, the tax authority is allowed to re-classify the nature of the transaction performed by the taxpayer and to assign the tax consequences applicable to the ‘real’ transaction.
There are special proceeding rules that must be applied if the Colombian Tax Authority defines that a taxpayer has incurred abusive practices. Such proceeding includes issuing an official requirement stating the reasons why the administration considers the taxpayer’s practice as abusive and it will only require at least summary/slight/hint evidence. The taxpayer will have a term of three months to reply to the assessment. If the argument is not satisfactory for the administration, another official statement must be issued where the Colombian Tax Authority explains the amendments that must be made to the taxpayer returns and which is, in the authorities opinion, the ‘real’ transaction.
## Electronic invoices
The Colombian Tax Authority is authorised to regulate the requirements regarding sales invoices and equivalent documents. Electronic e-invoicing system is applicable to payroll expenses and transaction with entities and individuals not obligated to issue e-invoicing in Colombia, among others.

# Colombia
## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Social security contributions
Every employee whose work contract is governed by Colombian labour regulations (with the exception of some foreign employees who may become voluntarily affiliated to the pensions system) must be affiliated to the integral social security system, which includes the:
The basis for contributions is determined by the monthly salary (excluding non-salary items) earned by the employee, which may not be, for ordinary salaried employees, less than the minimum legal monthly salary (COP 1.423.500 in 2025) and may not exceed 25 minimum legal monthly salaries (COP 35.587.500 million in 2025).
For employees who earn an integral salary, the basis for pension contributions will be the lower of 25 minimum legal monthly salaries or 70% of such integral salary.
### Contribution amounts
In the two regimes (public and private), the contribution amounts are currently 28.5% of the monthly salary.
Out of this percentage, 75% (approximately 20.5% of the monthly salary) must be borne by the employer and 25% (approximately 8% of the monthly salary) must be borne by the employee.
As such, for the mandatory health system, the employee should contribute 4% and the employer 8.5%. Note that starting from 2014, for employees with salaries below ten minimum monthly wages , the mandatory contribution to the health system on behalf of the employer does not apply. As such, the 8.5% contribution applies only to salaries above ten minimum monthly wages.
In regards to the mandatory contribution to the pension system, the employer should contribute 12% over the basis and the employee 4%.
Note that employees who earn more than 4 minimum legal monthly salaries (COP 5.694.000) must contribute an additional 1%, which will be destined to the pension solidarity fund, created by law to cover the risks of workers with scarce resources. Also, employees who earn more than 16 minimum monthly salaries (COP 22.776.000) must contribute an additional percentage (between 0.2% and 1%), depending on the amount of salary received.
For professional risks (*Aportes de Riesgos Profesionales*), the employer must pay a contribution ranging from 0.522% to 6.96% of the monthly salary, which is an insurance that covers risks of labour-related illnesses or accidents, permanent disability, death, and incapacity also derived from the employee's activity.
In addition, for employees with salaries higher than ten minimum monthly wages, employers must pay a 9% payroll tax on salary items only, the basis of which is 100% for ordinary salaried employees and 70% for integral salaried employees.
## Capital gains taxes
Capital gains are considered extraordinary income received by an individual from the occurrence of an exceptional economic act. The different kinds of capital gains in Colombian tax law are:
The general tax rate for capital gains in Colombia is 15%.
In the case of gains derived from lotteries, gaming, or similar activities, the tax rate is 20% (of the gain).
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
## Equity tax
| Taxable base (TU) | | Marginal tax rate (%) | Equity tax |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 72,000 | 0 | 0 |
| 72,000 | 122,000 | 0.5 | (Taxable base in TU less TU 72,000) x 0.5% |
| 122,000 | 239,000 | 1.0 | (Taxable base in TU less TU 122,000) x 1.0% + TU 250 |
| 239,000 | And on | 1.5 | (Taxable base in TU less TU 239,000) x 1.5% + TU 1,420 |
## Inheritance tax
There is no inheritance or gift-specific tax, as such, in Colombia. However, for tax purposes, inheritance and gifts are considered extraordinary income, and, as such, the heir/beneficiary will be liable to capital gains tax.
## Property taxes
## Financial transactions tax
The financial transactions tax is a permanent tax on financial transactions, the collection of which is the responsibility of regulated financial institutions and the Central Bank (*Banco de la República*).
The tax rate is 0.4%, and the taxable event is the carrying out of financial transactions that involve the disposal of resources deposited in checking or savings accounts, as well as in deposit accounts with *Banco de la República*and the issuance of cashier’s checks.
50% of the total tax paid is deductible for corporate income tax (CIT) purposes, regardless of whether or not the transactions have a causal nexus with the income-producing activity of the taxpayer.
The law establishes a series of operations and transactions that are exempted from this tax.

# Colombia
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is applicable in the following cases:
This tax is not applicable to the sale of vehicles and other fixed assets to be sold on a regular basis on behalf of third parties, as well as aeroplanes.
Services provided from abroad will be taxed through a reverse-charge mechanism, hence the beneficiary of the service will be liable to file the corresponding return and pay the tax before the Colombian Tax Authority, only if the beneficiary is registered for VAT.
Law 1819 of 2016 established that non-resident service providers rendering services from abroad must register for VAT purposes in Colombia when they sell vatable services to customers who are not registered for VAT purposes in Colombia. Registration for VAT purposes does not necessarily mean the triggering of a PE. Such obligation has been complied with by several foreign taxpayers, which requested a Colombian Tax ID, collected VAT, and remitted VAT during the bimonthly periods starting from 1 July 2018.
Nowadays, the registration process requires the foreign provider to obtain a Tax ID for the enterprise and for the legal representative, as well as a digital signature for the former. Additionally, a physical address in Colombian and an economic activity code needs to be provided.
Complementing the before mentioned, the foreign taxpayer can opt for allowing the financial entity, in cases where the payment is performed by using a debit/credit card, to act as withholding agent (WHT system is in force; however, the Tax Office has not released the list of non-resident service providers subject to WHT, so the system is currently not applicable), provided that the following requirements are fulfilled:
| Type of service | * Supply of audio-visual services (among them music, videos, movies, broadcasting of any event and games of any kind). * Services provided through digital platforms. * Supply of on-line advertisement. * Provision of distance trainings or courses. * Supply of rights of use or exploitation of intangibles. * Other electronic/digital services to customers located in Colombia. |
| --- | --- |
| Taxable base | The value recorded on the invoice sent to the Colombian customer. When not defined in Colombian pesos, the base will be the result of converting the value invoiced in other currency to Colombian pesos, using the foreign exchange rate of the day in which the reported VAT is going to be paid (the VAT return filing date and the payment date should be the same to avoid ineffective allegations). |
| Withholding agent | The financial entity that issued the debit/credit card used by the Colombian customer to acquire the service. As well any other intermediary facilitating the effective payment to the service provider and any other entity designated by the Tax Office. |
| Entities allowed to use this alternative | * Entities conducting one or several VATable digital services (only those listed before). * Entities opting in for the alternative. |
| Entities required to file the return | * Foreign entities developing one or several services of those listed before that do not opt in for this alternative. * Foreign entities providing services that do not qualify for the alternative, which are still digital services providers. |
On the realm of digital services provided from abroad, Law 2010 of 2018 identifies distant maintenance of equipment and programs as a VATable operation.
Additionally, there are some acts that are considered as a sale, which are the following:
The Colombian VAT is based on a credit-debit system throughout the entire chain of a business. However, certain products are only taxed at the manufacturer level (one-phase VAT). For purposes of VAT calculation, the VAT payer may credit the VAT (input) paid to vendors (certain limitations apply) against any VAT (output) collected from customers.
### VAT rates
The general VAT rate is 19%. However, certain services and goods are taxed at 5% and 0%.
The following are the most significant goods and services taxed at 5%:
The following are the most significant goods and services taxed at 0%:
### VAT exemptions
Under current law, there are VAT exemptions available for the following items, among others:
### Withholding VAT
VAT withholding on the purchase of goods and services for most domestic transactions is 15% of the tax due (effective rate 2.85%).
### VAT compliance
Filing frequency depends on taxpayer’s annual gross revenue as of 31 December of the previous taxable year. For businesses with annual revenue equal to or higher than TVU 92,000 (approximately USD 1.058.577 FY 2025), the frequency is bimonthly. If annual revenue is not in excess of TVU 92,000, the filing frequency is every four months.
No VAT filings are required for periods where no inputs or outputs exist.
Additionally, the tax reform of 2016 allows enterprises, branches, or businesses where the main activity is the exploration of hydrocarbons to file a VAT return from the moment in which the enterprise initiates its exploration activity in order to recognise the input VAT paid in acquisition or import of goods and services to be invested in the exploration phase and to be taken as part of the cost of development of their amortisable assets or investments in offshore projects. The balances in favour generated via VAT return during the exploration phases can be claimed during the next year of its generation (exploitation phase).
The regime is divided into two, identified as VAT responsible agents and non-responsible agents.
### VAT credit
VAT paid to vendors is creditable even if paid at rates higher than those at which taxable sales are made. Where a receivable arises above that credit, a refund will be available upon request, subject to certain circumstances (e.g. zero-rate sales or taxed sales).
### VAT paid on capital assets can be credited against income tax
VAT paid while building or buying a fixed asset, and all services needed to use such asset, can be credited against income tax of the year in which the VAT is being effectively paid.
## Consumption tax
A national consumption tax is levied on the following select services and goods:
Consumption tax cannot be credited against VAT. Consequently, the tax will be treated as a higher cost of the acquired asset or product and will be treated as a deductible cost for income tax purposes.
## Customs duties
As a general rule, the importation processes before the Colombian Internal Revenue and Customs Service (DIAN) can be carried out only by users registered in the Customs Information System.
According to the Harmonized System of Designation and Coding of Goods approved by the World Trade Organisation (WTO), imported goods are classified into subentries composed of six digits. Also, two digits are added, which are for exclusive use of the Andean Community (CAN), and two final digits, which correspond to the digits for use of Colombia. The customs subentry or harmonized tariff schedule (HTS) code, which is the ten-digit result, is exposed in the Colombian Customs Tariff, which is governed by Decree 2153 of 2016 and its amendments, which also reflects the applicable tariff of each duty. VAT, which is also part of the customs duties, is regulated in the Colombian Tax Code.
The general VAT rate for the importation of goods is 19%, and the customs duties range between 0% and 20%. However, in some cases, they may be higher, depending on HTS Code.
## Excise taxes
There are some excise taxes for the consumption of beer and its derivatives, wine, liquor and its derivatives, and cigarettes and similar products.
Tax rates are defined by law, although the tax is collected by regional authorities:
## Corrective taxes
### Carbon tax
The scope of the existing carbon tax is broadened to include the sale, self-consumption, and importation of coal (certain exemptions apply, including coal for export). Rates will rise while continuing to be specific values per ton, gallon, or cubic square. A phased approach is introduced for rates for coal from 2023 to 2027. Carbon tax will be deductible for income tax purposes.
### Tax on single-use plastics used for packing and wrapping
An excise tax will be imposed on the sale, withdrawal, or import for self-consumption of single-use plastic products for packing and wrapping goods (certain exemptions apply). The manufacturer or importer is to be the taxpayer of record. A rate for specific value per gram is to be applied. This tax will not be deductible for income tax purposes.
### Tax on sugar-rich ultra-processed drinks
A newly introduced excise tax will apply beginning November 2023 on the sale by producers and import of self-consumption of select sugar-rich beverages (certain exemptions apply, including sales for exports), subject to rate based on specific value of millilitres, and will be deductible for income tax purposes.
### Tax on sugar and sodium-rich ultra-processed food
A 10% excise tax (15% in 2024 and 20% from 2025) will be imposed beginning November 2023 on the production, import, and self-consumption of sugar and sodium-rich ultra-processed food products. In scope items will include, among other, those under tariff classification 04.04.90.00.00, 16.01, 16.02, 17.04. Individuals that are small-sized producers (revenue not in excess of USD 115,063) will be out of scope, as well as in scope items for export.
## Property tax
The property tax is a municipal tax that is imposed annually on real estate property located in urban, suburban, or rural areas. It is levied on both improved and unimproved real estate; consequently, the taxpayers of this tax are the owners or holders of the real estate property.
The taxable base of this tax is the current cadastral value of the property, as adjusted for inflation. In some cities, such as Bogotá, the taxable base is the value of the property as appraised by the taxpayer directly.
Property tax rates depend upon the nature and usage of the property, and generally range between 0.5% and 1.2%.
This tax is fully deductible for CIT purposes, provided the same has a causal nexus with the income-producing activity of the taxpayer (e.g. where the tax is paid on rental property).
## Stamp tax
The stamp tax rate is between 1.5% and 3% applicable upon the alienation of real estate over 20.000 tax units (approx. USD 230,125)
## Capital gains tax
The capital gains tax rate is 15%.
## Financial transactions tax
The financial transactions tax is a permanent tax on financial transactions, the collection of which is the responsibility of regulated financial institutions and the Central Bank (*Banco de la República*).
The tax rate is 0.4%, and the taxable event is the carrying out of financial transactions that involve the disposal of resources deposited in checking or savings accounts as well as in deposit accounts with *Banco de la República* and the issuance of cashier’s checks.
50% of the total tax paid is deductible for CIT purposes, regardless of whether or not the transactions have a causal nexus with the income-producing activity of the taxpayer.
The law establishes a series of operations and transactions that are exempted from this tax.
## Payroll taxes and social security contributions
There are three major payroll taxes and contributions.
The basis for contributions is determined by the monthly salary (excluding non-salary items) earned by the employee, which may not be, for ordinary salaried employees, less than the minimum legal monthly salary (approximately USD 331 in FY 2025) and may not exceed 25 minimum legal monthly salaries (approximately USD 8,275 in FY 2025).
For employees who earn an integral salary, the basis for pension contributions will be the lower of 25 minimum legal monthly salaries or 70% of such integral salary.
### Amounts of contributions
In the two regimes (public and private), the amounts of contributions are currently 28.5% of the monthly salary.
Out of this percentage, 75% (approximately 20.5% of the monthly salary) must be borne by the employer and 25% (approximately 8% of the monthly salary) must be borne by the employee.
However, employees who earn more than four minimum legal monthly salaries must contribute an additional 1%, which will be destined to the pension solidarity fund, created by law to cover the risks of workers with scarce resources. Also, employees who earn more than 16 minimum monthly salaries must contribute an additional percentage (between 0.2% and 1%), depending on the amount of salary received.
For professional risks (*Aportes de Riesgos Profesionales*), the employer must pay a contribution ranging from 0.522% to 6.96% of the monthly salary, which is an insurance that covers risks of labour-related illnesses or accidents, permanent disability, death, and incapacity also derived from the employee's activity.
In addition, for employees with salaries higher than ten minimum monthly wages, employers must pay a payroll tax of 9% on salary items only, the basis of which is 100% for ordinary salaried employees and 70% for integral salaried employees.
## Plastic bags tax
The triggering event for the plastic bags tax is the use of plastic bags, and the collections must be made by the commercial products to be carried in the bags. Since 2020 onwards, each plastic bag will cost COP 50.
This tax cannot be treated as a cost, deduction, or credit for any other tax.
## Medicinal cannabis tax
Medicinal cannabis tax is applicable to the sale, freely or onerously, of transformed products based on psychoactive or non-psychoactive cannabis. The rate to be applied is 16%, and this tax cannot be credited against VAT.
## Industry and trade tax
The industry and trade tax is a municipal tax that is imposed on revenue obtained from the exercise of industrial, commercial, or service activities in any Colombian municipal jurisdiction. It can be viewed as a special form of a turnover tax.
The industry and trade tax rates are determined by each municipality, and, as a rule, they range between 0.2% and 1%. 100% of this tax can be deductible as an expense for CIT purposes.

# Colombia
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Corporate income tax (CIT)
National companies (i.e. incorporated in Colombia under Colombian law) are taxed on worldwide income. Foreign non-residents are taxed on their Colombian-source income only.
The current general CIT rate is 35%. This rate is applied upon taxable income.
An additional 5% surcharge is applicable through 2027 for financial institutions, including insurance and reinsurance companies as well as stock and commodities brokers and infrastructure suppliers to the stock and securities markets, with taxable income equal to or greater than 120.000 tax units (approximately USD 1,390,000 for FY 2025)
A permanent surcharge is introduced for crude oil and coal extraction and production industry players with taxable income equal to or greater than approximately USD 588,362 for FY 2024. The surtax rate goes from 5% up to 10% (15% for oil extraction), subject to current year averaged market prices being at or over 65% of averaged prices over the preceding 120 months.
A 3% temporary surcharge for years 2023 through 2026 is introduced for hydro-electric power companies with taxable income equal to or greater than 30.000 tax units ( approximately USD 345.188 for FY 2025).
Taxable income is generally defined as the excess of all operating and non-operating revenue over deductible costs and expenses. The customary costs and expenses of a business are generally acceptable as deductible expenditure for CIT purposes, provided they are necessary, reasonable, and have been realised during the relevant tax year under the accrual or cash method of accounting, as the case may be.
Starting from FY 2023, the current general capital gains tax rate is 15% (up from 10% previously).
Qualifying businesses, such as offshore (exploration and production) companies, qualified companies operating at onshore FTZs (port services, permanent FTZs dedicated to the refining of fuels derived from petroleum or the refining of industrial biofuels), and qualified FTZ companies providing logistic services to FTZ management entities located in FTZs, enjoy a reduced rate of 20% (while subject to capital gains tax at 15%, where applicable).
The preferential 20% rate for other qualified FTZ companies will only survive for those taxpayers qualified until 2022 and during the initial term of the qualification. For taxpayers qualified after 2022, the preferential rate is subject to an export-oriented plan to be submitted for approval by the government.
Worldwide income earned by non-resident entities that is attributable to branches and permanent establishments (PEs) will be taxed at 35% or 15%, depending on whether the income is to be treated as ordinary income or capital gain.
## Minimum presumptive tax
The minimum presumptive tax was phased out as of FY 2021.
## Minimum effective tax rate (METR)
Starting from FY 2023, drawing from the OECD-propelled Pillar II, but certainly broader in scope and goals, an METR of 15% is introduced for resident corporations (with exemptions for social interest housing, zomac, and entities with adjusted profits equal to or lower than zero, among others).
Subject to a formulaic system, in-scope taxpayers will be required to true-up the METR to 15%.
## Stability Agreement Regime
As of 1 January 2013, the Legal and Tax Stability Framework was repealed. Applications under consideration will be grandfathered and approved if they meet the applicable requirement. Any already executed Legal Stability Agreements will continue to apply until expiration.
## Significant economic presence (SEP) rules
Starting 1 January 2024, a new SEP rule of taxation was introduced in Colombia. This rule intends to tax the income obtained by non-residents from the sale of goods and/or provision of digital services into Colombia when certain thresholds are fulfilled.
Executive Order defines digital services as: “those services provided through the Internet or an electronic network in an automated manner that require minimal human involvement by the service provider and are impossible to guarantee in the absence of technology. Services that have tax treatment established in other provisions are excluded, such as technical services, consulting and technical assistance, even if they are provided through an electronic network or platform.”
A non-resident entity will have an SEP in Colombia for (i) the sale of goods and/or (ii) the provision of digital services, provided there is a deliberate and systematic interaction with the Colombian market as well as a certain minimum level of revenue from Colombia.
It is presumed that a non-resident maintains a deliberate and systematic interaction with the Colombian market (i.e. with customer[s] and/or user[s] located in Colombia) when at least one of the following conditions is met: (i) Interaction or marketing outreach with 300,000 or more customers and/or users located in Colombia during the previous or current taxable year or (ii) prices are displayed in Colombian pesos (COP) or payment is allowed in Colombian pesos.
Customers are defined to be any individuals, entities, or otherwise unincorporated entities that buy and pay for goods or services, while users are those who have access to a website, portal, or app (digital interface) with a username and password.
Additionally, to create an SEP, the non-resident must obtain gross revenue equal to or exceeding 31,300 tax value units (TVU) (approximately USD 360.146) from transactions involving the sale of goods and/or provision of services to customer(s) and/or user(s) located in Colombia during the previous taxable year or the current taxable year.
SEPs thresholds are to be measured at a group level. Thus, if more than one entity sells goods and/or digital services into Colombia, the aggregate of such entities should be taken into account in determining the threshold tests, and all of the entities are considered to be covered by the SEP rules.
Foreign entities that trigger SEP will either be subject to a 10% WHT if they decide not to register before the Colombian tax office or 3% tax on gross revenue if they decide to register and submit an annual income tax return in Colombia. If the company fulfils the thresholds to have an SEP in Colombia and opts for the voluntary registration, it is important to consider that advance payments in two months at a 2% rate are also required.

# Colombia
## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Social security contributions
Every employee whose work contract is governed by Colombian labour regulations (with the exception of some foreign employees who may become voluntarily affiliated to the pensions system) must be affiliated to the integral social security system, which includes the:
The basis for contributions is determined by the monthly salary (excluding non-salary items) earned by the employee, which may not be, for ordinary salaried employees, less than the minimum legal monthly salary (COP 1.423.500 in 2025) and may not exceed 25 minimum legal monthly salaries (COP 35.587.500 million in 2025).
For employees who earn an integral salary, the basis for pension contributions will be the lower of 25 minimum legal monthly salaries or 70% of such integral salary.
### Contribution amounts
In the two regimes (public and private), the contribution amounts are currently 28.5% of the monthly salary.
Out of this percentage, 75% (approximately 20.5% of the monthly salary) must be borne by the employer and 25% (approximately 8% of the monthly salary) must be borne by the employee.
As such, for the mandatory health system, the employee should contribute 4% and the employer 8.5%. Note that starting from 2014, for employees with salaries below ten minimum monthly wages , the mandatory contribution to the health system on behalf of the employer does not apply. As such, the 8.5% contribution applies only to salaries above ten minimum monthly wages.
In regards to the mandatory contribution to the pension system, the employer should contribute 12% over the basis and the employee 4%.
Note that employees who earn more than 4 minimum legal monthly salaries (COP 5.694.000) must contribute an additional 1%, which will be destined to the pension solidarity fund, created by law to cover the risks of workers with scarce resources. Also, employees who earn more than 16 minimum monthly salaries (COP 22.776.000) must contribute an additional percentage (between 0.2% and 1%), depending on the amount of salary received.
For professional risks (*Aportes de Riesgos Profesionales*), the employer must pay a contribution ranging from 0.522% to 6.96% of the monthly salary, which is an insurance that covers risks of labour-related illnesses or accidents, permanent disability, death, and incapacity also derived from the employee's activity.
In addition, for employees with salaries higher than ten minimum monthly wages, employers must pay a 9% payroll tax on salary items only, the basis of which is 100% for ordinary salaried employees and 70% for integral salaried employees.
## Capital gains taxes
Capital gains are considered extraordinary income received by an individual from the occurrence of an exceptional economic act. The different kinds of capital gains in Colombian tax law are:
The general tax rate for capital gains in Colombia is 15%.
In the case of gains derived from lotteries, gaming, or similar activities, the tax rate is 20% (of the gain).
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
## Equity tax
| Taxable base (TU) | | Marginal tax rate (%) | Equity tax |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 72,000 | 0 | 0 |
| 72,000 | 122,000 | 0.5 | (Taxable base in TU less TU 72,000) x 0.5% |
| 122,000 | 239,000 | 1.0 | (Taxable base in TU less TU 122,000) x 1.0% + TU 250 |
| 239,000 | And on | 1.5 | (Taxable base in TU less TU 239,000) x 1.5% + TU 1,420 |
## Inheritance tax
There is no inheritance or gift-specific tax, as such, in Colombia. However, for tax purposes, inheritance and gifts are considered extraordinary income, and, as such, the heir/beneficiary will be liable to capital gains tax.
## Property taxes
## Financial transactions tax
The financial transactions tax is a permanent tax on financial transactions, the collection of which is the responsibility of regulated financial institutions and the Central Bank (*Banco de la República*).
The tax rate is 0.4%, and the taxable event is the carrying out of financial transactions that involve the disposal of resources deposited in checking or savings accounts, as well as in deposit accounts with *Banco de la República*and the issuance of cashier’s checks.
50% of the total tax paid is deductible for corporate income tax (CIT) purposes, regardless of whether or not the transactions have a causal nexus with the income-producing activity of the taxpayer.
The law establishes a series of operations and transactions that are exempted from this tax.

# Colombia
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Inventory valuation
The value of inventories, which includes all expenses and direct and indirect charges necessary to put an item in a position to use or sell, must be determined using one of the methods allowed under IFRS rules. For goods of a similar nature, the allowed methods are first in first out (FIFO) or weighted average. For inventories of diverse natures or usages, a different methodology can be used, as long as such has a recognised technical value.
## Capital gains
## Dividend income
From FY 2017 onwards, dividend distribution is taxed; this means that only dividends paid out of profits obtained since FY 2017 onwards should be subject to the dividend tax.
This tax is applied regardless of the profits being taxed or not at the distributing company level, and the rates differ depending on the residence of the beneficiary, as follows:
## Interest income
Interest income derived from activities in Colombia is considered part of the CIT base for Colombian entities; however, if interest is paid or accrued to a non-resident that is not compelled to file a CIT return in Colombia, a WHT is accrued over the payment or deposit at a rate of 20%, which can be reduced to 15% if the maturity term is equal to or exceeds one year. Note that there are some special conditions derived from double tax treaties (DTTs) that may decrease the WHT rate.
An exemption is in place for principal, interest, and commissions related to lending, insurance, re-insurance, and other finance trade by governmental financial entities for countries with which cooperation agreements have been executed over these areas.
A reduced 5% WHT rate is available for interest income earned by non-residents on loans or bond-like instruments with terms of eight years or longer, the proceeds of which are used for certain government/private-run infrastructure projects.
Interest on short-term imports is to be out of scope for WHT purposes only if debt maturity is not to exceed 6 months (24 months prior to 2019).
## Royalty income
Royalties paid in favour of a Colombian entity are subject to taxes in Colombia; consequently, such royalty payments are part of the CIT base. If royalties are paid in favour of a non-resident (i.e. in favour of an entity that is not compelled to file CIT in Colombia), WHT is generally accrued over the payment or deposit at a rate of 20%.
Certain DTTs offer limited relief for the WHT on royalties (e.g. 10%).
## Foreign income
The following cases, among others, qualify as foreign-source income:
It should be noted that income triggered by other technical services, as well as consulting services, technical assistance, and administrative services rendered by a related party in the last case, will be regarded as Colombian-source income, regardless if rendered in Colombia or abroad, and subject to a 20% WHT (33% for administrative services).

# Colombia
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
The Colombian tax system provides for WHT as a general mechanism of advance tax collection. Under the law, as a general rule, all corporate entities are required to collect or withhold taxes from payments made to third parties. The WHT collection agents must collect the applicable WHT amounts, deposit the withheld amounts with the authority, file monthly WHT returns, and issue WHT certificates to the payees. The payees who are also CIT return filers credit the withheld taxes against the annual CIT liability computed on their returns.
However, domestic income earned by non-resident entities that is not attributable to branches and PEs will be taxed under general income tax rate (35%).
On other types of payments that give rise to Colombian-source income, the general WHT rate is 15%, with the foreign non-resident payee being required to file a CIT return in Colombia to report the final CIT liability, at the rates mentioned before on net income (and being entitled to a refund where the final liability is less than the amount withheld at the 15% rate or being required to pay the deficit should the case be the opposite).
WHT returns do not need to be filed where there are no taxes to declare or pay.
## Offsetting of WHT
WHT returns filed on a non-payment basis will be treated as not filed, except if the filer has a refundable tax credit balance equal to or higher than two times the outstanding payment. A six-month deadline applies for the taxpayer to apply the offsetting of the credit balance. Otherwise, late filing penalties will apply.
The WHT return that has been filed without full payment before the expiration of the due date to be submitted will have legal effects, as long as the total payment of the withholding is made within the two following months counted as from the due date to submission of the tax return.
## Special self-withholding tax
There is a special self-withholding tax from 0.55% up to 4.5% over gross revenues for Colombian taxpayers that are exempt from paying social security and health contributions for their employees earning less than ten times the current legal minimum monthly wage (approximately USD 3.310 in FY 2025). The self-withholding is creditable against the CIT liability.
## Self-withholding on some exports
There is a 5.4% self-withholding tax on exports for the mining, oil, and gas industry. The self-withholding is creditable against the CIT liability.
## WHT on interest
Interest payments made abroad on loans or cross-border leasing agreements are subject to a 20% WHT. If the loan or cross-border agreement has a term equal to or greater than eight years and it is destined to financing government/private-run infrastructure projects under the conditions set in Law 1508 of 2012, a 5% WHT is triggered.
However, lease agreements for aircraft, ships, and the like, or parts thereof, are subject to a 1% WHT. In addition, a reduced rate of 15% is applicable upon interest and alike payments connected with loans provided by foreign entities which term is equal to or higher than one year. This also applies to interest and financial payments related with the monthly payment of leasing agreements.
## Summary WHT chart for payments to non-Colombian entities

Notes
1. The treaty rate depends on the participation of the shareholder in the Colombian company that distributed the dividends and some other requirements.
2. The rate depends on whether the lender is a financial entity or not.
3. If services are locally untaxed, there is no WHT; otherwise, a 10% WHT will apply.
4. Treaty will presumably apply from 2026 onwards. The internal approval phases are not completed yet.
5. In the treaty with France and the United Kingdom, the definition of royalties does not include technical services and consulting services, which might be considered as business profits not subject to withholding. This consideration might be applied in other DTTs as it triggers the 'most favoured nation' clause.
6. In the treaty with Switzerland, the rental/leasing of technical equipment is considered as a royalty; however, it might, under the most favoured nation clause, be considered as a business profit based on the tax treatment provided in the DTT.
7. 20% for profits taxed at the level of the entity making the distribution. 35% + 20% (48%) for profits untaxed at the level of the entity making the distribution.

# Colombia
## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Tax Reform (Law 2277 of December 2022) passed and enacted
### Corporate taxation
### Corrective taxes
#### Carbon tax
Starting from FY 2023, the scope of the existing carbon tax is broadened to include the sale, self-consumption, and importation of coal (certain exemptions apply, including coal for export). Rates will rise while continuing to be specific values per ton, gallon, or cubic square. A phased approach is introduced for rates for coal from 2023 thru 2027. Carbon tax will be deductible for income tax purposes.
#### Tax on single-use plastics used for packing and wrapping
An excise tax will be imposed on the sale, withdrawal, or import for self-consumption of single-use plastic products for packing and wrapping goods (certain exemptions apply). The manufacturer or importer is to be the taxpayer. A rate for specific value per gram is to be applied. This tax will not be deductible for income tax purposes.
#### Tax on sugar-rich ultra-processed drinks
A newly introduced excise tax will apply beginning November 2023 on the sale by producers and import of self-consumption of select sugar-rich beverages (certain exemptions apply), subject to rate based on specific value of millilitres, and will be deductible for income tax purposes.
#### Tax on sugar and sodium-rich ultra-processed food
A 10% excise tax (15% in 2024 and 20% from 2025) will be imposed beginning November 2023 on the production, import, and self-consumption of sugar and sodium-rich ultra-processed food products. In scope items will include, among other, those under tariff classification 04.04.90.00.00, 16.01, 16.02, 17.04. Individuals that are small-sized producers (revenue not in excess of 10.000 tax units (Approx. USD 115.000) will be out of scope.

# Colombia
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Corporate residence is as general determined by the place of incorporation of any given company.
For CIT purposes, companies incorporated under foreign laws that have their main domicile abroad are considered ’foreign companies’, whereas any company incorporated in Colombia under Colombian law qualifies as a ‘national company’ even if fully owned by foreign shareholders.
Rules on effective place of management are in place (*see below*).
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The Colombian internal legislation incorporates the concept of PE. This concept follows the OECD criteria and means a fixed place of business through which an entity carries out its activity, whether partially or totally.
A PE will also be incorporated when a person (other than an independent agent) has the capacity to conclude contracts on behalf of the foreign entity, except for preparatory and auxiliary activities.
In order to define what should be understood as preparatory and auxiliary activities, local regulations have adopted the OECD criteria.
Colombian law upholds the triggering of a PE upon the presence of a fixed place of business that is located in a given place and features a certain degree of permanence (no cut-off timeline is provided) where a non-resident entity conducts part or the whole of its business.
Auxiliary and preparatory activities that do not cause a PE to exist are listed out. The regulations reiterate that a PE is subject to income tax on worldwide income attributable to its course of business as well as on any income directly earned.
Also, a PE will be subject to domestic WHT rates whenever engaged with resident parties.
However, payments or accruals to non-residents having a PE may continue to be subject to rates set out for non-residents if the underlying transaction is unrelated to the PE's purpose. A PE will be required to make annual CIT filings. PEs are given the capacity to withhold and remit taxes as well as to charge and collect value-added tax (VAT) to the extent of taxable transactions.
Requisites for registration of a PE are set out and include, *inter alia*, good standing documentation or proof of existence as well as an active account at a local bank or financial institution.
A PE is required to prepare contemporaneous documentation (in addition to transfer pricing compliance requirements) with a functional and technical analysis of the assets, liabilities, capital, risks income, costs, and expenses attributable to its business in Colombia. In addition, a PE must, for tax purposes, prepare separate accounts for purposes of the attribution of income and capital gains.
Interest on debt push down to branches and PEs under attribution rules is deductible only when subject to WHT.
Branches and PEs are subject to income tax on worldwide source income that is attributable under attribution rules since 2019.
## Effective place of management (EPOM)
As of FY 2023, EPOM rules are broadened and will operate around less subjective tests to include scrutiny over the place where day-to-day activities are carried out, as well as the place where management usually exercises authority and responsibility over the entity’s affairs.
Guidance is available (Regulation 3028 of 27 December 2013) on how to register a non-resident entity that is effectively managed in Colombia and treated as a resident for tax purposes.
The process requires submission of a good standing documentation, proof of identity of the legal representative (or attorney if a mandate to register exists), and availability of an active bank account at a resident bank or financial institution.
The rules require entities effectively managed in Colombia to carry local books under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as well as to satisfy tax compliance requirements upon completion of the tax registration.
Entities with their EPOM in Colombia are required to withhold and remit taxes as well as to charge and collect VAT to the extent of taxable transactions.
No EPOM will be deemed to exist in Colombia for (i) non-resident issuers listed on the Colombian stock exchange, or any other internationally reputed exchange, nor (ii) non-resident entities when 80% or more of its revenue is sourced in the country where the entity is domiciled.
## Tax havens
A non-cooperative jurisdiction or place of null or minimum taxation would be established by the government if one of the following criteria is complied with:
Aside from these criteria, the Colombian government is enabled to use the accepted international criteria in this matter.
In addition to non-cooperative or place of null or minimum taxation, law established an extra requisite to define preferential tax regimes, which refers to jurisdictions that ring-fence their benefits for their residents and offer them only to non-resident entities or individuals; such preferential tax regimes are to be jurisdictions that met with two of the above-mentioned criteria.
In accordance with the above, the Colombian government will be entitled to adopt a tax haven list; such a list exists currently and can be updated from time to time.
Any payment or accrual, regardless of its nature, that constitutes taxable income for a beneficiary that is deemed as resident, established, located, or functioning in a tax haven jurisdiction is subject to a 35% WHT (general CIT rate).
Transactions with entities that are tax haven residents are subject to the transfer pricing regime. As a result, Colombian taxpayers must file a transfer pricing report and a transfer pricing informative return for such transactions, regardless of whether or not the entity’s equity or gross income is lower than the threshold established by Colombian law for applying such compliance obligations.

# Colombia
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
In Colombia, the customary costs and expenses of a business are generally acceptable as deductible expenditure for CIT purposes, provided they are necessary, proportional, have a cause-effect relationship with the income producing activity, and have been realised during the relevant tax year under the accrual method of accounting. Examples of common (and not so common) deductions include the items below.
## Depreciation
### Assets held as of 2016 and previous years
Assets acquired and reported as of 31 December 2016 will be depreciated following the fiscally accepted methodologies for 2016 and previous years. In regard to those assets, the normal estimated useful lives are as follows:
| Asset | Useful life (years) |
| --- | --- |
| Buildings and pipelines | 20 |
| Machinery and equipment, office furniture, and fixtures | 10 |
| Vehicles and computer equipment | 5 |
The acceptable methods for depreciation are:
Depreciation rates can be increased by 25% for each additional eight-hour shift of asset use (and *pro rata* for fractions thereof). When tax depreciation exceeds book depreciation, the taxpayer is required to establish a reserve equivalent to 70% of the difference. Recapture of depreciation on the sale of depreciated property is taxable for CIT.
### Assets acquired since 2017 onwards
For assets acquired after 31 December 2016, IFRS rules apply. In accordance, such assets will be depreciated in consideration with the effective benefits that are expected to be obtained. Under IFRS rules, equipment will not only be seen as a whole; instead, each part of it could be recognised as unique, and its depreciation may vary as well.
Note that for fiscal purposes, both regulations (depreciation for 2016 and IFRS) will be valid at the same time depending on whether the asset was acquired in FY 2016 or FY 2017 onwards. Therefore, depreciation outstanding balances of fixed assets held as of 31 December 2016 must be depreciated during the lifespan of the asset using one of the accounting methodologies applicable before the tax bill enactment (*please see Assets held during 2016 and previous years above*).
For assets acquired from 2017 onwards, the depreciation rules under IFRS are accepted. For income tax purposes, taxpayers obligated to have accounting books are allowed to deduct the reasonable depreciation quantities recognised for assets used in businesses or activities yielding income during the taxable period. Nevertheless, the deduction for depreciation of assets is limited to the following percentages:
| Depreciable assets | Annual fiscal rate for depreciation (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Constructions and buildings | 2.22 |
| Pipelines, plants, and networks | 2.50 |
| Communication routes | 2.50 |
| Fleet and airborne equipment | 3.33 |
| Fleet and iron equipment | 5.00 |
| Fleet and fluvial equipment | 6.67 |
| Weapon and surveillance equipment | 10.00 |
| Electrical equipment | 10.00 |
| Fleet and terrestrial transport equipment | 10.00 |
| Machinery and equipment | 10.00 |
| Movable goods and belongings | 10.00 |
| Scientific medical equipment | 12.50 |
| Bottles or recipients, packages, and tools | 20.00 |
| Computer equipment or hardware | 20.00 |
| Data processing network | 20.00 |
| Communication equipment | 20.00 |
Note that depreciation rates can be increased by 25% for each additional 16 hour shift of asset use.
To the extent that accounting depreciation is higher than the limits established in the law, it will generate a difference that can still be deducted after the asset’s useful life. However, this additional deduction is limited to the thresholds previously exposed.
## Amortisation of intangible assets
As a general rule, taxpayers can amortise, for CIT purposes, the cost of any acquired intangible asset over a period of five years using the straight-line method. The factor allowed per year as deductible is 20% of the fiscal cost.
Amortisation is available for intangible assets complying with the following requirements:
Acquisition of intangible assets between related parties is not subject to amortisation, unless transfer pricing rules apply
## Goodwill
Goodwill pending balances generated before 1 January 2017 will be deductible for CIT purposes, provided they are related to the business activity or income-producing activity and its loss of value can be proved. Goodwill must be amortised using the straight-line methodology within five years from 1 January 2017 onwards.
Goodwill generated from 2017 onwards will not be deductible for CIT purposes. Goodwill has been acknowledged as an intangible asset when formed or created by the enterprise. However, its tax basis will be zero.
### Goodwill on share purchases
Goodwill on share purchases cannot be deducted via amortisation from 2017 onwards.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses are deductible for CIT purposes, provided they are necessary, reasonable, and have been realised during the relevant tax year under the accrual method of accounting.
## Interest expenses
Taxpayers are generally entitled to deduct any interest paid to financial institutions or to third parties, provided certain requirements are met.
The Colombian Tax Regime has incorporated thin capitalisation rules (*see Thin capitalisation in the*[*Group taxation*](group-taxation.html) *section*).
## Bad debt
Bad debt is deductible for CIT purposes, provided the debt is originated as a result of the development of an income-producing activity and complies with the quantities accepted by the regulation. Additionally, debts incurred between related parties, associated individuals, or between entities and its shareholders will not be allowed as deductible bad debts.
Provision of bad debt credits and provision of risk ratios generated during the taxable year by entities subject to surveillance of the Financial Superintendence can be deducted for CIT purposes. Additionally, provisions generated during the taxable year regarding assets received via payment in kind and leasing agreements to be developed in accordance with the current laws will be deductible.
Nevertheless, no deduction will be allowed for bad debt if:
## Charitable contributions
## Expenses incurred abroad
As a general rule, the deduction of expenses incurred abroad for yielding national-source income is limited to 15% of the taxpayer’s net income, when such expenses were not subject to WHT (i.e. foreign-source income not subject to tax in Colombia). The following exceptions are applicable:
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are not deductible for CIT purposes.
## Taxes
Taxpayers can deduct 100% of the taxes, surcharges, and contributions at year of accrual, as long as they are related with the commercial activity of the taxpayer, including affiliation quotas paid to guilds.
It is possible to deduct 50% of the financial transactions tax, even for those cases where there is no nexus between the economic activity of the taxpayer and the economic fact triggering the tax.
## Special deductible items
Colombian income tax laws have established certain special deductible items, which include the following:
## Deductibility limitation
The following special deductions, exempt income, and tax discounts cannot exceed 3% of the net taxable income (before deducting them):
## Net operating losses
Net tax losses generated from 2017 onwards can be carried forward within the following 12-year period. Recovery of tax loss is uncertain for long-time projects.
Net tax losses generated through the end of 2016 and previous years can be carried forward without limitation. The value of such losses must be adjusted for inflation as of 31 December 2016, as no further adjustments are allowed.
In order to find out the total value of losses generated before 31 December 2016 that can be carried forward, a simple calculation must be made. In this calculation, income tax for equality (CREE) tax losses and CIT losses will be merged to define the final value to be carried forward (Section 123 of Law 1819 of 2016 explains further considerations in this regard).
Be advised that no tax loss is allowed in the sale of assets between related parties. Additionally, capital losses cannot be offset against ordinary income.
## Payments to foreign related parties
### Royalties and similar charges
Royalties and the costs of exploitation or acquisition of all kinds of intangible property that are charged by foreign related parties are allowable as CIT deduction, provided that the corresponding WHT is collected at generally 20% (10% in the case of most DTTs). Other types of payments are subject to the general rules for expenses incurred abroad.
Royalties recognised to non-resident (or FTZ-located) related parties are not deductible if connected with an intangible formed in Colombia. Additionally, royalties paid for finished products are non-deductible.
### Management overhead expenses
Management overhead expenses paid to a foreign related party (e.g. the parent company) are deductible, provided they meet the arm’s-length test under transfer pricing regulations and provided the management services are duly substantiated and are specifically related to the income-producing activity of the local subsidiary that pays them.
These expenses must also be carefully documented such that the local subsidiary can provide evidence to the authority of the fact that they are specifically related to its Colombian operations (i.e. to the planning and direction of the operations, the setting and implementation of management controls, the measurement of progress made toward specific business goals, the related financial results, etc.). Regardless of whether these services are supplied outside or inside Colombia, a 33% WHT is also required to ensure deductibility.
### Interest
Interest and related financial costs (including foreign exchange losses) paid to foreign related parties are deductible, provided they meet the arm’s-length test under transfer pricing regulations and the thin capitalisation rules (*see the*[*Group taxation*](group-taxation.html)*section*).
Furthermore, interest and the related financial costs paid on short-term financing relating to imports of merchandise and raw materials directly supplied by foreign related parties are also deductible for CIT purposes. Interest paid or accrued to a non-resident triggers WHT over the payment or accrual at a rate of 20%. However, this rate can be reduced to 15% if the maturity term of the loan is equal to or higher than one year.

# Colombia
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Group taxation or group consolidation is not allowed for CIT purposes in Colombia.
## Transfer pricing
In Colombia, transfer pricing rules are applicable to the transactions performed by local taxpayers with foreign related parties, related parties located in Colombian FTZs, and any party in a non-cooperative jurisdiction or place of null or minimum taxation (known also as ‘tax havens’, *see Tax havens in the [Corporate residence](corporate-residence.html) section*). Thus, for CIT purposes, Colombian taxpayers must determine their income, costs, expenses, assets, and liabilities on the basis of prices and profit margins used in comparable transactions entered into with or between independent or unrelated parties.
## Local File, Master File, and Informative Return Compliance
The materiality threshold is: (i) the gross equity (assets) of the local taxpayer on 31 December of each year equal to or higher than the equivalent to TVU 100,000 (approximately USD1.158.116 FY 2025) or (ii) the gross income obtained by the local taxpayer in a given year equal to or higher than the equivalent to TVU 61,000 (approximately USD 706.450 FY 2025). Preparation and filing of the Informative Return is required for all transactions and preparation and filing of a Local File and Master File are required for transactions exceeding TVU 45,000 (approximately USD 521.152 in FY 2025). The materiality threshold is not applicable when engaging into transactions with tax havens, and the transaction threshold is reduced to TVU 10,000 (approximately USD 115.811 in FY 2025).
There are applicable penalties depending on the nature of the omission; all penalties impose costly burdens for the taxpayer, and they are designed to be higher than the compliance costs. Rejection of cost and expenses may apply if expense transactions are not documented.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
Colombia implemented the CbC Report since 2016 and its requirements are the same as those proposed by the OECD. It is also a signatory of the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on the exchange of CbC Reports.
The local materiality threshold is income of the previous year of TVU 81,000,000 (approximately USD 938.074.186 in FY 2025).
All entities resident in Colombia belonging to a multinational group must notify to the DIAN if it is the controlling or designated entity. If not, the taxpayer must notify if the parent complies with the CbC Report and the identity and tax residence of the reporting entity.
## Thin capitalisation
Thin capitalisation rules now only apply to direct or indirect related-party interest bearing debt (before 2019, related and unrelated debt would be in scope) while the ratio is reduced to 2 to 1 (previously 3 to 1). Back-to-back transactions, as well as endorsement transactions through third parties, may be subject to further scrutiny by the tax authorities.
Thin capitalisation rules do not apply to businesses in unproductive phases, factoring enterprises (if less than 50% of the operation is done with related parties), infrastructure projects carried out by special purpose entities, and entities subject to the surveillance of the Superintendence of Finance.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
An entity will be considered a CFC if it is controlled by a Colombian entity and also considered as a non-resident for tax purposes in Colombia.
Requirements to be considered a CFC:
Investment vehicles are considered as CFCs in Colombia.
CFC rules will apply fully if the controlled entity is located in a tax haven. This consideration is set as a legal presumption.
If a CFC is proven to be controlled by Colombian tax residents, these will be obligated to comply with these rules if they directly or indirectly own shares equal to or higher than 10% of the entity’s equity or its results.
Dividends, interests, rental income, gains from assets that generate passive income, technical services, etc. will be considered as passive income.
It is presumed that in case the passive income from the CFC represents 80% or more of its total income, all of the CFC income, costs, and deductions are passive income. While, if the CFC obtains active income and it represents 80% or more of the total income obtained by the CFC, it is presumed that 100% of the income, expenses, and deductions of the CFC are connected with the generation of such active income.

# Colombia
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Branch income is taxed at the general income tax rate (35%).
The branch taxable base is no longer limited to domestic income. From 2019 onwards, the branch taxable base corresponds to worldwide profits attributable to the branch.
Branches are required to prepare an attribution study (in addition to transfer pricing compliance requirements) with a functional and technical analysis of the assets, liabilities, capital, risks, income, cost, and expenses attributable to its business in Colombia.
In addition, for tax purposes, the branch must prepare separate accounts in order to record income and capital gains attributed to it.
Branch profit distribution is categorised as a dividend; consequently, if profits are taxed at the branch level, dividend tax is applicable. If not, an equalisation tax at the general CIT rate of the year of the distribution (35%) plus the dividend tax (20%) are applicable upon dividend distribution. The above-mentioned treatment could be changed if treaty relief is available (to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis).

# Colombia
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Foreign tax credit
Foreign income taxes over non-domestic-source income are creditable against CIT, subject to certain limitations. Generally, the amount of the credit cannot exceed the sum of Colombian taxes imposed over the same income. DTTs provide for more comprehensive credit systems as well.
For dividends tax credit, it is expressly established that the effective rate assumed by the company abroad will be that which results from dividing the tax actually paid among commercial profits before taxes.
For the tax credit to be allowed, the shares held by the taxpayer must be deemed as fixed assets.
It is clarified that the indirect tax discount would not be applicable to portfolio investments or destined to speculate in securities markets.
A certificate from the tax auditor of the company that distributes the dividends must be available, in which the value of the commercial profit, the value of the taxable profit, the tax rate, and the tax actually paid by said company can be verified.
## CIT exemptions
As items of exempt income, the law has established the following:
## Tax credit for certain investments
A 30% tax credit is available for investments made in certain scientific and/or technological projects or in professional training projects of governmental, public, or private institutions.
## Special CIT rate for free trade zones (FTZs)
Starting from FY 2023, the following FTZs enjoy a special CIT rate of 20%:
The preferential 20% rate for other qualified FTZ companies before December 2022 will only survive for the term of the initial qualification. New qualifications will be subject to an export-oriented plan to be submitted for approval by the government.
Note that capital gains are taxed at the standard capital gains tax rate of 15%.
Commercial users will apply the general CIT rate, which is 35%.
## Payment of CIT by investments in civil works
Civil works for taxes is a mechanism introduced in the 2016 Tax Reform through which income taxpayers may fulfil their income tax payment by executing works or public investment projects of social significance.
This payment mechanism allows for project execution using tax resources while bypassing the usual flow of money through state entities. Instead, it is administered and executed under the responsibility of a private company to fulfil its tax obligations.
This mechanism enables direct investment of tax into infrastructure projects, tertiary roads, public education, water supply and sanitation, educational infrastructure repair, productive infrastructure (agriculture), digital connectivity, school supplies, climate change mitigation, among others, in the Most Affected Areas by Armed Conflict (ZOMAC) and Territorially Defined Development Areas (PDET).

# Colombia
## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## International treaties
Currently, Colombia has DTTs in force with Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, France, India, Italy, Mexico, Portugal, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom Northern Ireland, and the Andean Community (Bolivia, Perú and Ecuador). DTTs with the following territories are signed but are not yet enforceable: Brazil, Luxembourg, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Arab Emirates, and Uruguay.
Colombia has also entered into an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) for the implementation of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) with the United States. Agreements for the interchange of tax information have also been entered into with other nations.
## Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)
### Action 1
Import of services rules expanded to be in scope, including all services (save for exception established by law), provided that the purchaser or beneficiary of the service is a Colombian tax resident, or has a domicile, PE, or place of economic activity in Colombia.
### Action 3
A CFC regime was introduced in 2016. This regime pretends to have a tax control on the income generated by foreign entities, which are managed by one or more tax residents in Colombia, that also meet the requirements to be considered as a controlled company: (i) Is a subordinated or controlled company according to the commercial regulations and (ii) is considered a foreign related party.
The CFC applies if the Colombian tax resident owns at least a 10% participation, directly or indirectly, in the company abroad.
If a Colombian tax resident owns a CFC, it will be taxed currently on their proportionate share of the CFC’s income (including passive income), costs, expenses, and deductions.
### Action 5
Colombia has signed both the OECD Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (MAC) and the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information (MCAA). It is intended that automatic exchange of tax information in Colombia began in September 2017.
Also, according to Section 631-4 of the Colombian Tax Code, the Tax Office must issue a Resolution to identify the entities subject to reporting to fulfil the international commitments towards the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) agreements currently in force. Resolution 119 of 2015 set the requirements to be met by the local financial institutions for AEOI purposes.
### Actions 8 to 10
Colombian transfer pricing rules are based on OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. In the Colombian Tax Code, the following were introduced: (i) rules regarding transactions re-characterisation (Section 260-4), and (ii) best method rule (comparable uncontrolled price or CUP) for commodities and raw materials (Section 260-3 (1)). No further changes are foreseeable in the future.
### Action 13
Transfer pricing informative return: If caps are exceeded, all transactions (no materiality applicable) are subject to disclosure.
Master File: Mandatory if caps are exceeded, it follows the suggested contents issue by the OECD and is generally prepared by the ultimate parent company. At the date of this summary, it is estimated that it may be filed in English; however, if required by the tax authority, an official translation should be provided within the following 20 working days of said request.
Local File: There is an obligation to prepare and file the Local File for transactions per type of transaction (not on a stand-alone basis) exceeding approximately 494,000 United States dollars (USD) per type of transaction.
Country-by-Country (CbC) Report: Not applicable for subsidiaries; however, it will be require to present a form disclosing if parent is obligated to CbC reporting in its domicile country (*see Country-by-country [CbC] reporting in the*[*Group taxation*](group-taxation.html)*section*).
## Multilateral Instrument (MLI)
In July 2017, Colombia signed the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (MLI) aimed to amend its DTTs aligned to the BEPS recommendations. The MLI will be enforceable when the internal procedures have been completed by the Colombian Congress, Constitutional Court, and the government (expected in FY 2022).
Colombia included as Covered Tax Agreements whole of the DTTs in force and the DTTs signed with France.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
The CRS is the standard for AEOI developed by the OECD.
CRS is a very broad reporting regime that relies extensively on the intergovernmental exchange used for the implementation of FATCA.
Similar to FATCA, the CRS requires financial institutions resident in participating jurisdictions to implement due diligence processes to document and identify accounts that must be reported according to the CRS, as well as establish a wide-ranging reporting process.
Colombia has signed both the MAC and the MCAA. Automatic exchange of tax information in Colombia started in September 2017.
## Choice of business entity
The most common type of company used in Colombia is the simplified stock company or simplified corporation, known as an SAS (*sociedad por acciones simplificada*). Besides SAS, foreign investors also use branch offices of an offshore entity as their investment vehicles in Colombia.
As a general rule, from a high-level perspective, there are no major differences between a branch office and a subsidiary (such as an SAS) as far as Colombian taxation is concerned.
All the taxes discussed in this summary would apply equally to a branch operation or a subsidiary operation. However, from a commercial perspective, and specifically from the perspective of corporate liability, operating through a branch office means that the head office is exposed to direct liability for all the obligations of the branch, tax obligations included. Operating through a subsidiary means that only the subsidiary is liable for its obligations as a general rule, that is to say that the shareholders are not liable for company obligations. Of corporations, the advisable choice would be an SAS, which is very flexible in nature, easy to incorporate, and can be held by one single shareholder (regular corporations require a minimum of five shareholders).
## Mergers/De-mergers
Mergers and de-mergers are tax free, subject to limitations as follows:
Mergers/de-mergers failing to meet these standards will be treated as taxable dispositions. Where participants are not residents, the tax-free status is available if assets held in Colombia represent 20% or less of the worldwide aggregate of assets of the group.

## Employment expenses
Employees are not entitled to deduct business-related expenses from their employment income.
However, independent workers are able to. Independent workers can choose to be treated as employees for income tax purposes (procedure and tax reliefs). If they choose to be treated as independent (rather than employees), they are able to claim costs and deductions deemed as 60% of their gross income.
## Personal deductions
### Charitable contributions
### Mortgage interest deduction
For mortgage interest paid in Colombia, up to a maximum of COP 59.758.800 for FY 2025 (TU 1,200) is deductible annually.
### Healthcare expenses
Healthcare payments (i.e. payments to companies who offer prepaid health and are monitored by the national health superintendent, payments for health insurance to insurance companies that are monitored by the financial superintendent) for the taxpayer, spouse, and children are deductible up to a maximum of TU 16 monthly, an equivalent of COP 9.561.408 annually.
### Dependant deduction
For dependant deduction, the deductible limit is 10% of gross labour income until a maximum of TU 32 monthly, an equivalent of COP 19.122.816 annually.
Dependants are defined as:
Additionally, employees are able to deduct TU 72 for each additional dependant, up to four dependants.
## Interests paid on educational loans
Law 2010 of 2019 introduced a deduction for interests paid on educational loans granted by the Government Education Entity ICETEX. This deduction applies while the education loan is for the taxpayer’s higher education and it is capped to TU 100 annually.
## Personal allowances
There are no personal allowances in Colombia.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Employment income
A foreign resident is taxed on employment income earned for services performed in Colombia no matter where payment is made. Employment income includes salary and non-salary items, such as bonuses, living allowances, housing allowances, tax reimbursements, benefits in kind, and certain payments that must be made under Colombian labour law. All employees, including those who have agreed to receive an integral salary (i.e. without social benefits of the legal bonus and severance compensations), can treat up to 25% of the total annual employment income as exempt income. This 25% is limited to a maximum cap of TU 790 per year (COP 39.341.210 for FY 2025). Although some payments derived from a labour relationship may be agreed as not being salary, they are deemed to be income and subject to income tax.
### Special savings account deposits
### Contributions to pension system
Mandatory contributions made to the Colombian pension system funds by an employee are not deemed to constitute income or capital gains for the employee and are not part of the withholding tax (WHT) basis. Additionally, along with mandatory contributions to the health system, these mandatory pension contributions are considered non-taxable income.
Voluntary contributions made by the employee or the employer to mandatory pension funds are considered non-taxable income for the employee and are not part of the WHT basis, provided that these amounts do not exceed 25% of the employee’s employment or taxable annual income nor TU 2,500 (COP 124.497.500 for FY 2025).
Notwithstanding the above, contributions to the voluntary pension fund or AFC accounts will be taxed if they are withdrawn from the fund by the employee within ten years of having been deposited into the fund. Also in this case, even if the deposit is withdrawn within ten years, it would continue to be treated as exempt income if it is used to pay for a housing acquisition.
Contributions made to foreign pension systems are deemed to be taxable for the expatriate or employee and are part of the WHT basis.
## Capital gains
## Dividend income
## Interest income
‘Monetary correction’ on savings accounts (an adjustment that savings and loan institutions credit to clients placed in certain types of savings or term-deposit accounts in order to compensate for inflation) is free of tax. The correction must be certified by the financial institution. Any additional gain recognised as interest is, however, taxable.
The inflation component of interest received by individuals (not required to carry accounting books) on certain bonds is not subject to income tax.

# Colombia
## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
A person is considered fiscally resident in Colombia if one remains in the country (continuously or not) for an aggregate period of time of 183 days within a period of 365 consecutive days. If one finishes in the second year, the individual is considered resident in the second year.
Also, if the person is a Colombian national, one will be fiscally resident if one falls within any of the following scenarios:
For the above scenarios, the period actually spent by the Colombian individual in Colombia is irrelevant.
However, an individual will not be a Colombian resident for any of the scenarios above if 50% or more of one's yearly income has been sourced where one is domiciled or 50% or more of one's assets are located where one is domiciled.
