# Guernsey, Channel Islands
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 27 January 2025
## Inventory valuation
Inventory is valued at the lower of historical cost or net realisable value. Use of last in first out (LIFO) is not permitted. Generally, there are no material differences between accounts prepared on a normal accounting basis and those prepared on a tax basis.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are not subject to tax in Guernsey.
## Dividend income
All dividends paid by a standard tax-paying company (0%) are deemed to have been paid from income arising after 31 December 2007 (i.e. after the introduction of the zero/ten tax regime), unless the company elects to have them treated otherwise.
### Stock dividends
Stock dividends may be treated as income.
## Interest income
Interest received from a Guernsey bank is taxable at 0%.
Interest income received by a standard tax-paying company is taxable at 0%.
## Royalty income
Royalty income is treated as income for corporate income tax purposes. Any royalty income received by a standard-tax paying company is taxable at 0%.
## Foreign income
Resident corporations are liable to tax on their worldwide income. Income tax is levied on foreign branch income when earned, and on investment income from foreign dividends, interest, rents, and royalties. Double taxation is mitigated either through unilateral relief (by giving credit for foreign taxation of up to three-quarters of the effective Guernsey rate) or by treaty relief.

# Guernsey, Channel Islands
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 27 January 2025
Companies paying dividends to Guernsey resident individuals are required to deduct or account for the difference between the tax incurred by the company and the shareholder’s individual tax rate (20%) on actual distributions.
A company is required to withhold tax when it is acting as an agent and making payments to a non-resident liable to Guernsey tax.
Guernsey does not levy any other forms of withholding tax (WHT).
## Double taxation treaties (DTTs)
The table below sets out the rates of WHT applicable to the most common payments of dividends and interest under Guernsey domestic law where such a liability arises and the reduced rates that may be available under an applicable DTT. Please refer to specific treaties to ensure the values are up to date.
| Recipient | WHT (%) | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dividends | Interest |
| Resident corporations | 0 (1) | 0 (1) |
| Resident individuals | 0/10/20 (2) | 0 (3) |
| Non-resident corporations and individuals: |  |  |
| Non-treaty | 0 | 0 |
| Treaty (4): |  |  |
| Bahrain (5) | 0 | 0 |
| Cyprus | 0 | 0 |
| Hong Kong | 0 | 0 |
| Isle of Man | 0 | 0 |
| Jersey | 0 | 0 |
| Liechtenstein | 0 | 0 |
| Luxembourg | 0/5/15 (6) | 0 |
| Malta | 0 | 0 |
| Mauritius | 0 | 0 |
| Monaco | 0 | 0 |
| Qatar | 0 | 0 |
| Seychelles | 0 | 0 |
| Singapore | 0 | 0 |
| United Kingdom | N/A (7) | N/A (7) |
Notes
1. Resident corporations receiving dividends and interest are not subject to any WHT.
2. For resident individuals, if the income has been taxed on the paying company at 0%, a 20% deduction should be made. If the income has been taxed on the paying company at 10%, 10% WHT should be applied. If the income has been taxed on the paying company at 20%, there should be no deduction at source.
3. Resident individuals are paid interest gross, without any WHT; however, individuals are required to file an annual tax return and pay 20% income tax on any interest received.
4. Where a reduced rate of withholding is allowed by any treaty, whether on dividends or interest, it is usual for this reduced rate to be stated not to apply to amounts that are in excess of a normal commercial rate of interest, or where the dividend or interest is effectively connected to a PE in Guernsey of the recipient; such general limitations are not specifically indicated in the table. Moreover, note the general requirement for dividends and/or interest to be beneficially owned by the recipient in order to access benefits under a treaty.
5. The DTT with Bahrain was signed on 29 September 2024 but is not yet in force.
6. Dividends paid by a company that is a resident of Guernsey to a resident of Luxembourg may be taxed in Luxembourg. However, such dividends may also be taxed in Guernsey, and if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of Luxembourg, the tax charged may not exceed 5% of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company that directly holds at least 10% of the capital of the company paying the dividends or 15% of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.
7. The Explanatory Note to the Guernsey-United Kingdom DTT specifically excludes dividends and interest from the scope of the DTT.

# Guernsey, Channel Islands
## Overview
Last reviewed - 27 January 2025
The Channel Islands, located in the English Channel, are the last remnants of the medieval Dukedom of Normandy. Guernsey, which encompasses the 10 parishes on the Island of Guernsey as well as the islands of Herm, Jethou, Burhou, and Lihou, is a British Crown dependency. Alderney is the closest of the Channel Islands to France, as well as being the closest to England, and is part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey. The only parish of Alderney is the parish of St. Anne, which covers the whole island. The United Kingdom (UK) is constitutionally responsible for defence and international representation of the Channel Islands. The capitals of Guernsey and Alderney are St. Peter Port and St. Anne respectively. The official languages of Guernsey are English and French. The currency in Guernsey is the British pound sterling (GBP).
Financial services, including banking, fund management, and insurance, have a major influence on employment and the economy in Guernsey. There has been economic growth in the financial services, construction, retail, and public sectors. Low income taxes and death duties make Guernsey and Alderney a popular destination.

# Guernsey, Channel Islands
## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 27 January 2025
‘Principally resident’ and ‘solely resident’ individuals are both liable to Guernsey income tax on their worldwide income. ‘Resident only’ individuals are either taxed on their worldwide income or alternatively taxed on Guernsey-source income and can opt to pay a set charge of GBP 40,000 (GBP 30,000 prior to 2021) in respect of non-Guernsey source income and no additional liability will arise on this income in Guernsey.
The revised Guernsey-UK DTA (in force from 1 January 2020 in respect of Guernsey income tax) clarifies that an individual electing to pay the standard charge remains liable to Guernsey income tax on his or her worldwide income.
## Personal income tax rates
Tax is payable at the rate of 20% on net income after allowances (*see the [Deductions](guernsey/individual/deductions.html) section for a description of allowances*).
It is possible for a Guernsey resident individual to elect for a cap on their income tax liability. Elections can be made for a liability cap of GBP 160,000 to apply for an individual or couple on non-Guernsey-source income, and the liability cap can be increased to GBP 320,000 if an election is made for the cap to apply to an individual or couples' worldwide income.
Furthermore, an election for a liability cap of GBP 60,000 can be made for individuals who purchase open market property on the island in excess of GBP 1,500,000 in the year they take up permanent residence. The cap is applied to an individual or couples' worldwide income and is also available for the three consecutive years after the year of arrival.
An encashment of a pension fund (i.e. both triviality payments and lump sum payments that are over the annual tax‐free lump sum limit) that comprises Guernsey tax relieved pension contributions shall be excluded from the income tax cap from 1 January 2020.
The annual tax-free lump sum limit for pensions schemes has been maintained at GBP 203,000.

An additional 15% rate of duty is applicable on some goods originating in the United States (US).
## Property taxes
Income from Guernsey land and buildings is subject to Guernsey income tax at 20%. No other property taxes apply.
## Transfer taxes
Guernsey does not levy transfer taxes.
## Document duty
Document duty is payable in respect of ‘chargeable transactions’ of real property in Guernsey.
Document duty is paid on a graduated-rates basis and ranges from 2.25% to 5.5%. This is applied depending on the value of transfers in interests in Guernsey property conveyed and on the registration of bonds securing loans on real property.
For 2024, a down-sizing incentive has been introduced to charge 0% document duty on the first GBP 400,000 of a replacement principal private residence, subject to meeting certain conditions. This is expected to end on 31 December 2024.
In addition, an additional document duty of 2% on each bank will be charged on all residential properties that are not the principal private residence of the purchaser or a family member.
Document duty may also apply in respect of the transfer of shares in which the underlying company holds Guernsey situs real property.
Document duty is payable by the purchaser of the real property.
## Stamp taxes
Guernsey does not levy any stamp duties.
## Payroll taxes
The Employee Tax Instalment (ETI) Scheme is a scheme whereby the employer deducts income tax from its employees and pays this over to the Guernsey Income Tax Office.
The ETI Scheme applies to all employees. For the purposes of the ETI scheme, an employee is an individual holding or exercising an office or employment, including a company director, part-time workers, casual workers, and sub-contractors.
The ETI Scheme operates on a quarterly basis. Throughout each quarter, the employer should deduct tax from their employees on each payday. Details of the gross weekly or monthly wage and deductions made must be recorded and returned with the relevant remittance by the 15th day of the month following the end of the relevant quarter (e.g. tax deducted during the first quarter needs to be submitted by 15 April).
## Social security contributions
An employer, for the purposes of Social Insurance, is anyone who has employees. An employee is anyone who is gainfully occupied in employment under a contract of service in Guernsey or Alderney.
In general, contributions are required from both employer and employee in respect of any employed person who is over school-leaving age and under 65. Social security contributions are levied on the gross employment income of the employee at 7.0% for the employer and 7.4% for the employees from 1 January 2025.
Employer social security contributions for 2025 are calculated on a monthly lower earnings limit of GBP 797.33, which is the level of earnings at which an employer becomes liable for the payment of contributions. The upper limit for 2025, which is the highest level of earnings on which contributions are calculated, is GBP 15,717 per month.

# Guernsey, Channel Islands
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 27 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December, although companies can adopt a year-end of their choice.
Investment companies are now required to compute their income and file their tax returns on a calendar year basis and not accounting year-end basis.
## Tax returns
The Guernsey Revenue Service has decided to initiate steps to reinstate the original annual filing deadline of 30 November as follows:
It is compulsory for all Guernsey companies to file their tax returns online.
The format of the Guernsey income tax return was altered in respect of the accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019 to allow the incorporation of the Economic Substance Regulations.
Companies are required to disclose where they are captured by the Regulations, in what capacity, and make several declarations as to whether and how they meet the substance requirements.
Should a company meet the conditions below, a simplified return may be filed without a computation.
In order to qualify for a simplified return, a company must have none of the following:
Should a company have Guernsey-resident individual beneficial members and/or make loans to participators, it will be required to submit quarterly returns accounting for distributions and loans advanced.
Partnerships have an annual filing requirement along with submission of financial statements.
## Payment of tax
The Guernsey Revenue Service issues interim assessments with tax payable in four instalments due by the 15th day after the end of the relevant quarter in the year of charge (i.e. 15 April, 15 July, 15 October, and 15 January). If liabilities have not been determined, this may necessitate initially raising estimated assessments based on prior year figures and raising a final assessment when the figures are agreed. Once the Revenue Service has received the company’s income tax return, they will issue an assessment detailing the final balancing income tax payment due. This amount will be due to be paid within 30 days of the issuing of the final assessment.
## Tax audit process
The Revenue Service will assess each company tax return as and when it is received, and the turnaround time from submission of a return to the issue of a final assessment varies dependent upon the workloads of the Revenue Service but is generally dealt with in around three months.
## Statute of limitations
The Director can raise an assessment in respect of any income that has not been assessed at any time no later than six years after the end of the year of charge in which the income arose.
Guernsey passed regulations requiring certain legal entities carrying on relevant activities to demonstrate the existence of adequate economic substance on the Island. The legislation came into force on 1 January 2019 and for partnerships from 1 January 2022 (though partnerships that were established on or after 1 July 2021 are in scope from the date of establishment). The Regulations require companies and partnerships that are tax resident and carry on relevant activities in Guernsey to demonstrate that they each have a substantive presence in Guernsey commensurate with their level of activities in Guernsey.

## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 27 January 2025
## Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Pillar Two
BEPS Pillar Two focuses on ensuring a minimum level of taxation and is centred around the following two rules:
Together, the IIR and UTPR are known as the global anti-base erosion (GloBE) rules. They would apply to certain multinational enterprise (MNE) groups with 750 million euros (EUR) or more in annual revenues and would by necessity rely on a common tax base. In essence, the GloBE rules would provide jurisdictions with the right to ‘tax back’ up to an agreed minimum rate of tax, where other jurisdictions have not fully exercised their primary taxing rights.
## Tax return due dates
The Guernsey Revenue Service has decided to initiate steps to reinstate the original annual filing deadline of 30 November as follows:

# Guernsey, Channel Islands
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 27 January 2025
All Guernsey-registered companies are regarded as tax resident on the island unless granted exempt company status. In addition, a company will be treated as a resident in Guernsey (regardless of where it is incorporated) if shareholder control is exercised by persons resident on the island.
From 1 January 2019, Guernsey amended the laws governing corporate residence to include a ‘central management and control’ element into the test of corporate residence. From 1 January 2019, a company is tax resident in Guernsey if:
An exception is granted where the company can demonstrate that it satisfies the following conditions, in which case, it will not be considered resident even if it is incorporated or controlled in Guernsey:
The company must also show that its residency status in the overseas jurisdiction is not motivated by the avoidance, reduction, or deferral of the liability of any person to tax.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The Income Tax (Guernsey) Law, 1975 defines PE as including:
Note that the fact that a body’s directors regularly meet at a particular place does not, in itself, make that place a PE of that body.

# Guernsey, Channel Islands
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 27 January 2025
Normally, business deductions are allowed if they are incurred wholly, exclusively, and necessarily for the purpose of the business.
## Depreciation
Annual allowances are granted for income tax purposes in respect of certain items, the most common of which have been set out below. Please note this is not a complete list:
| Assets | Basis | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Buildings: |  |  |
| Stone, brick, concrete, or other substantial structures | Reducing-balance | 1.25 |
| Buildings of a less substantial construction | Reducing-balance | 5 |
| Farm buildings | Straight-line | 5, 10, or 20 |
| Motor vehicles, buses, lorries, and motorcycles | Reducing-balance | 25 |
| Computer hardware | Straight-line | 20 |
| Machinery and plant | Reducing-balance | 20 |
| Glasshouses: |  |  |
| Expenditure in respect of initial allowance\* | Straight-line | 10 |
\* Section 123 (3) of the Law defines expenditure and circumstances on which initial allowances can be claimed in respect of glasshouses.
## Goodwill
The amortisation of goodwill is not a deductible expense in Guernsey.
## Start-up expenses
Pre-trading expenditure incurred within the 12 months prior to the commencement of trade, which would have been allowable had it occurred on the first day of trading, may be allowed as a deduction in computing the profits of the first accounting period.
## Interest expenses
Interest is a deductible expense where it is incurred wholly, exclusively, and necessarily for the purposes of the business.
## Bad debt
Bad and doubtful debts discovered in the accounting period to have become bad or irrecoverable may be deducted from taxable profits, but the deduction may not exceed the amount written off as such in the books of the business.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable donations by companies are not deductible for Guernsey income tax purposes.
## Fines and penalties
Fines or penalties incurred are not deductible for Guernsey income tax purposes.
## Taxes
Income tax paid is not deductible in computing taxable income.
## Net operating losses
Losses from one class of income may be used to offset the profits from another class of income if both classes are subject to tax at the same rate. Unrelieved trading losses may be carried forward to offset future trading income.
Upon cessation of trade, operating losses arising from balancing allowances may be carried back to the previous two years of charge to be relieved against past trading profits.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Guernsey-source royalties and long-term interest are subject to taxation at source. Relief is obtained by the retention of the tax deducted. Short-term interest, unless owed to an authorised bank, is not deductible, unless the advance in respect of which it is paid is used wholly and exclusively for the purposes of trade. Other fees must be paid on an arm’s-length basis.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 27 January 2025
Group loss relief may be claimed when both companies are members of the same group and the companies are either carrying on business in Guernsey through a PE or incorporated in Guernsey. Loss relief is available only against income taxed at the same rate.
A claim for group loss relief must be made by the claimant company within two years after the end of the calendar year in which the relevant accounting period ended, and the claim must be accompanied by a declaration by the surrendering company that it consents to the surrender.
## Transfer pricing
Guernsey does not currently have specific transfer pricing legislation in place. However, the general anti-avoidance provisions do apply.
## Country-by-country reporting (CbCR)
Guernsey has formally committed to the OECD model of CbCR and has already put in place the relevant implementing regulations for entities with accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2016. In addition, Guernsey has signed up to the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) to assist with the sharing of relevant information in relation to CbCR, as well as broadly adopting the OECD’s CbCR implementation package, to facilitate its implementation of this BEPS minimum standard.
Multinationals having global revenues of EUR 750 million or more are required to file annual reports to tax authorities at three levels. The first element (which taxpayers are generally required to provide for fiscal 2016) is a ‘country-by-country report’ that gives a detailed picture of business results for each country where the business operates (including things like number of employees, revenues, pre-tax profit, and taxes paid). Companies will also need to give an overall picture of their global business, aggregating data from all of the countries where one operates. In addition, companies will be required to report separately to each country where they operate with business and tax information about the local entities and operations in that country.
The disclosure of this business information will be accessible, through automatic information exchanges, to tax authorities wherever they have a presence (subject to certain conditions). Groups will need to consider how to explain their operational purpose of business arrangements, which may include tax advantages.
The deadline for submission of the CbCR report to the Guernsey tax authority is within 12 months of the end of the accounting period to which it relates.
Where there is no reporting obligation, there is a requirement to notify the Director of Revenue Service of the name of the entity that is undertaking the reporting and to provide certain other information. An entity must notify the Director by 30 November in the year following the last day of the accounting period if it is a constituent entity.
## Thin capitalisation
Guernsey does not currently have specific thin capitalisation legislation in place. However, the general anti-avoidance provisions do apply.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Guernsey does not currently have specific anti-avoidance legislation in relation to CFCs. However, the general anti-avoidance provisions do apply.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 27 January 2025
Branch income is taxed in the same manner as companies, at the appropriate rate according to the activity being undertaken.
No further tax is withheld on the transfer of profits abroad to group companies, provided no Guernsey-resident individual has an interest in the company.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 27 January 2025
In view of the low rate of tax, no special incentives are available to local businesses in Guernsey.
## Foreign tax credit

# Guernsey, Channel Islands
## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 27 January 2025
## Economic substance
The economic substance requirements apply to companies from 1 January 2019. Effective 1 July 2021 and 1 January 2022, the economic substance rules also apply for new partnerships and existing partnerships, respectively. A body, which is defined as a partnership or company, is subject to the Guernsey economic substance requirements if it is Guernsey tax resident, undertakes a relevant activity, and has gross income during an accounting period from that activity. The relevant activities are as follows:
Please note that regulated Collective Investment Vehicles (CIVs) are in scope of the economic substance requirements if they meet the self-managed conditions.
## US-Guernsey intergovernmental agreement (IGA)
On 13 December 2013, Guernsey signed an IGA regarding the implementation of Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). The IGA has been ratified by Guernsey's Parliament and is embodied in The Income Tax (Approved International Agreements) (Implementation) (United Kingdom and United States of America) Regulations 2014. Its operative provisions came into force from 30 June 2014.
## UK-Guernsey IGA
On 22 October 2013, Guernsey signed a FATCA-style IGA with the United Kingdom (UK-Guernsey IGA) under which mandatory disclosure requirements may be imposed in respect of ‘Investors in the Fund’ who are UK resident or who are non-UK entities controlled by one or more UK resident individuals, unless a relevant exemption applies. The UK-Guernsey IGA has been ratified by Guernsey's Parliament and is embodied in The Income Tax (Approved International Agreements) (Implementation) (United Kingdom and United States of America) Regulations 2014. Its operative provisions came into force from 30 June 2014.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
Guernsey adopted global CRS on Automatic Exchange of Information on 1 January 2016. The first reporting took place in 2017.
## Mandatory Disclosure Regime (MDR)
On 11 March 2020, The government of Guernsey passed legislation introducing the MDR aligned to the OECD Model Mandatory Disclosure Rules for CRS Avoidance Arrangements and Opaque Offshore Structures.
At the time of writing, although the law had been made, it had yet to be brought into force.
Once in force, the law will require promoters, service providers, and, in some circumstance, users of CRS avoidance arrangements and opaque offshore structures to provide the Director of the Revenue Service with information about those arrangements and structures within a 30-day window of, broadly, the arrangement being made available.
It is intended that information relating to users resident in other jurisdictions will be exchanged with the tax authority of that jurisdiction in accordance with the terms of the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on the automatic exchange regarding CRS avoidance arrangements and opaque offshore structures, also ratified by the States of Guernsey on 11 March 2020.
## OECD's Inclusive Framework
The OECD has been working on a global solution to reform the international corporate tax framework, which will affect how large multinational enterprises are taxed around the world.
That framework is based on two broad work streams: Pillar One is essentially a proposal for partial re-allocation of taxing rights and Pillar Two proposes that large multinational enterprises will pay a minimum effective rate of tax of 15% on their profits.

# Guernsey, Channel Islands
## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 27 January 2025
Guernsey operates a flat 20% income tax rate for all individuals resident in Guernsey or deriving Guernsey-source income.
The 2025 Guernsey Budget introduced a number of changes in the field of personal taxation.
The personal allowance has been increased from 13,900.00 British pounds sterling (GBP) to GBP 14,600.00, and earners of more than GBP 82,500.00 will have their allowance reduced by GBP 1 for every GBP 5 exceeding this limit. This withdrawal of allowances has been extended beyond the personal allowance (*see the [Deductions](deductions.html) section*).
Interim assessments for individuals will now be issued prior to the commencement of the year of charge with instalment payments now due at each calendar quarter (i.e. 15 April, 15 July, 15 October, and 15 January). This is expected to come into effect from the 2024 calendar year.
Social security rates have been increased from 6.9% to 7.0% for the employer contribution and from 7.2% to 7.4% for the employee contribution. Self-employed contributions have been increased from 11.9% to 12.2%. Lower earnings limits have been increased to GBP 184.00 (weekly) and GBP 797.33 (monthly), and upper earnings limits for both employer and employee have been increased to GBP 3,627.00 (weekly) and GBP 15,717.00 (monthly).
Couples are no longer subject to joint taxation, and each individual is now required to be responsible for their own taxes, including filing tax returns and making any payments due.
## Tax return due dates
The Guernsey Revenue Service has decided to initiate steps to reinstate the original annual filing deadline of 30 November as follows:

# Guernsey, Channel Islands
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 27 January 2025
## Personal deductions
Mortgage interest is deductible subject to a limit of GBP 400,000 on an individual’s principal private residence in Guernsey. There is a set cap on interest relief on a Guernsey principal private residence for individuals, which is GBP 3,500. The limit on relief will be reduced gradually every year until 2027, which will be the first year without tax relief.
A rent-a-room relief is available, allowing individuals to claim an exemption of up to GBP 10,000 of income per room per annum for a maximum of two rooms, subject to certain conditions.
Pension contributions to Guernsey-approved schemes are also deductible up to GBP 35,000 for contributions above GBP 2,500.
Unauthorised pension payments will now face a penalty charge of 50%, which would be an income tax levied against the individual who received the unauthorised payment.
## Personal allowances
Guernsey residents are currently entitled to various personal allowances. These allowances are time apportioned for resident only, non-resident, and individuals who arrive in, or depart from, the island part way through the tax year. Furthermore, the allowances are subject to withdrawal at a rate of GBP 1 for each GBP 5 of income above GBP 82,500.
Allowances for 2024/25 are as follows:
| Allowances | 2024 (GBP) | 2025 (GBP) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Single person | 13,900 | 14,600 |
| Dependent relative | 4,390 | 4,390 |
| Charge of children generally only available to lone parents | 9,195 | 9,490 |
| Infirm person | 4,390 | 4,390 |
| Housekeeper | 4,390 | 4,390 |
### Pro-rata allowances
It has been enforced that allowances shall be pro-rated for an individual considered to be solely or principally resident in the year of arrival or departure from Guernsey based on the amount of time spent on the Island in that year of charge.
## Business deductions
There are no significant business deductions allowable to the individual.

## Employment income
While treated solely or principally as a resident of Guernsey, an individual is assessable on the full amount of the emoluments of employment, no matter where the duties are performed. This will include certain benefits. Where a non-resident carries out any duties in Guernsey, the emoluments attaching to these duties are assessable in Guernsey.
Directors with substantial control of a limited liability company (LLC) will now be treated as employees, with social security contributions deducted by the employer. Directors can choose to continue to be treated as self-employed for five years if they opt-in before 31 December 2024.
## Capital gains
There is no tax on capital gains in Guernsey.
