## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax period for PIT purposes is the calendar year. However, withholding taxes on wages and pension contributions are made on a monthly basis (i.e. upon payment).
## Tax returns
PIT returns are filed annually, and the deadline to submit them is 31 March of the following year. An amendment to the tax return is allowed within three years after the mandatory date when the tax return was submitted.
### Penalties
Submission of the tax return after the deadline is subject to fixed mandatory fines. The understatement of tax presented in the tax return is subject to penalty from 15% to 25%, depending on the under-declared amount.
## Payment of tax
Each employer is responsible for withholding the tax and pension contribution from taxable salaries paid to employees, including payments to non-business individuals, for professional, technical, management, and financial services, payments for service contracts, payment for actors, musicians, athletes, and dependent agents. The salaries shall be paid through the bank.
Employers are required to submit payroll records, together with pension contribution liabilities, and make the respective payment to the Tax Administration of Kosovo (TAK) by the 15th day of the following month. Employers must inform the TAK about a new employee one day before the employee starts work.
### Penalties
Late payment interest is charged on overdue payments if the tax payments are made after the deadline. The amount of interest due to late payment is calculated on a monthly basis, but not more than ten years from the date when the tax became due.The interest rate shall be determined at least once a year, which must be higher than the interest rate of commercial lending by banks in the Republic of Kosovo.
The tax authority may also levy a tax penalty on taxpayers who claimed any tax refunds without eligibility. Penalties in these cases are levied based on the amounts claimed without eligibility.
## Tax audit process
The Kosovo tax system is based on self-assessment. Tax audits include all types of taxes that the individual is subject to. If any discrepancies result from the tax audit, the tax authorities issue an audit report and re-assessment notices, which the taxpayer can appeal to the Appeals Department within the tax authority.
A taxpayer may submit an amended tax declaration if one subsequently discovers an error in a tax declaration that has already been submitted. The deadline for submitting an amended declaration is three years after the due date of the declaration being amended.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations in general circumstances is six years.
From a PIT perspective, during a tax audit, the main focus of the tax authorities is on areas relating to the calculation of gross income for employees (i.e. allowable and disallowable expenses paid for employees), wages paid in accordance to contracts, primary or secondary employee status, etc.

## Taxable period
The taxation period for which the CIT is assessed is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
CIT returns are filed annually, and the deadline to submit the annual return is 31 March of the following year. The amendment of a submitted tax return is allowed within three years after the mandatory date when the tax return was submitted.
### Penalties
Submission of the tax return after the deadline is subject to fixed mandatory fines. The understatement of tax presented in the tax return is subject to penalty from 15% to 25%, depending on the under-declared amount.
## Payment of tax
Taxpayers with income from economic activities exceeding EUR 30,000 per year are obligated to make quarterly advance payments (15 April, 15 July, 15 October, and 15 January) that amount to ¼ of 110% of the total tax liability for the previous tax period. If it is the taxpayer’s first year of business and/or a tax loss was incurred in the previous year, quarterly advance payments are made on the principle of estimation of that year’s CIT liability.
Final CIT payment is due with the return on 31 March.
### Penalties
Late payment interest is charged on overdue payments if the tax payments are made after the deadline. The amount of interest due to late payment is calculated on a monthly basis, but not more than ten years from the date when the tax became due. The interest rate shall be determined at least once a year, which is higher than the interest rate of commercial lending by banks in the Republic of Kosovo.
The tax authority may also levy a tax penalty on taxpayers who claimed any tax refunds without eligibility. Penalties in these cases are levied based on the amounts claimed without eligibility.
## Tax audit process
The Kosovo tax system is based on self-assessment. Tax audits include all types of taxes that the business is subject to. If any discrepancies result from the tax audit, the tax authorities issue an audit report and re-assessment notices, which the taxpayer can appeal to the Appeals Department within the tax authority.
A taxpayer may submit an amended tax declaration if one subsequently discovers an error in a tax declaration that has already been submitted. The deadline for submitting an amended declaration is three years after the due date of the declaration being amended.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations in general circumstances is six years.
During a tax audit, the main focus of the tax authorities is on areas relating to CIT expense deductibility, VAT crediting rights, WHT compliance, etc.

# Kosovo
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The VAT law and system in Kosovo is based on the European Union (EU) Directive for VAT (Directive 2006/112/EC and its subsequent amendments). VAT legislation is regulated by Law No.05/L-037 ‘On Value Added Tax’ and the corresponding sub-legal acts.
### Registration for VAT
All taxable persons who import/export and taxable persons whose turnover is above EUR 30,000 within a calendar year are required to register for VAT.
Where turnover is less than the threshold, voluntary registration for VAT is possible.
VAT registration for foreign entities or persons not established in Kosovo should be completed from the beginning of their economic activity in Kosovo, regardless of the threshold. Nonetheless, this is not required of persons who make supplies for which the place of supply is considered to be Kosovo and the recipient is liable for the payment of VAT.
### Object of taxation
VAT is levied on:
### VAT rates
The standard VAT rate is 18%.
A reduced rate of 8% applies to the following supplies:
### Chargeability of VAT
VAT generally becomes chargeable when the goods or services are supplied. Specific rules apply in cases where supply of goods or services occurs over a period of time, where successive payments are made, and in case of long-term contracts.
VAT becomes chargeable whichever of the following conditions is fulfilled first: payment is made, invoice is issued, or the supply of goods/services is carried out.
### VAT refunds
Taxable entities have the right to carry forward to the following three tax periods the VAT credit or to claim VAT refund if the following conditions are met:
While taxable persons that have exports may claim VAT refund on a monthly basis after each tax period if the following conditions are met:
On 28 January 2024, the New Law on Administration of Tax Procedures entered into force, and the Tax Administration of Kosovo (TAK) shall now review the VAT refund claim request in 30 days or less (previously, 60 days). In addition to this, based on an internal regulation of the TAK, reimbursement claims shall be reviewed within 7 to 30 days (if no tax audit is initiated) based on the classification of the taxpayer (Category A, B, or C).
### Invoicing
Invoices for supplies subject to VAT must always be issued by the 15th day of the month following that in which the chargeable event occurs, at the latest.
### Place of supply of goods/services
Place of supply of goods or services is determined in line with the provisions set out in EU Directive 2006/112/EC on the Common System of Value Added Tax.
In respect of goods, special rules apply to establish the place of supply of goods with and without transport, on board ships, aircraft, or trains, and supply of natural gas and electricity through distribution systems.
In respect of services, there are two main rules: general and particular. The general rule defines the place of supply of services to a taxable person, which is where that person has established one’s business. Particular rules apply to specific services related to immovable property, passenger transport, restaurant and catering services, short-term rent of transportation equipment, and educational, cultural, artistic, or similar events.
For the supply of services to a non-taxable person, the general rule is that the place of supply is the place where the supplier has established one’s business. The particular rules for supplies to non-taxable persons apply to specific services as outlined above.
The place of supply of the following services to a non-taxable person established outside of Kosovo is the place where that person is established: transfers of copyrights, patents and similar rights; advertising services; consultancy, engineering, accounting, legal, and data processing services; banking, financial, and insurance transactions; supply of staff; hiring of movable tangible property (except transport); provision of access and transport or transmission through to natural gas and electricity distribution systems; telecommunication, radio, and television broadcasting services; and electronically supplied services.
### Reverse-charge mechanism
Reverse charge is applied on supplies of goods and/or services that are supplied from a taxable person not established in Kosovo.
When the recipient of such services/goods is registered for VAT in Kosovo, the place of supply of such services/goods is considered to be Kosovo, and the recipient will be liable for paying the VAT.
In cases where the recipient is not registered for VAT in Kosovo, the supplier is liable to pay VAT and is obligated to register for VAT in Kosovo via a tax representative.
A special reverse-charge scheme is applicable for the supply of construction and construction-related works, as well as supplies where personnel is engaged in construction activities.
Similar to the regular reverse-charge mechanism, the person liable to pay the VAT on the supply is the recipient of the construction services.
With a new public decision, as of 1 January 2020, this rule does not apply in invoicing between the main contractor and the investor, and, in such cases, the contractor issues the invoice with VAT.
### VAT exemptions
VAT exemptions without the right to deduction are applicable to activities in the public interest, welfare, education, culture, sports and religious activities, media, and public transportation. Other activities exempt from VAT include financial services, health and life insurance, lottery, land, housing for residential purposes, etc.
VAT exemptions with the right to deduction include exports, international transport, intermediary services, and special customs arrangements. As per the Law on Economic Recovery, raw materials produced by Kosovo manufacturing businesses are exempt from VAT for both internal trade and exportation with the right to deduction. This is valid until 31 December 2028 as a measure against COVID-19 economic impact.
Supplying goods and services that are co-financed by donations from foreign governments and the Kosovo government and destined for projects with the public as the beneficiary are exempt from VAT (with deduction rights) if such exemption is foreseen between the parties and the participation from the Kosovo government is not more than 20%.
### The right to deduct VAT
The right to deduct input VAT arises at the time when VAT becomes chargeable and such VAT is related to goods or services obtained for business purposes.
For cars used for both business and personal purposes, only 50% of input VAT can be deducted. The use of immovable property in the same manner allows VAT deductibility only up to the proportion of the property’s use for business purposes.
In case purchased goods and services are used to make both taxable and exempt supplies, VAT shall be deducted proportionally to the transactions for which VAT is deductible.
### VAT compliance
Monthly submission of VAT returns to the TAK and monthly payment of VAT are due by the 20th day of the month following the end of each tax period.
In addition, VAT records have to be kept for six years after the end of the tax period to which they relate.
## Customs import duties
Most rates of import duty on goods that originate outside of CEFTA/EU/Turkey are 10% *ad valorem* (10% of the price paid or payable for the imported goods); however, some imported goods are exempt from the payment of the 10% import duty. The Integrated Tariff Code of Kosovo (TARIK) provides detailed information on import duty rates, VAT rates, and excise tax rates (if any), as well as any required certificates or licences that pertain to all imported goods.
## Excise taxes
Excise tax is levied as a percentage of the value of the goods or represents a fixed amount per specified quantity. Excise tax in Kosovo is applicable on certain goods like beer, wines, alcohol, liquors, and other alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, other tobacco products, cars, petrol, diesel, etc.
For applicable excise taxes on these items, please see: [*https://gzk.rks-gov.net/ActDetail.aspx?ActID=2688*](https://gzk.rks-gov.net/ActDetail.aspx?ActID=2688)
## Property taxes
The new Law on Immovable Property Tax, which entered into force on 16 August 2023, has changed the progressiveness of the tax rate. Immovable Property Tax is based on the appraised amount of the taxpayer’s immovable property as the tax base in the respective municipality. The tax base for the taxpayer with immovable properties within a municipality is determined as a single tax base according to the combined amount of all the taxpayer’s immovable properties.
Property tax rates also vary for each municipality. For the capital city of Pristina, the following rates are applicable based on the category of the real estate and activity undertaken:
| Amount of properties (EUR) | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| up to 100,000 | from 0.10 to 1 |
| over 100,000 | 0.20 to 1, plus the tax from the above line |
| over 500,000 | 0.30 to 1, plus the tax from the 2 above lines |
| over 1,000,000 | 0.40 to 1, plus the tax from the 3 above lines |
| over 5,000,000 | 0.50 to 1, plus the tax from the 4 above lines |
The municipalities shall stipulate the applicable tax rate for each tax limit.
The valuation of the property for property tax purposes (calculated in EUR/m2) depends on the location and type of property.
## Transfer taxes
Transfer of immovable property is subject to a property transaction fee levied at the municipal level at EUR 150 per unit. One unit equals 100m² of residential/commercial building or 1 hectare of land.
## Stamp taxes
There are no stamp taxes in Kosovo.
## Payroll taxes
Entities are required to withhold personal income tax (PIT) from the gross salaries of their employees. Progressive tax rates ranging from 0 to 10% are applied to gross income. Based on the new Law on Administration of Tax Procedures, entities are required to inform the tax administration about a new employee one day before the employee starts to work. Salary payment shall be through bank.
## Social security contributions
Both employer and employee are subject to compulsory pension contributions in Kosovo. The total compulsory contribution is 10%, where 5% represents the employee’s share (withheld from gross wages) and 5% the employer’s share.
Employers and employees may contribute additional pension contribution up to 30% (15% + 15%).
The compulsory pension contributions are deductible for CIT purposes of the employer, whereas voluntary contributions and those exceeding 15% of the annual salary are not deductible.
## Other local taxes
Taxes are collected by the municipalities and vary on the activity and location of the business. Such taxes include vehicle tax, property tax, ecological tax, and advertising tax.

# Kosovo
## Overview
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
Kosovo is a landlocked country in the central Balkan Peninsula. With its strategic position, it serves as an important link in the connection between central and south Europe, the Adriatic Sea, and the Black Sea. Its capital and largest city is Pristina, and other major urban areas include Prizren, Peja, and Gjakova. Kosovo borders Albania to the southwest, the Republic of Macedonia to the southeast, Montenegro to the west, and Serbia to the north and east.
Kosovo covers an area of 10,890 square kilometres and has a population of 1,873,000 with a density of 172 per square kilometre.
The official languages in Kosovo are Albanian and Serbian. Turkish, Bosnian, and Roma languages have the status of official languages at the municipal level. The official currency is the euro (EUR).
Kosovo is a multi-party parliamentary representative democratic republic, with legislative, executive, and judicial institutions.
Kosovo’s economy has been recovering at a steady pace post-pandemic. In 2020, the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate decreased by 5.2%. Based on estimated figures, the GDP growth rate in 2022 is projected to increase by 3.9%, which is then expected to trend around 4.2% in 2023.
Kosovo is a member of several international organisations, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, while its membership to the European Union (EU) and United Nations (UN) is still under way. Kosovo has a liberal trade regime as part of Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) that allows producers in Kosovo to export duty-free to CEFTA members. The EU Autonomous Trade Preference regime also enables duty-free exports for the majority of Kosovo goods to the EU market. The April 2016 implementation of the Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with the European Union reinforced trade liberalisation and removed many of the remaining trade and tariff barriers for the European Union.
Tax services include corporate compliance services in accounting, corporate, indirect, and employment tax compliance, as well as tax advisory on domestic and international taxation, transfer pricing, tax dispute resolution, and tax disclosures.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
## Inventory valuation
In order to determine the cost of goods sold, the taxpayer must use one of the inventory methods prescribed by the Kosovo Accounting Standards, which permit the use of first in first out (FIFO) and average cost but prohibit last in first out (LIFO).
Kosovo Accounting Standards are harmonised with the International Accounting Standards (IAS).
## Capital gains
Capital gains and losses are realised through the sale or other disposal of capital assets, including real estate and securities. Capital gains and losses are recognised as business income and business losses, respectively. Capital gains are taxed at the standard CIT rate of 10% (i.e. are taxed at the same rate).
## Dividend income
Dividends received by residents and non-residents are exempt from any form of taxation.
## Interest income
Interest income is taxed at the CIT rate of 10%.
## Rental income
Rental income is taxed at the CIT rate of 9%.
## Royalty income
Royalty income is taxed at the CIT rate of 10%.
## Partnership income
The partnership is not taxed itself; however, the members of the partnership are taxed separately at the standard CIT rate of 10% depending on their share in the partnership.
## Foreign currency exchange gains/losses
Foreign currency exchange gains are subject to tax as capital gains.
## Foreign income
Kosovo resident corporations are taxed on their worldwide income. If a DTT is in force, double taxation is avoided through granting a tax credit up to the amount of the applicable Kosovo CIT rate.
Kosovo legislation does not contain any provisions under which income earned abroad may be tax deferred.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
Resident taxpayers paying rent, interest, royalties, and non-resident services shall withhold tax at the time of payment and shall transfer the amount of the tax withheld not later than the 15th day of the month following the tax period.
Taxpayers shall withhold tax at the time of payment or credit. A WHT obligation applies only when the underlying amount (e.g. rent, interest) is actually paid, not when it accrues.
WHT rates are provided below:
For payments made to recipients in countries with which Kosovo has a DTT, the rates of WHT may be eliminated/reduced under the terms of the treaty.
There is no WHT on dividends, as dividends received by residents and non-residents are exempt from taxation in Kosovo.
## Double tax treaties (DTTs)
Currently, Kosovo has DTTs in place with the following countries:
| Recipient | WHT (%) | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dividends | Interest | Royalties |
| Non-treaty | 0 | 10 | 10 |
| Treaty: |  |  |  |
| Albania | 5/8 | 10 | 10 |
| Austria | 0/15 | 10 (1) | 0 |
| Belgium | 10/15 | 15 | 10 |
| Croatia | 5/10 | 5 | 5 |
| Finland | 5/15 | 0 | 10 |
| Germany | 15 | 0 | 10 |

| Turkey | 0/5/15 (3) | 10 | 10 |
| United Arab Emirates | 5 | 5 | 0 |
| United Kingdom | 0/15 | 0 | 0 |
Notes

# Kosovo
## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
## New law on corporate income tax (CIT)
In July 2019, Kosovo introduced a new law on CIT, which entered into force in August 2019.
The key changes resulting from the new law are summarised below:
### Change of taxation method for insurance and re-insurance activities
The previous taxation method of 5% of gross premiums collected during a tax period for insurance and re-insurance activities has been amended to the conventional taxation method of CIT being levied on taxable profits at the rate of 10%.
### Recognition of loan loss, technical, and mathematical provisions
The new law foresees the recognition of provision expenses for banks, micro-finance institutions, and non-bank financial institutions as follows:
### Allowable deductions for sponsorships in sports, youth, and culture
Taxpayers making contributions to sports have the right to get a tax credit of up to 30% of CIT, and those contributing to youth and culture will be granted a deduction of up to 20% of CIT (if combined contributions in both sports and youth and culture, a maximum allowance of 30% is provided).
### Shorter tax loss carryforward period
Tax losses can be carried forward up to four consecutive tax periods, as opposed to the previous law, which allowed for a carryforward period of up to six consecutive tax periods.
### Lowered threshold to register for CIT
The requirements to maintain books and records, and consequently the obligation for tax reporting based on accrued income, is applicable for any taxpayer with annual gross income from economic activities of 30,000 euros (EUR) or higher, decreased from the EUR 50,000 threshold as per the previous law.
### Reduced withholding tax (WHT) rate on special categories
WHT on gross payments for any taxpayer making payments to non-business individuals, farmers, and collectors of recycled materials, forest fruits, and medicinal plans is reduced from 3% to 1%.
### Revised transfer pricing provisions
As opposed to the previous law, which favoured the comparable uncontrolled price method against other methods, the new law states that the selection of a transfer pricing method should be based on its appropriateness and other relevant criteria (in line with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] Transfer Pricing Guidelines).

# Kosovo
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
Based on Kosovo legislation, a legal entity is considered to be resident in Kosovo if it has its head office or its place of effective management in Kosovo.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
A PE is considered a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on in Kosovo for a period longer than 6 months within any 12-month period. It includes any place of management, branch, office, factory, workshop, mine, oil or gas source, quarry, or other place of exploitation of natural resources.
A PE is deemed to have been created by any building site, construction, assembling or installation project, or supervisory activity in connection therewith, but only if such site, project, or activity lasts longer than 183 days within any 12-month period.
Similarly, furnishing consultancy services for a period of 90 days or more in any 12-month period by a non-resident person triggers a PE, as well as owning immovable property by a non-resident that is situated in Kosovo. In the case of a sole trader or sole proprietorship, if the non-resident person stays in Kosovo for a total period of more than 183 days (including vacation and off days) within the 12-month period, they are considered Kosovo tax residents.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
Expenses paid or incurred, fully or partially, in relation to business activities are deductible for CIT purposes.
Business representation expenses, including expenses that a business incurred in relation to its partners or other institutions (e.g. meetings, presenting new projects with elements of entertainment), cannot exceed 1% of annual gross income. Bad debt expenses are allowable under certain conditions. Business travel expenses are allowable if documented properly.
Expenses that are subject to WHT on rent (such as payments for lease) are only CIT deductible if the corresponding WHT is paid by 31 March of the period following that in which they were incurred, at the latest.
## Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation expenses are calculated via the straight-line method, depending on the category of asset concerned. For buildings, the rate is 5%; for vehicles, furniture, and equipment, the rate is 20%; and for plant and machinery, the rate is 10%.
Amortisation expenses are allowed in accordance with the useful life of the intangible asset, but, at most, 20 years if not specified.
## Goodwill
No specific tax provisions cover the treatment of goodwill.
## Start-up expenses
Only expenses incurred in the current tax period reported can be deducted.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are deductible, provided that such expenses have been paid or incurred in relation to business activities and any WHT due has been paid on or before 31 March of the year following that in which interest expense arose.
## Bad debt
A bad debt shall be considered an expense if it meets all of the following conditions:
## Charitable contributions
Contributions made by a taxpayer in the form of donations or sponsorship for humanitarian, health, education, religious, scientific, cultural, environmental protection, and sports in accordance with the CIT law are considered as contributions given for public interest and are allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of 10% of taxable income, computed before these contributions are deducted.
An additional 10% deduction may be applicable if prescribed so by other laws pertaining to sponsorships of certain activities.
Taxpayers making contributions to sports have the right to deduct up to 30% of CIT; meanwhile, those contributing to youth and culture will be granted a deduction of up to 20% similarly from CIT (if combined contribution in both youth and sports and culture, the maximum deduction is 30%).
A taxpayer who claims a deduction in respect of charitable contributions made during the tax period shall furnish receipts signed and stamped by the beneficiaries of the charitable contributions, confirming the purpose of those donations, the amounts of the donations, and the times when the donations were made.
A charitable contribution deduction can only be claimed by a taxpayer who pays tax on an accrual or real income basis.
## Pension expenses
Pension contributions are deductible up to the limit of 15% of gross salary.
## Bribes, kickbacks, and illegal payments
Bribes, kickbacks, and illegal payments are non-deductible for tax purposes.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and other tax-related sanctions are non-deductible expenses.
## Taxes
Income taxes, VAT, and excise duties are non-deductible expenses.
## Other significant items
Provision expenses are only allowable for banks and insurance companies as per the rules prescribed by the Central Bank of Kosovo and only up to 80% of the statutory provision expenses.
## Net operating losses
Tax losses can be carried forward for up to four consecutive tax years. However, restrictions may apply in cases of change of business or change of ownership; if the business changes its type of business organisation or has an ownership change of more than 50%, the tax loss is not allowed to be carried forward.
Carryback loss provisions are not allowable.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments to foreign affiliates are subject to WHT at 5% if they represent services provided with physical presence in Kosovo by the affiliate, unless tax relief is available with a DTT. These payments are tax deductible if they are properly documented and incurred for business purposes only.
Payments to foreign affiliates made for the purpose of transferring profits may be subject to revaluation by the tax authorities. Any transactions/payments made to foreign affiliates shall be performed on an arm’s-length basis.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
There are no group taxation rules applicable in Kosovo.
## Transfer pricing regime
In July 2017, Kosovo introduced transfer pricing rules, which are applicable from fiscal year 2017.
These rules apply to Kosovo CIT payers that have entered into controlled transactions with related parties established in foreign tax jurisdictions.

Recognised transfer pricing methods include the comparable uncontrolled price (CUP) method, resale price (RP) method, cost plus (C+) method, transactional net margin (TNM) method, and profit split (PS) method. A simplified approach is applicable for low value-adding intra-group services.
Taxpayers with controlled transactions exceeding EUR 300,000 in a calendar year are required to:
Taxpayers with controlled transactions of EUR 300,000 or less in a calendar year are required to prepare documentation, but are not required to submit an Annual Controlled Transactions Notice.

## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
## Foreign tax relief
The resident taxpayer who receives income from economic activities outside of Kosovo and who pays income tax on that income to any other state shall be allowed a tax credit under the PIT for the amount of income tax paid to such state that is attributable to the income generated from the other state.
The tax credit allowed is limited to the amount of foreign tax paid on the income earned outside Kosovo and shall not exceed the amount of obligatory tax in Kosovo on that same income. To the extent that Kosovo tax on that income exceeds the foreign tax paid, the excess amount must be included in the computation of Kosovo obligatory tax.
## Tax treaties
Kosovo currently has DTTs in place with the following countries:
DTT agreements with Czech Republic, France, and Italy are not yet in force.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
An individual is considered resident for tax purposes if one is an individual whose temporary, usual, main residence is in Kosovo, one stays in Kosovo for at least 183 days during a tax period, or one has one’s centre of vital interests (i.e. one’s personal, financial, or social relations) in Kosovo.
The fiscal year is the same as the calendar year (i.e. 1 January to 31 December).
In case a double tax treaty (DTT) between Kosovo and the resident’s country prescribes differently, the DTT provisions will prevail.
