## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## Taxable period
Tax is assessed on a fiscal-year, self-assessment basis, which may or may not match the calendar year.
## Tax returns
The due date for filing the CIT return is during the second week of the fifth month after the fiscal year-end. Tax returns are filed electronically.
## Payment of tax
Instalment payments on account of CIT must be made in the course of the tax year. The instalment payments must be made on a monthly basis, beginning in the first month after the due date of filing of the tax returns.
### Penalties
Penalties derived from tax infractions may be applied by tax authorities, as follows:
### Interest on late payments
Late payment of taxes is subject to compensatory interest. The applicable rate is periodically updated by the tax authorities (currently 7.47%). Interest will start accruing on the day after the filing due date.
## Tax audit process
The tax authorities are entitled to audit taxpayers within the statute of limitations period. Audits consist of revising the calculation of any national or provincial tax based on formal requirements. Where any assessment is issued by the tax authorities, the taxpayer is entitled to either accept it or file a claim. Assessments can be done under a real or estimated basis, depending on the specific case and the information that the taxpayers have on their transactions. In the case that the taxpayers do not accept the assessment during the administrative period, they can claim against Tax Courts before any judicial process.
There are no specific provisions about e-auditing.
## Statute of limitations
The actions and powers of the tax authorities to determine and require payment of federal taxes, and to implement and enforce fines and closures planned, prescribe:
The statute of limitations may be extended to ten years in certain provinces with respect to provincial taxes.
