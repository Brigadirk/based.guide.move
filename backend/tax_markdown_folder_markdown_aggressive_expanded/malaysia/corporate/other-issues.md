## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
## Intergovernmental agreements (IGAs)
The Malaysia-United States IGA was signed on 21 July 2021 to implement the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA).
Under the IGA, reporting Malaysia-based financial institutions will provide the Malaysian Inland Revenue Board with the required information of accounts of US persons. The information of which will then be exchanged between the Malaysian and US tax authorities.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
Malaysia is committed to exchanging CRS information from 2018. Under the CRS, Malaysian financial institutions (MYFIs) are required to collect and report financial account information on non-residents.
The reporting financial Institution is defined to mean any financial institution (FI):
Once an MYFI has applied the due diligence procedures in respect of the accounts it holds and has identified reportable accounts, it must report certain information regarding those accounts to the tax authorities. A reporting MYFI with no reportable accounts is required to make a nil return annually to the Malaysian Inland Revenue Board.
