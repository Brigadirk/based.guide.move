## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
## Social security contributions
### Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF)
The Malaysian EPF is a compulsory pension scheme for all Malaysians. The EPF receives and manages retirement savings, encompassing compulsory contributions by all Malaysian citizens and permanent residents who are working in Malaysia. It is not compulsory for non-Malaysian citizens and non-permanent residents to contribute to the EPF, but they may elect to do so.
| Contribution by | Malaysian citizens and permanent residents (mandatory) | | Expatriates and foreign workers (without permanent resident status) (voluntary) | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Social Security Organisation
Malaysia also has a Social Security Organisation (SOCSO) who administers the Employment Injury Scheme (EIS) and the Invalidity Scheme (IS). SOCSO coverage and protection is limited to Malaysian citizens and permanent residents. A monthly contribution must be made and may fall under one of two categories:
## Employment Insurance System (EIS)
The EIS provides certain benefits and a re-employment placement programme for insured persons in the event of loss of employment to promote active labour market policies. The EIS covers only Malaysian citizens, permanent residents, and temporary residents.
Both the employer and employee make monthly contributions of 0.2% of employee's wage, restricted to a maximum of MYR 11.90, respectively.
## Real property gains tax (RPGT)
| Disposal | **Citizens and permanent residents** | Non-citizens/non-permanent residents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Up to 3 years | 30% | 30% |
| In the 4th year | 20% | 30% |
| In the 5th year | 15% | 30% |
| Exceeding 5 years | 0% | 10% |

Sales tax is generally an *ad valorem tax.* The *ad valorem* rates are 5% or 10% depending on the class of goods.
The rate of service tax is 8% for all taxable services except for the following, which are at 6%:
## Net wealth/worth taxes
