## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
Interest payments, in general, are subject to WHT at a rate of 20%.
Bond interest is subject to WHT at the rate of 10%, except bonds and similar financial products (except public debts) duly listed on the stock exchange, which are subject to CIT at the reduced rate of 5%.
Interest on shareholder loans or income from subscription of obligations paid to holding companies is exempt from WHT.
Royalty payments are subject to WHT at the rate of 20%.
Payments of services between resident companies are generally not subject to WHT. Payments of services to non-resident entities are subject to WHT at the rate of 15%, unless waived under the applicable tax treaty.
Rental payments are subject to WHT of 10% when paid or made available by companies. However, rental payments between resident companies are generally not subject to WHT.
For a Cabo Verde-based recipient, tax withheld is a payment on account against the final income tax due regarding income derived from (i) business, commercial, and services activities, (ii) real estate income, and (iii) employment income when the beneficiary of such income opts to file a tax return.
Any non-Cabo Verde resident entity carrying out an economic activity in Cabo Verde is subject to a final WHT at the same rates applicable to each income category foreseen by the Tax Code.
Regarding income paid to micro and small-sized companies, the WHT applicable is 4%.
