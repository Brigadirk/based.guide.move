For the primary workplace, the following amounts are currently to be deducted from the gross salary income when calculating the taxable income:
For the salary income obtained in other cases, taxable income is assessed as the difference between the gross salary income and the individual mandatory social contributions, due according to the law, in line with the provisions of the European Union or other social security agreements to which Romania is a party.
Individual taxpayers may generally direct up to 3.5% of their annual income tax to charitable purposes.
