## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 25 April 2024
Expenses fall into three categories: deductible expenses, limited deductibility expenses, and non-deductible expenses.
## Deductible expenses
As a general rule, expenses are deductible only if they are incurred for business purposes.
Some of the deductible expenses specifically mentioned by the Romanian Fiscal Code include:
Note that credit institutions apply IFRS rules, and certain deductibility rules are provided for this category of taxpayers.
## Limited deductible expenses
The deductibility of the following expenses is limited:
## Non-deductible expenses
Expenses deemed non-deductible include, among other items, the following:
1. They were destroyed following natural disasters or major force situations in the conditions provided by the methodical norms.
2. Insurance contracts have been set up in respect of these.
3. They were degraded from a qualitative perspective, and the proof of destruction is available.
4. The food intended for human consumption, with a close-to-expiration date, other than those found in the situations/conditions provided in points 1 and 2, if their transfer is carried out according to the legal provisions on reducing food waste.
5. The animal by-products not destined for human consumption, other than those found in the situations/conditions provided in points 1 to 3, if their disposal is carried out in accordance with the legal provisions on reducing food waste.
6. The agri-food products that have become improper for human or animal consumption, if the targeting/guiding is aimed at transforming them into compost/biogas or neutralising them, according to the legal provisions on reducing food waste.
7. Other goods than those found in the situations/conditions provided in points 1 to 6, if the term of validity/expiry is exceeded, according to the law.
Note that credit institutions apply IFRS rules, and certain non-deductibility rules are provided for this category of taxpayers.
## Depreciation
Romanian law makes an explicit distinction between fiscal and accounting depreciation. Fiscal depreciation is treated as a deductible element within the CIT computation, while accounting depreciation should be treated as a non-deductible expense. Companies should maintain a separate record to reflect the separate computation of the fiscal and accounting depreciation. Any accounting revaluations of fixed assets are not taken into account in computing the tax depreciation.
Assets are generally depreciated using the straight-line method. However, accelerated or reducing balance depreciation methods may be used to determine fiscal depreciation for certain assets, while the accounting depreciation method may be different.
The useful lives to be used for tax purposes are the ones stated in the Official Fixed Assets Catalogue, published under government decision. Ranges are provided for classes of fixed assets, from which the taxpayers can choose the useful life (e.g. office and housing buildings: 40 to 60 years, commercial buildings: 32 to 48 years, commercial furnishings: 9 to 15 years, automobiles: 4 to 6 years).
For vehicles with up to nine seats, the fiscal depreciation is limited to a maximum of RON 1,500 per month for each vehicle. Certain categories of vehicles are exempt from this monthly deduction limitation (e.g. used exclusively for emergency, security, or delivery service; used for paid passenger transport; or used for paid supply of services).
Land cannot be depreciated for tax purposes.
### Accelerated depreciation
Under the Romanian Fiscal Code, machinery and technical equipment, computers and their peripherals, as well as patents, may be depreciated by using the accelerated method, under which a maximum of 50% of the asset’s fiscal value may be deducted during the first year of usage, while the rest of the asset’s value can be depreciated using the straight-line method over the remaining useful life.
## Goodwill
As a rule, goodwill is deemed non-depreciable from a Romanian fiscal perspective.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses recognised as intangible assets according to the applicable accounting regulations can be depreciated over a maximum period of five years.
## Provisions and reserves
As a general rule, provisions and reserves are non-deductible for CIT purposes. However, there are certain provisions and reserves that are deductible, such as:
- Reimbursement plan.
- Asset liquidation.
- Simplified procedure.
The reduction or cancellation of any provision or reserve deducted from the taxable profit, due to changing the destination of the provision or reserve, distribution towards shareholders in any form, liquidation, spin-off, merger, or any other reason, should be included in the taxable revenue and taxed accordingly.
Note that special rules are applicable to credit institutions that are required to apply IFRS rules.
## Fiscal losses
Starting from 2024, companies are allowed to carry forward fiscal losses declared in the annual CIT returns for a period of up to five years, within 70% of the taxable profits threshold, based on the FIFO method. No related adjustment for inflation is allowed.
Any loss incurred by a PE of a Romanian company located in a non-EU/European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member state or in a country that has a DTT in place with Romania is only deductible for tax purposes from the revenue derived by that PE, and losses can be carried forward only for a period of five years.
For foreign legal persons, carryforward of losses applies only to revenue and expenses attributable to their PE in Romania.
Losses incurred by a company can be transferred within a merger/spin-off operation and can be recovered by the successors, in proportion to the assets and liabilities transferred. The successors of these restructuring operations are able to use such losses during the remaining period.
Carryback of losses is not available in Romania.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Transactions with Romanian-affiliated companies and with non-resident related parties fall within the scope of the investigations regarding compliance with transfer pricing legislation (*see Transfer pricing in the*[*Group taxation*](group-taxation.html) *section*).
