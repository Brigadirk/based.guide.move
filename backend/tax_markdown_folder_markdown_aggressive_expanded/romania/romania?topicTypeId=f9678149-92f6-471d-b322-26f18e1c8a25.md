## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 25 April 2024
## Social contributions
Social contributions due by employers and employees on income derived from dependent activities are applied to a certain computation base.
Social contributions liabilities are assessed in line with the EU social security coordination rules and the provisions of the social security agreements Romania applies.
The general social contributions rates are established as follows:
Employee contributions:
The monthly assessment base is the gross income derived from dependent activities.
Employer contributions:
The monthly assessment base is the gross salary income derived by individuals, resident and non-resident, based on an employment contract (or a service relationship or special status), as well as revenues treated as salaries (administrators’ remuneration, director on mandate contract, etc.). Special exemptions are provided for each category of the social contributions.
Employers compute and withhold the social contributions when paying salaries. Social contributions must be declared and paid by the salary income payer to the relevant state budgets by the 25th day of the month following the one for which such salary income is paid.
For benefits in kind and/or in cash received from third parties based on an employment contract or a contractual relationship between parties, the obligation to compute and withhold social contributions belongs to:
In addition to salary income, social contributions may be levied in respect of the following types of income:
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate is 19%. The standard VAT rate is applied to all supplies of goods and services (including imports) that neither qualify for an exemption (with or without credit) nor for a reduced VAT rate.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Romania.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
No inheritance taxes apply in Romania, except in relation to transfer of real estate in certain circumstances. Gift taxes are not levied in Romania.
## Property taxes
### Building tax
The building tax calculation method differentiates between buildings depending on their destination usage:
New rules will apply starting in 2025. According to OG no. 16/2022, tax of at least 0.1% (for residential buildings) or at least 0.5% (for non-residential buildings) will apply to the value of the building. For buildings used for agricultural activities, the buildings tax will be calculated by applying a rate of 0.4% to the value of the building.
The value will be calculated as the total value of the buildings, including any annexes, and the land areas covered by them included in the market studies of the indicative values ​​of real estate administered by the National Union of Notaries Public in Romania.
### Land tax
Owners of land are subject to land tax established at a fixed amount per square metre, depending on the rank of the area where the land is located and the area or category of land use, in accordance with the classification made by the Local Council.
Similar to building tax, land tax is paid annually, in two equal instalments, by 31 March and 30 September. A 10% reduction is granted for full advance payment of this tax by 31 March.
### Special taxes on high value assets
As of January 2024, the following assets are subject to the special tax of 0.3%:
