# Congo, Democratic Republic of the
## Overview
Last reviewed - 15 October 2024
The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), located in Central Africa, is bordered by nine countries, including the Central African Republic and Southern Republic of Sudan to the north; Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and Tanzania to the east; Zambia and Angola to the south; and the Republic of Congo and Atlantic Ocean to the west. The Democratic Republic of the Congo attained independence in 1960 and was known as Zaïre prior to 1997. It is the second largest country in Africa and is divided into 26 provinces, with Kinshasa as its capital. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is a presidential democratic republic, and the official language is French. The currency is the Congolese franc (CDF).
Ever increasing activity in the mining sector, the source of most export income, has boosted the DRC's fiscal receipts and gross domestic product (GDP) growth.
