# Colombia
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Foreign tax credit
Foreign income taxes over non-domestic-source income are creditable against CIT, subject to certain limitations. Generally, the amount of the credit cannot exceed the sum of Colombian taxes imposed over the same income. DTTs provide for more comprehensive credit systems as well.
For dividends tax credit, it is expressly established that the effective rate assumed by the company abroad will be that which results from dividing the tax actually paid among commercial profits before taxes.
For the tax credit to be allowed, the shares held by the taxpayer must be deemed as fixed assets.
It is clarified that the indirect tax discount would not be applicable to portfolio investments or destined to speculate in securities markets.
A certificate from the tax auditor of the company that distributes the dividends must be available, in which the value of the commercial profit, the value of the taxable profit, the tax rate, and the tax actually paid by said company can be verified.
## CIT exemptions
As items of exempt income, the law has established the following:
## Tax credit for certain investments
A 30% tax credit is available for investments made in certain scientific and/or technological projects or in professional training projects of governmental, public, or private institutions.
## Special CIT rate for free trade zones (FTZs)
Starting from FY 2023, the following FTZs enjoy a special CIT rate of 20%:
The preferential 20% rate for other qualified FTZ companies before December 2022 will only survive for the term of the initial qualification. New qualifications will be subject to an export-oriented plan to be submitted for approval by the government.
Note that capital gains are taxed at the standard capital gains tax rate of 15%.
Commercial users will apply the general CIT rate, which is 35%.
## Payment of CIT by investments in civil works
Civil works for taxes is a mechanism introduced in the 2016 Tax Reform through which income taxpayers may fulfil their income tax payment by executing works or public investment projects of social significance.
This payment mechanism allows for project execution using tax resources while bypassing the usual flow of money through state entities. Instead, it is administered and executed under the responsibility of a private company to fulfil its tax obligations.
This mechanism enables direct investment of tax into infrastructure projects, tertiary roads, public education, water supply and sanitation, educational infrastructure repair, productive infrastructure (agriculture), digital connectivity, school supplies, climate change mitigation, among others, in the Most Affected Areas by Armed Conflict (ZOMAC) and Territorially Defined Development Areas (PDET).
