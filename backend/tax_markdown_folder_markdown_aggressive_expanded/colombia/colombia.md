# Colombia
## Overview
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Colombia, a constitutional republic in Northwest South America with coasts on the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, was established in 1886. It is divided into 32 departments and one capital district. Colombia's capital is Bogotá. The official language is Spanish, and the currency is the Colombian peso (COP).
Colombia experienced an accelerated period of growth between 2002 and 2013, and such growth have been maintained until 2019, mainly due to improvements in domestic security, rising commodity prices, and favourable economic market policies. Foreign direct investment experienced an increase in the first semester of 2019 of 20.1%, reaching 4.9 billion United States dollars (USD). The Colombian government has entered into several free trade agreements with European and Asian partners. Currently, the United States and the European Union have been the most important trading partners in services and good exportation and reaching an important rise of foreign direct investment.
