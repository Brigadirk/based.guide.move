## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 14 October 2024
An individual is deemed to be resident in Guyana where the individual resides in the country for more than 183 days in any year, resides permanently, or, being in Guyana, intends to reside there permanently. An individual will be regarded as ordinarily resident in Guyana if the individual is habitually resident in Guyana (i.e. resident in Guyana in the normal course of things).
