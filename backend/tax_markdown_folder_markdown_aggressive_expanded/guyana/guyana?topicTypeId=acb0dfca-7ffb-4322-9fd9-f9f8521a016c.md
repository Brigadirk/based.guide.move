## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 14 October 2024
## Inventory valuation
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is generally determined using the average cost method for accounting and tax purposes, but the first in first out (FIFO) method is also acceptable.
## Capital gains
## Dividend income
Corporate tax is payable on dividends received by resident companies from non-resident companies. However, dividends paid by resident companies to other resident companies are exempt from tax.
## Interest income
Interest income is taxed at the applicable rate of corporate tax.
## Royalty income
Royalty income is taxed at the applicable rate of corporate tax.
## Foreign income
Income earned by a non-resident company in Guyana is subject to tax in the year the income was earned. There is no deferral regime in Guyana.
