Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
## Depreciation and amortisation
Allowed tax depreciation and amortisation rates and methods for each category of fixed assets are shown below:
| Asset category | Method | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Buildings and machinery and other fixed structures installed in the building | Straight-line basis | 5 |
| Computers, software products, and information systems | Straight-line basis | 25 |
| Other assets | Straight-line basis | 20 |
| Intangible assets (including goodwill and start-up expenses) | Straight-line basis | 15 |
Notes
Depreciation and amortisation of fixed assets at amounts higher than those allowed for tax purposes is considered a non-deductible expense.
## Interest expenses
Interest paid in excess of the average 12-month credit interest rate applied in the banking system, as determined by the Bank of Albania, is a non-deductible expense.
Additional to the above, any interest expenses that take at least 30% or more of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) are recognised as non-deductible for CIT purposes. Interest for which the deduction is denied is carried forward for the next five years.
## Bad debt
Bad debts are only deductible if the following conditions are met simultaneously:
This applies to all entities except those operating in the financial sector.
## Charitable contributions
There are no provisions in Albania regarding the tax treatment of charitable contributions. In general, contributions are considered as non-deductible expenses for CIT purposes.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and other tax-related sanctions are non-deductible expenses.
## Taxes
Income taxes, VAT, and excise duties are non-deductible expenses.
## Other significant items
The Albanian legislation also defines the following specific costs as non-deductible:
The amounts allocated to special reserve accounts in banks and insurance companies that are calculated under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are deductible.
In the case of banks, branches of foreign banks, and non-bank financial entities licensed by the Bank of Albania for the exercise of lending activity, the write-off of bad debt is recognised as a deductible expense if the following conditions are met:
Employers’ contributions towards the life and health insurance of employees are deductible.
## Net operating fiscal losses
Fiscal losses may be carried forward up to five consecutive years. However, losses may not be carried forward if more than 50% ownership of the share capital or voting rights of the company is transferred during the tax year, provided that this is accompanied by a change of business activity.
Albanian legislation does not allow losses to be carried back.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments to foreign affiliates are subject to withholding tax (WHT) unless tax relief is requested in accordance with the local legislation or any DTT in place. These payments are tax deductible if they are properly documented and incurred for business purposes only.
Payments to foreign affiliates made for the purpose of profit transfer might be subject to price revaluation by the tax authorities. Any transactions/payments made to foreign affiliates shall be performed on an arm’s-length basis.
