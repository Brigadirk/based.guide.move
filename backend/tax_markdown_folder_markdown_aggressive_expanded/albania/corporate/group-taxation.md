# Albania
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
There is no group taxation in Albania.
## Transfer pricing
The law on transfer pricing in Albania emphasises the following:
- one person participates, directly or indirectly, in the management, control, or capital of the other person, and
- the same person or persons participate(s), directly or indirectly, in the management, control, or capital of both persons.
The taxpayer subject to transfer pricing rules must have in place the following information:
Taxpayers with a total value of related-party transactions of over 30 million euros (EUR) for the period of the agreement, can enter into an Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) with the tax authority.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There is a CFC rule in Albania, introduced with Law No. 29/2023 'On Income Tax', applicable to natural persons only. According to this law, when a natural person has an interest in a controlled foreign entity, the profits of which are not subject to tax or are exempt from tax in the Republic of Albania, any undistributed profits, which derive from passive income, must to be included in the taxable income from the investment of the natural person, provided that this passive income exceeds 30% of the total profit of the controlled foreign entity.
