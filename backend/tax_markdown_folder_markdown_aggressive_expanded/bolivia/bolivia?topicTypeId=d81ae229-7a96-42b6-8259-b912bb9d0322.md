## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Payments made to Bolivian residents
Dividends paid to Bolivian residents, either individuals or corporations, are not taxable.
## Payments to non-residents
Dividend payments, distributions of profits to the head office by Bolivian branches, interest payments, royalty payments, and fees paid for any type of services made to non-residents are subject to a WHT of 12.5%. -note that this WHT rate can be reduced if dividends/profits are totally or partially reinvested (*see the [Investment incentives](bolivia/corporate/tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section*)-.
## Tax treaties
Bolivia currently has in force double tax treaties (DTTs) with the Andean Community (i.e. Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru), Argentina, France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.
Beneficial WHT rates on dividend distributions are provided by DTT with Spain and Sweden at 10% and 0%, respectively, provided the Spanish or Swedish holding company demonstrates it is the beneficial owner and holds more than a 25% interest in the Bolivian company.
