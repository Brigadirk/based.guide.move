## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Taxable period
The taxable year is the fiscal year. The fiscal year varies according to the activity of the corporation. Banks and commercial and other service activities have a fiscal year-end as of 31 December; industrial, oil, and gas companies as of 31 March; agribusiness and forestry companies as of 30 June; and mining companies as of 30 September.
## Tax returns
CIT is assessed on a self-assessment basis every fiscal year, and the due date for submission is 120 days after the fiscal year-end. Tax returns must be accompanied by audited financial statements (if applicable) and ancillary tax information as requested by the tax authorities.
## Payment of tax
CIT is payable in one annual payment 120 days after the fiscal year-end, except for mining companies, which are obligated to make advance payments on a monthly basis with respect to the additional tax (i.e. 12.5% and 7.5% for exploitation and manufacturing mining companies, respectively).
## Tax audit process
## Statute of limitations
According to the current BTC, tax authorities have up to eight years to review and recalculate taxes determined by taxpayers, and this period could be extended two years more if taxpayers do not register in the appropriate regime or if taxpayers have performed commercial and/or financial transactions with a person (corporate or individual) resident in a country/region considered a low or nil taxation jurisdiction. This period must be computed as of the first day of the following year in which the tax payment due date has occurred (e.g. if the tax payment deadline occurred in August 2022, the period that can be subject to tax review is 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2030).
