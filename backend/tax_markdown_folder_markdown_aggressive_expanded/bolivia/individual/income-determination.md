## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Employment income
An employee is taxed on salaries, bonuses (except Christmas bonus), living allowances, housing allowances, tax reimbursements, benefits in kind, and any other form of income/compensation earned as an employee for work carried out in Bolivia.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are not subject to tax. However, note that RC-IVA taxes income obtained by individuals as a result of either the investment of their capital or the work carried out, or the combination of both.
## Investment income
Investment income from a Bolivian source (except dividends paid to individuals by domestic corporations) is taxed as ordinary income with RC-IVA. Investment income obtained abroad by individuals is not taxed in Bolivia. Interest, dividends, etc., earned in Bolivia by non-residents are subject to a withholding tax (WHT) of 12.5% when such income is remitted or credited to a personal account.
