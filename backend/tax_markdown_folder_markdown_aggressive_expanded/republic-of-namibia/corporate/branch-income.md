# Namibia, Republic of
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
Branch income that is received or accrued from a source within, or deemed to be within, Namibia is taxable in Namibia based on the normal corporate tax rules.
A branch is regarded as an extension of its foreign head office. A branch may, therefore, not deduct fees paid to its foreign head office (unless a tax treaty provides for such a deduction), as it is argued that a branch cannot transact with itself. Reimbursement of actual expenses may, however, be deducted, subject to the normal deduction rules.
Transfer pricing rules apply to transactions between a branch and cross-border related parties.
