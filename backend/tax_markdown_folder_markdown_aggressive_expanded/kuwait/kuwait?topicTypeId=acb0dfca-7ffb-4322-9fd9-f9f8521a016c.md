## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
Income tax is imposed on the profit of a business in Kuwait as calculated by the normal commercial criteria, using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), including the accrual basis. Note that provisions, as opposed to accruals, are not deductible for tax purposes. In addition, for contract accounting, revenue is recognised by applying the percentage of completion method.
Article 2 of the Executive Bylaws to the Kuwait Tax Law provides that income earned from the following activities in Kuwait shall be considered subject to tax in Kuwait:
## Inventory valuation
Inventory is normally valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value, on a first in first out (FIFO) or average basis.
## Capital gains
Capital gains on the sale of assets and shares by foreign shareholders are treated as normal business profits and are subject to tax at a 15% rate. The tax law provides for a tax exemption for profits generated from dealing in securities on the KSE, whether directly or through investment portfolios.
## Dividend income
Dividends declared by companies listed on the KSE after 10 November 2015 are exempt from tax in Kuwait.
## Interest income
In principle, tax is levied on the foreign company's share of the profits (whether or not distributed by the Kuwaiti company) plus any amounts receivable for any other income in Kuwait (e.g. interest, royalties, technical services, management fees). However, the Kuwait tax law will still subject the interest received from a Kuwaiti source to tax in Kuwait, whether this interest is the only source of income for the foreign entity in Kuwait or the foreign entity has more sources of income in Kuwait other than the interest income.
## Royalty income
Royalty income earned from “the sale, lease, grant of franchise to use or utilise any trademark, design, patent, intellectual property, or copyright in Kuwait” is taxable in Kuwait. Kuwait tax law imposes a deemed profit of 98.5% on royalties earned from Kuwait (1.5% being an allowance for head office overhead), on which the prevailing flat corporate tax rate of 15% is applied.
## Foreign currency exchange rates and related profits and losses
The tax treatment for realised and unrealised losses and gains related to foreign currency transactions are as follows:
## Exempt income
The following sources of income are exempt from tax in Kuwait:
## Foreign income
The Kuwait tax law does not clearly provide for the tax treatment of foreign income. Such income is currently treated on a case-by-case basis.
