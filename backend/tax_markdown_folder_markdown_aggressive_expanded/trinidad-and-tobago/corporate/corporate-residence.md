# Trinidad and Tobago
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 31 January 2025
Corporate residence is determined by reference to the location of the central management and control of the business of a company.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
A non-resident company is subject to corporation tax on its income derived from trading within Trinidad and Tobago. A company is deemed to be engaged in or carrying on trade or business in Trinidad and Tobago if it has an office or place of business or has a branch or agency within Trinidad and Tobago. The local legislation does not make any reference to the term ‘permanent establishment’; however, this term is used generally in the treaty context. Subject to the terms of specific double taxation treaties (DTTs), a non-resident company will have a PE in Trinidad and Tobago where:
The term ‘fixed place of business’ has been generally defined to include a place of management, a branch, office, factory, a workshop, an installation or structure for the exploration of natural resources, or a building, construction, or installation project.
Most treaties outline circumstances under which a company will not be deemed to have a PE, and these include where the activities of the company are merely of a preparatory or auxiliary nature.
