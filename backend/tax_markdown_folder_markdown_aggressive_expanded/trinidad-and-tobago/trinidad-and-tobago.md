# Trinidad and Tobago
## Overview
Last reviewed - 31 January 2025
Trinidad and Tobago, with its capital in Port of Spain, gained its independence in 1962. It is one of the most prosperous countries in the Caribbean, largely due to petroleum and natural gas production and processing.
The official language of Trinidad and Tobago is English, and the currency is the Trinidad and Tobago dollar (TTD).
Trinidad and Tobago has earned a reputation as an excellent investment site for international businesses. Growth has been fuelled by investments in liquefied natural gas, petrochemicals, and steel. Additional petrochemical, aluminium, and plastics projects are in various stages of planning.
Trinidad and Tobago is one of the leading Caribbean producers of oil and gas, and its economy is heavily dependent upon these resources, but it also supplies manufactured goods, notably food products and beverages, as well as cement, to the Caribbean region. The country is also a regional financial centre, and tourism is a growing sector, although it is not as important domestically as it is to many other Caribbean islands. The economy benefits from a growing trade surplus.
