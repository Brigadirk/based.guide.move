## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is applicable to a wide range of goods and services. The standard rate applicable to commercial supplies is 12.5%.
Basic food items and agricultural supplies are zero-rated, as are crude oil, natural gas, and exported goods and services. Hotel accommodation and yachting services to non-residents are zero-rated.
A number of services, including financial services, real estate brokerage, residential rentals, and educational services, are exempt. However, certain financial services are subject to a transaction tax at a rate of 15%. Imported inputs of highly capital-intensive manufacturers are exempt from VAT.
The VAT registration threshold for companies making commercial supplies is TTD 600,000 for a 12-month period.
## Customs duties
Customs duties are imposed at varying rates on imports and manufactured goods according to classification in Schedules to the Customs Act. The basis is the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) value of the goods at the time of import. However, there is a provision for exemptions in relation to specific goods.

## Payroll taxes
Under the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system, an employer is required to deduct income tax from emoluments paid to employees. ‘Emoluments’ is widely defined to include all salary, wages, overtime, bonus, remuneration, perquisites, lodging, stipend, commission or other amounts for services, directors’ fees, retiring allowance, and pensions.
## Social security contributions
There is a social security tax, referred to as National Insurance, that is deducted at source at varying rates. The maximum rate is TTD 414.30 per week for monthly income over TTD 13,600, which is payable TTD 276.20 by the employer and TTD 138.10 by the employee.
There is also a health surcharge that is deducted at source. The maximum liability is TTD 8.25 for every week worked.
## Hotel accommodation tax
Hotels are subject to a hotel accommodation tax at a rate of 10% of the value of the accommodation.
