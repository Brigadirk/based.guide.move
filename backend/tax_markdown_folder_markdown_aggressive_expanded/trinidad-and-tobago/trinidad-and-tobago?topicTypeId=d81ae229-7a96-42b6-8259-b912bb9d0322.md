## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 31 January 2025
WHT is imposed at varying rates up to 15%, depending on the nature of the payment, the status of the payee, and the applicability of DTTs. The tax treaty rate in some instances is now higher than the statutory rate. In such cases, the lower statutory rate applies. The rates below have been adjusted to reflect these reductions:
