## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 31 January 2025
With the assent of the Governor on 27 December 2023, the Bermuda Corporate Income Tax Act 2023 (CITA 2023) became law. Subsequent to this date, a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) has been released with an updated version including additional guidance on this subject.
Effective as of 1 January 2025, a 15% corporate income tax (CIT) will be generally applicable to Bermuda businesses that are part of a multinational enterprise (MNE) group with annual revenue of 750 million euros (EUR) or more. The Bermuda CIT aligns with the Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) rules and qualification as a Covered Tax. However, Bermuda currently has no proposals to introduce the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) or the Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR).
Historically, Bermuda had not imposed taxes on profits, income, dividends, or capital gains. Bermuda businesses that are not within the scope of the newly enacted Bermuda CIT, which is effective in 2025, will continue to not be subject to income tax in Bermuda.
