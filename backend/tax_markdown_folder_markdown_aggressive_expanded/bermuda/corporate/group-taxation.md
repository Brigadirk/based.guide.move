## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 31 January 2025
Since income taxes have not previously been imposed on corporations in Bermuda, group taxation has historically not been relevant in the context of Bermuda taxation.
However, Bermuda has enacted CITA 2023 which includes specific guidance in relation to group taxation applicable to the CIT effective in 2025.
