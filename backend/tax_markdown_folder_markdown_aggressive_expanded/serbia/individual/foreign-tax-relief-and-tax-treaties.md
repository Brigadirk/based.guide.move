## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 12 June 2024
## Foreign tax relief
Serbian residents are taxed on their worldwide income. When income generated in another country is taxed there, the taxpayer has the right to decrease the tax liability by claiming a tax credit to the tax authorities in Serbia. This tax credit is equal to the tax paid in another country, but it cannot exceed the amount of the tax that would have been paid in Serbia.
In case the income is received from a country with which Serbia has DTT in place, the method for avoidance of the double taxation prescribed by the DTT (credit or exemption) will be applicable.
