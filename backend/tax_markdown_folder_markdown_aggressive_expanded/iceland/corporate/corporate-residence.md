## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
Foreign corporations are regarded as Icelandic tax residents if the effective management is carried out in Iceland.
The Internal Revenue Directorate can decide with a ruling whether a corporation’s residence is in Iceland. The ruling can be appealed to the Internal Revenue Board or to a court of law.
