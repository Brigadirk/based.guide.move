## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Branches of a foreign company are chargeable to tax in Bangladesh on income received or deemed to be received in Bangladesh or income that accrues or arises, or is deemed to accrue or arise, in Bangladesh. The tax rate will be as applicable to an unlisted company on net income (i.e. income less allowable expenses).
## Branch profit remittance tax
Remittance of profits (after tax) earned by a branch to its head office attracts a branch profit tax at 20% of such remittance. The remittance is not allowed by the authorised dealer bank unless the branch profit tax has been duly deposited.
