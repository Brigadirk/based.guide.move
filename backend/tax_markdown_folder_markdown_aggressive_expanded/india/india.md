## Overview
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
India, a country in South East Asia, is the seventh-largest country by geographical area, the most populous country with over 1.43 billion people, and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean to the south, the Arabian Sea to the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal to the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; Bhutan, the People's Republic of China, and Nepal to the northeast; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. India is divided into 28 states and eight union territories, with New Delhi as the capital. The official languages of India are Hindi and English, and the currency is the Indian rupee (INR).
India gained independence in 1947 and is developing into an open-market economy. Economic liberalisation, including reduced controls on foreign trade and investment, began in the early 1990s and has served to accelerate the country's growth rate, projected at 7% in tax year 2024/25 (tax year begins on 1 April and ends on 31 March of the following year; note that, in India, 'tax year' is referred to as 'financial year' and the year following a 'tax year' is referred to as 'assessment year').
