## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
Resident entities are subject to corporate income tax (CIT) based on their worldwide income.
Non-resident entities without a PE or whose income is not attributable to a PE in Mozambique are only subject to CIT on the income sourced from Mozambique.
Resident entities and non-resident entities with a PE in Mozambique are subject to CIT that is levied on taxable profits, defined as accounting profits adjusted to comply with tax law rules, at a tax rate of 32%.
Non-resident entities without a PE or whose income is not attributable to a PE in Mozambique are generally taxed through a final and definitive withholding tax (WHT) of 20% or 10% (applicable to certain income only) that is applied on the gross income earned. There are also instances (e.g. capital gains) where non-resident entities are required to register themselves as a non-resident taxpayer, appoint a tax representative in Mozambique, file the necessary tax return, and subject the income/gain to CIT at a rate of 32%.
