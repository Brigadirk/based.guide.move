| Dividends | 5 |
| Interest | 5 |
| Royalties | 5 |
| Oil and gas subcontractor income | 4 |
| International transportation/communication | 10 |
| Income from services rendered in Georgia | 10 |

Payments of interest, royalties, or other Georgian-source income to non-residents registered in so called ’black listed’ countries are subject to WHT at a 15% rate.
The list of such countries is determined by the MoF of Georgia.
