A person established in Georgia must register as a VAT payer when its taxable turnover exceeds 100,000 Georgian lari (GEL) in any continuous 12-month period. Georgian fixed establishment of a foreign taxable person is liable for VAT registration from the beginning of taxable operations.
Generally, VAT is chargeable at the moment of supply of goods and services. VAT is also applied on the advances received on goods and services to be supplied.
The taxable amount is determined based on the received/receivable consideration.
VAT-exempt supplies include financial services, goods and services required for oil and gas operations, certain medical and education services, etc.
