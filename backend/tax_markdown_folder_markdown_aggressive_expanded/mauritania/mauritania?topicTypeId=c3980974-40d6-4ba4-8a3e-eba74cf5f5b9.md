Taxpayers are required to close their accounts each year on 31 December, except in the event of disposal or cessation of activities during the year.
New enterprises that commenced operations during the year may close their first balance sheet at the end of the following year. They are then required to draw up a provisional operating account as at 31 December of the year in which they commenced business, the results of which will be taxed immediately. This tax will be deducted from the tax on the results of the first closed balance sheet.
## Tax returns
