## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 18 July 2024

Business expenses booked during the fiscal year and declared are generally deductible unless specifically excluded by the GTC.
## Inventory valuation
Inventory is generally stated at the lower of cost or market value.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are taxed at the regular CIT rate (25% or 2%). However, the tax may be deferred if the proceeds are used to acquire new fixed assets in Mauritania in the following three fiscal years with an application addressed to the General Tax Office.
## Dividend income
Dividends are subject to a 10% WHT.
## Interest income
Bond interest is taxed at 10%. The amount withheld must be paid in four equal instalments (within the first 15 days of January, April, July, and October of each year).
