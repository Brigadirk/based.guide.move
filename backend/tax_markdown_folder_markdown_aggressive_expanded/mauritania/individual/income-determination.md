## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 18 July 2024
## Employment income
Under Article 111 of the GTC, the tax is due for employees receiving income from public and private salaries, wages, and related allowances:
The following types of income are exempt from tax:
The following types of pensions are exempt from tax:
## Equity compensation
The GTC does not provide specific rules applicable to the taxation of employer-provided stock options.
## Business income
For the tax regimes based on the actual income (normal and intermediary regimes), the tax due will correspond to 30% of the tax base or to 2.5% of the taxable revenues, whichever is higher
However, the minimum tax payable will depend on the type of tax regime (MRU 125,000 for the normal tax regime and MRU 75,000 for the intermediary tax regime).
The tax base will correspond to profits less expenses.
However, taxpayers will not be allowed to do the following:
It will be possible for the individuals subject to the intermediary tax regime to opt for the normal tax regime before 1 February of each year. The option becomes effective from 1 January of the year of the opting for the normal tax regime and should be applied for at least two fiscal years.
However, an individual subject to the normal tax regime cannot opt for the intermediary tax regime or for the lump-sum tax regime.
Taxpayers subject to the lump-sum tax regime will be liable to pay a tax of 3% of their annual turnover.
Under the lump-sum tax regime and where individuals perform simultaneous activities in the same location or several activities in different locations, each business will be considered as a different activity taxable on a separate basis, assuming that the total turnover is less than MRU 3 million.
## Dividend income
Dividends are taxed at 10%. When the company pays the dividend, it should apply the WHT. There is a complex system of quarterly instalment payments.
## Interest income
Bond interest is taxed at 10%. The amount withheld must be paid in four equal instalments (within the first 15 days of January, April, July, and October of each year).
Deposits or guaranteed interest on accounts with a Mauritanian bank are taxed at 10%. The amount withheld is paid by the bank in four equal instalments (within the first 15 days of January, April, July, and October of each year).
Other interest revenues, notably interest on loans, are taxed at 10%. The amount withheld is paid in four equal instalments (within the first 15 days of January, April, July, and October of each year).
## Rental income
Rental income from houses, office buildings, factories, and real estate without buildings is subject to proportional tax at a rate of 10%.
