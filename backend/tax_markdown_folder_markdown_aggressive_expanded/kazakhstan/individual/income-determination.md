## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
## Employment income
Employee income (irrespective of one’s residency status) subject to taxation in Kazakhstan is any kind of income received by an employee from an employer in cash or in kind (e.g. accommodation provided by an employer, benefits, compensation, personal use of company provided car, reimbursable business trip expenses in excess of statutory limits).
## Equity compensation
No taxable income is recognised at either the grant date or date of exercise for equity compensation, as the difference between the actual cost and fair market value is specifically excluded from taxation.
## Business income
## Capital gains
Capital gains are subject to income tax at the rate of 15%.
However, capital gains associated with the disposal of the following securities may be exempt from taxation in Kazakhstan:
## Dividend income
Dividend income received from a Kazakhstan source, as well as all foreign-source dividend income, is taxable at 15%.
Dividend income received from a resident legal entity for a calendar year is exempt from 10% taxation in Kazakhstan within 30,000 times the Monthly Calculated Index (MCI) upon distribution. The amount of dividends that is more than 30,000 times the MCI paid to an individual is subject to tax at the source of payment at the 10% rate.
## Interest income
In accordance with the provisions of the Kazakhstan tax legislation, interest income received from foreign banks is taxable in Kazakhstan irrespective of the level of interest rate, whereas interest income from Kazakhstan banks (operating under the licence of the authorised Kazakhstan state body on regulation and supervision of financial markets and financial institutions) is exempt from taxation in Kazakhstan for residents. The tax rate for non-residents is 15%.
Interest on debt securities, government securities, and agency bonds is also exempt from taxation in Kazakhstan.
## Rental income
When calculating taxable income associated with renting out or leasing a property, the taxpayer can exclude maintenance and repair costs or reimbursement of such costs associated with leasing of this property.
