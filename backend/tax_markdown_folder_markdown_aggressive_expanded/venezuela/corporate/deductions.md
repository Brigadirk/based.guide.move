## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
## Depreciation and amortisation
## Goodwill
Deduction of the amortisation of goodwill is allowed for income tax purposes. Deduction of the cost basis for purposes of calculating the capital gain on the sale is also allowed for income tax purposes.
## Organisational and pre-operating expenses
Domestic income tax regulations do not provide for specific guidance as to the treatment of organisational and pre-operating expenses. The accepted practice is to follow GAAP.
## Interest expenses
Interest paid on a loan, the principal of which is invested to generate income, is deductible.
## Bad debt
Losses arising from bad debts are deductible, provided:
## Charitable contributions
Deductions for allowable charitable contributions are limited to 10% of taxable income (before deducting contributions) when taxable income does not exceed TU 10,000. When taxable income exceeds TU 10,000, charitable contributions are limited to 8% of taxable income. For oil extraction companies, the deduction is limited to 1% of the pre-contribution tax amount.
## Fines and penalties
Income tax regulations do not expressly provide for the treatment of fines and penalties; however, such expenses are not deductible as they do not meet the normality and necessity requirements.
## Taxes
Municipal, state, and local taxes are deductible in determining taxable income. Corporate taxes are not deductible.
## Other significant items
Payments required by the labour law, such as profit sharing (generally between 15 days and four months' salary) and severance indemnity accruals, are also deductible. In cases of unjustified dismissals, double severance indemnities must be paid. However, accruals for such additional indemnities are generally not deductible until paid.
Corporate tax deduction of employees' compensation and professional fees is subject to compliance with the taxpayer's obligations as employer as provided for in the Law, which entail, among others, withholding obligations.
## Net operating losses
Losses may be carried forward for three years. During the three-year term, the amount of losses available to carry forward cannot exceed 25% of the tax period’s taxable income. Carryforward losses derived from the inflation adjustment have been eliminated. Losses may not be carried back. Foreign losses may be offset only against foreign profits.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
A Venezuelan corporation may claim a deduction for royalties and technical assistance and for technical service fees paid to foreign affiliates, subject to the following conditions:
