Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
## New tax measures as of 2024
The Luxembourg Parliament voted on 11 December 2024 to approve bill 8414 amending the Luxembourg tax legislation. The bill introduces several important measures for both individual and corporate taxpayers and aim to strengthen the purchasing power of Luxembourg residents and cross-border employees and the competitiveness of Luxembourg companies
The main measures for individuals are the following:
These measures are designed to enhance Luxembourg's competitiveness and encourage the creation of high-value-added jobs. The anticipated tax revenue loss from these measures is expected to be balanced by increased tax revenues in the medium term.
Additionally, considering the continuous tension in relation to the Luxembourgish real estate, notably due to the high long-term interest rates that affect the borrowing capacity of households, the Law dated 22 May 2024 introduced new temporary measures in order to boost the housing market. These temporary measures were initially taken only for the tax year 2024. However, the following measures have been extended for an additional period of 6 months, i.e., until 1 July 2025.
These temporary measures are summarised below:
### Adjustments to personal income tax (PIT) brackets
