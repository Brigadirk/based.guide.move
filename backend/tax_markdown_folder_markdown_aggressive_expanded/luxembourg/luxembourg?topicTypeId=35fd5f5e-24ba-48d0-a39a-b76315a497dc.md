## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
Individual income tax is levied on the worldwide income of individuals residing in Luxembourg, as well as on Luxembourg-source income of non-residents.
## Personal income tax rates
Luxembourg income tax liability is based on the individual's personal situation (e.g. family status). For this purpose, individuals are granted a tax class. Three tax classes have been defined:
Since 1 January 2018, married non-resident taxpayers who are not separated are granted tax class 1. However, subject to some conditions, they can request to be treated as Luxembourg tax resident to obtain the application of the tax class 2 (generally, the tax class for resident unseparated spouses). The application of tax class 2 leads to a combined assessment.
Non-resident taxpayers may request joint taxation under tax class 2 (i.e. as for married resident taxpayers), provided that at least one of the following conditions is met:
This option can be requested via either payroll or individual tax return. Non-resident married taxpayers will have to report their non-Luxembourg-sourced income (for example, the spouse’s professional income). In principle, non-Luxembourg-sourced income will be exempted for Luxembourg tax purposes but will be taken into account when determining the applicable tax rate for the Luxembourg-sourced income ('exemption with progression').
In practice, married non-resident taxpayers where one spouse works outside of Luxembourg and/or where the individual has extensive income outside of their Luxembourg employment income will be adversely affected by this provision, as it will increase their effective tax rate.
Tax is calculated in accordance with a progressive table, ranging from currently 8% on taxable income in excess of EUR 12,438 to 42% on income in excess of EUR 220,788. See the below tax brackets for the tax scale that has been adapted as of 2024:
