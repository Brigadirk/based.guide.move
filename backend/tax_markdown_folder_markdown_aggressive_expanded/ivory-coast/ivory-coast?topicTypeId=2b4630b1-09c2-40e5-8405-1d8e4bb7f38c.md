# Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire)
## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 20 November 2024
## Social security contributions
Employees must contribute to the social security system (*Caisse Nationale de Prevoyance Sociale* or CNPS) together with the employer. The employees only pay 6.3% for the CNPS Retirement Fund and the employer pays 7.7% of the taxable salary to the CNPS Retirement Fund (total 14%). The other contributions are paid by the employer (i.e. family allowances 5.75%, work injury from 2% to 5%).
The monthly ceiling for the CNPS Retirement Fund is XOF 3,375,000, and the monthly ceiling for the other contributions is XOF 70,000.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
## Luxury and excise taxes
Excise duties apply on cigarette imports, alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverages, oil products, and perfume and cosmetics products.
## Payroll taxes
Taxes are levied at the rates of 2.8% for local employees and 12% for expatriate employees on the total taxable remuneration, including salaries, benefits, and benefits in kind.
With the removal of the 20% reduction on gross remuneration paid, as part of the salary tax reform, the above-mentioned usage rates are directly applied to the gross base for the calculation of the employer contribution.
