# Ecuador
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 06 September 2024
## Employment expenses
Social security contributions are deductible against income arising from employment.
## Personal expenses
As of 2022, there is no longer a deduction for personal expenses; however, personal expenses will be considered for the tax discount or reduction (applicable before allocating tax credits).
## Personal allowances
An annual personal allowance of USD 11,902 represents the minimum taxable income in the current progressive PIT table, which means that an individual will pay income tax when one's income exceeds USD 11,902.
## Business deductions
Independent professionals are allowed to deduct their social security contributions as well as other business expenses.
