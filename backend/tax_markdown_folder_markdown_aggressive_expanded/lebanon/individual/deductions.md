## Personal allowances
Individuals are entitled to family deductions ranging from LL 450 million to LL 900 million instead of LL 37.5 million to LL 62.5 million according to the taxpayer's family status (as per Article 49 of Budget Law 2024 dated 15 February 2024).
## Business deductions
For sole proprietorships and general partnerships, tax is levied on real profits or profits on a fixed lump-sum basis (a specified percentage, depending on the type of profession, applied to annual revenues to determine taxable profits). Accordingly, no deductions are taken into consideration.
