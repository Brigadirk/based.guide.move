# Lebanon
## Overview
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
The Republic of Lebanon is situated in the Levant on the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea, with Syria to the north and east. Lebanon is divided into six governorates, with Beirut as the capital. The official language is Arabic, and the currency is the Lebanese pound (LBP or LL).
Lebanon has a long tradition of domestic free trade and investment policies, with free market pricing for most goods and services. The Lebanese economy is service-oriented, and its main growth sectors include banking and tourism.
However, since October 2019, the country has been going through a freefall in economy and de facto capital control restrictions. Even though the Lebanese pound currency is still pegged to the United States dollar (USD) at USD 1 = LL 1,507.50 since 1997, the Lebanese currency has been unofficially devalued for more than 95% of its value since the end of 2019, leading to severe economic consequences and historical inflation rates.
Due to political instability, the real gross domestic product (GDP) witnessed a decrease of 6.6% in 2024, according to the World Bank.
Lebanon is a founding member of the United Nations (UN) and the League of Arab States and is a member of all international organizations under the auspices of the United Nations (e.g. UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, Food and Agriculture Organization, International Fund for Agricultural Development), the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (i.e. the World Bank) and its affiliates (i.e. the International Finance Corporation and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the International Development Association (IDA).
