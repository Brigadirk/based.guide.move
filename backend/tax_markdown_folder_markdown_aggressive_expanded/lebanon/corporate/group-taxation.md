# Lebanon
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
There is no group taxation in Lebanon.
## Transfer pricing
In Lebanon, there are no clear and detailed transfer pricing or general anti-avoidance rules. However, even in the absence of clear transfer pricing rules, exchanges or transactions made between related parties should be done on an arm’s-length basis.
The tax administration has the right to reassess related-party transactions and adjust their value in order to reflect the taxable amount related to the period under study.
## Thin capitalisation
In Lebanon, there are no clear or detailed thin capitalisation rules.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no CFC rules in Lebanon.
