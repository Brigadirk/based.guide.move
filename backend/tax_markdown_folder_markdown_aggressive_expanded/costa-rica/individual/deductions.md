# Costa Rica
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 15 January 2025
## Employment expenses
A domiciled individual, whether or not a national, whose only source of income is a salary for personal services cannot deduct business expenses.
## Personal allowances
In Costa Rica, personal allowances take the form of tax credits (*see the*[*Other tax credits and incentives*](other-tax-credits-and-incentives.html)*section for more information*).
## Business deductions
Self-employed individuals whose source of income is from professional services (i.e. non-dependent work relationship), insurance brokerage, commissions (sales), fees, etc. may deduct up to 25% of the gross income as a deduction without itemising the expenses or may elect to itemise the expenses incurred in producing the income.
