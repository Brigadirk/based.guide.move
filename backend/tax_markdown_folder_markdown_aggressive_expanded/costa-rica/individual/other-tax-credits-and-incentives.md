## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 15 January 2025
## Personal tax credits
Individuals are permitted annual tax credits, as shown below:
| **Allowances for employed/self-employed individuals** | **Annual tax credit (CRC)** |
| --- | --- |
| Spouse (1) | 31,200 |
| Child (each) (2) | 20,640 |
1. Only self-employed individuals who receive commissions, fees, royalties, or other forms of income for services rendered, and those who receive interest or rental income from local sources must file a tax return. If both spouses earn income, they must submit individual returns, in which case the personal child credit can be credited by only one of the spouses. The present legislation does not contemplate joint filing.
2. The child allowance is permissible only if the child is a minor, is unable to work, or is a university student under 25 years of age.
