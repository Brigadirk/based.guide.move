## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
A Tanzanian resident is taxed on worldwide income, irrespective of source. Non-residents are taxable on income with a source in Tanzania.
Gain from the disposal of investments in Tanzania is subject to income tax where such investments fall within the source rules, and, in such a case, the gain will be taxed at a rate of 30%.
## Reduced rate for newly listed companies
A reduced corporate income tax (CIT) rate of 25% applies for three consecutive years for companies newly listed on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE). To qualify, at least 30% of the company's shares must be issued to the public.
## Reduced rate for specific persons
Reduced CIT rates apply as follows:
## Alternative minimum tax (AMT)
AMT applies at a rate of 0.5% to the turnover of companies with perpetual unrelieved tax losses for the current and preceding two income years. Exemption applies to (i) agricultural companies (ii) tea processing companies (for a three-year period from 1 July 2024 to 30 June 2027), and (iii) companies engaged in provision of health or education.
