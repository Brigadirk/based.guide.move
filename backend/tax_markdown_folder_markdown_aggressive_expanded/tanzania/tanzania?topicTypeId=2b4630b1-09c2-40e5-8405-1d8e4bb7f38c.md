## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Social security contributions
There is a state social security scheme known as the National Social Security Fund (NSSF), which every employer in the private sector must contribute to. The employer’s contribution is 20% of the employee’s remuneration; however, the employer is entitled to recover up to half of this from the employee.
Similar contribution rates (20%) apply to the Public Service Social Security Fund (PSSSF) scheme, which is a special fund for the employer and employees in the public sector; however, the employer is entitled to recover up to 5% from the employee.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Tanzania.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There are no inheritance, estate, or gift taxes in Tanzania.
## Skills and development levy (SDL)
SDL is a tax on the employer calculated as 3.5% of gross cash emoluments of employees. It is not a tax on the individual but is a cost that needs to be borne in mind when considering the overall cost of employment of employees. It is only applicable to employers who have a minimum of 10 employees.
The following institutions are exempted from SDL: (i) nursery, primary, and secondary schools; (ii) vocational, educational, and training schools; (iii) universities and higher learning institutions; and (iv) religious health institutions.
## Workers compensation fund tariff
Employers are subject to the workers compensation fund tariff. The tariff is payable on a monthly basis and is calculated as a percentage of cash sums paid to employees at 0.5%. Employers are also required to file a monthly return form.
## Property taxes
The property tax rates for valued properties vary depending on the value and location of the property. For unvalued properties, property tax is charged at TZS 18,000 for a normal building and TZS 90,000 per storey for a storey building.
