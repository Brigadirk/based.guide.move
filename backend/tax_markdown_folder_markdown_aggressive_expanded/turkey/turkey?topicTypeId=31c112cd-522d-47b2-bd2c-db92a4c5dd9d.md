## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 02 May 2024
## Taxable period
The Turkish tax year is a calendar year.
## Tax returns
The annual tax return for the year has to be filed by 31 March. No extensions are available.
## Payment of tax
Income tax is withheld every month from salaries paid through a Turkish payroll under the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system.
The tax, when a return is filed for any outstanding liability under the aforementioned principles, is paid in two equal instalments; by the time of filing and in the fourth month thereafter. Non-residents leaving Turkey have to settle full liability within 15 days before departure.
Taxpayers filing income tax returns for their commercial or professional income must pay advance income tax (under the title of 'temporary tax'), calculated as 15% of their cumulative income as of the end of each quarter during the calendar year.
