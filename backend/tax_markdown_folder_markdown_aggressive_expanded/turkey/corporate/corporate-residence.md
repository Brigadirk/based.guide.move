## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 02 May 2024
If both the legal and the business headquarters of a company are located outside Turkey, the company is regarded as a non-resident entity for Turkish tax purposes. If one of these headquarters is located within Turkey, the company is regarded as a resident entity for Turkish tax purposes.
Note that there is no distinction between CIT and VAT registration in Turkey. Therefore, corporations or permanent establishments (PEs) are liable for all taxes (e.g. CIT, VAT, WHT, stamp tax) once they are registered for tax purposes in Turkey.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Unlike the provisions of the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital, there is no minimum period of presence in Turkey before a presence is regarded under the Turkish tax legislation as a PE. In this regard, we believe that the PE evaluation should be made for each case depending on the merits of the case, both from a local legislation perspective and from a treaty (if applicable) perspective.
