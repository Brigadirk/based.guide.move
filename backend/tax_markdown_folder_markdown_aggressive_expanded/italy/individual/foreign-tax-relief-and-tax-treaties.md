## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## Foreign tax relief
In case of double taxation of the same income (between Italy and a foreign country), the individual can claim foreign tax relief for the taxes paid abroad. The relief can be claimed only when the foreign taxes become 'final and settled' by filing the Italian tax return. The foreign tax relief is calculated using a specific formula.
