## New administrative penalties regime
Starting from September 1, 2024, a new regime of administrative penalties has been introduced on tax violations. In general terms, taxpayers should benefit from a reduction of penalties, and self-disclosure procedures are encouraged.
## Enhancement of Tax Control Framework (TCF) and cooperative compliance regime
Additional certainty is granted to taxpayers under the cooperative compliance regime regarding transparency with the tax authorities. In particular:
A certification of the TCF has been introduced to apply for the regime.
Entities that are part of a group can opt for the cooperative compliance regime in case at least a group entity meets the size requirements and the group has implemented a certified TCF.
Subjects not eligible can apply for an optional regime, provided that a certified TCF is in place.
A Code of Conduct is introduced to define and regulate mutual commitments between the tax authorities and taxpayers.
## Tax credits and incentives
The main changes introduced by the 2025 Budget Law in terms of incentives for businesses include:
1. The limitation of the use of the tax credit for investments 4.0 and the simplification and strengthening of the Transition bonus 5.0.
2. Confirmation for 2025 of the tax credit for investments in the single ZES, also for companies operating in the agricultural, fishing and aquaculture sectors.
4. Extension, until 2027, of the tax credit for the listing of SMEs.
