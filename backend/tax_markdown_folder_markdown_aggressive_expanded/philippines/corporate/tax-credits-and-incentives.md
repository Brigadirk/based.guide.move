## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 01 August 2024
## Foreign tax credit
Domestic corporations are allowed to claim a credit for any income taxes paid to a foreign country, provided that the taxes are not claimed as deductions. Foreign corporations are not allowed foreign tax credits.
Credits for foreign taxes are determined on a country-by-country basis. The amount of foreign tax credit in respect of the tax paid in a country shall not exceed the same proportion of the tax against which the tax credit is taken, which the taxpayer’s income from the country bears to its entire taxable income. There is, however, a further limitation based on the total amount of foreign-sourced income that the taxpayer earns. The total amount of foreign tax credits shall not exceed the same proportion of the tax against which the tax credit is taken that the taxpayer’s foreign-sourced income bears to its entire taxable income.
## Incentives under CREATE
Export-oriented enterprises and domestic enterprises engaged in strategic activities as defined under the Strategic Investment Priority Plan (SIPP) have the following incentives under the CREATE Law:
The period of availment shall commence from the actual start of commercial operations, with the registered business enterprise availing of the tax incentives within three years from the date of registration, unless otherwise provided in the SIPP.
Qualified expansion or entirely new project or activity may qualify to avail of incentives, subject to the qualifications in the SIPP and performance review by the Fiscal Incentives Review Board.
Entities that are registered with the investment promotion agencies (IPAs) that are still enjoying incentives prior to the effectivity of the CREATE Law will be allowed to continue the said enjoyment, subject to the following rules:
