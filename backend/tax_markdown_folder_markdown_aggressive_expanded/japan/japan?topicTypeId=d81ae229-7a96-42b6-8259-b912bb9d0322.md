Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Tax treaty network
As of 1 April 2024, Japan has entered into 86 tax conventions applicable to 155 jurisdictions and has also ratified the multilateral instrument (‘MLI’).
Companies making certain payments are required to withhold income taxes using the following rates, based on those treaties.

Notes
6. Tax treaties with many countries provide reduced tax rates, as indicated. Some treaties, however, provide higher tax rates (e.g. Brazil, Thailand), although the rate under domestic law will be the maximum rate. Still other treaties do not provide rates at all (e.g. Egypt). In these instances, rates specified under Japanese domestic tax laws apply.
7. The tax treaty was concluded mainly for the purpose of information exchange.
8. The tax treaties with Brazil and Thailand provide 25% tax rates for certain income. However, the WHT rate cannot exceed 20.42% (including the income surtax of 2.1%) on any income to be received by a non-resident taxpayer of Japan under Japanese income tax law.
9. The treaty with the former Czechoslovakia is applied to the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. It stipulates that cultural royalties are tax exempt.
10. The treaty with the former USSR is applied to Armenia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan.
11. Tax treaties with many countries provide reduced rates where the recipients of interest are government organisations and financial institutions.
