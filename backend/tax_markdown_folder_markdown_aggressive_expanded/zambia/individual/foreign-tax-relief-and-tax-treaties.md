## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
## Foreign tax relief
Foreign tax suffered on income of an individual may be eligible for foreign tax relief either under a double tax treaty (DTT) with Zambia or as unilateral relief available under domestic law. The credit is restricted to the lower of the amount of foreign tax actually suffered and the Zambian income tax that would have applied on the foreign income as a percentage of total income.

Zambia has in-force DTTs with the following countries:
| Botswana | Ireland (6) | South Africa (1) |
