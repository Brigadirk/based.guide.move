## National Health Insurance contributions

## Consumption taxes
Value-added tax (VAT) applies to standard rated supplies of goods and services at 16%.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
Zambia does not have a net wealth/net worth tax.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Zambia does not have an inheritance, estate, or gift tax.
## Property taxes
Zambia does not have any other property tax other than Property Transfer Tax (PTT) (*see below*).
## Property transfer tax (PTT)
PTT applies on the transfer of land situated in Zambia; intellectual property (IP) right; a mining right or an interest in the mining right; mineral processing licences and other mining-related licences; and the transfer of shares issued by a company incorporated in Zambia, including on the indirect transfer by a non-resident company that indirectly holds at least 10% of the shareholding of a company incorporated in Zambia.
Effective from 1 January 2023, the following PTT rates apply:
| Description | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Land (including buildings) | 5 |
| Shares (including an interest in a mining right)\* | 5 |
| Interest in a mineral processing licence | 5 |
| Mining licence/right | 10 |
| Mineral processing licence | 10 |
| Mining right for an exploration licence | 5 |
| IP | 5 |
The PTT liability is generally payable by the vendor. However, where the vendor/transferor is not available, a person, other than the transferor of the property, shall file a provisional tax return on behalf of the transferor where that person has been allowed to do so by a court order or has been appointed as a proxy for the registrar of court who has been authorised to render the provisional return. This will only apply under the following conditions:
## Luxury and excise taxes
Certain products, such as alcoholic drinks and cigarettes, are subject to excise duty.
## Turnover taxes
Turnover tax applies to certain businesses where the turnover is more than ZMW 12,000 but not more than ZMW 800,000 *per annum*. A flat rate of 4% on business turnover will be applied where turnover is between ZMW 12,000 and ZMW 800,000 *per annum*. Income that is subject to turnover tax will not be subject to income tax or VAT.
The definition of 'turnover' for turnover tax purposes excludes interest, dividends, and royalties.
## Local non-income taxes
