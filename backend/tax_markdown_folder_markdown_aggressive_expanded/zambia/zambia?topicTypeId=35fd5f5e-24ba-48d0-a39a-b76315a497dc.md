## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
Under the Income Tax Act, Zambia has a source-based system for the taxation of income. Income deemed to be from a Zambian source is generally subject to Zambian income tax. Zambian residents are also subject to income tax on interest and dividends from a source outside Zambia.
## Personal income tax rates
The rates of income tax applicable to an individual for the 2024 charge year are as follows:
| Annual taxable income (ZMW) | Rate of income tax (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Up to 61,200 | 0 |
| 61,201 to 85,200 | 20 |
| 85,201 to 110,400 | 30 |
| Over 110,400 | 37 |
In principle, the same rates apply to both Zambian and non-Zambian residents. In practice, the only mechanism for income of non-Zambian residents to be subject to income tax at these rates would be on Zambian-source emoluments from an employment or office under Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE). Other Zambian-source income of non-Zambian residents could be subject to withholding tax (WHT).
