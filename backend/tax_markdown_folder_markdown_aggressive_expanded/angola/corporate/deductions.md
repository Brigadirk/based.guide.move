## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
## Depreciation
Depreciation should be computed using the straight-line method; any other method must be approved by the tax authorities.
The tax depreciation rates should respect the limits imposed by Presidential Decree No. 207/15, of 5 November 2015, and Decree No. 755/72, of 26 October 1972, altered by Decree No. 57/74, of 24 January 1974.
The table below summarises some examples of the depreciation tax rates.
| Type of asset | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Office buildings | 4 |
| Industrial buildings | 4 |
| Computers | 33.33 |
| Furniture | Between 12.5 and 25 |
| Software | 20 |
| Light passenger vehicles | 25 |
An intensive operating regime is foreseen allowing accelerated depreciation. The depreciation rate can be increased by 25% in the case of production on two shifts and by 50% in the case of continuous production.
## Goodwill
Amortisation of goodwill is not deductible for CIT purposes.
## Interest expenses
Interest costs are generally deductible for CIT purposes. Interest arising from shareholder loans may be deductible for tax purposes up to the limit that would result from the annual average interest rate established by the Angolan Central Bank.
## Bad debt
## Provisions
The following provisions are accepted as tax deductible:
In relation to doubtful debts, the regime:
In relation to the losses incurred with inventories, the regime:
## Charitable contributions
Donations are only deductible for CIT purposes if fully compliant with the Patronage Law. The requirements imposed by this law are very restrictive.
The donations granted outside the scope of Patronage Law are also subject to autonomous taxation at a rate of 15%.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are not deductible costs for tax purposes.
## Taxes
Certain taxes are non-deductible for CIT purposes, namely the CIT itself, PIT, IIT, property tax, or taxes paid on behalf of third parties (e.g. PIT borne on behalf of the employees).
## Autonomous taxation
Confidential expenses are subject to autonomous taxation at rates of 30% and 50%. The donations granted outside the scope of Patronage Law are also subject to autonomous taxation at a rate of 15%.
The amount of autonomous taxation should be added to the taxable income in the case of donations and added to the tax due in the case of confidential expenses.
## Net operating losses
Tax losses can be carried forward for five years.
Carryback of losses is not allowed.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments to foreign affiliates are accepted for tax purposes, although the arm’s-length principle should be complied with.
