## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
## Foreign tax relief
If a DTT does not apply, Hungarian residents are also taxed on foreign-source employment income, but credit is given for foreign taxes paid. The credit may neither exceed 90% of the foreign tax paid abroad nor the Hungarian PIT calculated with the Hungarian tax rate on the foreign income.
Individuals have to make quarterly tax advance payments calculated on the gross income they receive from abroad if they become subject to taxation in Hungary (e.g. they perform their activities in Hungary).
In the case of income from investments or the sale of property, if the income is foreign sourced, the foreign tax may be fully deducted from the Hungarian tax burden; however, at least 5% Hungarian tax needs to be paid in the absence of a DTT. Where DTTs apply, they usually provide an exemption, rather than credit, for foreign taxes. In the cases of dividend, the DTTs usually apply the credit method.
