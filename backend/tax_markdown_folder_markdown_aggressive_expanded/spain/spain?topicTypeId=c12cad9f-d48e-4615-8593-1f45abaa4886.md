## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
The general CIT rate in Spain is 25%. Other tax rates may apply, depending on the type of company that is taxed and its type of business.
Resident companies are taxed on their worldwide income.
For permanent establishments (PEs) in Spain of foreign companies, non-resident income tax (NRIT) is chargeable on income that may be allocated to the PE at a 25% tax rate.
## Small and medium size entities (SMEs) and micro-enterprises companies
With effect for tax periods starting on or after 1 January 2025, a reduction in the tax rate applicable to SMEs (*see Special tax regimes in the [Tax credits and incentives](spain/corporate/tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section*) and to micro-enterprises (those with a net turnover in the previous tax period of less than EUR 1 million) is envisaged, although its implementation is expected to be carried out progressively over a period of three years for micro-enterprises and five years for SMEs.
In addition, in the case of micro-enterprises, the tax rate is broken down into two brackets, with a lower rate being levied on the taxable income up to EUR 50,000, when the tax period is one year, or up to the corresponding proportional amount, when the tax period is shorter. Specifically, the tax rates would be as follows:
| New taxable rates applicable to SMEs and micro-enterprises | | Tax periods starting in | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | **2028 and beyond** |
| Micro-enterprises | Taxable income up to EUR 50,000 | 21% | 19% | 17% |  |
| Excess | 22% | 21% | 20% |  |
| SMEs | | 24% | 23% | 22% | 21% |
The above reduced rates will not apply to entities that are considered equity companies.
For corporate groups, the turnover of all group companies must be considered for this purpose. Special rules apply for the first tax period in which an economic activity is carried out or short tax periods.
Tax-protected cooperative entities will be taxed at the tax rates resulting from reducing the previous tax rates by three percentage points, provided that the resulting rate does not exceed 20%, except for non-cooperative results.
## Newly created companies
Newly created companies are taxed at a 15% tax rate for both the first tax period in which they obtain a profit and the following tax period. This tax rate is not applicable to equity companies (i.e. companies that do not carry on business activity) or to newly created companies that are part of a national or international group.
The reduced rate may also be inapplicable if the company's business activity was previously carried on by a related company or individual.
## Start-up companies
Companies that meet the requirements set forth by the law to qualify as start-ups may apply a 15% tax rate in the first tax period in which the company obtains positive taxable income and in the following three periods, contingent upon maintaining the conditions to qualify as a start-up.
For these purposes, a company will be considered a start-up if the following requirements are met:
When the company belongs to a business group, the group or each member company of the group must meet the above requirements.
Companies that meet the requirements to qualify as start-ups are not entitled to the application of the reduced tax rate when:
## Minimum CIT rule
A minimum taxation rule will apply to those CIT payers whose net turnover in the 12 months prior to the date in which the tax period begins has been of at least EUR 20 million and for taxpayers who are taxed under the special tax consolidation regime for CIT purposes, regardless of its net turnover amount.
According to this rule, the above-mentioned taxpayers’ CIT net tax due (defined as tax due after applying tax reliefs and deductions) may not be less than the result of applying 15% to the taxable income reduced or increased due to the additions/decreases related to the reserve for the levelling-off tax losses (eligible by small-size entities) and reduced by the special investment reserve of the special economic and tax regime of the Canary Islands.
This measure will have effects for tax periods starting as of 1 January 2022.
The minimum taxation rule will not be applicable to taxpayers taxed under 10%, 1%, or 0% CIT rates nor to listed companies that make investments in the real estate market (called SOCIMIs in Spain).
The following entities have a special minimum tax rate:
The following rules must be considered while calculating the minimum tax rate:
The minimum CIT rule will also apply to NRIT payers that act through a PE in Spain.
## Global minimum tax
On 21 December 2024, Law 7/2024 of 20 December 2024, was published in the Official State Gazette (BOE), which, among other things, transposes Council Directive (EU) 2022/2523 in Spain. This Directive and, therefore, the Spanish Law aims to ensure an overall minimum level of taxation for multinational groups and large-scale domestic groups, i.e. it implements the so-called Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two.
Generally, for the purposes of calculating the effective tax rate obtained within a given jurisdiction, the following formula needs to be considered:
Effective tax rate = Adjusted covered taxes of the constituent entities in the jurisdiction / net qualifying income of the constituent entities in the jurisdiction
To this end, both the adjusted covered taxes and the qualifying income of the relevant entities need to be calculated following the relevant adjustments provided in Law 7/2024.
### Safe Harbours
The Spanish Law provides for the application of Transitional Safe Harbour, in line with OECD Transitional Country-by-Country Safe Harbour, applicable to fiscal years beginning no later than 31 December 2026.
Further, Spanish law provides for the application of the QDMTT Safe Harbour and other safe harbours to be developed by the OECD.
## Business and professional activities tax
The business and professional activities tax is a local direct tax levied annually on the performance in Spain of business, professional, or artistic activities, whether or not they are carried out on particular premises. The tax payable depends on different factors, such as the type of activity carried on and the location and size of the premises where the activity is carried on. As regards limits, the tax may not exceed 15% of the presumed average profits of the business/professional activity.
CIT payers and non-resident companies carrying on an activity in Spain through a PE are exempt from this tax if their net turnover for the tax year of the last CIT/NRIT return filed prior to the date of accrual of the local tax (1 January) was less than EUR 1 million.
