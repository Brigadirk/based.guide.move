# Spain
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
A company is resident in Spain and subject to CIT on its worldwide income when:
Under Spanish law, a company’s ‘effective’ head office is in Spain when its business activities are managed and controlled from Spain.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Taxpayers operating in Spain through a PE are subject to NRIT.
Most Spanish tax treaties for the avoidance of double taxation contain a definition of PE in line with OECD criteria.
In the absence of a double tax treaty (DTT), domestic law states that companies or individuals are considered to operate through a PE when, by any legal means, they have continuous or habitual work facilities in Spain or a place to do any kind of work where they perform all or part of their activities, or when they act in Spain through an agent with powers to enter into an agreement in the name and on behalf of the non-resident company/individual, provided that these powers are exercised on a regular basis.
In particular, a PE includes management offices, branches, offices, factories, workshops, warehouses, shops or other establishments; mines, oil or gas wells, quarries, farms, forestry facilities, livestock farms, or any other site where natural resources are collected; and construction, installation, or assembly sites whose duration lasts more than six months.
The main difference between the Spanish rules and the DTT rules is that the Spanish rules do not contain exceptions to the definition of PE where the activities carried out are of a preparatory or auxiliary character.
The Spanish High Court has issued several judgements on the question of PEs where it has adopted a functional approach to the subject of the existence of a PE. In this regard, it has afforded a flexible interpretation of what should be considered a PE, and specifically, of the concepts of dependent agent and fixed place of business.
