## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
Over the past year, the following significant reforms have been made to Spanish law on direct taxation of individuals:
## Royal Decree-Law 10/2024
Royal Decree-Law 10/2024, passed on  23 December 2024, establishing a temporary energy tax in 2025, was published in the Spanish Official Gazette on  24 December.
The Royal Decree-Law was not ratified by Parliament, and its repeal was agreed during its sitting of 22 January 2025.
## Royal Decree-Law 9/2024
Royal Decree-Law 9/2024, adopting urgent measures in economic, tax, transport and social security matters and extending certain measures to address situations of social vulnerability, was approved on 23 December 2024 and published in the Spanish Official Gazette on 24 December.
The Royal Decree-Law was not ratified by Parliament and its repeal was agreed during its sitting of 22 January  2025,.
## Act 7/2024
Act 7/2024, of 20  December  2024, that amends some of the Personal Income Tax Act provisions, bringing in measures to mitigate the economic consequences of the DANA flood in the Autonomous Region of Valencia, and other measures to increase revenue collection, such as, an increase in the savings tax rate.
The most important measures contained in this legislation that affect individual taxation are:
## Organic Law 1/2025
Organic Law 1/2025, of 2 January, introduces measures to the Justice System for efficiency purposes. Since it establishes  mandatory mediation (or an alternative method to resolve disputes) before the filing of a lawsuit, within civil, commercial and social processes, the Law adapts the tax exemption on compensation received as a result of civil liability for personal damages, regulated in the Personal Income Tax Law, which was applicable only when it was established by a judgement.
As a consequence of this measure, the law provides that it will also be applicable when the compensation is agreed through alternative dispute resolution methods and  payment is made by the insurance company.
## Royal Decree-Law 4/2024
Royal Decree-Law 4/2024, which extends certain measures to address the economic and social consequences of the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and by which urgent tax, energy, and social measures are adopted, was passed on 26 June 2024 and published in the Spanish Official Gazette on 27 June 2024. The main tax measures included that affect individuals’ taxation are the following:
The corporate income tax (CIT) free depreciation incentive provided for investments in new vehicles and new charging infrastructures for electric vehicles used for business purposes that come into operation in the tax periods starting in 2024 will also be applicable to PIT payers that carry out the economic activities in which the vehicles and charging infrastructures are used. When such vehicles or charging infrastructures are transferred, the tax depreciation that exceeds that which would have been applicable had the free depreciation incentive not been applied will not reduce the acquisition value for the purposes of calculating the capital gain or loss arising from such transfer. This excess will be considered business income obtained in the tax period in which the assets are transferred.
## Royal Decree 142/2024
Royal Decree 142/2024, dated 6 February 2024, amends the Regulation of Personal Income Tax, approved by Royal Decree 439/2007, dated 30 March 2007, regarding withholdings and payments on account.
To prevent workers receiving the minimum interprofessional wage from being subject to withholdings or payments on account, paragraph 1 of Article 81 of the Personal Income Tax Regulation is amended, indicating the new amounts of employment income to which withholdings and payments on account are applied, based on the number of children and other dependants and the taxpayer's situation.
The Royal Decree raises the minimum amount to apply withholdings from EUR 15,000 to EUR 15,876, which will allow those who earn the minimum wage in 2024 to not have PIT withholdings applied to their payroll.
This modification aims to exempt the minimum interprofessional wage from withholdings; in addition, salaries close to the minimum interprofessional wage will also see a reduction in the applicable withholding.
