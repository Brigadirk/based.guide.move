## Social security contributions
The government is encouraging all enterprises (including individuals) to register (including their employees) in the Social Security Scheme.
Both the employer and employee must contribute to the social security fund. The social security contributions are as follows:
Social security contributions are paid at the same time as the PIT based on gross remuneration and are deductible when calculating PIT. Although the rate of the social security contribution is 6% and 5.5%, respectively, the total base amount to be calculated is capped at LAK 4.5 million.
Expatriates who work in Lao PDR for more than 12 months are required to be registered in the social security scheme in Lao PDR.

## Gift taxes
Gifts with a value of less than LAK 1.3 million are exempt from gift tax. The rate is 5% if the value is over than LAK 1.3 million.
## Property taxes
