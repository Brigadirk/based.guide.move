## Employment income
Taxable compensation includes everything that is either directly or indirectly connected with the work and/or assignment remuneration package, including salary, premiums, bonuses, allowances of any kind, tax reimbursements, club dues, and company-owned cars.
## Equity compensation
The income tax on stock options is due by individual residents in Brazil on the positive spread between the grant price and the fair market value at the time of exercise as well as upon the sale of the shares, where the sale results in a capital gain. Further implications must be observed in case the costs are recharged to the Brazilian entity.
## Business income
