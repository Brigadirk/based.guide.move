## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
Chile taxes its individuals resident or domiciled in Chile on worldwide income. Foreigners working in Chile are subject to taxation only on their Chilean-source income during the first three years in Chile, after which worldwide income is taxed.

### Non-resident flat tax
Before residence is acquired, a flat 15% tax generally is levied if the activities can be qualified as technical or engineering work or professional services that an individual renders through a report, advice, or plan development. In the case of other activities, or where the paying company is located in a tax haven, other rates would apply.
## Local income taxes
There are no local income taxes to be paid in Chile, only central government taxes.
