# Egypt
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Inventory valuation
Egyptian generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) should be applied to inventory valuation, and all methods that are acceptable by Egyptian GAAP can be used. The methods acceptable are almost the same as those acceptable under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
## Capital gains
The law defines capital gains as the difference between the acquisition cost and the fair market value/selling price of the share. However, for listed shares acquired before 1 July 2014 and sold after that date, the capital gain will be calculated as the difference between either the acquisition price or the closing price on 30 June 2014 (whichever is higher) and the selling price.
### CGT treatment applicable to resident companies
### Capital gains tax treatment applicable to non-resident companies
### Capital losses
A capital loss can be offset against a capital gain arising during the same tax year, provided that they both arise from the sale of shares (i.e. gain and loss of listed shares are in a separate pool from the gain and loss of unlisted shares, so the loss from the sale of listed shares can only be offset against the gain from the listed shares and cannot be offset from the gain of unlisted ones). Excess capital losses that are not utilised during a tax year can be carried forward for a period of three years and should be offset against capital gains from the sale of shares.
### Law No. 30 updates: CGT additional incentives
Shares offering (IPO)/additional share tranches incentives:
EGX trading incentives:
## Dividend income
### Dividend income treatment applicable to resident companies
A 10% WHT will be imposed on dividends paid by Egyptian companies unlisted on the EGX to resident corporate shareholders. The 10% WHT will be reduced to 5% if the dividends are paid by Egyptian companies listed on the EGX.
Dividends received by resident companies from other resident companies should not be added to taxable income, provided that the related/associated costs are not deductible from the recipient companies' taxable profit (only 10% of the dividends received should be added to the taxable pool subject to CIT at the rate of 22.5%), provided that the company receiving the dividends holds more than 25% of the shares or the voting rights of the subsidiary company and holds or is committed to hold those shares for at least two years.
### Dividend income treatment applicable to non-resident companies
A 10% WHT will be imposed on dividends paid by Egyptian companies unlisted on the EGX to non-resident corporate shareholders. The 10% WHT will be reduced to 5% if the dividends are paid by Egyptian companies listed on the EGX.
Participation exemption
90% of the dividends distributed by a non-resident corporate shareholder to a resident one will be exempt from tax (i.e. only 10% of the amount of the dividends will be subject to tax). Such exemption can be benefited from if both of the following conditions are met:
### Permanent establishments (PEs)
A PE's profits should be deemed dividend payments, and thus subject to the above treatment, if they were not repatriated to the parent company within 60 days of the PE's financial year-end.
### Stock dividends
Stock dividends are not subject to tax in Egypt.
### Tax leakage on dividends distribution (as per the new amendments under Law No. 30).
For the purpose of reducing the tax leakage related to dividends distributed through a multi-layered structure in Egypt, the new amendments eliminate/reduce double taxation on dividends.
Certain eligibility conditions are provided for WHT deduction, including:
## Interest income
Interest expenses are deducted from interest income when calculating the interest income to be included in taxable income, provided certain conditions are met.
Generally, interest income is not taxed separately; it is considered as part of the company's income and taxed accordingly (i.e. at the 22.5% CIT rate).
## Rent/royalty income
Rent/royalty income are not taxed separately; they are considered as part of the company's income and taxed accordingly (i.e. at the 22.5% CIT rate).
## Foreign income
Income from any source, domestic or foreign, received by a corporation within Egypt is subject to CIT. The scope of tax covers the activities carried out inside and outside Egypt, which are administered or managed within Egypt.
There is no provision for deferring income earned abroad.
