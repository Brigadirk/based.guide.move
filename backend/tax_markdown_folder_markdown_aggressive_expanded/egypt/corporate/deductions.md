## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
In order for expenses to be acceptable for tax deduction, such expenses must be:
## Depreciation and amortisation
The tax law set the depreciation and amortisation rates for tax purposes to the following:
### Accelerated depreciation
A company may have the option to deduct 30% accelerated depreciation from the value of the machines and equipment used in industries during the first fiscal year of their employment. This should be done by submitting a request to the tax authority prior to deducting the 30% accelerated depreciation.
## Goodwill
According to Article 25 of the Egyptian Income Tax Law, goodwill is amortised at the rate of 10% using the straight-line method.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses are tax deductible, and the whole amount can be amortised for the first year.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are deductible for tax purposes after offsetting any tax-exempt interest income.
Interest expense deductions are only allowed if the following conditions are fully met:
## Bad debt
According to Article 28 of the Egyptian Income Tax Law, deduction of bad debts shall be allowed, subject to submitting a report from the external auditor indicating the fulfilment of the following conditions:
## Charitable contributions
Donations to the government are tax deductible. Donations to Egyptian charities are also deductible, but only up to 10% of taxable income.
## Fines and penalties
Financial fines and penalties paid by the taxpayer because they or one of their subordinates has committed a deliberate felony or misdemeanour are not deductible.
## Taxes
Income tax payable according to the Income Tax Law is not deductible.
## Other significant items
The following other items are not deductible:
## Net operating losses
A company may carry losses forward for a period not to exceed five years. Nevertheless, if a change occurs in the ownership of its capital exceeding 50% of the shares, stocks, or the voting rights, if the company is either a joint-stock company or a company limited by shares whose shares are not listed on the Egyptian Stock of Exchange, and if the company changes its activity, the company cannot carry the losses forward.
In general, companies cannot carry losses back, except for contracting companies (i.e. in case of long-term projects), which are allowed a loss carryback for an unlimited period of time (to the extent of the duration of the contract).
## Payments to head office
A branch may deduct head-office charges of up to 10% of its taxable income. Moreover, the branch or subsidiary should withhold taxes before the payment of interest, royalties, and service fees to non-resident foreign corporations or affiliates.
