# Egypt
## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Law No. 30
Generally, the new Law No. 30 is designed with the aim of boosting the economy and streamlining the taxation of various items of income.
These modifications will be effective starting 16 June 2023 and are expected to be followed by the executive regulations from the Ministry of Finance in the coming months.
## Post COVID-19 updates
Post the COVID-19 pandemic, updates/changes have been announced by the Egyptian government to several articles in the Egyptian income tax law derived with the intention to stimulate the economy.
Such changes mainly cover the withholding tax (WHT) imposed on the dividend distributions made by an Egyptian company, capital gains tax (CGT) realised upon disposing of Egyptian listed shares on the Egyptian Exchange (EGX), along with the stamp tax imposed, as explained below.
In addition, a decree has been published abolishing the 20% stamp tax that has been imposed on advertisements and adding a 14% value-added tax (VAT) instead.
## E-invoicing system in Egypt
As part of the digital transformation for the tax government practice in Egypt and following the introduction of the e-filling mechanism, the Ministry of Finance has released Decree no. 188 of 2020 for introducing the new e-invoicing system.
In July 2021, Ministerial Decree no. 1206 of 2021 was issued obligating all governmental bodies not to accept any paper invoices from any of their suppliers as of 1 October 2021. Therefore, any company dealing with any governmental body must apply the e-invoicing system before that date.
As of 1 April 2023, paper invoices will not be considered in proving costs or expenses when submitting tax returns for income tax, as well as when deducting or refunding VAT, and only electronic invoices will be considered.
Electronic invoices are to be applicable starting July 2023, and electronic receipts starting January 2025.
## Dividends distributed by a listed Egyptian company
## Dividends distributed by a non-listed Egyptian company
## Dividends distributed between resident entities
## CGT imposed on the gains realised from the disposal of shares/securities listed on the EGX
If the shares were offered on the EGX for the first time (IPO):
In case additional tranches were offered after the issuance date of the newly amended tax law (i.e. 15 June 2023), 25% of the realised capital gains shall not be subject to tax upon fulfilment of certain conditions.
EGX trading incentives:
## Stamp tax imposed on the proceeds realised upon disposing of shares/securities listed on the EGX
## Stamp tax imposed on the proceeds realised upon disposing of unlisted shares/securities
## Returns received from funds
The newly amended tax law treatment of the gains/returns received from eligible funds by juridical persons will be subject to a flat tax rate as follows:
The relevant investment cost related to the aforementioned gains and returns will be considered non-deductible expenses.
The executive regulations of this law shall determine the calculation methodology of the relevant costs.
This is to be applicable for financial years (FYs) ending after 15 June 2023.
