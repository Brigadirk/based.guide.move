## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
A foreign company may trade through a Slovak branch, which must be registered in the Slovak Commercial Register. The taxable income of the branch must not be lower than that which an independent entity (e.g. a Slovak company) would achieve from carrying out similar activities under similar conditions. If the branch’s taxable income cannot be assessed based on its income less costs, as adjusted for tax purposes, certain other methods may be used. A taxpayer may ask the tax authorities in writing to approve such a method.
