# Slovak Republic
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
A company is a tax resident in the Slovak Republic if it:
## Permanent establishment (PE)
A PE is created if:
The conditions for creating a PE may be regulated in more detail by a DTT.
A PE need not be entered in the Slovak Commercial Register, but a foreign entrepreneur with a Slovak PE is taxable in Slovakia. A foreign entrepreneur with a Slovak PE has the same tax registration, filing, payment, and tax advance payment obligations as a Slovak company. The tax base of a PE may not be less than one that which would have been achieved if similar activities under similar conditions were performed as an independent entity (e.g. a Slovak company).
