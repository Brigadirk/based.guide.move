## Investment incentives
Tax incentives can be granted to new investors, subject to the application of a specific request with the Algerian Agency for Investment Promotion (AAPI). The tax incentives can be granted for the investment phase and for the exploitation phase. They can be granted for a period of three years or ten years, depending on the kind and the size of the business.
Other incentives can be granted for start-up businesses under CIT, TPA, customs duties, and VAT to encourage youth investment.
Many tax regimes and tax holidays/incentives are available to attract foreign direct investors in Algeria. For example, there is a temporary exemption from CIT of ten years for investing companies in specific zones or those creating 500 jobs or more. VAT and custom duties exemptions are also available during the investment phase.
There is also a ten-years temporary exemption from CIT for companies making decisive investment that have potential for creating jobs and wealth.
There is a five-year reduction of CIT for companies whose securities are introduced on the stock exchange.
## Foreign tax credit
Algerian tax law does not provide for unilateral tax relief. A DTT, however, may provide for bilateral relief.
