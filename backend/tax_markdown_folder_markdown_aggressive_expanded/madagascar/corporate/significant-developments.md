## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
## Reform of the General Tax Code introduced in the 2023 Financial Law
The reform consists of the extraction of procedural tax provisions from the General Tax Code. From January 2023, the General Tax Code is split into:
## New tax from 2025: Mobile transaction tax
From 2025, any operation related to the use of electronic money is subject to Mobile transaction tax at a rate of 5% of the transaction fees excluding tax.
## VAT credit deferral limited to 3 years
From 2025, VAT credit can be carried forward over 3 years, instead of indefinitely previously
## Tax audit process
From 2025, some modifications have been made in respect of tax audit process, mainly concerning concerning response timing and the request for deferral of payment in the event of a contentious claim.
