# Madagascar
## Overview
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
Madagascar is an island nation along the southeast coast of Africa. Formerly an independent kingdom, it became a French colony in 1896 but regained independence in 1960. Madagascar is a constitutional democracy divided into 23 regions, with Antananarivo as the capital. Malagasy and French are the official languages of Madagascar, and the currency is the Malagasy ariary (MGA).
After discarding socialist economic policies in the mid-1990s, Madagascar has followed a World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) led policy of privatisation and liberalisation. This strategy placed the country on a slow and steady growth path. Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, is a mainstay of the economy, accounting for more than one-fourth of gross domestic product (GDP) and employing 80% of the population.
