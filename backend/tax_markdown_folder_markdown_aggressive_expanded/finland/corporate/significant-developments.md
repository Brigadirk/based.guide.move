## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
Significant changes to transfer taxation entered into force in the beginning of 2024. Among other changes, all transfer tax rates were reduced as of 1 January 2024. These new rates were applied retroactively to acquisitions made on or after 12 October 2023. In addition, upon distribution of shares as a dividend in kind, from January 2025 onwards, the distributing company is liable for tax (instead of the shareholders).
The employing corporate taxpayer’s training deduction will no longer be available as of tax year 2025. The deduction may be made from the tax year 2024.
Please find more information on the following pages of this tax summary.
