## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
## Employment expenses
Expenses incurred in acquiring or maintaining taxable income are, in principle, deductible items.
If the employer does not reimburse for increased living expenses due to business trips, a deduction from earned income may be available. The amount of deduction shall be based either on actual expenses or a fixed amount determined annually in the tax authorities’ guidelines. Also, travelling and accommodation expenses due to business trips may be deducted if not reimbursed by the employer.
A standard deduction of EUR 750 from salary income is granted if actual business expenses are below that amount.
## Personal deductions
### Pension premiums
Mandatory pension premiums are fully deductible from earned income for both national and municipal tax purposes.
The deductibility of voluntary pension contributions is limited, and they are deducted from capital income (maximum deduction of EUR 5,000).
Other savings in certain long-term investments (e.g. a long-term savings contract with a bank, investment fund company, or other investment service company) are also entitled to the same deduction as the contributions to voluntary pension insurances.
### Unemployment insurance premiums
Mandatory unemployment insurance premiums are deductible from earned income for both national and municipal tax purposes.
### Interest expenses
Interest paid related to investment loans are deductible from capital income. If the deductions related to capital income exceed the amount of capital income, the end result is a capital income deficit of which 30% can be deducted from income taxes on earned income up to certain limit.
### Household expenses
The following temporary changes concern the tax year 2025:
The deduction for expenses related to the move from oil heating to more sustainable energy sources will be increased as follows:
The deduction concerning other renovating costs remains the same as before (i.e. the maximum deduction is EUR 1,600 [EUR 150 credit threshold], 35% of the work-related expenses paid to a company, and 13% of the wages if household is the employer of the individual performing the work).
### Accommodation costs
### Donation deduction
Individuals and death estates are allowed to deduct cash donations of a minimum of EUR 850 and a maximum of EUR 500,000 from earned income if the purpose of the donation is development of science or art. The requirement for deduction is that the donation is made to a university with public financing that is located in the European Economic Area or to a related university fund. The purpose of this change is to advance private finance of universities.
