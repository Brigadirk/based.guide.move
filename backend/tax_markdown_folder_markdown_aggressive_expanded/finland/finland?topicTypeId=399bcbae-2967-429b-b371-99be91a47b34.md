# Finland
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
## Customs duties
Goods imported into Finland from outside the European Union need to be customs cleared and might be subject to customs duties. The rates of customs duties are determined at the EU level.
### Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)
The CBAM is also applicable for imports into Finland. The CBAM entered into force in its transitional phase as of 1 October 2023. It initially applies to imports into the European Union of certain goods and selected precursors whose production is carbon intensive and at most significant risk of carbon leakage. These goods are cement, iron and steel, aluminium, fertilisers, electricity, and hydrogen.
The CBAM will be fully implemented as of 1 January 2026, and importers will need to declare each year the quantity of goods imported into the European Union in the preceding year and their embedded greenhouse gases (GHGs). Importers will then surrender the corresponding number of CBAM certificates. The price of the certificates will be calculated depending on the weekly average auction price of EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) allowances expressed in EUR/tonne of CO2 emitted.
## Excise duties
Product specific excise duties are levied on tobacco and alcohol products, certain fuels, electricity, soft drinks, and beverage packaging.
Finland has several excise tax exemptions and reliefs in place for energy and alcohol used in e.g. manufacturing and datacentres. Finland levies excise tax on electricity at the EU minimum level of 0.063 cents/kWh.
The Finnish tax authority has digitalised nearly all excise tax administration procedures, and handling times are among the shortest within the European Union.
## Real estate tax
Municipalities impose an annual real estate tax. The tax is levied on the taxable value of buildings and land. The municipal council determines the applicable tax rates, although the minimum and maximum tax rates are set by tax legislation. The tax is deductible from taxable business income or agricultural income if the real estate is used for business or agricultural purposes. The tax is deductible from taxable income of the so-called 'other-source income' if the real estate is used to acquire other taxable income than business income.
## Transfer tax
Amendments to the Act on transfer taxation entered into force on January 2024 and 2025 onwards. The first amendment reduced applicable transfer tax rates, and the second amendment made the companies distributing dividends liable for transfer tax if the company distributes dividends as shares or other securities.
Generally, the transfer tax is payable by the transferee. However, dividend distributing company is liable to file a transfer tax return and pay the tax on dividends available to be drawn as shares or other securities on or after 1st of January 2025. If the decision to distribute dividends does not specify the date on which the dividends become available to be drawn, the company is liable for transfer tax if the decision is made on or after 1 January 2025. The company can file the transfer tax return on dividends distributed as securities in the online portal of the Finnish tax authorities
A transfer tax of 3% of the sales price is payable on transfer of real estate located in Finland. A transfer of shares in Finnish companies and other domestic securities is subject to a transfer tax of 1.5%. A transfer of shares in Finnish housing companies and real estate companies is subject to a transfer tax of 1.5%.
A transfer tax of 1.5%  is payable on a transfer of shares in a foreign company whose activities consist mainly of owning or holding (directly or indirectly) real estates in Finland, provided that either the transferor or the transferee is a resident of Finland or, alternatively, a Finnish branch of a foreign credit institution, a Finnish branch of a foreign investment firm, or a Finnish branch of a foreign fund management company.
Transfer tax is calculated as a certain percentage of the sales price and potential other consideration. The consideration includes payments made by the transferee to other parties than the transferor as well as obligations assumed by the transferee towards the transferor or another party, provided that such payment or obligation accrues to the benefit of the transferor. If the transferee acquires shareholder loans from the transferor in connection with the share acquisition, the amount of shareholder loans is included in the transfer tax base as of 2024 onwards. In case of transfer of shares in a real estate company, additional provisions concerning transfer tax base are applicable.
No transfer tax is payable on the transfer of securities that are subject to trading on a regulated market or multilateral trading facility in the European Economic Area (EEA). Similarly, no transfer tax is payable if both the seller and the transferee are non-residents. Transfer tax is, however, always payable on transfers between non-residents if the transferred shares are shares in a Finnish housing or real estate company.
## Stamp tax
No stamp taxes are levied in Finland.
## Payroll taxes
The employer has a liability to withhold income taxes on remuneration subject to tax in Finland, including cash remuneration and non-cash benefits based on their taxable value. The taxes can, however, be withheld only on cash compensation, and the maximum income tax withholding liability equals the amount of cash remuneration.
## Social security contributions
According to the Finnish social security legislation, both Finnish and foreign employers have a liability to pay several social security payments in Finland in cases where an employee performs one's tasks partly or wholly in Finland. The liability concerns all employers, regardless of the form of the company and whether the foreign company has a PE in Finland. The percentage rates for the employer’s (and employee’s) social security contributions are revised on an annual basis.
