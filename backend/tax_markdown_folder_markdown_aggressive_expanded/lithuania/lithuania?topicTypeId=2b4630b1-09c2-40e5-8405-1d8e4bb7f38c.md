## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
## Social security contributions
The following income is subject to social security and health insurance contributions (only the main types of income are commented):
Individuals are also able to choose to additionally contribute for pension to the second-tier pension fund. Not contributing individuals under 40 years old as at 1 January of the respective year who are included in the register of insured individuals on 2 January of the same year are automatically involved in the participation in such pension accumulation system (such involvement will be performed every three years); however, they are allowed to choose whether to participate or not. Individuals over 40 years old are able to choose such a participation voluntarily.
Individuals who did not historically participate in this pension accumulation system are able to start contributing 3% in 2024. The state respectively adds the contribution of 1.5% on the state average remuneration amount.
There is also an option to pay higher contributions (above 3%) either by individuals themselves or their employers. Such expenses are PIT deductible for individuals and corporate income tax (CIT) deductible for employers.
Social security returns should be submitted by employers on a monthly basis by the 15th day of the following month, and the contributions should be paid on a monthly basis by the 15th day of the following month. The social security returns must be submitted electronically.
### International social security
The Lithuanian legislation on social security has been harmonised with the European Union (EU) regulations. Foreign employees seconded to Lithuania from a European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland and their employers are not required to pay social security contributions in Lithuania if an A1 certificate is obtained.
Employees temporarily seconded to Lithuania from third countries, with which Lithuania has no reciprocal social security agreements, are not required to pay the Lithuanian social security contributions as well, unless their permanent place of employment becomes Lithuania or the secondment exceeds one year.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate is 21%.
## Net wealth/worth taxes

Property for inheritance tax purposes is defined as real estate and movable property as well as securities and cash. Foreigners pay this tax in the same manner as citizens of Lithuania, however, only inherited real estate and movable property subject to registration in Lithuania is subject to taxation.

Otherwise, the tax rates for inherited property are 5% (if the taxable value is up to EUR 150,000) and 10% (if the taxable value exceeds EUR 150,000).
## Gift tax
There is no gift tax applicable in Lithuania.
## Real estate tax (RET)
