## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
## Employment expenses
Employment-related expenses are not deductible from individual employment compensation.
## Personal deductions
The following expenses incurred by Lithuanian tax residents over the tax period may be deducted from taxable income:
The total amount of deductible expenses specified above is limited to 25% of the taxable income (subject to 15%, 20%, and 32% PIT rates) during the calendar year. The total deductible life insurance premiums and both types of pension contributions amount should not exceed EUR 1,500.
## Standard deductions
A monthly tax-exempt amount (TEA) is applied only to employment-related income of Lithuanian tax residents, as follows:
The annual TEA shall be applied to the total annual income received by the individual. In cases where an individual receives additional income to the salary income (or salary increases during the year), corrections are made at the end of the year (when filing the annual income tax return). The calculation is made taking into consideration the annual taxable income, including tax exempt income received for the work performed in the country Lithuania has a double taxation treaty (DTT) concluded with and accordingly taxed in such a country. Also, income from individual activities derived under business certificates is not included in the calculation of the annual TEA.
The annual TEA can be applied to Lithuanian tax non-residents only at the end of the tax period by submitting the annual PIT return, provided their annual gross income does not exceed EUR 34,370.67.
For all children, the Lithuanian local municipal offices pay to families EUR 122.50 per month per child from birth to 18 years of age or older if they study according to a general curriculum until they reach the age of 21. The additional children allowances are also possible for families receiving certain low amounts of income, having three or more children, etc.
## Personal allowances
There are no personal allowances available in Lithuania.
## Business expenses
Expenses incurred for the purpose of receiving income from individual activities by self-employed individuals are tax deductible. There are two options to deduct expenses from income received/earned during the tax year:
## Losses
In certain cases, individuals performing individual activities can carry forward the losses for an unlimited period of time, until the activity that resulted in such losses is terminated.
Generally, losses resulting from the sales of shares and other financial instruments can reduce the profits earned from such sales during the same tax year (certain restrictions apply). However, losses resulting from other sales of property (e.g. immovable property) do not reduce the taxable base of other sales transactions of such property. Moreover, it is not possible to carry forward losses resulting from capital gains.
