## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
Worldwide income received by a Lithuanian tax resident is subject to PIT. However, only the following income sourced in Lithuania by a non-resident is subject to PIT:
## Personal income tax rates
PIT at a 20% rate is applied to income amounts not exceeding EUR 126,532 per calendar year in 2025 and at a 32% rate for the exceeding part for:
Income from profit distribution (e.g. dividends) is taxable at a flat PIT rate of 15%.
Individual activity income is taxed depending on the amount of income received. PIT calculated at the 15% flat rate on taxable income is reduced by applying a PIT credit, calculated according to special formulas (effective rate may vary from 5% to 15%). *Please see Business income in the [Income determination](lithuania/individual/income-determination.html) section for more information*.
Other income not specified above is taxed at a PIT rate of 15% if income amounts do not exceed EUR 253,065 per calendar year. A 20% PIT rate is applicable to income exceeding this threshold.
## Local, state, or provincial PIT rates
There are no local, state, or provincial PIT rates applicable in Lithuania.
