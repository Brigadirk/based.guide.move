## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
## Foreign tax credit
A company may reduce tax payable on certain foreign-sourced income in Lithuania by taxes paid on that income in a foreign country if that Lithuanian company has received appropriate notice from that foreign country. The tax credit may not exceed the CIT rate payable in Lithuania.
## Investment project incentive
Entities involved in an investment project can reduce their taxable profits by up to 100% of the actually incurred acquisition costs of long-term assets meeting certain requirements. Please note that depreciation (amortisation) expenses of such assets shall be deducted in a common manner.
Taxable profits can be reduced by such costs incurred from 2009 to 2028.
This relief is applied to the following categories of fixed assets:
The assets must be not used and produced not earlier than two years ago (as calculated from the date when such fixed assets were put into use).
The costs exceeding the above-mentioned 100% limit can be carried forward for four years.
There are certain criteria defining what could be considered an investment project. The project should be precisely described to meet the criteria allowing a company to use the tax relief.
Expenses, except for fixed assets’ depreciation (amortisation) expenses, incurred for R&D purposes can be deducted three times in the tax period when they are incurred, provided that R&D works performed are related to ordinary business activities. The entity also may apply accelerated depreciation rates to fixed assets used in R&D activities.
A company applying tax relief for R&D has to prepare R&D documentation. This documentation has to cover the performed project, substantiate conformity with certain tax requirements, and specify the amount of expenses for R&D activities.
As of 1 January 2018, a new tax incentive for companies investing into R&D was introduced. Such companies have the possibility to not only deduct the expenses incurred for R&D works from the taxable income three times, but they are also entitled to apply the reduced 5% (6% from 1 January 2025) CIT rate on the profit deriving from the commercial exploitation of patented inventions (it is similar to 'patent box' regimes available in other countries).
A company can apply the reduced CIT rate of 5% (6% from 1 January 2025) if:
## Funds granted for producing a film or a part of a film
Funds granted for producing a film or a part of a film can be deducted from taxable income and from CIT payable due during the period from 2019 to 2028 if the following conditions are met:
Not more than 75% of funds granted free of charge for production of film or of a part thereof in Lithuania can be deducted from taxable income.
Certain restrictions for reduction of taxable income and tax due apply.
## Large project relief
Starting from 1 January 2021, revenue an entity earned in the course of carrying out a large investment project may be exempt from CIT for a period of 20 years (or until the maximum state aid is reached). The relief applies only if at least 75% of the entity’s revenue for the relevant tax period consists of revenue from (i) manufacturing, (ii) data processing, or (iii) internet server services (hosting) and related activities. The requirements for the application of the relief are one of the following:
An investment agreement with the government of the Republic of Lithuania for the application of large project relief is required. This agreement must be signed by 31 December 2025.
The relief starts to apply from the tax period when the above-mentioned thresholds are reached. The application of the relief is suspended for the tax periods in which the amount of capital investment and/or the average number of employees and/or amount of salaries falls below the required threshold. The exemption will be renewed for the tax period when the required thresholds are reached again. Moreover, the exemption will not be granted to companies established in and benefiting from the preferential taxation in an FEZ.
It should be mentioned that if the investment agreement is signed, there are other benefits for the investor (green corridor initiative):
## Free economic zones (FEZs)
There are seven FEZs in Lithuania: in Kaunas, Klaipėda, Akmenė, Kėdainiai, Marijampolė, Panevėžys, and Šiauliai.
As of 1 January 2018, entities operating in an FEZ and fulfilling certain requirements are entitled to FEZ relief (i.e. do not pay CIT for the first ten years and apply 50% lower CIT rate for further six years). Also, no real estate tax has to be paid in an FEZ.
FEZ relief is applicable to the entities registered and actually performing its activities in the FEZ, if all of the following requirements are met:
