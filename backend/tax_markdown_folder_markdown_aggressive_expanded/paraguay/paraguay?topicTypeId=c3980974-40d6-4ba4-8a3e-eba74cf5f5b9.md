## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 31 May 2024
## Taxable period
For the CIT and LTIT, the taxable period is the calendar year. Regarding the AIT, the taxable period is as follows:
## Tax returns
Income tax returns are submitted on a fiscal-year basis as a self-assessment and must be filed by the fourth month following the end of the fiscal year.
## Payment of tax
Income tax is due on varying days in the fourth month following the end of the fiscal year, depending on the taxpayer ID number, according to a calendar established by the Treasury Ministry. Four equal advance payments are made throughout the year, calculated based on 100% of the tax due in the previous year. Payments must be made in May, July, September, and November of each year after the due date for filing the income tax return, according to the calendar established by the tax authorities.
### Penalties
Tax legislation provides the following penalties:
## Tax audit process
The auditing process is performed by the tax authorities when there is a certainty or suspicion of tax evasion. Additionally, the taxpayer may be audited according to a draw process that is made by the tax authority.
The tax law also establishes an obligatory tax audit, which has to be made by external auditors, when the taxpayer obtains PYG 6 billion of gross income during the year. An annual audit report on tax compliance rules is presented to and reviewed by the tax authorities. When a tax issue is identified, the tax authority may apply a penalty to the taxpayer.
## Statute of limitations
The tax authority may audit the last five fiscal years.
The tax authority is focusing on purchases invoices. It is important to note, that in order to consider an expense as deductible for tax purposes, it must comply with the formal requirements established by Law.
In addition to this, these vouchers must also comply with the mentioned formal requirements in order to consider them as a part of the VAT credit.
It should be noted that Paraguay, through Law No. 6656 of 26 November 2020, approves the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, amended by the Provisions of the Protocol that amends the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters
In this context, Paraguay is a cooperating country to share tax information with other tax authorities abroad.
