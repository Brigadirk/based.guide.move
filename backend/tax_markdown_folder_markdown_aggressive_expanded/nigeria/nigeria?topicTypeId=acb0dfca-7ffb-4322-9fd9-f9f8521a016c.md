## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 16 September 2024
The following income is subject to CIT in Nigeria:
## Inventory valuation
The first in first out (FIFO) valuation method is commonly used. Average and standard cost methods are also allowed, but last in first out (LIFO) is not permitted. Other than the accounting requirement in the local generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), there are no special statutory provisions for inventory valuation.
## Capital gains
## Dividend income
Dividends received from non-resident companies are taxable except if repatriated into Nigeria through government-approved channels (i.e. any financial institution authorised by the Central Bank of Nigeria to deal in foreign currency transactions).
Dividends received from small manufacturing companies are exempt for CIT purposes during the first five years of operation. Dividends from investments in wholly export-oriented businesses are also exempt. Dividends paid to Unit Trusts and Real Estate Investment Companies are exempt from WHT.
### Stock dividends
Stock dividends (bonus shares) are subject to WHT similar to cash dividends addressed above but are not included in the taxable income of the recipient company.
## Interest income
Interest received by a Nigerian company is liable to tax at the relevant CIT rate, with tax withheld at 10% available as an offset against the final tax liability.
Interest on Federal Government bonds is tax exempt. Interest on foreign currency domiciliary accounts is also exempt.
Interest payable to a non-resident investor is liable to WHT at 10%, which is the final tax. Recipients who are resident in a country with a DTT with Nigeria enjoy a reduced rate of 7.5% (where it is stated expressly in the DTT).
## Royalty income
Royalties received by a Nigerian company are liable to tax at the relevant CIT rate. WHT at 10% is available as an offset against the final CIT liability.
Royalties received by a Nigerian company from non-resident payers are taxable except if repatriated into Nigeria through government-approved channels.
Non-resident companies who receive Nigerian royalties are subject only to WHT at 10%, which is reduced to 7.5% if a treaty is in place with Nigeria (and where it is stated expressly in the DTT).
## Other significant items
The following entities' income or profit is exempt for CIT purposes:
## Foreign income
A Nigerian resident company is taxable on its worldwide income. On the other hand, a non-resident company is subject to tax only on income derived from Nigeria.
Dividends, interest, rents, and royalties earned abroad and brought into Nigeria through government-approved channels are exempt from Nigerian tax; otherwise, the income is taxable at the CIT rate applicable based on the classification of the company (i.e. small, medium, or large) and tertiary education tax at 3%. Government-approved channels mean the Central Bank of Nigeria and any bank or financial institution authorised to carry out foreign exchange transactions.
Taxable foreign income earned by a Nigerian tax resident entity cannot be legally deferred.
