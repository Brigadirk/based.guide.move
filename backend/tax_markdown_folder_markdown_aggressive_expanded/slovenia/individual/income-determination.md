## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
PIT is levied on six different sources of income:
## Capital gains and investment income
Capital gains, interest, dividends, and rental income are generally taxed at a flat rate of 25%.
The tax rate on capital gains is decreased according to the length of the holding period. The tax rate is 25% for a holding period from 0 to 5 years, 20% for a holding period from 5 to 10 years, 15% for a holding period from 10 to 15 years, and 0% for a holding period greater than 15 years. The tax on capital gains and rental income is treated as a final tax for residents and non-residents alike.
Interest derived from bank deposits with banks or savings banks registered in Slovenia or elsewhere in the European Union is not subject to taxation up to the amount of EUR 1,000.
