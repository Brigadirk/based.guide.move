# Slovenia
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
## Foreign tax credit
Tax paid abroad can be credited against tax liability in Slovenia. The amount of tax that can be credited is the amount of final and actually paid tax. If there is a DTT made between countries in question, the amount of tax that can be credited is the amount calculated at the rate determined in the DTT. A taxpayer needs to provide proof of the amount of foreign tax, the basis for calculation of the tax, and the amount of the tax paid.
## Investment allowances
The tax allowance for investment in equipment and intangible assets is limited to 40% of the value of the assets (also intangibles) invested into and can be utilised up to a maximum of 63% of the actual tax base.

The tax allowance equates to 45% of the salary paid to the person during the first 24 months of their employment, up to the amount of the tax base.
