# Uzbekistan, Republic of
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 09 February 2025
## Taxable period
The tax period for CIT is a calendar year, and the reporting period is a quarter.
## Tax returns
CIT is reported quarterly before the 20th day of the month following the reporting quarter both by Uzbek legal entities and PEs. The annual tax return is due by 1 March following the reporting year.
## Payment of tax
Legal entities are required to make payments of their tax liability not later than the filing deadline for the respective reporting quarter.
Legal entities with annual income for the previous tax period exceeding UZS 10 billion are required to make advance payments on a monthly basis.
Monthly advance payments should be made by the 23rd day of each month.
Possible excess of advanced payments can be deferred to the future periods, set-off against liabilities on other taxes, or refunded by the tax authorities within 15 days after filing an application for refund.
## Tax audit process
A new mechanism of tax control has been introduced, which prescribes that tax audits will be appointed based on the results of risk analysis. Specifically, taxpayers will be divided into three risk groups: high risk (red), average risk (yellow), and low risk (green). It is expected that taxpayers in the green group will not be audited, while taxpayers in the red group may be audited each year.
Risk analysis will be performed based on the following:
An on-site tax audit is carried out to collect information on the calculation and payment of taxes and fees, as well as other obligations. Following the results of an on-site tax audit, additional taxes will not be charged.
A tax audit is a full-fledged study of compliance with tax legislation by a taxpayer who has a high degree of risk with significant turnover. Tax audits are conducted for taxpayers selected based on the results of the analysis of risk factors for non-payment of taxes. After a tax audit, additional taxes and financial sanctions may be applied.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations for tax purposes in Uzbekistan is set to three years.
There are no officially announced areas of focus during tax audits. In practice, the tax authorities usually focus on currency control, cash discipline, deductibility of expenses for CIT purposes, and taxes on resources (e.g. excess profits tax, subsurface use tax).
