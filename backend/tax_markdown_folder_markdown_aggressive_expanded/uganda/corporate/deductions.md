## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
The ITA sets out the following conditions for deductibility of an expense:
A taxpayer who is accounting for tax purposes on an accrual basis derives income when it is receivable by the taxpayer and incurs expenditure when it is payable by the taxpayer.
An amount is treated as payable by the taxpayer when all the events that determine liability have occurred and the amount of the liability can be determined with reasonable accuracy, but not before economic performance with respect to the amount occurs. Economic performance occurs:
Contingent liabilities are not tax-deductible in Uganda.
## Depreciation
A deduction is allowed for the depreciation of the person’s depreciable assets, other than minor assets, in accordance with the appropriate applicable rates. The ITA allows a taxpayer a deduction for the depreciation of their depreciable assets on a reducing-balance basis. Depreciable assets are classified in three classes as follows:
| Class | Assets included | Rate of tax depreciation (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Computers and data handling equipment. | 40 |
| 2 | Plant and machinery used in farming, manufacturing, and mining. | 30 |
| 3 | Automobiles; buses and minibuses; construction and earth moving equipment; specialised trucks, tractors, trailers, and trailer mounted containers; rail cars, locomotives, and equipment; vessels, barges, tugs, and similar water transportation equipment; aircraft; specialised public utility plant, equipment, and machinery; office furniture, fixtures, and equipment; and any depreciable asset not included in another class. | 20 |
### Industrial building allowance
A company is eligible for an industrial building allowance on its industrial and commercial buildings at a tax rate of 5% *per annum* on a straight-line basis. The industrial building allowance will be granted on the actual cost incurred in constructing the buildings.
### Initial allowance
Effective 1 July 2023, the 50% and 20% initial allowances granted to new eligible business assets and industrial buildings have been removed.
## Goodwill
An intangible asset is amortisable over its useful life. To the extent that the useful life of the underlying asset that gives rise to goodwill can be determined, then the goodwill may be deductible over the useful life of the asset.
## Start-up expenses
A company setting up business for the first time or engaged in the initial public offer at the stock market will be entitled to a tax deduction for all its start-up costs that are of capital nature that would otherwise not be tax-deductible under the ordinary tax rules. The start-up costs will be allowed as tax-deductible costs over a period of four years on a straight-line basis at the rate of 25% *per annum*.
## Interest expenses
Interest is deductible if the interest is incurred in respect of a debt obligation by the company in the production of income included in the company’s gross income. Interest arising from non-trade-related debt obligation is not deductible. Deferred interest is deductible when paid.
Interest charged before capital investment is put to use must be capitalised. Interest incurred after capital investment is put to use is allowed as a deduction.
The previous thin capitalisation rules were repealed and replaced by a provision that limits the deductibility of interest by a taxpayer who is a member of a group to 30% of the tax EBITDA. The excess interest can be carried forward for a maximum of three years. This interest limitation does not apply to financial institutions, including micro-finance deposit taking institution, tier 4 micro-finance institutions, or a person carrying on insurance business.
## Bad debt
A deduction is allowed for bad debt only if:
For the bad debt to be deductible, the taxpayer must demonstrate to the URA that reasonable steps to collect the debt were taken and that the taxpayer failed to recover the debt. In relation to a financial institution, it should be a debt in respect of which a loss reserve held against presently identified losses or potential losses, and which is therefore not available to meet losses that subsequently materialise, has been made.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable donations are deductible if made to amateur sporting associations; religious, charitable, or educational institutions whose object is not for profit; trade unions; and other similar associations that have been issued with a written ruling by the Commissioner currently in force stating that it is an exempt organisation. The donations should not exceed 5% of the person’s chargeable income.
## Meals, refreshments, and entertainment
Expenses for meals, refreshments, and entertainment are deductible only where the value is included in the employment income of the employees or is excluded from employment income owing to the fact that it is provided on equal terms to all workers.
## Pension expenses
Employers are allowed a deduction for the contributions made to pension schemes on behalf of their employees. Employees, on the other hand, do not get a deduction for the contributions they make to pension funds.
## Payment for directors
Directors are treated as employees, so expenses incurred in respect of directors are deductible expenses.
## Bribes, kickbacks, illegal payments
Non-business expenses are not tax-deductible, including those of a private nature.
## Fines and penalties
No deduction is allowed for any fine or similar penalty paid to a government or its sub-division for breach of any law.
## Taxes
No deduction is allowed for income tax payable in Uganda or in a foreign country.
## Other significant items
No deduction is allowed for the following other expenditures:
## Net operating losses
A deduction is allowed for any assessed tax losses carried forward from previous years of income. Such tax losses are carried forward and deducted against future taxable profit of the business in the subsequent years of income. Effective 1 July 2023, the losses can be carried forward for seven years, following which only 50% of the losses is allowed as a deduction. There is also ring-fencing of losses in the following circumstances:
There is no provision for carryback of losses in Uganda.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments to foreign affiliates are deductible as long as they are charged at an arm's length and incurred in the production of income.
