## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Foreign tax credit
A resident taxpayer is entitled to a foreign tax credit for any foreign income tax paid by the taxpayer in respect of foreign-source income included in the gross income of the taxpayer. The foreign tax credit allowed is subject to the income tax rate (i.e. 30%) in Uganda.
## Tax holidays for exporters
A tax holiday of ten years is available to exporters who export at least 80% of their produce of finished goods, subject to certain conditions.
## Incentives for the importation of plant and machinery
Plant and machinery is exempt from customs duty on importation. Additionally, a VAT deferral facility is available where VAT is deferred on importation of plant and machinery and subsequently waived upon approval by the relevant authorities.
## Employment incentives
A deduction of 2% of income tax payable is granted to any employer who can prove to the URA that at least 5% of their employees on a full-time basis are people with disabilities.
## Other incentives
To qualify as an operator in an industrial park or free zone or as any other person carrying on business outside the industrial park or free zone, the taxpayer must locally source 75% of raw materials subject to availability, and the person should also employ at least 75% citizens who earn an aggregate wage of at least 75% of the total wage bill.
