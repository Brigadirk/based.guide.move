Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Personal deductions
No deduction is allowed for any expenses that are private or domestic in nature. Such expenses include costs of maintaining the individual's family and residence, costs of commuting to work, and costs of clothing worn to work.
### Charitable contributions
Individuals are allowed deductions for donations made to amateur sporting associations, religious institutions, charitable institutions, or educational institutions whose object is not for profit. However, the allowed amount cannot exceed 5% of the chargeable income.
### Interest expenses
Interest incurred on a debt by an individual is only allowed to the extent that the debt obligation was incurred in the production of income included in gross income.
## Personal allowances
The first UGX 2,820,000 of a resident individual's annual income falls in the nil tax bands and does not suffer tax. This is the amount allowed to an individual tax free.
## Business deductions

Any expenditure or loss that is business in nature but which is recoverable under any form of insurance or contract is not allowable for deduction.
