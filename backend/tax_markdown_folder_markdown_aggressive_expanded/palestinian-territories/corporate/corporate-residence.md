# Palestinian territories
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
The following are considered to be a resident for tax purposes:
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The Palestinian Income Tax Law does not mention or define the concept of ‘permanent establishment’. This concept is stated in international Double Tax Avoidance Agreements. According to the Palestinian Income Tax Law, income generated in Palestine is liable to tax in Palestine. In order to determine the place where income is generated, the Palestinian Tax Authorities use the same terms that are used in international tax treaties in order to determine whether there is or isn’t a PE.
