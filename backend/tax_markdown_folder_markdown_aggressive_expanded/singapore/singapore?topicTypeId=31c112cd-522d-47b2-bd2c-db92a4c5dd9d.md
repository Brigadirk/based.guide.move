# Singapore
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 06 May 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year in Singapore is the calendar year. An individual’s income from a preceding calendar year is assessed to tax in the following calendar year (i.e. year of assessment).
## Tax returns
Each taxpayer is required to make an annual return of income and of such particulars as may be required to determine the personal reliefs and deductions. The tax return must be filed on a calendar-year basis and must be submitted by 15 April. If filed electronically, the deadline is 18 April.
## Payment of tax
The tax assessed is payable within one month of the date of the assessment whether or not a notice of objection to the assessment has been lodged with the tax authorities. The notice of objection must be lodged within 30 days of the date of the notice of assessment, failing which the assessment will be treated as final.
In the case of an employee, the tax authorities will, upon application, generally allow the payment of tax by monthly instalments with no interest, using the Interbank GIRO system (an interbank fund transfer system).
### Clearance for foreigners
Singapore does not have payroll withholding. When a foreign citizen employee ceases employment in Singapore or leaves Singapore for a period exceeding three months or on an overseas posting, the employer needs to notify the Singapore tax authorities and withhold all monies due (unless the Singapore taxes are fully borne by the employer) until tax clearance is issued. The notification must be made no later than one month prior to the date of cessation/departure. Foreigners are also subject to tax on unexercised/unvested stock options/awards on a deemed gain basis when they cease employment or leave Singapore.
As a concession, tax clearance need not be obtained in the following scenarios:
## Tax audit process
The tax authority is the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS). It adopts a risk-based approach to identifying compliance risk, with a focus on improving the behaviour of taxpayers who pose a higher risk of non-compliance. The Singapore tax authorities also prioritise and tailor specific compliance programmes that aim to identify taxpayers who have made mistakes in their tax returns, create an audit presence in the community to deter non-compliance by other taxpayers, educate taxpayers on their tax obligations and how to comply with these, and identifying areas of tax law, policies, and processes where the tax system can be simplified.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations is four years from the year of assessment. It does not apply where there has been fraud or wilful default by the taxpayer.
The tax authorities are focused on self-employed taxpayers, who can include doctors, dentists, lawyers, accountants, consultants, commission agents, private tutors, renovation contractors, and bloggers.
Areas of focus include:
