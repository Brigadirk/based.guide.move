## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The VAT rate applicable in Chad is:
An operation performed in Chad that constitutes an economic activity and for which payment is made, unless included in the list of exemptions in the law governing VAT, is liable for VAT, even if the residence of the natural person or the registered office of the legal entity is located outside Chad.
The VAT law provides a list of transactions exempted from VAT that includes, among many others, the following:
Before fiscal year 2018, the refund of VAT credit applied only to some categories of taxpayers.
From fiscal year 2018, any taxpayer (resident) subject to VAT may apply for the refund of VAT credit, except taxpayers who benefit from any exemption via establishment agreements.
The deadline for the application of the refund of VAT credit is 24 months from the birth of this credit.
The refund of VAT credit is guaranteed by an escrow account domiciled in Bank of the States of Central Africa. This account is fuelled by 15% of various VAT revenues.
Any VAT credit officially recognised by the tax administration shall be refunded.
The consequences of the application for VAT credit are as follows:

## Customs duties
The tax basis of customs duties corresponds with the customs valuation, namely the selling price of the goods plus cost of delivery to Chad (costs of insurance, transportation, etc.).
The rates of customs duties depend on the nature of the goods and range from 5% to 30%. These rates can be summarised as follows:
## Excise duty
Excise duty applies to goods of great consumption: cigarettes, drinks (water, beer, and wine), cosmetics, and luxury products, and transactions of mobile companies, which are the legal taxpayers. Excise duty rates depend on the nature of the goods and range from 5% to 25% of the value of the good.
Some of the rates are as follows:
This value differs depending on the origin of the good. If the good has been manufactured in the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC) zone, the value corresponds with the selling price charged by the manufacturer. If the good is imported into the CEMAC zone, the value is the sum of the freight value plus insurance costs and customs duties.
This value constitutes the basis of the calculations of the excise duty.
## Real property tax
The annual real property tax differs according to whether it is a built or an unbuilt property and whether it is located in N’Djamena or elsewhere. The tax is imposed in the municipality where the property is situated.
The tax rate on built property is 10% in N’Djamena and 8% elsewhere.
The tax rate on unbuilt property is 21% in N’Djamena and 20% elsewhere.
The calculation basis is the potential revenue of that property. The potential revenues correspond to four-fifths of the rental value, the rental value being 10% of the market value. For rural unbuilt property, the market value is fixed to XAF 50,000 per hectare.
Some temporary exemptions are granted to new buildings or additions to constructed buildings after 1 January 1968 from this tax in some conditions. In case of construction or reconstruction, owners can benefit from temporary exemptions as follows:
