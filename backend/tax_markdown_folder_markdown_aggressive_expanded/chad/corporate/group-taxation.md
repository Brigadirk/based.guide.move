## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
There is a specific taxation of groups within the CEMAC area.
Where a joint stock company and a private limited company own either registered stock in a joint stock company or shares in a private limited company, the net proceeds of the share in the second company paid to the first during the financial year shall be deducted from the total net profit of the latter, less a percentage for costs and charges. This percentage is fixed at 10% of the total amount of the proceeds. This system shall apply when all of the following conditions are met:
## Transfer pricing
The Tax Code acknowledges that dependent or controlled companies may transfer benefits indirectly to their company abroad it is dependent on or to the company abroad it is controlled by.
In order to calculate the real benefit, the indirectly transferred benefits (by means of increase of purchase price or decrease of sales price to the controlling company or by any other means) are incorporated into the result established by the accounts.
If the tax administration does not have enough precise elements to determine the benefit, it will establish the taxable benefit by way of comparison to companies normally operated in Chad.
The Tax Code provides further, in accordance with CEMAC regulation, that interest paid to shareholders on sums that they lend over and above their share capital is deductible at the rate for loans allowed by the central bank increased by two percentage points. This deduction is only possible if the amounts lent do not exceed 50% of the share capital.
### Transfer pricing documentation requirements
From January 2023, Article 1000 XIV of the General Tax Code requires a category of taxpayers who are resident in Chad to submit spontaneously and annually to the tax authorities, during the filing of the fiscal and statistic declaration, a light transfer pricing documentation (LTPD) together with the full transfer pricing documentation (FTPD). The LTPD is to be filled in a form by the concerned taxpayers, while the FTPD is a documentation containing all the required information.
For 2023, both the LTPD and the FTPD must be filed by 1 May 2023 (30 April being a Sunday). However, a deadline submission extension can be granted by the tax administration without exceeding two months.
Companies concerned by the LTPD and the FTPD are enterprises registered in Chad:
By reference to the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for multinational enterprises and tax administrations, and the Circular ref 02 /MFBCP/SE/SG/DGI/ 2023, an FTPD should includen especially:
Branches and PEs are within the scope of the said requirement.
Late filing of the transfer pricing documentation is subject to fines as follows:
Lack of filing the transfer pricing documentation entails the non-deductibility of expenses relating to intra-group transactions (i.e. foreign technical assistance, management fees, royalties, interest) and the payment of fines amounting to 5% of the amount of intra-group transactions with a minimum of XAF 50 million.
Moreover, the lack of filing, late filing, and insufficiency of information required for transfer pricing documentation leads to the payment of a fine of XAF 100,000 per each piece of information not provided, each piece of missing information, and each piece of inaccurate information.
## Thin capitalisation
The thin capitalisation rules apply to companies subject to corporate tax and to advance of funds or receivables granted by shareholders.
The deductibility of interest paid to shareholders is limited by two rules:
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no provisions relating to CFCs in Chad.
