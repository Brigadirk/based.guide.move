# Hong Kong SAR
## Individual - Other issues
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
## Treatment of business entities
An individual who does not set up a separate legal entity can conduct business in Hong Kong SAR through the following principal forms:
## Visa and work permit
Foreigners are generally required to obtain a work permit before taking employment in Hong Kong SAR.
The Hong Kong Immigration Department will contact the individual and/or the sponsor for verification upon receiving the application.
## Tax equalisation or reimbursement plans
A tax reimbursement programme is usually provided by employers to expatriate employees to alleviate any tax increases which may be incurred as a result of an overseas assignment. A tax reimbursement programme may either be a ‘tax protection’ or ‘tax equalisation’ plan.
