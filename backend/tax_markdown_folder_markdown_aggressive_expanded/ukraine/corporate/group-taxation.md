## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
In Ukraine, each legal entity is taxed individually.
## Transfer pricing
### Controlled transactions
The transfer pricing rules apply for CIT purposes only. The list of controlled transactions for transfer pricing purposes includes business transactions that may have an impact on taxable profits and that are:
In addition, starting from 23 May 2020, the transfer (full or partial) of functions from one counterparty to another that leads to a decrease in the income/financial result of a Ukrainian taxpayer (in cases where in a relationship between unrelated parties such transfer would not have taken place without compensation) is also subject to transfer pricing rules.
Notes
1. Starting from 1 January 2025, the following two new criteria for determining related parties are introduced:
2. Starting from 1 January 2025, to replace the prior ones, the following new criteria are established for the inclusion of states (territories) in the relevant list of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine (so called 'low-tax' jurisdictions):
3. Starting from 1 January 2025, two new conditions are introduced (instead of the prior one - payment of CIT by the non-resident in the reporting year in the country of its registration), and, if at least one of them is met, the taxpayer's transactions with the non-resident, whose organisational and legal form is included in such a list, are recognised as uncontrolled (in the absence of other criteria):
Such status must be confirmed by an appropriate certificate, prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Tax Code of Ukraine, and submitted to the State Tax Service by 1 October of the year following the reporting year.
Transactions with the same counterparty are considered to be controlled if the total annual amount of the transactions with any counterparty (calculated according to accounting rules) exceeds UAH 10 million (net of indirect taxes), provided the total annual income (calculated according to the accounting rules) of the taxpayer received as a result of any type of activity exceeds UAH 150 million (net of indirect taxes).
Transactions performed between a non-resident and its PE in Ukraine are considered to be controlled if their value, determined in accordance with the accounting rules, exceeds UAH 10 million (net of indirect taxes) for the corresponding tax (reporting) year.
For all cases listed above, the value criteria for recognition of transactions as controlled should be calculated at prices that are in line with the arm’s-length principle.
Some transactions are considered to be at arm’s-length (i.e. transactions in which prices are subject to state regulation, transactions subject to mandatory valuation, transactions in which prices are determined by mandatory auction, transactions on forced sale of collateral) if the conditions of transactions meet the respective legislation requirements.
### Transfer pricing methods
The Tax Code of Ukraine provides five methods for determining the arm's-length nature of controlled transactions:
According to the Tax Code, the selected transfer pricing method should be the one that the taxpayer reasonably considers as being most appropriate according to the facts and circumstances of the controlled transaction unless the Tax Code specifies the requirements for the application of a specific method of justification of the arm’s-length nature of the controlled transactions of a certain type.
The most appropriate method of transfer pricing is selected taking into account the following criteria:
The taxpayer, taking into account these criteria, uses any method that the taxpayer deems most appropriate; however, if there is a possibility to apply both the CUP and any other method, the CUP method is used.
Where, subject to such criteria, the resale price method or the cost plus method and the net profit or profit split method can be applied by the taxpayer with equal reliability, the resale price method or the cost plus method shall be used.
For controlled transactions on transfer of functions from one counterparty to another where it is not possible to apply one of the methods prescribed above, the special methodology is prescribed.
The CUP method is a priority for controlled commodity transactions. The list of commodities is defined and published by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. When applying the CUP method for these transactions, the taxpayer may compare the prices within the controlled transactions with the prices of comparable uncontrolled transactions (actually performed by the taxpayer or other unrelated parties) and/or with commodity quotations. The State Tax Service of Ukraine publishes a recommended (non-exclusive) list of data sources for obtaining commodity quotations on its official web portal before the beginning of the reporting year.
If the taxpayer decides to apply methods other than CUP for commodities transactions, the taxpayer should include in its transfer pricing documentation (Local File):
The Tax Code also provides the possibility for the use of several transfer pricing methods (or a combination thereof) to substantiate the arm's-length nature of controlled transactions. However, the taxpayer may not use more than one method to determine whether the nature of a controlled transaction is at arm’s-length. The application of methods that are not prescribed by the Tax Code (*see above*) is prohibited.
For the purposes of applying transfer pricing methods, the following information may be used:
### Transfer pricing documentation/reporting
All taxpayers performing controlled transactions in the reporting year should file a report on controlled transactions (transfer pricing notification) by 1 October of the year following the reporting year.
All taxpayers belonging to an international group of companies and performing controlled transactions in the reporting year should file a notification on participation in an international group of companies (CbCR Notification) by 1 October of the year following the reporting year.
Starting from 23 May 2020, three-tier transfer pricing documentation is introduced in Ukraine, which includes the following:
The taxpayer submits the CbCR to the tax authorities within 12 months after the last day of the financial year, which is defined by the parent company of the international group of companies (within 12 months after the end of the calendar year in the absence of information on the financial year defined by the parent company of the international group of companies).
Note that the first reporting period for submitting the CbCR is:
As of 4 December 2023, for Ukraine the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on the Exchange of Country-by-Country Reports has not yet entered into force with any foreign jurisdiction. Consequently, for the rest of taxpayers, the first reporting period for submitting the CbCR has not yet been established.
The first reporting period for submitting the CbCR is:
Transfer pricing documentation and global transfer pricing documentation (Master File) should be prepared in Ukrainian only in any format (either a single document or a set of documents).
The Tax Code of Ukraine contains a detailed list of information to be included in transfer pricing documentation (Local File), global transfer pricing documentation (Master File), CbCR, and notification on participation in an international group of companies.
### Business purpose
Starting from 23 May 2020, the requirements for the content of transfer pricing documentation (Local File) were extended. The most important changes are that the taxpayer should include in the Local File a justification of the business purpose (economic benefits resulting from the controlled transactions compared to realistically available alternatives between unrelated parties) for controlled transactions on the purchase (sale) of goods, works (services), intangible assets (including licenses), and items of business transactions other than goods. If the taxpayer fails to justify the business purpose/economic benefit within the controlled transactions, there is a risk that the Ukrainian tax authorities will not recognise such controlled transactions when calculating the taxpayer’s financial result or the controlled transactions may be replaced by an alternative option between unrelated parties acting commercially in comparable conditions.
From 1 January 2022, the concept of 'business purpose' is also applied to the uncontrolled transactions with non-residents from 'low-tax' jurisdictions or of special organisational and legal forms, which are included in the list of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, as well as royalty charges with all non-residents.
### Transfer pricing adjustments
If the prices/profitability of the controlled transaction do not correspond with the arm's-length principle, the taxpayer should perform the respective transfer pricing adjustment and pay additional tax. The parties to the controlled transaction are entitled to perform a proportional transfer pricing adjustment. The proportional adjustment for Ukrainian taxpayers is allowed if the counterparty is a related party to the taxpayer and has made an actual adjustment of its tax liabilities. In addition, there should be an effective DTT between Ukraine and the jurisdiction of the non-resident related party.
Starting from 1 January 2021, the amount of controlled transactions that does not correspond with the arm's-length principle (range) will be determined as deemed dividends paid to the non-resident. Additional exposure of 15% WHT (unless a lower rate is provided by the DTT), as well as advance CIT payment, may be applicable in such a case.
The interquartile range of benchmark prices/price level index (PLI) is considered to be a yardstick used for substantiation of the arm’s-length nature of the transactions. The taxpayers should adjust the financial result/prices of the transactions to the levels corresponding with the lower/higher quartiles, while the adjustments, assessed by the tax authorities, are made to the median of the interquartile range. The adjustments are made based on the results of the reporting (tax) year.
### Transfer pricing audit
The Tax Code also provides for a specialised transfer pricing audit as the tax authorities are not allowed to examine pricing in controlled transactions during normal full-scope tax audits. The audit duration cannot exceed 18 months, although extension is possible for another 12 months. Such a period is also suspended until the completion of court proceedings on claims by the taxpayer regarding issues related to the assignment, conduct or subject of such audit.
The tax authorities cannot conduct more than one transfer pricing audit within one calendar year, although other (non-transfer pricing) tax audits can be conducted during this period. The statutory limitation period for transfer pricing assessments is seven years.
The tax authorities have the right to use the information obtained in the course of transfer pricing audit from the taxpayers who were parties to the tested controlled transactions or were involved in supply chain with regard to the subject of controlled transactions. In case of failure to provide information, the tax authorities have the right to cross-audit such taxpayers.
With the introduction of martial law on 24 February 2022, transfer pricing audits were not initiated, and the initiated audits were suspended.
However, starting from 25 November 2022, the following unscheduled transfer pricing audits were resumed for the period until martial law is terminated or cancelled in Ukraine (1):
Notes
Responsibility under the Tax Code (including the responsibility for ongoing violations committed before 25 November 2022) applies for taxpayers starting from 25 November 2022 as a result of the above audits for any non-compliance identified. In this case, the moratorium on financial penalties/fines for the duration of martial law, the state of emergency, and/or quarantine does not apply.
In addition, the deadline for submission of transfer pricing documentation (Local File) and global transfer pricing documentation (Master File) requested by the tax authorities, as well as the report on controlled transactions, notification on participation in an international group of companies, and CbCR has been reinstated until martial law is terminated or cancelled in Ukraine.
If the parties to the controlled transaction do not provide sufficient justification for the actual actions of the parties to the transaction and the actual conditions of its conduct, then the functions, risks, and assets are distributed in favour of the party to the controlled transaction who is a resident of Ukraine.
### Penalties in transfer pricing
The Tax Code defines penalties for non-compliance with the following transfer pricing rules:
Payment of such penalties does not exempt the taxpayer from the obligation to file the transfer pricing documents prescribed above.
### Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs)
Large taxpayers have the right to enter into APAs with the tax authorities in order to agree on certain terms of controlled transactions in advance. For a large taxpayer, it is also possible to pre-align pricing in controlled transactions that are or will be carried out by those large taxpayers.
For the period from May 2024 through December 2024, there were no significant changes in the Tax Code regarding transfer pricing rules (except for the above-mentioned changes with respect to the reporting period for submitting the CbCR and upcoming changes regarding the criteria for recognising transactions as controlled).
## Thin capitalisation
Starting from 1 January 2021, the following rules apply to legal entities whose debts to all non-residents (not only related parties) exceed equity by 3.5 times:
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
The CFC rules in Ukraine will come into force on 1 January 2022. The first reporting period is 2022. The first report is allowed to be submitted in 2024 for the first two reporting periods.
Penalties are not applied for violation of the requirements of the Tax Code of Ukraine during the determination and calculation of the profit of the CFC based on the results of the 2022-2023 reporting years.
According to the results of the 2022-2023 reporting (tax) years, the taxpayer and officials shall not be subject to administrative and criminal liability for any violations related to the application of the norms of the Tax Code of Ukraine regarding reporting on CFCs.
On 1 July 2024, Law No. 3706-IX that introduces to the Tax Code of Ukraine amendments with regard to liability for violations of the rules of reporting on CFC will enter into force. According to the Law No. 3706-IX, during the period of martial law in Ukraine, and six months after the month in which the martial law is suspended or cancelled, the taxpayer will not be subject to penalties and administrative and criminal liability for violations related to the application of the CFC rules, namely for non-submission or untimely submission of the CFC report and notification on the acquisition or alienation of a share in a foreign legal entity, or of the initiation/termination of actual control over a foreign legal entity, and for non-display by the controlling person in the CFC report of information on the available CFCs.
Broadly, under the CFC regime, a Ukraine resident company or individual may be taxed on a proportion of the profits of certain entities that are owned or controlled by a Ukrainian tax resident. The profits of a CFC are included into the taxable income of the controlling person and are taxed at standard income tax rate and rules. Please note there are a few specific tax rates for individuals.
### Definition of a CFC
An entity is deemed to be a CFC if it is:
Foreign establishments without the status of a legal entity (e.g. partnerships, trusts, funds, foundations) are also equated to an entity for CFC purposes.
A controlling person of a foreign company is defined as:
Control may be established directly or through a chain of indirect ownership.
### Available CFC exemptions
Profits of CFCs should be exempt from taxation under the CFC rules in Ukraine under the following conditions:
### Determining taxable profits
A CFC's taxable profits are calculated as net profits before tax as per its unconsolidated financial statements for a relevant calendar year, prepared under domestic GAAP or IFRS adjusted per specific list of tax adjustments. The Tax Code does not provide for a mandatory audit of financial statements; however, the tax authorities may request an audit report if they have doubts.
Losses incurred by a CFC may be carried forward and decrease taxable profits of this CFC in the future. Loss from revaluation of securities is non-deductible; only loss from trading operations can be deducted.
Foreign taxes paid on the profits of a CFC, either under Ukrainian law or the laws of a foreign jurisdiction, may be offset against the Ukrainian PIT liabilities charged on the CFC’s profits (i.e. only for individuals).
### Implications for affected entities
If none of the available exemptions may be applied, the CFC’s chargeable profits must be apportioned among the relevant Ukrainian controlling persons in proportion to their interest(s) in the CFC as at the final day of the reporting period. Such persons should be taxed on their portion(s) at the applicable rate of income tax. However, the Ukrainian CFC rules have no implications for the CFC itself.
## Treatment of inter-company items
Ukrainian tax legislation provides the following treatment for inter-company items:
