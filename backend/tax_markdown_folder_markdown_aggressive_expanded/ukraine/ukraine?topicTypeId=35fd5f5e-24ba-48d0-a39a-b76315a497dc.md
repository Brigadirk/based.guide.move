## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
Residents are taxed on their worldwide income, subject to the restrictions set forth by any applicable DTT.
Non-residents are subject to Ukrainian tax only in respect of their Ukrainian-source income (this, for example, includes income received by the individual from their employer, either resident or non-resident, in relation to employment exercised in Ukraine) or, under conditions, investment profit from operation with non-Ukrainian investment assets if the issuers own Ukrainian subsidiaries.
The same tax rates generally apply to tax residents and non-residents (with certain exceptions).
## Personal income tax rates
The standard tax rate of 18% applies to income received as salary and other benefits under employment and civil agreements, foreign income, and other income not covered elsewhere.
Taxable income received from abroad is subject to a tax rate of 18%, with some exceptions.
The 18% rate also applies to all passive income (e.g. interest, dividends, royalties, investment profit), unless specified otherwise by a special article (*see the [Income determination](ukraine/individual/income-determination.html) section*). Dividends paid by resident CIT payers (except mutual investment institutions) are taxed at 5%. Dividends paid by non-residents, mutual investment funds, and non-payers of CIT in Ukraine are taxed at 9%. Dividends that are 'not ordinary dividends' are taxed like salary (i.e. at 18%).
Income earned by tax non-residents from sources in Ukraine should be subject to tax under the same order and rates as those for tax residents, unless otherwise specified by the Tax Code.
## Military tax rates
A temporary 1.5% military tax on personal income was introduced in August 2014. This is effective until the reformation of the Ukrainian Military Forces is completed. The completion should be confirmed by the respective decision of the Parliament.
Tax base for the military tax is the same as for PIT (with some exceptions) and is not capped.
Ukrainian employers and other tax agents are responsible for tax withholding. Military tax from income not withheld by a tax agent should be payable on a self-assessment basis within the deadlines for PIT.
For the updates introduced by the Law 4015-IX, dated 10 October 2024, please refer to *Military tax**in the [Significant developments](ukraine/individual/significant-developments.html) section*.
Income of individuals accrued for the periods before the Law 4015-IX came into force ( i.e. before 1 December 2024) shall be taxed at the military tax rate in effect prior to the entry into force of this Law (i.e. 1.5%), regardless of the date of their actual payment (grant), except for cases expressly provided for by the Tax Code of Ukraine.
