## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
Resident companies in Portugal are taxed on their worldwide income.
There is an optional regime to exclude from taxation the profits and losses allocated to a foreign permanent establishment (PE) of a company resident, for tax purposes, in Portugal. The regime applies provided that (i) the profit allocated to that PE is subject to and not exempt from a tax foreseen in Article 2 of the EU Parent/Subsidiary Directive (Council Directive 2011/96/EU) or a tax similar to the Portuguese CIT where the legal rate is not lower than 60% of the standard CIT rate (meaning 12.6%), (ii) the PE is not located in a black-listed jurisdiction, and (iii) the effective tax on income is not lower than 50% of the tax that would be due under the CIT Code (except when certain requirements are met). The regime is not applicable to the profit allocated to the foreign PE up to the amount of the losses attributable to that PE that have been taken into account by the Portuguese taxpayer when computing the respective taxable income of the previous 12 tax years. This is an optional regime that must cover, at least, all the PEs located in the same jurisdiction, and is mandatory for a minimum three-year period.
A flat CIT rate of 20% applies on the global amount of taxable income realised by companies resident for tax purposes in mainland Portugal (also applicable to Portuguese PEs of foreign entities). The standard CIT rate is 14.7% in the Autonomous Region of Madeira and in the Autonomous Region of the Azores, including PEs of foreign entities registered therein.
A reduced CIT rate of 16% (11.9% in the Autonomous Region of Madeira and in the Autonomous Region of the Azores) applies to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and small-medium capitalisation (Small Mid Caps) companies (resident entities and PEs in Portugal of non-resident entities) on the first € 50,000 of taxable income (the standard CIT rate shall apply on the excess). Additionally, SMEs and Small Mid Cap companies carrying out their activity and having their effective management in inland territories of Portugal mainland can benefit from a rate of 12.5% (8.75% in the case of the Autonomous Region of the Azores and in the case of beneficiary territories of the Autonomous Region of Madeira) on the first € 50,000 of the taxable amount, also being subject to the standard CIT rate on the excess. In both cases, reference is made to the concept of micro, small, and medium-sized companies as foreseen in the EU Commission Recommendation 2003/361, and to the concept of Small Mid Cap as aligned with the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund concerning the definition of micro, small, and medium capitalisation enterprises.
Entities qualified as startups are subject to a 12.5% CIT rate (8.75% in the Autonomous Region of Madeira) on the first € 50,000 of taxable income (the standard CIT rate shall apply on the excess).
Entities that do not carry out a commercial, industrial, or agricultural activity as their main activity are subject to a 20% CIT rate on the global amount of their taxable income (14.7% in the Autonomous Region of Madeira and 14% in the Autonomous Region of the Azores).
## Surtaxes
The following surtaxes may also apply:
The state surtax is levied on resident taxpayers carrying on commercial, industrial, or agricultural activity and by non-residents with a PE in Portugal. The state surtax is paid in three instalments.
A regional surtax (Derrama Regional) applies as follows:
## Autonomous taxation
Autonomous taxation applies at different rates on certain expenses incurred by entities subject to CIT. It is self-assessed in addition to CIT (even if no CIT is due) at the following rates:
| Cost of acquisition (EUR) | Type of vehicle (%) | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Plug-in hybrid\* | Vehicle natural gas (VNG) | Other | Fully electric |
| Lower than 37,500 | 2.5 | 2.5 | 8.0 | - |
| Between 37,500 and 45,000 | 7.5 | 7.5 | 25.0 | - |
| Equal to or higher than 45,000 | 15.0 | 15.0 | 32.0 |  |
| Exceeding 62,500 | - | - | - | 10.0 |
\* Which battery can be charged using a connection to the power grid, having a minimum electric autonomy of 50 km and official emissions of less than 50gCO2/km.
All of the above-mentioned rates of autonomous taxation cease the  increase of 10%, if the taxpayer has tax losses in the tax year in which the expenses are incurred, when:
Additionally, shows offered to customers, suppliers or any other person or entity are no longer subject to autonomous taxation.
