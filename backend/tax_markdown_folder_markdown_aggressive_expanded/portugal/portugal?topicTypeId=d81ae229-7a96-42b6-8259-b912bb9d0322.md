Notes
1. The lower of the listed rates applies to royalties when the beneficiary holds 50% or less of the paying company's share capital.
2. There is no WHT on dividends if the EU Parent/Subsidiary Directive applies.
3. The lower of the listed rates applies to dividends when the beneficiary directly holds 25% or more of share capital. Depending on each DTT, a two year holding period may be required.
4. The lower rate applies to interest on debentures raised in France after 1 January 1965 or on significant loans or debentures raised in Portugal or abroad under major development projects listed in the treaty annex.
5. The lower of the listed rates applies to bank loans, but if interest is payable from Portugal, the bank loans must qualify as being of economic or social interest or fall under an approved development plan.
6. The lower of the listed rates applies to interest received by financial institutions.
7. The lower of the listed rates applies to technical assistance.
8. The lower of the listed rates applies on interest related to loans with a minimum maturity of two years.

10. The rate of 5% regarding royalties applies to equipment lease.
11. The rate of 10% applies if the company that is paying the dividends is a resident of Israel and the dividends derive from profits that are subject to tax in Israel at a rate that is lower than the normal rate of Israel company tax.

In the case of Saudi Arabia, the 10% minimum holding requirement is waived in case the beneficial owner is the state or a public entity.
14.

An exemption from WHT is also foreseen regarding interest and royalties, when paid between associated companies (shareholdings of at least 25% held for at least two years), in line with the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation.

The lower of the listed rates applies to dividends if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) that (i) directly holds at least 10% of the capital of the Portuguese company paying the dividends or (ii) directly controls at least 10% of the voting rights of the Peruvian company paying the dividends.
17. The lower of the listed rates applies to interest related to credits of any nature granted by a financial institution or, in the case of the Ivory Coast, Saudi Arabia, the Sultanate of Oman, Vietnam, and São Tomé and Principe, when the beneficial owner or the entity paying the interest is the state or other public body (including the central bank) of the contracting states.
