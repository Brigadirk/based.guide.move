## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Resident nationals and foreigners are taxed on their worldwide income under the Myanmar Income Tax Act.
Under the Union Taxation Law (UTL) 2015, non-resident nationals were exempt from income tax on salary income earned and received in foreign countries. With effect from 1 October 2023, the tax exemption is no longer available. Under the Amended UTL 2023, income tax will be imposed on salary income received by non-resident nationals in foreign countries, and the tax paid in foreign countries will be allowed to offset against the Myanmar tax payable.
Non-resident foreigners are taxed only on income derived from sources within Myanmar.
Foreigners working for Union of Myanmar Foreign Investment Law (MFIL) or Myanmar Investment Law (MIL) companies may be taxed at the same tax rates as a tax resident, regardless of their period of stay in Myanmar, under the tax incentives that may be granted to the MFIL/MIL companies.
