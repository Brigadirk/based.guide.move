## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Generally, foreign branches are deemed to be non-resident companies. Non-resident companies are taxed only on income derived from sources within Myanmar. Non-resident companies pay tax at the same rate as resident companies. This means a branch of a foreign company will pay tax at the 22% rate. The income is generally subject to tax under the normal rules for residents.
