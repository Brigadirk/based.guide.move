## Special economic zones (SEZs)
In addition to foreign investment under the MFIL, foreign investors may invest under the Myanmar Special Economic Zone Law of 2014 (Myanmar SEZ Law).

The Myanmar SEZ Law contains provisions relating to the exempted zone, business promoted zone, other zone, exempted zone business, other business, developers and investors, exemptions and reliefs, restrictions, duties of developers or investors, land use, banks and finance management and insurance business, management and inspection of commodities by the customs department, quarantine, labour and guarantee of non-nationalisation, dispute resolution, WHT, bank and financial management and insurance business, etc.
Incentives under the Myanmar SEZ Law include:
For investors:
For developers:
Land use may be granted under an initial lease of up to 50 years and renewable for a period of an additional 25 years. Developers/investors may rent, mortgage, or sell land and buildings to another person for investment purposes within the term granted with the approval of the management committee concerned.
Investors seeking to register an entity under the SEZ need to obtain an investment permit from the relevant SEZ Management Committee.
## Foreign tax credit
There is no provision for unilateral relief. Relief may be available pursuant to a tax treaty, but the application of the tax treaties is at the sole discretion of the Ministry of Planning and Finance.
