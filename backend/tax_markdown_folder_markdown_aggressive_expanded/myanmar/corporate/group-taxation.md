# Myanmar
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
There is no group taxation regime in Myanmar.
## Transfer pricing regime
There are currently no transfer pricing rules in Myanmar.
## Thin capitalisation rules
Generally, there is currently no specific safe harbour with respect to a debt-to-equity ratio for Myanmar tax purposes. The Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM) has set a maximum debt-to-equity ratio of 3:1 or 4:1 (as part of the criteria for a Myanmar entity to obtain a foreign loan).
## Controlled foreign company (CFC) regime
There are currently no CFC rules in Myanmar.
