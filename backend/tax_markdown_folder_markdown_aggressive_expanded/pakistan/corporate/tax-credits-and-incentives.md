## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
## Tax credits and exemptions
The Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (i.e the local tax law) provides for exemptions of whole or part of tax, reduced applicable tax rates, inapplicability of certain provisions, and reduction in tax liability. These exemptions are either based on specific categories of taxpayers or for a specific time period.
Significant tax credits/exemptions under the local income tax law are provided as follows:
### Certain exemptions and concessions for ‘special technology zones’ (STZs)
Dividend income and long-term capital gains from investments in zone enterprises, as defined in the STZ Ordinance, by a venture capital fund is exempt for ten years commencing from issuance of licence by the authority to the zone enterprise.
Profits and gains from the development and operations of the zones by a zone developer, as defined in the STZ Ordinance, is exempt for ten years from the date of signing of the development agreement.
Profits and gains of zone enterprises, as defined in the STZ Ordinance, is exempt for ten years from the date of issuance of licence by the authority.

Companies were earlier allowed a straight deduction against taxable income (up to 20% of taxable income) in case of donations made to certain approved institutions. Donations to these charitable institutes earlier eligible for direct deduction from income have now been transposed into the tax credit regime. As a result, the overall upper limit for tax break for the donors, in respect of charitable donations, has been reduced.
## Foreign tax credit
Where a resident taxpayer derives foreign-source income on which foreign income tax is paid within two years from the year in which it is derived, the taxpayer is allowed a tax credit equal to the lower of (i) the foreign income tax paid or (ii) the Pakistan tax payable in respect of that income. However, foreign tax paid is not refundable.
