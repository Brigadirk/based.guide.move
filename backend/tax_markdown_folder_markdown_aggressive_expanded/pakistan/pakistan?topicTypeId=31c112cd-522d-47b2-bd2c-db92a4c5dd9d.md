## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year is 1 July through 30 June.
## Tax returns and statements
An individual is required to file a return of income with the tax authorities on a fiscal year basis (1 July through 30 June). Filing of a revised return requires prior approval of the Commissioner, subject to certain limitations and conditions. The Commissioner is now also empowered to grant approval for revision of a return for a bona fide omission or wrong statement.
Every resident taxpayer filing a return of income is required to file a wealth statement (in the prescribed format) along with the return of income. The Commissioner can also require any person to furnish the said statement. For revision of a wealth statement, an intimation has to be filed with the Commissioner, who is empowered to disallow/disregard such revision in case he/she is of the view that the same has not been made for correction of bona fide errors or omissions. A taxpayer has been allowed to make revision of a wealth statement up to a period of five years.
Every resident taxpayer being an individual and having foreign income equal to or in excess of 10,000 United States dollars (USD) or having foreign assets with a value of USD 100,000 or more is now also required to file a separate statement of foreign income and foreign assets in a prescribed format. The Commissioner can also require any person to furnish such statement.
All individuals (including salaried persons) are required to file their return/wealth statement for the year ended 30 June by 30 September. Late filing shall be liable to penalty proceedings.
Persons whose income was subject to the final tax regime were previously required to file a statement prescribed in the law in lieu of a return of income; however, such requirement has now been omitted. The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) is to prescribe returns for different classes of income or persons, including those covered by the final tax regime.
## Payment of tax
Income tax is withheld from salaries by the employer. The amount to be withheld is determined by applying to the salary the average rate of tax on the estimated income of the employee for the fiscal year.
Advance tax is payable by an individual (other than a salaried individual) in four instalments if the latest assessed taxable income is in excess of PKR 1 million.
## Statute of limitations
An audit of the tax return filed by a taxpayer can be conducted by the tax authorities within five years of the end of the financial year in which the return is filed. A person whose income tax affairs have been audited in any preceding four tax years shall have immunity from selection of audit. However, amendment proceedings may be initiated other than by way of selection of audit.
Tax authorities can probe into the source of unexplained offshore assets and foreign-source income irrespective of any time limitation.
The time period to pass an amendment order is 180 days from the issuance of show cause notice.
The tax authorities mainly focus their attention on taxpayers other than salaried individuals.
