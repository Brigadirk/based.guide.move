## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
## Social security contributions
All private organisations are required to register with the Private Organisation Employees Social Security Agency (‘pension fund’). It is mandatory for all Ethiopian citizens to contribute to social security and optional for foreign citizens with Ethiopian origin. Foreign citizens with no Ethiopian origin are not allowed to contribute to the fund.
Employers are required to contribute 11% of the employee’s basic salary to the scheme, while the employee’s contribution is at 7%.
Payment must be remitted by the employer for both the employee and employer contributions within 30 days from the date of deduction. Where a company fails to pay the pension contributions for three months, the Social Security Agency has the power to deduct the contributions in arrears from the company’s bank. All banks are required to cooperate on this.
