## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
Accrued expenses are not deductible until the expenses are fixed or determined.
## Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation of all property, plant, and equipment (PP&E), which includes buildings, machinery, and vehicles, used in business to generate income is allowed as a deduction for CIT. Generally, interest on debt acquired to purchase, manufacture, or construct PP&E must be capitalised until the PP&E is operational. This does not apply to the interest associated with the expansion or improvement of existing PP&E. A detailed list of fixed assets, gross values (including capitalised interest), the useful lives of the assets, and the current year’s depreciation charge must be submitted to the tax authorities when filing the annual CIT return.
The tax law allows the following methods for calculating depreciation:
In determining depreciation using a straight-line method, salvage value of the assets is regarded as zero. However, where the declining-balance method is used, 5% salvage value is required. Changes in the depreciation method must be approved by the tax authorities in advance, and such approval may only be obtained in exceptional cases (i.e. merger between two corporations having different depreciation methods). Although the tax law specifies the standard useful lives for each type of assets, the useful life of a fixed asset can be increased or decreased by 25% of the standard useful life at the taxpayer’s election. The elected depreciation method and useful life should be consistently applied. Also, a taxpayer can apply for a change to the useful life within 50% of the standard useful life, which requires an approval from tax authorities.
The standard useful life and the scope of elective useful life for assets are provided in the following tables:
| Tangible fixed assets | Standard useful life (years) | Scope of elective useful life (years) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vehicles (excluding those used for transportation businesses and leasing service of machinery, equipment, and consumer goods), tools, equipment, and fixtures | 5 | 4 to 6 |
| Ships and aircraft (excluding those used for fishery, transportation, and leasing service of machinery, equipment, and consumer goods) | 12 | 9 to 15 |
| All buildings and constructions of brick structure, block structure, concrete structure, mud structure, mud wall structure, wooden structure, wooden frame mortar structure, and other structures | 20 | 15 to 25 |
| All the buildings and constructions of steel-frame/iron bar concrete structures, stone structures, brick/stone structures, steel-frame structures | 40 | 30 to 50 |
Note that machinery and equipment used for specific industries shall be subject to different useful lives from four years (e.g. bag manufacturing) to 20 years (e.g. water supply service).
| Intangible fixed assets | Useful life (years) |
| --- | --- |
| Goodwill, design rights, utility model rights, trademarks | 5 |
| Patents | 7 |
| Fishery rights, extraction rights under the law of development of mineral resources at the sea bottom (may elect activity method), right of management for toll roads, water rights, right of use for electricity and gas service facilities, right of use for tap water facilities for industrial use, right of use for general tap water facilities, right of use for heating facilities | 10 |
| Mining rights (may elect activity method), right of use for exclusive telegraph and telephone facilities, right of use for exclusive sidetracks, right of management for sewage disposal, right of management for tap water facilities | 20 |
| Right of use for dams | 50 |
Note that for used fixed assets (including assets acquired through mergers or spin-offs) that have been used for more than half of their standard useful lives, a new useful life may be filed with the tax authorities of between 50% of the standard useful life and the standard useful life.
According to the CITL, depreciation is generally allowed for tax deduction only when expensed for book purposes. However, in order to alleviate any dramatic increase in tax burden due to decreased depreciation expenses through the adoption of K-IFRS, additional expense deduction may be allowed through tax adjustment. For tax purposes, depreciable assets acquired by a company adopting K-IFRS on or before 2013 may be depreciated up to the tax deduction limit computed without the adoption of K-IFRS. Depreciable assets acquired by a company adopting K-IFRS after 2014 may be depreciated using the standard useful lives only if they are the same type of existing assets used for the same business line and the calculation method of deduction is regulated.

## Goodwill
Amortisable goodwill for tax purposes is defined as ‘value transferred with consideration, apart from transferred assets included in business transfer, valuated appropriately by considering business premium factors of the transferor such as permission/licence, legal privileges, geographical advantages, trade secrets, credit, reputation, transaction partners, etc.' Goodwill shall be amortised over five years using the straight-line method for tax purposes.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses, such as incorporation expenses, founders’ salary, and registration fees and taxes, are deductible if the expenses are recorded per the articles of incorporation and are actually paid.
## Interest expenses
Interest incurred in the ordinary course of business is deductible as long as the related loan is used for business purposes. There are, however, a number of exceptions to the general rule, as follows:
## Contingent liabilities
In general, contingent liabilities are not deductible, except for reserves under the following items, which are counted as deductible expense within the tax limit:
The amounts enumerated below are also counted as deductible expenses in calculating income for the business year:
## Bad debt
For companies that are not financial institutions, a doubtful accounts reserve is allowed as a deduction for tax purposes at the greater of 1% on the tax book value of the receivables at a year-end or actual bad debt ratio (deductible bad debts in a current year divided by the tax book value of receivables as of the preceding year-end). Bad debts are allowed as a deduction when certain legal proceedings are satisfied or the statute of limitations for the claims has lapsed.
## Charitable contributions
The amount in excess of such deduction limit may be carried over for ten years. Donations other than the above qualified donations will not be deductible for tax purposes.
## Employee remuneration
There is no statutory limit for employee remuneration as long as it is reasonable, which includes salaries, wages, stipends, bonuses (except bonuses paid based on the disposition of accumulated profits), retirement payments, pensions, and meal and housing allowances, as well as all other kinds of subsidies, payments, and compensation. Remuneration of foreign employees is determined according to their employment contracts.
## Pension expense
Employers hiring one or more employees are required to set aside severance pay or retirement pensions for their employees. Defined contribution (DC) and defined benefits (DB) are the two available schemes for the retirement pension system. Under the DC scheme, the premiums paid by the employer are deductible upon payment, while deductions for the reserve under the DB scheme are subject to a tax deduction limit.
## Payment for executives or directors
Bonuses paid to executives or directors in excess of the amount determined in the articles of incorporation or payment policy resolved at a shareholders’ meeting, etc. or bonuses paid based on the disposition of accumulated profits are not deductible. Also, severance benefits paid to directors in excess of the amount determined in the articles of incorporation or payment policy resolved at a shareholders’ meeting, etc. or the amount prescribed in the tax law in absence of relevant article under the articles of incorporation or payment policy are not deductible.
## Entertainment expenses
The deductible limit for entertainment expenses in a business year is computed as:
| Amount of gross receipts (KRW) | Rate |
| --- | --- |
| 10 billion or less | 0.3% |
| Over 10 billion up to 50 billion | KRW 30 million + 0.2% of the excess over KRW 10 billion |
| Greater than 50 billion | KRW 110 million + 0.03% of the excess over KRW 50 billion |
## Insurance premiums
Insurance premiums paid to an insurance company are deductible if the business enterprise is the listed beneficiary. Insurance premiums for which the beneficiary is the employee are also deductible; however, they are treated as salaries for the employees and are subject to WHT on earned income (this excludes the severance insurance premium or social security taxes that are borne by employers).
## Fines and penalties
Fines, penalties, and interest on underpayment of taxes are not deductible.
## Taxes
Income taxes are generally not deductible in determining income subject to CIT.
## Net operating losses (NOLs)
In general, an NOL carryforward is allowed for 15 years for the NOL incurred in the fiscal year starting on or after 1 January 2020 (10 years for the NOL incurred in the fiscal year starting on or after 1 January 2009). The CITL restricts a company from deducting the NOL in excess of 80% of the taxable income for the fiscal year beginning 1 January 2023 and thereafter. NOL carryforward of a Korean branch of a foreign company is also restricted to 80% of current-year taxable income. However, SMEs and certain qualifying companies under recovery process, etc., which will be exempt from this rule, are allowed to deduct the NOL carried over from prior years without limitation. Generally, NOL carryback is not allowed. However, SMEs can elect to carry back an NOL for one year if they have duly filed tax returns for the year when NOL was incurred and the preceding year.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Under the LCITA, the following conditions must be met in order for intra-group service fees, such as a management service fee charged by a foreign related party to a domestic company, to be deductible:
