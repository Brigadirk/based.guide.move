## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
Korea’s National Assembly approved the government's Bill to amend 15 tax laws, including the Corporate Income Tax Law (CITL), on 21 December 2023. The approved Bill includes measures to refine domestic global minimum tax rules, which are implemented from the fiscal year starting on or after 1 January  2024, and generally aligned with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two Model Rules and Administrative Guidance on the Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) Model Rules (note that the application of the Undertaxed Payment Rule [UTPR] will be delayed by one year, revising the effective date to 1 January 2025, in consideration of global progress in UTPR implementation). Furthermore, the Bill introduces new reporting requirements concerning offshore trusts and employee stock-based compensations to bolster regulations against tax avoidance.
Under the approved Bill, the application period for special tax for rural development is extended by ten years, lasting until 30 June 2034. This extension is intended to continuously enhance the industrial competitiveness of the agricultural and fisheries sector to cope with the expanded opening of the agricultural and fishery market.
