## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
## Social security contributions
The only mandatory social security regime in Morocco is the one managed by the *Caisse Nationale de Sécurité Sociale* (CNSS) fund.
Other private social security organisms are available in Morocco but are not mandatory.
Employees must contribute to the social security regime managed by the CNSS.
The CNSS rates are as follows and apply to the gross salary, excluding exempted allowances and indemnities:
| Contribution | Employee portion (%) | Employer portion (%) | Monthly salary limit (MAD) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Family allocation | - | 6.40 | - |
| Social allocation | 4.48 | 8.98 | 6,000 |
| Professional training | - | 1.60 | - |
| Mandatory medical care | 2.26 | 4.11 | - |
In case of the existence of a social security treaty between Morocco and another country, foreign assignees may benefit from social security exemption and continue contributing to their foreign social security regime (following the respective treaty conditions).
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is levied under the Moroccan Tax Code and is due on all industrial, commercial, and handicraft transactions taking place in Morocco, as well as on importation operations.
