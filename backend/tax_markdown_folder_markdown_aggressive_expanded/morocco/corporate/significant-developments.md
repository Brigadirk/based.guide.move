## VAT withholding tax (WHT)
The 2024 Finance Act introduced a VAT WHT system applicable to two categories as follows:
### VAT-registered suppliers of equipment
WHT must be levied on VAT due on taxable transactions carried out by suppliers of equipment who fail to present a recent certificate of tax compliance (issued by tax authorities within the past six months).
Companies carrying out transactions outside the scope of VAT or exempt from VAT without the deduction right are not required to operate the WHT.

## Revision of the corporate income tax (CIT) rates
The 2023 Finance Bill fixed the applicable CIT rates as follows:
Still, the target rates of 20% and 35% rates will not be applicable until January 2026. As such, CIT rates will progressively evolve, from 2023 to 2026, as follows:
|  | CIT rate (%) | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fiscal year (FY) | | | | |

## Social solidarity contribution (SSC)
The 2023 Finance Act extended the application of the SSC for corporate profits and professional income for the years 2023, 2024, and 2025.
The contribution is calculated as follows:
### SSC calculation method and applicable rates for companies
For companies, the SSC is calculated on the net taxable profit of the previous fiscal year according to the following proportional rates:
| Net taxable income (MAD) | SSC rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Between 1 million and 5 million | 1.5 |
| Between 5 million and 10 million | 2.5 |
| Between 10 million and 40 million | 3.5 |
| More than 40 million | 5.0 |
Companies subject to SSC must submit a declaration, by electronic means, according to a model established by the administration within three months following the closing date of the last accounting period. They must pay the amount of the contribution at the same time as the declaration referred to above.
## WHT on dividends
The 2023 Finance Law introduced a reform on the WHT rate applicable to income from shares, units, and similar income that extends to 2026. Thus, the target rate of 10% will not be applicable until January 2026. As such, the WHT rate on dividends will progressively evolve, from 2023 to 2026.
The WHT rate applicable to dividends is the one corresponding to the year in which these products were distributed as follows:
| Fiscal year | Applicable WHT rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| 2023 | 13.75 |
| 2024 | 12.50 |
| 2025 | 11.25 |
| 2026 | 10.00 |
