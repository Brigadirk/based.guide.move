## Overview
Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
The Kingdom of Morocco, a country located in the Maghreb region of North Africa, has a population of nearly 33 million and an area of 710,850 square kilometres. Morocco is a constitutional monarchy with an elected parliament. The political capital is Rabat, and the largest city is Casablanca; other large cities include Marrakesh, Tetouan, Tangier, Salé, Fes, Agadir, Meknes, and Oujda. The official language of Morocco is Arabic, and its currency is the Moroccan dirham (MAD).
Morocco is a young and dynamic country that has attracted increasingly more investments since the privatisation programme started in 1993 and due to the liberalisation of its markets.
Foreign investments in Morocco have expanded from the traditional domains of textiles, fishing, and agriculture to those presenting greater added value, such as energy, infrastructure, transport, telecommunications, financial services, and others.
The European Union (EU) is Morocco’s primary trading partner, providing 65% of Morocco’s imports and receiving 70% of Morocco’s exports.
