## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Residents
Resident legal entities making payments to individuals (other than salary payments) must withhold and pay WHT to the MTA at the following rates:
## Non-residents
The following WHT rates apply upon payments to non-residents:
## Double tax treaties (DTTs)
The DTTs in force between Moldova and other countries may provide for more favourable tax rates than those provided by the local provisions. For their application, the foreign beneficiary of such income should provide the paying entity with its fiscal residency certificate before the payments are actually made. The Moldovan tax law expressly provides that the DTTs prevail over the national provisions. The only exception refers to the case where the domestic norms provide for more favourable tax rates (i.e. in such circumstances, the domestic ones shall apply).
Currently, Moldova has 50 operational DTTs, as outlined below:
