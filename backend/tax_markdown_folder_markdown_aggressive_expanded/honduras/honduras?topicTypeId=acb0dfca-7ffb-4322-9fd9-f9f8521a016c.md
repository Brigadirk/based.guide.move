# Honduras
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
Income is computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting and commercial principles, subject to certain adjustments required by the tax law.
## Inventory valuation
Inventories are generally valued using the first in first out (FIFO), last in first out (LIFO), and weighted-average cost methods.
## Capital gains
## Dividend income
The income from dividends is considered ‘other income’, thus non-taxable under the general income tax rates. The dividends for resident individuals or entities are subject to a 10% WHT.
There is a 10% WHT rate applicable on the dividends paid to non-residents as well.
Any dividends or distribution of profits that were subject to the corresponding 10% dividend WHT will not be taxed again in case of redistribution.
### Stock dividends
In principle, stock dividends are also not taxable if considered as a capitalisation of the entity. Any transaction should be specifically evaluated.
## Interest income
Honduran Bank interests are subject to a 10% WHT at the moment the interest is given, when the sum is over HNL 50,000. Interests from abroad are considered as other income. For income tax reconciliation, interest income is considered non-taxable when subject to the 10% WHT.
## Royalty income
Royalties are taxed in the same manner as general income if the recipient is a local company or branch. If the recipient is a non-resident, then the application of a WHT will apply.
## Foreign income
Deferral and anti-deferral of foreign income are not regulated in Honduras.
