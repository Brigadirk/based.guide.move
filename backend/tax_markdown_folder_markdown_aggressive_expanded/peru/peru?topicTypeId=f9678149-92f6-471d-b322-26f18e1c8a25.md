## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Social security contributions
### Health contributions
Employers are obligated to make monthly health contribution payments equal to 9% of the total compensation paid to the employee.
Employees must choose affiliation with either the National Health System (*EsSalud*) or the Private Health System (*Entidades Promotoras de Salud* or EPS). 25% of the amount paid to the EPS may be used as a credit against *EsSalud* contributions.
### Pension funds contributions
Employers must apply monthly withholdings for pension funds contributions equal to (i) 13% of the compensation received by the employee in cases where the employee is affiliated with the National Pension System or (ii) approximately 12.5% in cases where the employee is affiliated with the Private Pension System (in this case, 10% corresponds to their personal pension account and almost 2.5% to insurance and commissions for managing the fund).
Should a foreign individual’s labour contract end and the individual leaves Peru, the pension funds deposited in the Private Pension System (the aforementioned 10%) can be transferred to their pension fund abroad or wired to an account of the employee in a foreign bank if no individual pension fund abroad is available.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
## Property taxes
## Luxury and excise taxes
The sale of specific goods, including fuel, cigarettes, beer, liquor, and vehicles, is subject to excise tax. Since September 2018, gambling and betting, such as casino games, slot machines, lotteries, bingo, raffles, draws, and equestrian events, are subject to excise tax.
Excise tax rates, and the manner in which the tax is applied, depend on the type of goods or services.
## Temporary Regime to repatriate income
An exceptional Regime was established for taxpayers domiciled in the country who decided to declare or repatriate and invest in Peru the foreign income that was not included in their tax returns. This included tax debts generated until December 31, 2022.
The tax rate was of 10%. If the money was repatriated and kept in the country for twelve months, the tax rate could be of 7%.
