## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Foreign tax credit
Pursuant to the PITL, taxpayers may deduct the foreign income taxes paid due to their foreign-source income levied by the PITL, provided that it doesn't exceed the amount that results from applying the average rate of the taxpayer to the incomes obtained abroad, or the tax paid abroad. The amount that, for any circumstance, is not used in the corresponding fiscal year cannot be set off (or compensated) in others fiscal years or be refunded.
