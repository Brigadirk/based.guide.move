## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Inventory valuation
The first in first out (FIFO), average, specific-identification, retail, and normal or base-stock methods are allowed for inventory valuation. The last in first out (LIFO) method is not permitted.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are taxed as ordinary income. However, capital gains derived from the sale of stock issued by a Peruvian company through the Lima Stock Exchange are taxed at a 5% rate, provided that the seller is a non-domiciled party.
Indirect transfer of Peruvian shares is also subject to income tax in Peru, provided certain requirements are met.
## Dividend income
Dividends distributed to domiciled individuals and non-domiciled taxpayers (entities or individuals) are subject to WHT. Nevertheless, dividends distributed to domiciled entities are not subject to any taxes.
If the dividends distributed correspond to earnings obtained up to fiscal year 2014, the WHT applicable will be 4.1%. If the dividends correspond to earnings obtained in fiscal years 2015 and 2016, the WHT applicable will be 6.8%. For dividends generated from fiscal year 2017 onwards, the WHT applicable will be 5%.
## Interest income
The PITL establishes that the WHT rate on interest arising from loans for non-resident corporations is 4.99%, provided the following requirements are met:
If the loan does not comply with these requirements, a WHT rate of 30% would be applicable.
## Royalty income
Royalties paid to non-domiciled parties are subject to a 30% withholding rate, to the extent that the goods or rights generating royalties are economically used in the country or the royalties are paid by a domiciled taxpayer.
## Foreign income
A Peruvian corporation is taxed on Peruvian and foreign-source income. For active income of foreign source, the company must pay taxes in the fiscal year in which the earned income is accrued. For passive income, the company must pay taxes in the fiscal year in which the income is perceived.
