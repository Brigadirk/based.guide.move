# Isle of Man
## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
## Key employees
Legislation was introduced with effect from 6 April 2020 that replaced an extra statutory concession relating to special treatment of key employees.
The special treatment is aimed at individuals who are or will be new residents and who are essential to the implementation and the operation of new business in the Island.
Subject to fulfilling certain conditions, for the first three years after becoming resident for tax purposes, the income of the individual will be treated as if they were not resident in the Island.
