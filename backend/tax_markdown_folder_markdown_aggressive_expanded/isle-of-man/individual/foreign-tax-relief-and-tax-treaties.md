## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
## Foreign tax relief
The Isle of Man grants tax credit relief for foreign tax suffered by the individual equal to the lower of the foreign tax suffered and the individual's marginal Isle of Man tax rate.
## Tax treaties
As of 31 December 2024, the Isle of Man has entered into 11 comprehensive double tax agreements (DTAs), 13 limited-scope DTAs, and 39 tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs) based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) models.
Information has been exchanged with the United States (US) with effect from 30 June 2015 under an agreement to improve international tax compliance and to implement the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA).
The United Kingdom (UK) and Isle of Man governments have been exchanging additional information with effect from 30 June 2016 under an agreement extending the automatic disclosure of tax information. The agreement is modelled on the requirements of FATCA.
The Isle of Man has also adopted the Common Reporting Standard (CRS), the global standard for tax information agreements.
