## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 19 December 2024
## Taxable period
## Tax returns
Individuals who obtain income only from employment (i.e. an employer) and do not benefit from the deduction for expenses on education, health, and professional services are not obligated to submit an annual income tax return.
The annual individual income tax return (Form IR-106) is applicable for taxpayers who obtain income from two or more employers that, in the aggregate, exceed an annual income of NIO 100,000. The taxpayer should submit the annual income tax return within 90 days after year-end.
## Payment of tax
The employer, through the payroll, is responsible to withhold and pay the income tax on a monthly basis through withholding income tax return Form IR-122.
For those individuals filing the annual individual income tax return (Form IR-106), the final tax payment is due within 90 days after year-end.
