# Croatia
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 07 January 2025
## Inventory valuation
Inventories are generally valued at the lower of their acquisition cost or net realisable value. Taking into consideration the accounting principles set out in the Accounting Act and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) or Croatian Financial Reporting Standards (CFRS), a company can choose to adopt the most favourable method.
## Capital gains
Capital gains or losses are covered by the CIT regime. They are either an increasing or decreasing item to the CIT base.
## Dividend income
Dividend and profit shares payments made to resident companies are not taxable. Dividends and profit shares paid to non-resident companies are taxed at the WHT rate of 10 %. *Please see the* *Withholding taxes* *section for more information*.
## Interest income
Interest income on loans between related companies has to be determined at the minimum interest rate prescribed by the Ministry of Finance as calculated and published by the Croatian National Bank (the rate is 3.25 % for 2024). An alternative approach (instead of the interest rate prescribed by the Minister of Finance) is that the interest rate can be determined according to the transfer pricing rules, if applied to all contracts.
## Royalty income
## Foreign income
The tax base of a resident taxpayer subject to CIT is the profit earned both in Croatia and abroad, excluding the case where the taxpayer has registered a branch office abroad and taking into account the provisions of respective DTTs.
