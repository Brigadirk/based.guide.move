# Botswana
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 19 April 2024
## Taxable period
Botswana has a fiscal year ending on 30 June. However, a business may select its own accounting year, which may end on a date other than 30 June. This accounting year is accepted for the computation of the company’s taxable income.
## Tax returns
Botswana requires self-assessment, which means that the return submitted constitutes the assessment. The system is one that requires all corporate taxpayers to file tax returns in standard format (providing information relating to taxable income earned) within four months after the financial year-end of the company.
## Payment of tax
Under the self-assessment tax procedures for corporates, if the tax payable for a tax year exceeds BWP 50,000, then estimated tax is required to be paid in equal quarterly instalments over the period of 12 months ending on the company’s financial year-end date. Accordingly, the first quarterly payment should be made within three months of the beginning of the financial year and the balance quarterly payments at three monthly intervals thereafter. The final (balance) payment, if any, is to be made within four months from the end of the financial year, when submitting the return.
Where the tax is less than BWP 50,000, then the tax is payable within four months from the company’s financial year-end date.
## Tax audit process
There is no prescribed audit process, and an audit can be initiated by any factor as determined by the BURS. The audit or inspection will commence with a request from the BURS for the taxpayer to make available any such records or information as may be required.
## Statute of limitations
The assessment should be made any time prior to the expiry of four years after the end of the tax year to which it relates to. Tax returns submitted that have been assessed may not be reopened after a period of four years from date of assessment by the BURS.
The BURS is focusing on encouraging electronic filing for all the taxpayers.
