## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 27 December 2024
Taxable profits are defined as a positive difference between a taxpayer’s gross income and deductible expenses. Gross income encompasses all revenues received by a taxpayer from all economic activities, unless the revenues are expressly exempt from inclusion under the law. Deductible expenses encompass activities that result in a decrease in assets or increase in liabilities attributable to the activities carried out by an organisation, an individual entrepreneur, or a notary, which, in turn, results in a reduction in the equity of the organisation or the net assets of the sole proprietor or notary.
## Inventory valuation
Inventories are stated at their cost. First in first out (FIFO) or average cost methods of valuation are generally used for tax purposes.
The assets’ revaluation is not considered for CIT purposes, unless the revaluation of certain assets is prescribed under the law.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are included in taxable income. Non-residents are taxable on the realised capital gains from the increase of the value of the assets located in Armenia.
Capital gains, excluding those from disposal of securities, are taxed at a rate of 10%. If securities are disposed of after being held for more than two years, they are not subject to taxation. However, if securities are disposed of within two years of acquisition, the following applies: those securities held in other organisations are taxed at 18%, while securities not held in other organisations are subject to a 0% withholding tax (WHT).
## Dividend income
The dividend income should be considered received on the day of the decision by the shareholders to distribute dividends.
## Interest income
Interest income attracts normal CIT treatment.
## Royalty income
Royalty income attracts normal CIT treatment.
## Foreign income
Resident entities are liable to Armenian tax on their worldwide income. Foreign taxes should be available for credit against Armenian tax liabilities, up to the amount of Armenian tax payable on the foreign income.
There are no provisions in the Tax Code allowing any tax deferral on income earned abroad.
