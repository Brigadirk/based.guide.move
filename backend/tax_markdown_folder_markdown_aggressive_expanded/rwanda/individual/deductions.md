## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 20 July 2024
## Employment expenses
An individual may claim a deduction for any expense incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of employment income.
## Personal deductions
There are no tax allowable personal deductions provided for in the law.
## Standard deductions
There are no standard deductions provided for in Rwanda.
## Personal allowances
There are no specific personal allowances provided for in the Rwandan law.
## Business deductions
The law allows for deduction of expenses that are wholly and exclusively used in the production of income. The expenses should satisfy the following conditions:
## Losses
Where the deductions and allowances permissible under Rwandan law exceed income, an assessed loss results, which may be carried forward for set-off against income earned in future years. The tax losses can be carried forward for a period of five years.
However, the revenue authority may authorise the taxpayer who applies to carry forward the losses for more than five years if one fulfils certain requirements determined by an Order of the Minister.
Foreign-sourced losses cannot be deducted from either present or future domestic sourced business profits.
