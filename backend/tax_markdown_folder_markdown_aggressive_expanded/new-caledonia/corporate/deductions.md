## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 16 April 2024
## Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation is allowed as a deductible expense from taxable profits when it meets the following conditions:
Depreciation ceases to be tax deductible when it has reached, in total, the amount of the cost price. The cost price to be used generally means the actual acquisition price that the item involved for the company, as it results in principle from the accounting.
In the straight-line system, the annual depreciation to be deducted from the results of each fiscal year is calculated by applying to the cost price the rate corresponding to the normal duration of use of the element.
Equipment goods whose normal useful life is at least three years and industrial or agricultural buildings whose normal useful life does not exceed 15 years can be depreciated using the declining-balance method.
The coefficient applicable to the linear depreciation rate is, for each fixed asset, set at:
## Start-up expenses
The New Caledonian law provides specific rules for certain new companies, particularly when they set up in a free zone or when they can be qualified as young innovative companies (*jeunes entreprises innovantes*).
## Interest expenses
Interest paid to shareholders for the sums they leave or make available to the company, in addition to their share of the capital, whatever the form of the company, is deductible within the higher of the following two rates:
The legal interest rate is the rate determined by Article L. 313-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code.
This deduction is subject to the condition that the capital has been fully paid up.
## Charitable contributions
As a general principle, charitable donations are not tax deductible for CIT purposes. However, they may entitle one to an incentive (*see the [Tax credits and incentives](tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for more information regarding the charitable donations tax reduction*).
## Payments to directors
The fixed allowances that a company grants to its directors or executives of its company for representation and travel expenses are not deductible from tax results when these expenses already include the usual expenses of this nature reimbursed to the interested parties. Moreover, expenses that are excessive and not incurred for business purposes, including direct or indirect remuneration, paid to directors or persons with the highest remuneration in the company are not deductible from the taxable result.
## Fines and penalties
As a general principle, fines and penalties are not tax deductible for CIT purposes.
## Taxes
The TSS and the CAIS are not tax deductible for CIT purposes.
## Other significant items
Overhead costs of any kind are generally tax deductible for CIT purposes. However, companies having their head office or effective management outside New Caledonia may deduct from the amount of their taxable profit the share of general expenses incurred at the place of the head office or management relating to activities carried out in New Caledonia, within the limit of 5% of the amount of external services required by said activities. This deduction is subject to the following cumulative conditions:
When these conditions are not met, the share of the costs deducted is reinstated in taxable income without a rectification proposal.
At the first request from the administration, a justification of the interest of the costs for the business operated in New Caledonia is produced within three months.
Royalties that mining companies pay to shareholders who have, directly or indirectly, a majority stake in the company's capital are not deductible for the purposes of CIT.
## Net operating losses
### Carryforward of tax losses
Tax losses can be offset against long-term capital gain of the fiscal year.
Tax losses carried forward are available to offset the entire taxable profits of the following fiscal years and can be carried forward indefinitely.
### Carryback of tax losses
As a general principle, carryback of tax losses is not allowed, except for metallurgical and mining companies.
## Payments to foreign entities
