## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 16 April 2024
## Employment income
Employment income is widely defined and includes all employment benefits provided by the employer, whether in cash or in kind. Business expense reimbursements are not taxable. Benefits-in-kind are, as a general rule, included in income at market value. Moreover, employment income also includes the indemnities, reimbursements, and lump-sum allowances for expenses paid to members of the management board or managers of companies.
## Business income
Profits or gains derived from trades, professions, or vocations carried out in New Caledonia are subject to tax regardless of whether the individual is resident of New Caledonia. If the individual is resident in New Caledonia, a liability may also arise on profits or gains on activities carried out abroad unless tax treaties provided otherwise.
## Capital gains
## Dividend income
Dividends received from resident companies are not subject to PIT. However, the following withholding taxes (WHTs) amount to 20%: IRVM (11.5%), CCS (4%), and *centimes additionnels* (4.5%).
## Interest income
Interest and related income are subject to the IRCDC (8%) and the CCS (4%).
## Rental income
Rental income is equal to the difference between the gross rent and the costs representing property expenses.
