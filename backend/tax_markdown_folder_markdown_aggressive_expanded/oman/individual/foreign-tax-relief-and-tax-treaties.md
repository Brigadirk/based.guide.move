## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 01 January 2025
## Foreign tax relief
There is currently no PIT law enacted in Oman; consequently, foreign tax relief is not separately provided for under Oman domestic tax law. However, specific rules under a particular double tax treaty (DTT) in force between Oman and another country should be referred to.
## Tax treaties
Oman has DTTs with the following countries:
| Belarus | Italy | Qatar | Thailand |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Brunei | Japan | Russia | Tunisia |
| Canada | Korea | Seychelles | Turkey |
| China | Lebanon | Singapore | United Kingdom |
| Croatia | Mauritius | Slovakia | Uzbekistan |
| France | Moldova | South Africa | Vietnam |
| Hungary | Morocco | Spain |  |
| India | Netherlands | Switzerland |  |
| Iran | Pakistan | Syria |  |
