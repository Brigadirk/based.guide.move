The Oman Tax Authority (OTA) had previously implemented the Digital Tax Stamp system for excisable products, including cigarettes, shisha, and other tobacco products. In July 2023, the OTA aimed to expand this system to encompass carbonated drinks, energy drinks, and sweetened beverages. However, this initiative was subsequently suspended. In October 2024, the OTA decided to enforce the provisions for carbonated beverages, sweetened beverages, and energy drinks, effective from 1 February 2025.
