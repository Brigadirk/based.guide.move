## Overview
Last reviewed - 01 January 2025
Oman, an Arab country located on the southeast coast of the Arabian Peninsula, is bordered by the United Arab Emirates to the northwest, Saudi Arabia to the west, and Yemen to the southwest. Oman is divided into five regions and four governorates, with Muscat as the capital. The official language of Oman is Arabic, and the currency is the Omani Rial (OMR).
Oman has a middle-income economy that is heavily dependent on dwindling oil resources. As a result of declining reserves, Oman actively pursues a development plan that focuses on diversification, industrialisation, and privatisation, with the objective of reducing the oil sector's contribution to gross domestic product (GDP).
In 2016, the Tanfeedh initiative was enacted with the focus of enhancing economic diversification within the Sultanate and sustaining participation between the public and private sectors. The key components of the government's diversification strategy under the Tanfeedh initiatives are manufacturing, tourism, transport, logistics, mining, and fisheries.
With 100% foreign ownership now available to foreign investors in multiple sectors, Oman has also been attracting a large amount of foreign investment. The government has outlined initiatives to modernise the local economy and privatise state utilities. A significant increase in government spending and foreign direct investment has led to the development of the following sectors:
