## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
## Foreign tax relief
Double taxation is avoided by way of a foreign tax credit mechanism that applies unilaterally in the absence of an applicable DTT. The foreign tax credit is limited to the Israeli tax payable with respect to the same income. Foreign-sourced income is divided into categories (baskets) on the basis of the income source (e.g. dividends, business income), and a particular credit limitation applies to each basket. Excess uncredited foreign income can be carried forward for the subsequent five tax years.
