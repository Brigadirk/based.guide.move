## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
## Personal tax credits
Residents are entitled to personal tax credits against their tax liabilities according to their status. Each point is worth ILS 242 per month, with resident individuals being entitled to a minimum of 2.25 points. Additional points are granted for, among other items, dependent children, new immigrants, and single-parent families.
Foreign residents are not entitled to personal tax credits.
## Charitable contributions
Donations to recognised public institutions entitle the taxpayer to a tax credit of 35% from donations that in aggregate are not less than ILS 207, provided the donations do not exceed 30% of annual taxable income or ILS 10,354,816, whichever is less. Excess donation amounts can be carried forward for three years under certain circumstances.
## Tax benefits for new immigrants and returning residents
New immigrants and returning residents (who were foreign residents for a continuous period of at least ten years and returned to Israel to become an Israeli tax resident after such period) may enjoy the following tax benefits upon becoming tax resident in Israel (returning residents from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2009 may enjoy these benefits where they were foreign resident for at least five years):
Pursuant to certain transition provisions, an individual will qualify for the above benefits if one has returned to Israeli tax resident status in 2007, 2008, or 2009 after having been a foreign resident for a continuous period of at least five years (rather than requiring the above mentioned ten-year period).
A returning resident, who was a foreign resident for only six years before returning to Israeli residency status, shall enjoy the following:
Detailed rules apply to the above provisions. This subject matter is complex and requires review of each person's specific facts and circumstances.
## Special deductions for qualifying expatriates

Additional qualifying conditions apply.
A non-resident who is granted ‘foreign expert’ status is entitled to deduct from Israeli taxable income the following items for a period not exceeding 12 months of employment in Israel:
'Approved specialists’ (non-residents approved by the director of the Investment Centre at the Ministry of Industry and Trade), provided they are experts who possess skills not readily available locally, are taxed at a maximum rate of 25% on their earnings for a period of three years, with a possible extension of up to a further five years. They are also entitled to the benefits available to foreign experts in the first 12 months. Approval is generally given on income up to 75,000 United States dollars (USD) *per annum*.
