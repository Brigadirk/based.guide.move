# El Salvador
## Overview
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
El Salvador, the smallest and most densely populated country in Central America, is the former site of the ancient Pipil civilisation. It was conquered by Spain in 1524, under whose rule the capital city of San Salvador was founded by Diego de Holguin and Gonzalo de Alvarado in 1525. El Salvador declared its independence from Spain on 15 September 1821 as the Central American Federation, which was dissolved in 1839. El Salvador is a democratic republic governed by a president, and Spanish is the official language. Its currency is the United States dollar (USD); additionally, on 8 June 2021, the Legislative Assembly approved bitcoin as a legal tender, effective on 7 September 2021.
In general, El Salvador has always adopted an open attitude towards foreign direct investment, and the country is basing its development strategy on a policy of openness to trade, investment, and international competitive pressures.
