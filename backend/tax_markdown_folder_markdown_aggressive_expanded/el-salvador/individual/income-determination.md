Income is understood to cover the taxpayer's overall income collected during the tax period in question, either in cash or in-kind, from sources such as labour, business activities, capital, and generally all types of income, gains, benefits, or profits, whatever their origin might be, as well as condoned debt.
## Employment income
Taxable compensation of employees, resident or non-resident, covers all types of income whether in cash or in-kind (e.g. salaries, bonuses, overtime, paid vacations, housing and car allowances, reimbursement for tax and children's educational expenses, benefits-in-kind).

Capital gains are taxed at a flat 10% rate, except when the asset is realised within the 12 months following the date of acquisition, in which case capital gains are taxed as ordinary income. Capital losses can be offset by capital gains only. Whenever capital losses exceed capital gains, the balance may be offset against future capital gains for up to five years.
