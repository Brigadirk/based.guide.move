VAT is levied on exports at a rate of 0%. Foreign-source income is not subject to VAT.
VAT paid by a registered taxpayer company on its purchases (tax credits) is credited against VAT charged to its customers (tax debits) on a monthly basis.
VAT returns are filed on a monthly basis within the first ten working days of each month following the period under taxation.
## Customs duties
In El Salvador, the *Arancel Centroamericano de Importación* (Central America Import Duty) is applied, which is constituted in the *Sistema Arancelario Centroamericano* (SAC) (Duty Central American System) and its correspondent duties for import.
All duties for import are *ad valorem* and are applied at the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) value of the merchandise. The duty is common for all the countries in Central America.
## Excise taxes
### Tax on simple or sweetened soft drinks
An *ad valorem* tax on simple or sweetened soft drinks is levied at the rate of 10% over the selling price to the public as suggested by the manufacturer, importer, or distributor, excluding VAT and returnable bottle taxes.
### Tax on the production and importation of alcohol and spirits
A tax is levied on domestically produced or imported alcohol and spirits at rates ranging from USD 0.09 to USD 0.16 for each 1% of alcohol volume per litre or in proportion thereof. Spirits and alcohol also have an *ad valorem* tax levied at the rate of 8% over the suggested selling price to the public, excluding VAT.
### Tax on tobacco products
A tax is levied at USD 0.005 per cigarette, cigar, little cigarette, or other tobacco product. Also, an *ad valorem* tax is levied at the rate of 39% over the suggested consumer selling price to the public, excluding VAT.
### Tax on stimulated beverages
A specific tax of USD 0.20 per litre of stimulated or energy drinks will be applied. In case the aforementioned beverages are packaged in volumes greater or less than one litre, the calculation of the tax will be applied in proportion to its volume. In addition, a 5% ad-valorem tax will be applied on the suggested price of retail sale.
## Tax on transfer of real estate property
A 3% tax is applied to transfers of real estate property. This tax is applied to the amount by which the value of the real estate exceeds USD 28,571.43.
## Stamp taxes
No stamp taxes are assessed as the pertinent law was abrogated in 1992.
## Capital gains tax
Capital gains are taxed at a flat rate of 10% of net profits, except when gains are realised within 12 months following the purchase date, in which case they are taxed as ordinary income. Capital gains for securities are also subject to capitals gains tax; however, the 12-months rule described above does not apply for securities.
Capital losses can only be offset against capital gains. Whenever capital losses exceed capital gains, the remaining balance may be carried forward to future capital gains within a five-year period.
According to the Bitcoin Law, exchanges in bitcoins will not be subject to capital gains tax or any legal tender. The Bitcoin Law is in effect as of 7 September 2021.
