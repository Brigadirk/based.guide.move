# Jersey, Channel Islands
## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 08 January 2025
## Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Pillar Two
On 22 May 2024, the Government of Jersey announced that its domestic minimum tax would take the form of a new standalone multinational corporate income tax which would be aligned with the OECD GloBE Model Rules.
Draft legislation introducing Jersey’s ‘Multinational Corporate Income Tax’ (“MCIT”) was published on 14 August 2024. As expected, this is largely aligned with OECD GloBE Model Rules, adopting many of the definitions directly into Jersey’s domestic law.
The draft MCIT legislation was adopted by the States of Jersey on 22nd October 2024, with the law coming into effect for accounting periods starting on or after 1 January 2025.
For accounting periods starting on or after 1 January 2025, in-scope Jersey companies and branches of multinational groups will pay an effective tax rate of 15% under the new MCIT.
Jersey will not be enacting a UTPR at this time.
## Economic substance
### Companies
Jersey introduced economic substance legislation for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Jersey tax resident companies carrying on relevant activities will be required to meet an economic substance test.
Relevant activities are defined as any of the following businesses:
Self-managed funds are required to demonstrate they have substance in Jersey for any financial period that commences on or after 1 January 2021. Self-managed funds are always treated as having received income from the relevant activity of fund management, so the gross income test does not apply.
There are financial penalties in the case of failure to meet the economic substance test. In the first financial period up to 10,000 British pounds sterling (GBP), in the second period up to GBP 100,000. After the first penalty, the Comptroller may provide the Minister for Treasury and Resources with a report on the company, and the Minister may apply to the court for an order of winding up. There is provision for appeal against penalty determinations.
The requirements for companies with regards to the economic substance test dictate that they must be directed and managed in Jersey, undertake their core income generating activities (CIGA) in Jersey, and have adequate employees, expenditure, and physical assets in Jersey.
### Partnerships
On 29 June 2021, a law extending Jersey's economic substance regime to partnerships was passed. The economic substance requirements will apply to a Jersey 'resident partnership' undertaking a 'relevant activity' unless it is exempt.
The exemptions are detailed as follows:
Partnerships in existence before 1 July 2021 are in scope of the law for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2022. Partnerships formed on or after 1 July 2021 are in scope from the date of formation.
The law is broadly aligned with the company economic substance regime, summarised above, although there are points of divergence particularly relating to exemptions and sanctions for failing the economic substance test.
