## Risky taxpayers and transaction without substance
The concept of risky taxpayers and transaction without substance was newly introduced and became effective from 1 January 2020.
A non-commodity transaction is an operation discovered in the course of tax control and is formalised to generate profit without the provision of goods, works, and services.
The Law envisages the following with regards to the taxation of risky taxpayers:
Documents related with the transactions without substance, as well as electronic delivery notes issued by a risky taxpayer, will not be treated as a basis for recovery of value-added tax (VAT) from the state budget.
For profit tax purposes, the value of goods delivered by risky taxpayers will be calculated based on the market price and related information.
