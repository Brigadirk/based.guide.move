# Azerbaijan
## Overview
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
Azerbaijan is located on the south-eastern frontiers of the European continent and serves as the geographical bridge between Europe and Central Asia; it is also a convenient economic and energy route from Northern Europe to the Middle East. Azerbaijan is bounded by the Caspian Sea to the east, Russia to the north, Georgia to the northwest, Armenia to the west, and Iran to the south. It has a presidential republic form of government, with Baku as the capital. The official currency in Azerbaijan is the Azerbaijani manat (AZN), and the official language is Azerbaijani.
With a history of industrial development of more than 100 years, Azerbaijan proved to be an economic powerhouse in the Southern Caucasus throughout the turmoil of the Soviet Union collapse in the early 1990s. After Azerbaijan regained its independence in 1991, the Republic conducted a lengthy period of transition from a Soviet-style command economy into a modern, market-driven economy, concentrated on the production and export of its hydrocarbon resources.
Azerbaijan is a leading exporter of oil and natural gas. Oil production under the first production sharing agreements (PSAs) with the Azerbaijan International Operating Company (AIOC) began in November 1997.
Meanwhile, in spite of the fact that oil remains a key driver of gross domestic product (GDP), the non-oil sector is rapidly growing in Azerbaijan. In 2022, Azerbaijan’s GDP grew by 4.6%, while the non-oil sector of the economy recorded 9% growth.
On 21 February 2015, Azerbaijan’s Central Bank devalued the manat 33.5% against the United States dollar and 30% against the euro. The highest appreciation of the real exchange rate of Azerbaijan’s national currency since the devaluation of 2015 occurred in the last 10 months of 2020. In 2020, the real exchange rate of the manat in the non-oil sector rose by 6.6%.
