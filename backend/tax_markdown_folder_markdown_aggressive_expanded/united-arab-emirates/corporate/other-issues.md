# United Arab Emirates
## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 21 February 2025
## Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS)
The UAE joined the G20 / OECD Inclusive Framework on BEPS (the 'Inclusive Framework') in 2018. Through joining the Inclusive Framework, the United Arab Emirates has committed to implement, in the immediate to short term, the following 4 BEPS minimum standards Actions:
The UAE has also committed to implement the other 11 BEPS Actions in the medium to long term.
The UAE has signed and ratified the BEPS Multilateral Instrument (MLI). The key positions that the UAE decided to adopt include:
In respect of the remaining measures included under the UAE MLI position, the UAE has opted to agree specific changes to its DTTs through bilateral negotiation.
## BEPS 2.0 Pillar Two and DMTT in the UAE
On 9 December 2024, the UAE Ministry of Finance announced updates in relation to UAE CT Law. These include:
The Pillar Two rules require large multinational enterprises (MNEs) to pay a minimum effective tax rate of 15% on profits in every country where they operate. The DMTT will apply to multinational enterprises operating in the UAE with consolidated global revenues of EUR750 million or more in at least two out of the four financial years immediately preceding the financial year in which the DMTT applies. The UAE’s implementation of the DMTT will closely align with the OECD’s GloBE Model Rules.
Further, Cabinet Decision No. 142 of 31 December 2024 introduced the detailed legislation on the UAE DMTT including cases, provisions, conditions, rules, controls, and procedures. It is broadly aligned with the OECD’s Inclusive Framework (IF).
The UAE continues to enhance its business-friendly environment, reflecting its commitment to national strategic objectives such as strengthening economic competitiveness and improving ease of doing business. To promote sustainable growth, innovation, and investment, the Ministry of Finance is currently considering the introduction of the following Corporate Tax Incentives under Federal Decree-Law No. 47 of 2022.
Another incentive being considered is a refundable tax credit for high-value employment activities. This aims to encourage businesses to engage in activities that deliver significant economic benefits, stimulate innovation, and enhance the UAE’s global competitiveness. This incentive is proposed to take effect from 1 January 2025 and will be granted as a percentage of eligible salary costs for employees engaged in high-value employment activities. This includes C-suite executives and other senior personnel performing core business functions that add substantial value to the UAE economy.
The final form and implementation of the above mentioned proposed incentives are subject to legislative approvals.
## Economic substance regulations
### In scope entities
The Economic Substance Regulations (ESR) apply to all UAE Licensees that undertook  one or more of the "Relevant Activities" during the ESR Period, i.e. only for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2019 and ending on or before 31 December 2022.
The "Relevant Activities" are listed below:
Only the licensees that undertake a "Relevant Activity" and earn income from such "Relevant Activity" during the ESR Period are required to satisfy the applicable economic substance test. The ESR does not apply to non-UAE tax resident entities, investment funds and their underlying holding entities (except for self-managed investment funds), wholly UAE resident owned UAE entities with domestic transactions only (that are not part of a multinational group), and UAE branches of foreign companies that are subject to the corporate tax on all their “Relevant Income” in a foreign jurisdiction.
### Compliance requirements
There are two filing requirements, being:
The notification and substance report should be submitted electronically via the MoF online portal within 6 and 12 months of the financial year end of the UAE Licensee, respectively. These filings must be made on an annual basis, if applicable.
### Consequences of non-compliance
In addition to exchanging information with foreign authorities and the ultimate parent and beneficial owners of the UAE Licensee, failure to demonstrate adequate substance would result in administrative penalties (AED 50,000 in the first year of failure, increased to an amount of AED 400,000 for a consecutive year of failure). Additional penalties, such as suspending, revoking, or not renewing the UAE Licensee’s trade or commercial licence, could also apply.
Other administrative penalties include: (i) AED 20,000 for failure to submit the notification; (ii) AED 50,000 for failure to submit the annual substance report, as well as deemed failure to meet the economic substance test; and (iii) AED 50,000 for providing inaccurate information, as well as deemed failure of the economic substance test.
## United States (US) Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
In 2015, the United Arab Emirates signed the Model 1B Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the United States, which came into force in 2016 (US-UAE Model 1 IGA), with the US Internal Revenue Services (IRS) regarding the exchange of information related to US individuals and certain type of US-owned entities, with an effective date of 1 July 2014.
The domestic legislative provisions to implement FATCA in the United Arab Emirates are set in Cabinet Resolution No. 63 of 2022 (UAE FATCA Regulations).
The exchange of information is conducted on an annual basis, occurring in September of each year, between the UAE competent authority and the US IRS. UAE reporting financial institutions for FATCA purposes need to submit their FATCA returns to their relevant financial regulator (or the UAE MoF for unregulated entities) by 30 June of each year (unless otherwise informed). Filing of nil reports is required under FATCA.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
In 2017, the UAE signed the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) on Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information, and the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (MAC) was signed in 2017.
The exchange of information is conducted on an annual basis, occurring in September of each year, between the UAE competent authority and competent authorities of jurisdictions which have agreed to exchange information with the UAE.
The domestic legislative provisions to implement the CRS in the United Arab Emirates are set in Cabinet Resolution No. 93 of 2021 (UAE CRS Regulations).
UAE reporting financial institutions for CRS purposes need to submit their CRS returns to their relevant financial regulators (or the UAE MoF for unregulated entities) by 30 June of each year (unless otherwise informed). Filing of nil reports is required under the CRS.
