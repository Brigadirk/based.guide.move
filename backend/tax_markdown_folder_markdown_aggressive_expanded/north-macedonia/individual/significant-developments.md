According to the recent amendments, a 10% flat tax rate will apply on an individual's income from work, self-employment income, income from royalties and industrial property rights, income from sale of own agricultural products, rental income, income from capital, capital gains, and insurance income, as well as other taxable income not categorised separately in the legislation. The tax rate on the gains realised from games of chance will remain 15%.
The taxation of capital gains from sale of securities and shares released from investment is applicable from 1 January 2023 onwards. The taxation of interest on termed deposits is postponed until accession of North Macedonia to the European Union (EU).
