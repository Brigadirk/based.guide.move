## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 18 February 2025
Capital gains, as well as income from dividends, interest, rent, and royalties are treated as ordinary income of the taxpayer and are included in its general taxable base in accordance with accounting rules and standards. Dividend income received from domestic taxpayers is excluded from the tax base under condition that such income was taxed at the level of the payer.
## Inventory valuation
There are no provisions in the tax legislation regarding inventory valuation.
