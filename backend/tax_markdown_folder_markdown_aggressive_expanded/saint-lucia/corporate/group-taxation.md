# Saint Lucia
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
Group tax filing is not allowed in Saint Lucia; however, group tax relief is available under certain circumstances to allow the trading losses, excluding the current loss, of a resident company within a group to offset the profits of another resident company within the same group. A claim for group relief requires the consent of the Comptroller of the IRD and is only available to resident companies.
## Transfer pricing
Related-party transactions are accepted if they are made on an arm’s-length basis. The IRD has the power under the Income Tax Act to make any adjustment deemed necessary to place such transactions at arm’s length.
## Thin capitalisation
No provision exists for thin capitalisation in Saint Lucia.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no provisions relevant to CFCs in Saint Lucia.
