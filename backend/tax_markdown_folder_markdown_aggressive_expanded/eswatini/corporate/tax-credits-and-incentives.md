## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 15 August 2024
## Foreign tax credit
Eswatini does not have a foreign tax credit regime.
## Development Approval Order
The Minister of Finance, along set guidelines and with prior consent of the Cabinet, may nominate a business as a developmental enterprise (i.e. a business the Minister deems to be beneficial to the development of the economy) for a grant of a Development Approval Order. If approved, the business generally will be granted tax concessions, such as a lower corporate tax rate.
