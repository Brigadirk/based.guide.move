## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 15 August 2024
Income tax is levied on all income derived from a source within or deemed to be within the country, irrespective of whether the recipient of the income is actually resident in Eswatini.
## Personal income tax rates
Swaziland assesses resident and non-resident individuals on a graduated/progressive tax rate basis.

| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 100,000 | SZL 0 plus 20% of taxable income in excess of SZL 0 |
