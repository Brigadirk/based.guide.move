## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 11 February 2025
### **Corporate Income Tax (CIT) in Jordan**
CIT rates in Jordan are applied based on the industry or business activities from which the taxpayer generates income. According to the Income Tax Law, the CIT rates are as follows:
### **Taxation of Jordanian Resident Corporations**
Jordanian resident corporations are generally not subject to CIT on their worldwide income. However, income derived on investments generated from Jordanian deposits and funds is taxed at a rate of 10%.
For **foreign branches** of Jordanian resident corporations, the entire net income of the branch is taxed at a fixed rate of **10%**.
### **Taxation of Non-Resident Corporations**
Non-resident corporations are generally subject to tax through withholding tax (WHT) on income sourced from Jordan. (Refer to the Withholding Taxes section and PE section for more details.)
