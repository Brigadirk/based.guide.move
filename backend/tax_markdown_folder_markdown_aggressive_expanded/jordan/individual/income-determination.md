Last reviewed - 11 February 2025
Any income incurred in or from Jordan, for any person, regardless of the place of payment, shall be subject to tax in Jordan.
## Employment income
Salaries, wages, allowances, and bonuses (in cash or in kind) received from any employment, including the estimated annual value of housing, lodging, boarding, or any other allowance, are taxable in Jordan.
The first JOD 2,500 of monthly pension salary paid by a resident person shall be exempt from income tax.
Moreover, there is an annual exemption of JOD 2,000 for people with full or partial disabilities.
## Equity compensation
Generally, income from stock options and restricted stock are subject to tax within the individual's taxable income.
## Business income
Income from professional services or activities, and any other income from business activity or investment, unless specifically exempted according to Jordan's Income Tax Law, is combined with the other categories of income in order to determine PIT through the filing of an individual income tax return.
