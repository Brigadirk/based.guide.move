Any income incurred in or from Jordan, regardless of the place of payment, shall be subject to tax. This includes, but is not limited to, income from:
The following shall be exempted from tax:
## Inventory valuation
Inventory is generally valued in accordance to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) accounting framework.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are generally **subject to tax**, with a few exceptions specified in the Income Tax Law.
## Dividend income
Dividends received by Jordanian taxpayers from limited liability companies, general partnerships, limited partnerships, and private and public shareholding companies that are resident in Jordan are exempt from income tax.
However, this exemption does not apply to dividends received by the following Jordanian entities:
For these entities, dividends are subject to income tax as well as the national contribution tax (subject to certain participation exemption rules specified in the income tax law).
Additionally, dividend income received by Jordanian taxpayers from a non-resident legal entity in Jordan is also subject to both income tax and national contribution tax in Jordan.
## Foreign income
Jordanian resident corporations are not subject to income tax on their worldwide income unless that income is raised from sources that originate and relate to Jordanian deposits and funds, in which case this income would be taxed at rate of 10%. For foreign branches of Jordanian resident corporations, all of the branch net income is taxed at a fixed rate of 10%.
