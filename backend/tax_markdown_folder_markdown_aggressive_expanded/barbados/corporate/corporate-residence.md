# Barbados
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
A corporation is deemed to be resident in Barbados if its management and control is exercised in Barbados.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The concept of a PE is described within a number of Barbados’s double taxation agreements (DTAs). A PE is, in general, created in line with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Convention and is defined in domestic legislation as:
Under domestic legislation, a non-resident person is deemed to have been carrying on business in Barbados, and hence required to file a CIT return, where in an income year such a non-resident person:
In either of the circumstances mentioned above, the non-resident shall be deemed to have been carrying on business in Barbados in that income year and the income of that business shall be deemed to be income derived from Barbados for that income year.
