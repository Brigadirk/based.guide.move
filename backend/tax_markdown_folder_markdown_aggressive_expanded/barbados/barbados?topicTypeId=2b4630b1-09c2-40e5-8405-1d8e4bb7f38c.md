Every individual between the ages of 16 and 67, who is gainfully employed in Barbados under a contract of service, must be insured under the National Insurance and Social Security Act.
Contributions are determined as a percentage of insurable earnings up to a maximum of insurable earning of BBD 5,280 per month or BBD 1,219 per week. Employers must remit National Insurance contributions by the 15th day of the following month. Effective from 1 October 2018, the employee’s share is 11.1%, with the employer paying 12.75%. Self-employed individuals make quarterly contributions of 17.1% on earnings of up to a maximum of BBD 5,280 per month.
