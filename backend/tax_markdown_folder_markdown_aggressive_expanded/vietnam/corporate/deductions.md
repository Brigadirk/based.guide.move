## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 22 August 2024
## Depreciation and amortisation
Tax depreciation may differ from accounting depreciation. Depreciation in excess of the rates specified in the regulations on tax depreciation is not deductible. These regulations specify maximum and minimum permissible effective lives for various classes of assets, including intangibles. Current straight-line tax depreciation rates range from 2% to 33.33%.
The depreciation period of assets of the Build Operate Transfer (BOT) and Business Cooperation Contract (BCC) projects is the remaining life of the contract.
## Start-up expenses
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are generally deductible, except for certain cases.
Interest on loans corresponding to the portion of charter capital not yet contributed as scheduled is not deductible.
Interest on loans from non-economic and non-credit organisations exceeding 1.5 times the interest rate set by the State Bank of Vietnam is not deductible.
Interest on loans that has been capitalised is not deductible.
Tax deductibility of interest on loans is capped at 30% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) when a taxpayer has related-party transactions (*see Transfer pricing in the*[*Group taxation*](group-taxation.html)*section*).
The decree on transfer pricing could be amended soon.
## Bad debt

Losses may be carried forward fully and consecutively for a maximum of five years. Carryback of losses is not permitted.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
