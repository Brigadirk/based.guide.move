## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 22 August 2024
There is no concept of tax residency for CIT. Enterprises established under the law of Vietnam are subject to CIT in Vietnam. In addition, Vietnam has a broadly worded ‘permanent establishment’ definition.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
In Vietnam, a PE is defined as “a fixed place of business through which a foreign enterprise carries out part or the whole of its business or production activities in Vietnam”. The PE of a foreign enterprise shall include:
Foreign enterprises with their PEs in Vietnam shall pay tax on the taxable income earned in Vietnam (irrespective of whether it relates to the PE) and on the taxable income generated out of Vietnam and related to operations of the PEs.
