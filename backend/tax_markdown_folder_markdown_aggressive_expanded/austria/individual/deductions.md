## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Employment expenses
Employee portions of mandatory contributions to Austrian and/or foreign social security are tax deductible.
In computing income from employment, expenses related to the production and collection of income is generally tax deductible. These expenses include the following:
## Personal deductions
### Special expenses
Church tax is deductible up to EUR 600, and charitable contributions to certain institutions are deductible up to 10% of the current year’s taxable income. Austrian tax adviser fees are fully deductible.
### Extraordinary expenses
Individuals who incur extraordinary expenses can obtain some tax relief. This relief applies to resident individuals who are subject to unlimited tax liability who incur unavoidable expenses (e.g. funeral costs, medical expenses for special treatments not reimbursed by health insurance). Depending on income and family status, the taxpayer may be able to deduct an amount that exceeds a certain percentage of one's income. The retention rates are as follows:
| Annual income (EUR) | | Retention rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 7,300 | 6 |
| 7,300 | 14,600 | 8 |
| 14,600 | 36,400 | 10 |
| 36,400 |  | 12 |
The percentage is reduced by 1% for an individual:
Certain expenses (e.g. damage due to disaster) are generally fully tax deductible.
### Family bonus plus
The family bonus plus is a tax credit, which reduces the amount of tax paid. The annual tax credit of EUR 2,000 per child can be claimed for children up to the age of 18 years, who live in Austria, and are entitled to family allowance. If both parents claim the family bonus plus, both taxpayers are entitled to 50% of the tax-free amount (EUR 1,000 *per annum* for each taxpayer).
For children between 19 and 24 (in some cases until 25), the family bonus plus can be granted up to an amount of EUR 700 *per annum*.
## Allowances
Generally, personal allowances take the form of tax credits, i.e. deductions from tax payable. By contrast, family allowances are paid to the taxpayer in cash. *See the [Other tax credits and incentives](other-tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for more information*.
## Losses
Business losses or rental losses can be offset with other categories of income. Business losses can be forwarded in following years in case assessed by adequate and orderly accounting.
Rental losses cannot be carried forward.
