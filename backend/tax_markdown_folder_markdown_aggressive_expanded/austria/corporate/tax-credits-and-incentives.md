# Austria
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Foreign tax credit (matching credit)
R&D costs are fully deductible at the time they accrue. An R&D premium of 14% (i.e. R&D expenses x 14% = R&D premium) may be claimed for R&D activities performed in Austria.
The R&D premium is also available in case of subcontracted R&D; however, R&D incentives cannot be claimed by both principal and agent (the agent is just able to apply for the premium if the principal does not). In case of subcontracted R&D, the privileged R&D costs are capped at EUR 1 million per year.
Austria has no ‘patent box regime’.
