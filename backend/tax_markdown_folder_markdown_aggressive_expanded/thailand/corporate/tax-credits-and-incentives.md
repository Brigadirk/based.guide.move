## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
## Board of Investment (BOI) tax incentives
The BOI, by virtue of the Investment Promotion Act of 1977 (including its amendment no. 4 [2017]) and the Competitive Enhancement Act (2017), provides tax incentives for certain activities within the following categories:
The tax incentives available include the following:
### Incentives by category
Under the 2024 BOI promotion scheme, the focus is placed on the activities and the importance of the activities. Tax incentives are under the five technology and innovation development categories (A1+ to A4) and non-tax incentives are under category B, as below:
| Group | CIT exemption | Import duty exemption on machinery | Import duty exemption on raw materials for export | Non-tax incentives |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1+ | 10-13 years (without cap) + merit\* | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| A1 | 8 years (without cap) + merit\* | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| A2 | 8 years + merit \* | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| A3 | 5 years + merit | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| A4 | 3 years + merit | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| B | Merit (1-5 years) \*\* | Yes | Yes | Yes |
\* Exemption from CIT will be up to 13 years in total.
\*\* Only some activities are available, provided that certain criteria are fulfilled.
### Merit on competitiveness enhancement
The investment or expenses permitted are as follows:
| Investment in | Additional investment cap (% of investment or expenses incurred) |
| --- | --- |
| Technology and innovation: |  |
| Licensing fees for using domestically developed technology. | 200 |
| Product and package design. | 200 |
| Human resource development: |  |

| Organising training or accepting student internships for work training and skill development during their science and technology education. | 200 |
| Development of business operators’ potentials: |  |

### Additional years of tax exemption will be added to the standard tax incentives received as follows:

| --- | --- |
| ≥ 1% or ≥ THB 200 million | 1 year |
| ≥ 2% or ≥ THB 400 million | 2 years |
| ≥ 3% or ≥ THB 600 million | 3 years |
| ≥ 4% or ≥ THB 800 million | 4 years |
| ≥ 5% or ≥ THB 600 million | 5 years |
### Merit on decentralisation
Investment promotion zones have been included as a decentralisation merit to businesses that have operations in any of the following 20 provinces with low average income:
Kalasin, Chaiyaphum, Nakhon Phanom, Nan, Bung Karn, Buriram, Phrae, Maha Sarakham, Mukdahan, Mae Hong Son, Yasothon, Roi Et, Sisaket, Sakhon Nakhon, Sa Kaew, Sukhothai, Surin, Nong Bua Lamphu, Ubon Ratchatani, and Amnatcharoen.
Additional incentives for enterprises located in these 20 provinces include the following:
### Merit on industrial area development
One additional year of CIT exemption will be granted to Group A projects located within an industrial estate or promoted industrial zone. However, the total period of CIT exemption will not exceed eight years, except for the activities under A1+ that can obtain additional years of CIT exemption up to 13 years.
### Special economic zone (SEZ)
Tax incentives available for investment in eligible target and general activities in an SEZ are as follows:
To be eligible for the tax privileges, a number of general and specific conditions are required to be fulfilled, including the use of modern production processes and new machinery, paid-up share capital at the required amount, adequate environment protection systems, debt-to-equity ratio not exceeding 3:1, and the required area to operate the business.
### Tax incentives given to R&D contractors
R&D is a promoted activity under the Investment Promotion Act, which prescribes the criteria and conditions to be followed by an R&D contractor.
Tax incentives given are as follows:
The R&D services must be of the following description:
### Tax benefits under the Revenue Code
The Revenue Code provides for an additional 100% deduction in respect of expenditure incurred in Thailand on R&D for technology and innovation (including product and process innovation) when hiring government agencies or the private sector, as approved by the Director-General of the Revenue Department.
## Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC)
Under the Eastern Economic Corridor Act (2018) (EEC Act), an EEC project must be located in certain zones within the EEC, which consists of the three Eastern provinces of Rayong, Chonburi, and Chachoengsao. An EEC project will be promoted only if it is engaged in a target industry.
An EEC-promoted company will be granted CIT exemption and/or reduction privileges according to the criteria prescribed by the EEC committee. Currently, the CIT privileges under the EEC Act have not been announced.
Nevertheless, the BOI, under the Investment Promotion Act, has already issued criteria and incentives for promoted activities located in the EEC. The tax incentives are categorised under three zones, as follows:
Only eligible activities under categories A1+-A4 (except for those specified in a negative list) and enabling services can be applied for.
Tax incentives\* provided by the BOI are as follows:
\* Subject to qualified human resources, the development of R&D activities, and the location of the project.
Note that EEC incentives cannot be utilised together with those under the merit of industrial area development.
The EEC Act also grants a PIT reduction for employees with special knowledge/abilities who work or operate a business in certain zones within the EEC.
Qualified expatriates and Thai employees are granted a flat rate of 17% PIT on their income derived from working for companies carrying on target activities within the EEC.
## International business centre (IBC)
An international business centre (IBC) regime has been launched to replace the previous regional operating headquarters (ROH), international headquarters (IHQ), and international trade centre (ITC) regimes.
The criteria for the establishment and operation of an IBC are as follows:
Treasury management services comprise the following:
ITC means the international business of buying and selling goods, which may include the provision of services related to the goods purchased and sold. These services include the following:
Income of the IBC means the following:
The following tax benefits are available for 15 accounting periods:
In comparison with the previous ROH/IHQ regimes, the IBC regime does not apply different tax rates to offshore and onshore income. As a consequence, there is no longer any requirement for services to be provided to a minimum number of offshore affiliates. There is also no limit to the amount of onshore income that qualifies for the reduced tax rates. The expenditure required to qualify for the reduced tax rates has been significantly increased. However, in the case where an existing ROH/IHQ converts to be an IBC, it can enjoy the reduced tax rate of 8% provided that it meets the original minimum expenditure requirement of THB 15 million.
If an IBC does not meet the rules and conditions prescribed or does not otherwise qualify as an IBC in any accounting period, the benefits will be revoked on a year-by-year basis. If the company does not meet the conditions for more than one accounting period, or has none of the characteristics for operating as an IBC, the tax benefits will be terminated with effect from the first accounting period.
The taxable profit and loss of an IBC must be computed separately between the IBC and non-IBC businesses and between (i) headquarters and treasury management services, and (ii) royalties. Common expenses are to be allocated based on the proportion of revenue of the IBC and non-IBC businesses.
Tax losses must be maintained separately, as follows:
Tax returns must be filed separately for (i) headquarters and treasury management services, (ii) royalties, and (iii) non-IBC business.
## Foreign tax credit
A Thai company can use foreign tax paid on business income or dividends as a credit against its CIT liability. However, the credit cannot exceed the amount of Thai tax on the income.
