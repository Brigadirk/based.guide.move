## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Taxable period
The Dutch tax year runs from 1 January through 31 December.
## Tax returns
If both spouses are resident taxpayers, they are taxed separately for their business income, employment income, pension income, and other periodic payments less premiums for life annuities and for certain other periodic payments. Spouses and, under certain conditions, persons living as a joint household automatically qualify as fiscal partners. As such, they can choose to allocate the following types of income/deductions to either or both (in any given proportion):
Tax returns must be filed after each calendar year, in principle, before 1 May.
## Payment of tax
If an employee is on a Dutch payroll, wage tax will be withheld from one’s salary. Generally speaking, if taxpayers have sizable income that is not subject to wage tax withholding, they may be required to make advance payments of estimated additional income tax. When the employee has income tax deductions that are not considered in the Dutch payroll (e.g. [negative] income from a principal residence), it is also possible to file a preliminary tax refund form in order to claim monthly income tax refunds during the calendar year.
