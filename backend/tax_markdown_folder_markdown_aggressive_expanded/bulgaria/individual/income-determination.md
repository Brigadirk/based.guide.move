## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 11 June 2024
Individuals must pay personal income tax (PIT) on their gross income less any mandatory social security contributions they make at their own expense. Very few other deductions are possible.
## Employment income
Taxable income from work on the basis of an employment contract includes the following:
Employment income is taxed at a 10% flat tax rate.
## Business income
Business income of individuals registered as sole traders form the taxable base under the provisions of the Corporate Income Tax (CIT) Act (i.e. income minus expenses plus adjustments equals taxable profit). If the turnover exceeds BGN 100,000 in 12 consecutive months, the sole trader is subject to VAT registration. VAT registration may be required regardless of the turnover in certain cases.
Patent activities of sole traders are taxed under the provisions of the Local Taxes and Fees Act.
Sole traders file annual PIT returns. The deadline for reporting and payment of PIT due by sole traders is between 1 March and 30 June.
Sole traders can benefit from a 5% discount, provided that they report and pay their PIT due until 31 March of the following year.
## Capital gains and investment income
Bulgarian tax residents (including expatriates who are considered Bulgarian tax residents) are taxed on capital gains and investment income realised from all sources during their period of residence. Foreign tax residents are taxed only on the capital gains and investment income derived from sources in Bulgaria.
### Capital gains
Capital gains are taxed on an annual basis with a 10% flat tax rate if received by Bulgarian tax residents, and with a 10% final withholding tax (WHT) if received by non-residents. Certain exemptions provided in respect of capital gains are discussed under *Exempt income below*.
The taxable base for income from capital gains is determined as follows:
### Dividend income
Dividends and liquidation proceeds paid by Bulgarian and foreign entities are subject to a 5% final WHT at source. When the dividends/liquidation proceeds are paid by non-resident entities who are not obligated to withhold and remit the Bulgarian taxes, the tax is payable by the recipient themselves on an annual basis. The dividend income paid by non-resident entities should also be reported in the annual tax return.
### Interest income
Interest income from bank accounts in the European Union / European Economic Area is tax free as of 1 April 2022.
Interest income from bank accounts outside the European Union / European Economic Area is taxable at a tax rate of 10% as of 1 April 2022 instead of a final tax rate of 8% for Bulgarian tax residents and 10% final tax rate for non-Bulgarian tax residents.
### Rental income
Income from rent or other rights of use against consideration (except for rent from agricultural land), as well as income from annuities and leases, is subject to quarterly advance PIT at 10% and a final tax on an annual basis at the flat rate of 10%. Advance tax is not due for the fourth quarter unless the individual confirms in writing before the payer of the income one's willingness to apply an advance tax withholding for the fourth quarter.
For tax purposes, a statutory deduction of 10% of the gross income is provided.
### Royalty income
Royalties are taxed on an annual basis with a 10% flat tax rate if received by Bulgarian tax residents and a 10% final WHT if received by non-residents.
## Other income
The following basic types of income are also subject to PIT (the list, however, is not comprehensive).
Amounts redeemed early from voluntary pension, health, unemployment and/or vocational qualification and life insurance coverage, are subject to 10% final tax.
## Exempt income
Some types of non-taxable income are listed below, subject to specific conditions and requirements set in the law:
Property received on the grounds of inheritance, donation, or restitution is not considered income taxable under the PITA. However, other taxes and fees may be applicable.
