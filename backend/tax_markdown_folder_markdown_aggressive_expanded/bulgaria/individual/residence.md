## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 11 June 2024
Irrespective of their citizenship, an individual is considered a Bulgarian tax resident if they fulfil one or more of the following criteria:
If a double tax treaty (DTT) is in place, the tax residency status is determined in accordance with the provisions of the DTT, which prevail over domestic legislation.
A foreign tax resident is any individual who is not a Bulgarian tax resident.
