## Overview
Last reviewed - 16 December 2024
Australia is a country in the Southern Hemisphere comprising the mainland of the Australian continent as well as the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Australia is divided into six states and two territories, with Canberra as its capital. The official language of Australia is English, and the currency is the Australian dollar (AUD).
Six British colonies, which were created in the late 18th and 19th centuries, were federated and became the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901. In recent decades, Australia has transformed itself into an internationally competitive, advanced market economy. It boasted one of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD's) fastest growing economies during the 1990s, a performance due in large part to economic reforms adopted in the 1980s. Australia's abundant and diverse natural resources attract high levels of foreign investment and include extensive reserves of coal, iron ore, copper, gold, natural gas, uranium, and renewable energy sources. Australia also has a large services sector and is a significant exporter of natural resources, energy, and food.
