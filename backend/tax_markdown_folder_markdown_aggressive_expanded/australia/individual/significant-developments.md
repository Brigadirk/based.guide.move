## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 16 December 2024
The Australian government plans to enter into many new and updated tax treaties, with a new treaty with Portugal signed on 30 November 2023 and a new treaty with Slovenia signed on 9 September 2024 (both yet to enter into force). The relatively recently signed treaty with Iceland has entered into force to apply from as early as 1 January 2024. *See the [Foreign tax relief and tax treaties](foreign-tax-relief-and-tax-treaties.html) section for more information.*
