## Residential property vacancy fee for foreign persons
A property vacancy fee and annual reporting is applied to certain foreign owners of Australian residential property who submit a Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) notice or application (or would be so required had an exemption not applied) to acquire a residential dwelling or residential land at any time from 7:30 pm AEST on 9 May 2017. An individual who is not ‘ordinarily resident’ in Australia (with certain exceptions, such as Australian citizens), including a holder of a visa that permits the individual to remain in Australia for only a limited period, is subject to these rules.
In summary:
The relevant ‘vacancy year’ is broadly based on the first and each successive 12-month period commencing from the owner’s initial right to occupy the dwelling.
