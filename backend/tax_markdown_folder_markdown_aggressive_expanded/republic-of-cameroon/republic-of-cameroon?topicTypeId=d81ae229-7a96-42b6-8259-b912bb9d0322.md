## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
## Special income tax (SIT)
Subject to international tax treaties, an SIT is levied by the state or regional and local authorities on income paid to natural persons and corporate bodies domiciled abroad by individuals or legal entities located in Cameroon. The tax is withheld at source by the Cameroonian entity or individual paying the remuneration.
Subject to international tax treaties, the SIT rates are fixed as follows:
## Non-commercial profits WHT
A 16.5% WHT is to be deducted at source by entities that pay remunerations granted to the board members of public institutions, public corporations, and semi-public companies in any capacity.
The tax rate applicable to non-commercial revenue is 11% to be deducted at source by entities that pay the following:
## Dividends WHT
A total WHT of 16.5% applies to dividends paid to both Cameroon residents and non-residents. The WHT rate may be reduced under an applicable DTT.
## Interest WHT
The interest from foreign loans is subject to 16.5% WHT. The WHT rate may be reduced under an applicable DTT.
Interests on external loans of a maturity period of at least seven years, signed as of 1 January 2014, are exempted from the WHT.
## Royalties WHT
Royalties paid to non-residents are subject to a 15% WHT (the 10% surcharge is not applicable). The tax rate may vary under some DTTs.
## Tax treaties
Cameroon has tax treaties with Canada, France, Morocco, South Africa, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, and members of CEMAC (Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, and Republic of Congo).
