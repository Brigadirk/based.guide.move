# Belgium
## Overview
Last reviewed - 28 August 2024
Belgium lies in the heart of the largest industrialised trading bloc in the world, the European Union (EU), and has existed as an independent kingdom since 1830. It is a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy, with King Philippe I reigning as the sovereign as of 21 July 2013. Belgium has a population of about 11 million people and three official languages: Dutch, French, and German. The currency of Belgium is the euro (EUR).
Industry is concentrated mainly in the populous Flemish area in the north, and much of Belgium's trade is with other EU countries. It has a relatively equal income distribution, and its gross domestic product (GDP) was EUR 584.7 billion in 2023.
