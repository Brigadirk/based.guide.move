## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 28 August 2024
## Employment expenses
In determining the tax base, compulsory social security contributions (paid in Belgium or abroad) are fully deductible.
Employment-related expenses are also deductible, provided they are substantiated; alternatively, standard deductions may be claimed.
For employees, the standard expense deduction amounts to 30% of the gross earning, up to a ceiling of EUR 5,750.
For remunerated directors, the standard deduction is a flat 3% and cannot exceed the ceiling of EUR 3,030.
In addition to social security contributions and professional expenses, some non-business expenses can also be deducted from the taxable basis, and personal exemptions are granted.
## Personal deductions
### Tax reductions
Some non-business expenses give rise to a tax reduction.
At the federal level, the most commonly granted reductions mainly concern:

## Personal exemptions
In addition to the above-mentioned deductions, some personal exemptions are granted. The following amounts are deductible in determining taxable income.
### For each taxpayer
The personal basic exemption amounts to EUR 10,160.
### For dependent children
| Number of children | Exemption increase (EUR) | Accumulated exemption (EUR) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1,920 | 1,920 |
| 2 | 3,030 | 4,950 |
| 3 | 6,140 | 11,090 |
| 4 | 6,850 | 17,940 |
For any other dependent person, an amount of EUR 1,920 is deductible.
It must be stressed that the exemption takes place on the lowest part of income (at the lowest marginal tax rates).
Handicapped children or other dependants count for two children/dependants in the above scale.
For each child less than three years old on 1 January of the tax year, the above amounts are increased by EUR 690, provided no child custody expenses are deducted.
The rates and brackets applicable as of assessment year 2025 (income year 2024) to determine the taxes linked to the personal exemptions are as follows:
| Personal exemptions (EUR) | | Rate (%) | Gains on bracket (EUR) | Total (EUR) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 11,120 | 25 | 2,780 | 2,780 |
| 11,120 | 15,820 | 30 | 1,410 | 4,190 |
| 15,820 | 26,360 | 40 | 4,216 | 8,406 |
| 26,360 | 48,320 | 45 | 9,882 | 18,288 |
| 48,320 | and above | 50 |  |  |
The income of each spouse/legal cohabitant is taxed separately. Special rules exist when one spouse has no or low earned income, as noted below.
The exempt income, personal deductions, and the attribution of income to the spouse are, in principle, applicable both to residents and non-residents, although for non-residents these exemptions and deductions are only applicable provided they earn at least 75% of their worldwide professional income in Belgium. Moreover, in order to be entitled to regional tax benefits in Belgium, those non-residents must also maintain their tax residency in another member state of the European Economic Area.
