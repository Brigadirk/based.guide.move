# Guernsey, Channel Islands
## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 27 January 2025
## Employment income
While treated solely or principally as a resident of Guernsey, an individual is assessable on the full amount of the emoluments of employment, no matter where the duties are performed. This will include certain benefits. Where a non-resident carries out any duties in Guernsey, the emoluments attaching to these duties are assessable in Guernsey.
Directors with substantial control of a limited liability company (LLC) will now be treated as employees, with social security contributions deducted by the employer. Directors can choose to continue to be treated as self-employed for five years if they opt-in before 31 December 2024.
## Capital gains
There is no tax on capital gains in Guernsey.
