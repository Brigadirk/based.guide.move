# Taiwan
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 19 August 2024
A company is a resident of Taiwan for CIT purposes if it is incorporated in Taiwan. A non-resident company that has an FPOB or business agent in Taiwan is obligated to file a CIT return in Taiwan on its Taiwan-sourced income.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The term 'permanent establishment' only exists in the underlying DTAs signed with Taiwan. Taiwan domestic tax regulations only refer to an FPOB and business agent as a taxpayer of a foreign entity’s Taiwan-source income. The foreign entity shall be liable for Taiwan income tax assessment on its Taiwan-source income.
