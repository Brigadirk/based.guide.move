# Taiwan
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 19 August 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year in Taiwan runs from 1 January to 31 December. Businesses may request approval from the local collection authority to file CIT returns using a fiscal year-end other than 31 December.
## Tax returns
Tax returns are filed on a self-assessment basis. CIT returns are due no later than five months after the end of the tax year.
## Payment of tax
Tax is paid on a self-assessment basis in two instalments. The first payment is based on 50% of the tax liability of the prior year’s tax return and is made in the ninth month of the enterprise’s fiscal year. However, if the taxpayer meets certain requirements, it may self-assess the provisional tax based on the taxable income of the first half of the current fiscal year and deduct income taxes paid overseas against the provisional income tax payable if corresponding income is consolidated in the provisional tax return. The second payment is made at the time of filing the annual tax return. The returns are subsequently reviewed by the tax authorities, and a final assessment is issued.
Any overpaid tax as a result of the tax collection authority’s mistake shall be refunded to the taxpayer within two years of the tax authority’s acknowledgement of such mistake, and shall not be subject to the original five-year period for applying for refund where the taxpayer is responsible for the mistake.
## Tax audit process
Taiwan does not have a fixed audit cycle. Tax audit can be carried out any time prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations. Companies may be selected for audit if certain criteria are met.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations in Taiwan is five years from the tax return filing date if the return is filed on time. Where a taxpayer fails to file an annual tax return within the statutory deadline or evades tax by fraud or any other unrighteous means, the statute of limitations is extended to seven years.
