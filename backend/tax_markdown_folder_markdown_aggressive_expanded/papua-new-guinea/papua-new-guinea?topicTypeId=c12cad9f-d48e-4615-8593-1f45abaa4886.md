## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
PNG resident companies are liable for income tax on their worldwide income. Companies that are not resident in Papua New Guinea are only required to remit tax on income sourced in Papua New Guinea. A non-resident’s PNG-sourced passive income, including dividends, interest, and royalties, may be subject to WHT. It is ordinarily the case that the payer of the dividend, interest, or royalty must withhold the relevant amount of the tax and remit this to PNG’s Internal Revenue Commission (IRC).
Papua New Guinea levies corporate income tax (CIT) on companies on a flat rate basis.
Generally, trading profits and other income (except income that is specifically exempt) of resident companies in Papua New Guinea are assessed tax at a rate of 30%, whereas non-resident companies operating in Papua New Guinea are assessed tax at a rate of 48%.
The most recent budget also introduced a new income tax rate to apply to commercial banks. These entities will be subject to tax at the rate of 45%.
