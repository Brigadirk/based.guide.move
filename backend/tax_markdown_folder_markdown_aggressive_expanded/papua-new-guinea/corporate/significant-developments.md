# Papua New Guinea
## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
## Income Tax Act rewrite
In 2020, Papua New Guinea's (PNG's) Treasury released for public consultation the much-anticipated rewrite of the Income Tax Act (the Act). The consultation draft proposed a commencement date of 1 January 2021. However, despite consultation during 2021, 2022, and 2023, the Bill has not yet been presented to Parliament. As of the middle of 2023, there has been no formal commitments from Treasury in relation to the expected date of entry into force once passed, although the Treasurer did note that, in accordance with feedback from various stakeholders, the Bill's transitional provisions and certain subsidiary legislation would be fully developed before the Bill is presented to Parliament.
This statement from the Treasurer is a reaction to the fact that despite the rewrite being advertised as an attempt to simplify tax law to enable greater participation, and ultimately greater compliance, in the tax system, a number of design features have permeated the initial and most recent drafts, including:
A number of the proposed policy shifts that may impact companies include:
## 2024 National Budget and other legislative developments
The 2024 National Budget (released in November 2023) contained very limited tax changes.
There were no changes to corporate income tax (CIT), and there was no commitment to bring forward the rewrite of the Income Tax Act.
The most significant change was to make a temporary increase in the tax-free threshold for salary and wages tax imposed on individuals (SWT) into a permanent change. There was also a repeal of the dependent tax rebate that was available for individuals to be applicable from 1 January 2024. However, during early 2024, in response to public unrest, the dependent rebate is set to be reinstated.
## MLI and MAAC ratified
At the end of August 2023, the Internal Revenue Commission announced that Papua New Guinea has ratified the Multilateral Administrative Assistance Convention (MAAC) and the Multilateral Instrument (MLI), establishing Papua New Guinea's presence within the realm of international tax collaboration. However, there have been no consequential amendments introduced to legislation.
