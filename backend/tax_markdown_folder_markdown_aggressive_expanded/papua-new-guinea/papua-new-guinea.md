# Papua New Guinea
## Overview
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
Papua New Guinea (PNG) lies on the eastern half of the island of New Guinea, located between the Coral Sea and the South Pacific Ocean among the islands of Oceania. In 1885, it was divided between Germany (north) and the United Kingdom (south). The area controlled by the United Kingdom was transferred to Australia in 1902, which occupied the northern portion during World War I and continued to administer the combined areas until Papua New Guinea gained its independence in 1975. Papua New Guinea's capital city is Port Moresby, and its official languages are English, Tok Pisin, and Hiri Motu. The currency in Papua New Guinea is the Papua New Guinea kina (PGK).
Papua New Guinea is richly endowed with natural resources, but exploitation has been hampered by rugged terrain and the high cost of developing infrastructure. Agriculture provides a subsistence livelihood for 85% of the population. Mineral deposits, including copper, gold, and oil, account for nearly two-thirds of export earnings. A consortium led by a major American oil company commenced production of the country's estimated 227 billion cubic metres of natural gas reserves into liquefied natural gas (LNG) in April 2014 with the first shipment of LNG being delivered to Japan in May 2014, ahead of schedule. The project continues to operate and is a significant contributor to government revenues annually.
There are also a number of major resource projects in the pipeline, including the Wafi Golpu project, Frieda River Copper-Gold project, ‘Papua LNG’, Papua New Guinea’s second LNG project, and a potential expansion of the PNG LNG project. Of these projects, Papua LNG has signed gas agreements with the state and is reported to be targeting completion of front-end engineering and design (FEED) by the end of 2023.
