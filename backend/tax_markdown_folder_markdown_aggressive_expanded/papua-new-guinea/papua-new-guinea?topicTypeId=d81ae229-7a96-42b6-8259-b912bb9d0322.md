Notes
1. There is no WHT on interest when:
2. A royalty paid to a non-resident associate of the payee will suffer a 30% WHT. Where the non-resident is not an associate of the payee, the WHT rate will be 10% (or 48% of the taxable income derived from the royalty if the non-resident chooses to lodge an income tax return in Papua New Guinea).
3. The treaty with Germany has not yet been ratified by Germany.
## Business income WHT
Income derived by local contractors in certain industries is covered by the business income WHT regime. The industries affected include:
Businesses affected are required to have a certificate of compliance and to produce it when entering into contracts with their customers. Payers are required to file an annual income reporting statement where they make either an eligible payment of PGK 500 or more in relation to one contract or eligible payments for several contracts exceeding PGK 5,000 in the year of income in relation to a single payee. Payers are required to deduct a 10% WHT if payees do not produce a certificate of compliance.
## Non-resident insurer WHT
Premiums paid to non-resident insurers in respect of insurance contracts on property situated in Papua New Guinea or insured events that can only occur in Papua New Guinea are subject to tax in Papua New Guinea. The tax is calculated on a deemed taxable income equal to 10% of the gross premium, which is taxed at the non-resident tax rates of 48% (companies) or 30% (unincorporated associations). Tax treaties may limit the rate of tax applied.
