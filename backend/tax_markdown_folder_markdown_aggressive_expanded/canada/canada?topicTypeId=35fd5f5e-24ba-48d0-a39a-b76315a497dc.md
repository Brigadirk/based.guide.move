## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 10 December 2024
Individuals resident in Canada are subject to Canadian income tax on worldwide income. Relief from double taxation is provided through Canada's international tax treaties, as well as via foreign tax credits and deductions for foreign taxes paid on income derived from non-Canadian sources.
Non-resident individuals are subject to Canadian income tax on income from employment in Canada, income from carrying on a business in Canada and capital gains from the disposition of taxable Canadian property.
Individuals resident in Canada for only part of a year are taxable in Canada on worldwide income only for the period during which they were resident.
Personal tax credits, miscellaneous tax credits, and the dividend tax credit are subtracted from tax to determine the federal tax liability.
## Personal income tax rates
2024 federal tax rates are as follows:
| Federal taxable income (CAD) | | Tax on first column (CAD) | Tax on excess (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 55,867 | 0 | 15.0 |
| 55,867 | 111,733 | 8,380 | 20.5 |
| 111,733 | 173,205 | 19,833 | 26.0 |
| 173,205 | 246,752 | 35,815 | 29.0 |
| 246,752 |  | 57,144 | 33.0 |
## Provincial/territorial income taxes
All provinces and territories compute income tax using 'tax-on-income' systems (i.e. they set their own rates, brackets, and credits). All except Quebec use the federal definition of taxable income.
| Recipient | Provincial/territorial tax | | Provincial/territorial surtax | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Alberta | 15.0 | 355,845 | N/A | N/A |
| British Columbia | 20.5 | 252,752 | N/A | N/A |
| Manitoba | 17.4 | 100,000 | N/A | N/A |
| New Brunswick | 19.5 | 185,064 | N/A | N/A |
| Newfoundland and Labrador | 21.8 | 1,103,478 | N/A | N/A |
| Northwest Territories | 14.05 | 164,525 | N/A | N/A |
| Nova Scotia | 21.0 | 150,000 | N/A | N/A |
| Nunavut | 11.5 | 173,205 | N/A | N/A |
| Ontario | 13.16 | 220,000 | 20 and 36 | 5,554 and 7,108 |
| Prince Edward Island | 18.75 | 140,000 | N/A | N/A |
| Quebec (1) | 25.75 | 126,000 | N/A | N/A |
| Saskatchewan | 14.5 | 148,734 | N/A | N/A |
| Yukon | 15.0 | 500,000 | N/A | N/A |
| Non-resident | 15.84 (2) | 246,752 | N/A | N/A |
Notes
1. Quebec has its own personal tax system, which requires a separate calculation of taxable income. Recognising that Quebec collects its own tax, federal income tax is reduced by 16.5% of basic federal tax for Quebec residents.

Notes
2. *See Dividend income in the [Income determination](canada/individual/income-determination.html) section for more information on eligible and non-eligible dividends*.
3. Non-resident rates for interest and dividends apply only in limited circumstances. Generally, interest (other than most interest paid to arm's-length non-residents) and dividends paid to non-residents are subject to Canadian withholding tax (WHT).
## Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)
In addition to the normal tax computation, individuals are required to compute an adjusted taxable income and include certain 'tax preference' items that are otherwise deductible or exempt in the calculation of regular taxable income. If the adjusted taxable income exceeds the minimum tax exemption, a combined federal and provincial/territorial tax rate is applied to the excess, yielding the AMT. The taxpayer then pays the greater of regular tax or the AMT. Taxpayers required to pay the AMT are entitled to a credit for the AMT paid, which can be applied in any of the following seven years to reduce their regular tax liability in excess of their AMT level for that year.
Recently enacted legislation changes the federal AMT calculation, effective for taxation years beginning after 2023, by:
## Kiddie tax
A minor child that receives certain passive income under an income splitting arrangement is subject to tax at the highest combined federal/provincial (or territorial) marginal rate (i.e. up to 55%), referred to as 'kiddie tax'. Personal tax credits, other than the dividend, disability, and foreign tax credits, or other deductions cannot be claimed to reduce the kiddie tax.
## ‘Income sprinkling’
‘Income sprinkling’ (i.e. shifting income that would otherwise be realised by a high-tax individual [e.g. through dividends or capital gains] to low or nil tax rate family members) using private corporations is restricted by making certain aspects of the ‘kiddie tax’ rules (*see above*) also apply to adults in certain situations. The ‘split income’ of the adult family member will be subject to tax at the highest combined federal/provincial (or territorial) marginal rate (i.e. up to 55%). Personal tax credits, other than the dividend, disability, and foreign tax credits, or other deductions cannot be claimed to reduce this tax.
