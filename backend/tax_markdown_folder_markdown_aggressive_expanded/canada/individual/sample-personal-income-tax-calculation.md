| Enhanced government pension plan deduction |  | (838) |
|  |  |  |
| Net income/Taxable income |  | 128,162 |
|  |  |  |
| Federal tax before credits |  | 24,104 |
|  |  |  |
| Less - Personal credits: |  |  |
| Basic | 2,356 |  |
| Spouse | 2,356 | (4,712) |
|  |  |  |
| Less - Other credits: |  |  |

|  |  |  |

| Lesser of 750 and (5,000 / 128,162) x 18,537 = 723 |  | (723) |
|  |  |  |
| Federal income tax |  | 17,814 |
|  |  |  |
| Provincial (Alberta) income tax (2) before credits | 12,816 |  |
|  |  |  |
| Less - Personal credits: |  |  |
| Basic | (2,189) |  |
| Spouse | (2,189) |  |
| Government pension plan and employment insurance plan contributions tax credit | (427) |  |

Notes
1. Assuming the capital gains are not in respect of qualified farm property, qualified fishing property, or shares of a small business corporation, no capital gains deduction is available.
2. In Alberta, the following rates are applied to taxable income in 2024.
| Taxable income (CAD) | | Tax on first column (CAD) | Tax on excess (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 148,269 | 0 | 10 |
| 148,269 | 177,922 | 14,827 | 12 |
| 177,922 | 237,230 | 18,385 | 13 |
| 237,230 | 355,845 | 26,095 | 14 |
| 355,845 |  | 42,701 | 15 |
3. Personal tax credits and miscellaneous tax credits are subtracted from the result to determine Alberta tax. The 2024 Alberta personal tax credit for the government pension plan and employment insurance plan contributions is equal to 10% (maximum credit is CAD 427) of the lesser of the base (non-enhanced) amounts payable and the required base premiums for the year.
4. The taxpayer does not have sufficient tax preference items to be liable for AMT.
