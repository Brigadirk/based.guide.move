## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
An individual may be taxed in Greenland on the basis of full or limited tax liability.
An individual who is resident in Greenland is subject to full tax liability on one’s worldwide income unless the individual is considered a resident of another country according to a double residence clause in a relevant double taxation treaty (DTT).
An individual who is fully tax resident in Greenland will, as a main rule, be taxed at up to 44%, depending on the municipality of taxation. Some deductions are applicable.
An individual not fully tax liable may have limited tax liability to Greenland. Limited tax liability is restricted to income from Greenlandic sources, listed in the Greenlandic Tax Act Section 2, including:
An individual with limited tax liability to Greenland will, as a main rule, be taxed at up to 44% on income from sources in Greenland.
## Personal income tax rates
Generally, individuals are subject to state taxes (national income tax) and municipal tax.
The tax percentages may be adjusted every year, and the 2020 percentages are as follows:
| **Municipality** | **Municipality tax (%)** | **National tax (%)** | **Joint local municipality tax (%)** | **Total tax (%)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Kujalleq | 28 | 10 | 6 | 44 |

## Special regime for oil, gas, and mineral activities and certain construction activities
