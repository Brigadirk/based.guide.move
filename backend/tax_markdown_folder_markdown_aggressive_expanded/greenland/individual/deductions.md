### Life insurance premiums and contributions to pension funds
Payments to life insurance premiums and contributions to pension funds are basically deductible for Greenlandic tax purposes, provided that the payments are made to a Greenlandic pension fund or insurance company. However, deductibility for Greenlandic tax purposes is also subject to several other conditions being fulfilled.
### Mortgage interest expenses
Interest expenses are deductible for Greenlandic tax purposes in the year of accrual. However, if the debtor is unable to pay the interests, the interests are only deductible for Greenlandic tax purposes when paid. Interests regarding property located outside of Greenland are not deductible for Greenlandic tax purposes.
### Taxes paid
Paid taxes are not deductible for Greenlandic tax purposes. However, one should be aware of any obligations or rights in DTTs.
## Standard deductions
Fully tax liable individuals and individuals with limited tax liability from employment and employment related income are entitled to an allowance of DKK 48,000 a year (2016 amount). Persons with full tax liability to Greenland are further entitled to an extra allowance of DKK 10,000 a year (2016 amount). The amounts can be subject to adjustment every year, but have been stable for a number of years.
Foreigners who are subject to the expat flat-tax regime of 35% are not entitled to an allowance on their employment income, but have access to the standard allowance on other income.
## Personal allowances
There are no personal allowances or exemptions for Greenlandic tax purposes.
## Business deductions
The same expenses that are deductible for corporate tax purposes are also deductible for personal business purposes. *See the [Deductions](../corporate/deductions.html) section in the Corporate summary for more information on business expenses*.
## Losses
Business losses can be carried forward for a five-year period. This includes capital losses to the extent they form part of the income. Capital losses on financial contracts may only be offset against capital gains on financial contracts.
