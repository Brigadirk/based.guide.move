# Greenland
## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
## Multiple changes to tax legislation
A bill for changes to the Greenland tax legislation was approved on 14 November 2023. The bill includes various amendments and changes to the Greenland tax legislation, including (but not limited to):
There are some exceptions where the interest WHT of 25% does not apply (e.g. if the recipient of interest is subject to controlling influence of a parent company resident in Denmark, Faroe Islands, or a country with which Greenland has a DTT, provided that the recipient will be subject to local controlled foreign company (CFC) taxation, should the local conditions therefore be met.
Group companies with activity associated with the above industries/activities can also be covered, under certain conditions.
The tax calculation under chapter 3b follows the general Greenland tax principles but with the below special differences/treatments (note that the rules below do have certain aspects and conditions):
The law changes will have effect from the 2024 income year and going forward.
## New Greenlandic transfer pricing guidance
A new regulation has been issued on 17 October 2023, stating that certain companies must submit transfer pricing documentation within 60 days after the tax return deadline.
Whether the company is obligated to prepare and submit transfer pricing documentation depends on whether the controlled transactions reported in specific fields on the S40 form with the tax return exceed the threshold based on a special ’median value‘ calculation. The threshold for 2023 is DKK 500 million (DKK 250 million for 2024).
The threshold will be gradually reduced, and from 2030 all entities with controlled transactions, regardless of size, must submit transfer pricing documentation every year.
The Greenlandic transfer pricing rules also apply to transactions between Greenlandic group entities (no joint taxation in Greenland).
## Change in corporate tax rate and on account tax
The corporate tax rate is 25% for both Greenlandic and foreign companies from 1 January 2020. Previously, a ‘surcharge’ of 6% of the corporate tax payable was applicable, hence the effective corporate tax rate was 26.5%. From 1 January 2022, a company is able to pay on account tax to the Greenland tax authorities. This on account tax has to be paid before the end of the year for the present tax year (the deadline is pushed in cases of income year not following calendar year). If the actual corporate tax exceeds the prepaid on account tax, there is a ‘surcharge’ of 6% of the corporate tax payable; consequently, the effective corporate tax rate is 26.5%. The tax with surcharge is due for payment on 1 November with final due date for payment 20 November. Oil and mineral licence holders are exempt from the 6% surcharge according to current practice.
