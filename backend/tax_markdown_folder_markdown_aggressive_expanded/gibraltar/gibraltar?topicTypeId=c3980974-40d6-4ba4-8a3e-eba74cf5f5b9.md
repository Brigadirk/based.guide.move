# Gibraltar
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
## Taxable period
The taxable period is the accounting period of the company, which begins on the later of the beginning of the accounting period and the date when the company first receives a source of taxable income and ends on the earlier of the end of the accounting period, 12 months from the beginning of the accounting period, or the date on which trade ceased.
## Tax returns
Companies with income subject to tax in Gibraltar are required to file a return and calculate their tax liability for the year. The return, together with the estimated liability, needs to be accompanied by payment of the tax due nine months after the date of the company's financial year end.
Companies with assessable income of more than GBP 1.75 million are required to file audited accounts together with the tax return.
Where companies have assessable income of less than GBP 1.75 million, the accounts can be accompanied by an Independent Accountant's Report.
Companies with no assessable income are still required to file tax returns. The accounts to be filed depend on the size of the company as determined by the CA 2014. Full audited accounts are required except where the company qualifies as 'small', which would mean satisfying two of the following criteria for two consecutive years:
Where the company is 'small' and has no assessable income, only an abridged balance sheet needs to be filed.
## Payment of tax
Companies are required to make payments on account of future liabilities on 28 February and 30 September in each calendar year. Each payment should be equal to 50% of the tax payable for the relevant accounting period. The relevant accounting period is a prior accounting period whose tax payable date (i.e. nine months after the date of the company’s financial year end) precedes the first payment on account date for the accounting period in question. The relevant table in Schedule 10 of the Income Tax Act can be used to determine the correct relevant accounting period for the purposes of calculating the payments on account.
The balance of tax due (i.e. the actual liability less payments on account) is payable on the date of filing of the return.
### Penalties and fines
The following penalties and fines are applicable:
The following increased late filing penalties based on the size of companies as defined in the Companies Act 2014 will apply as of 1 July 2023 (subject to the relevant legislation being enacted):
| Company size | After due date | 3 months after due date | 6 months after due date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Micro / Small | GBP 100 | GBP 450 | GBP 750 |
| Medium | GBP 750 | GBP 1,250 | GBP 2,000 |
| Large | GBP 1,500 | GBP 3,500 | GBP 5,000 |
### Administrative fees
## Tax audit process
The Gibraltar tax system is based on self-assessment. However, the Income Tax Office has powers to make an enquiry into the tax return of a company within a period of 12 months from the date when the return is due to be filed or, if filed later than the deadline, 12 months from the date it was filed. If the Commissioner of Income Tax believes a return to be fraudulent, the above time limits will not apply.
A taxpayer may appeal against a disputed assessment by notice in writing addressed to the Commissioner within 28 days of the date of service of the notice of the assessment.
## Statute of limitations
The Commissioner has up to six years following the date of assessment to revise any incorrect assessments. There is no limit where the incorrect assessment is as a result of fraud, wilful default, or neglect.
Transfer pricing has become a priority area for the Gibraltar Tax Authorities. They have added to their resources and are undergoing a process of upskilling in this area.
