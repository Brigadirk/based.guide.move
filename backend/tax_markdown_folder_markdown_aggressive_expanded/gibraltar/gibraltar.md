# Gibraltar
## Overview
Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
Gibraltar (the Rock) is a peninsula situated at the southern tip of Spain, facing the northern coast of Africa and dominating the western entrance to the Mediterranean. Gibraltar's strategic importance has given it a long and eventful history and an influence on world events.
The Rock now has approximately 30,000 inhabitants. English is the official language, but most Gibraltarians are bilingual in English and Spanish. The currency is the Gibraltar pound (GIP), which is equal to the British pound (GBP).
On 31 January 2020, Gibraltar, together with the United Kingdom (UK), left the European Union (EU). The subsequent transition period ended on 31 December 2020. Negotiations about the United Kingdom's and Gibraltar’s future relationship with the European Union are currently ongoing.
The main sectors of the economy today are financial services, e-online gaming, tourism, a vibrant retail shopping district, and port services, including ship repair and ship conversion. Gibraltar has also positioned itself in recent years as a leading FinTech jurisdiction, being one of the first jurisdictions globally to introduce specific Distributed Ledger Technology Regulations.
