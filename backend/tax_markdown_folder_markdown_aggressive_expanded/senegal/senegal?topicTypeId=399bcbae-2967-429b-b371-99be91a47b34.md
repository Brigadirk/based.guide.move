## Value-added tax (VAT)
Subject to certain exclusions, most commercial operations are subject to an 18% VAT.
VAT on tourism activities is 10%.
A 17% special tax on financial activities (mainly banking, money transfers, interest, premiums and other remunerations received on loans, keeping of bank accounts or equivalent, financial intermediation, and change operations) is applicable instead of VAT.
VAT returns must be filed monthly.
Recently FY25 Finance Law sets the mandatory issuance of electronic invoices via a public invoicing portal or a platform set up by the administration for VAT payers, under penalty of a fine of 25% of the amount of VAT invoiced or due, capped at XOF 5 million.

## Payroll taxes
### Pay-as-you-earn (PAYE)
All compensation (including salary, cash allowances, and benefits in kind) paid to employees is generally taxable. For the calculation of the personal income tax (PIT) to be withheld by the employer, the tax administration provides a tax table determined on a monthly basis so that no calculation is necessary.
### Employer tax
Employers are subject to a 3% tax based on the total gross salaries paid to employees.
## Social Security contributions
Social Security contributions are borne exclusively by the employer.
The rate for the industrial accident/occupational disease branch has to be confirmed by the authority when registering the entity with the Social Security Office (applicable rate to be stated within the related certificate).
| Sector | Rate of contributions (only payable by employers) (%) | Maximum monthly basis of calculation (XOF) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Family | 7 | 63,000 |
| Industrial accident / Occupational disease | 1/3/5 | 63,000 |
## Retirement contributions
Retirement contributions are payable both by the employer and the employees:
| Regime | Rates of contributions (%) | | Maximum monthly basis of calculation (XOF) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Payable by employers | Payable by employees (withheld on the salary) |
| General | 8.4 | 5.6 | 432,000 |
| Executive | 3.6 | 2.4 | 1,296,000 |
## Employment medical coverage
The employer shall subscribe for all employees a medical coverage. The level of coverage depends on the type of agreement concluded with the dedicated organism. Usually, the employee is reimbursed for 80% of medical expenses, even though the law provides a range between 50% and 80%.
The maximum monthly rate is 15%, to be levied on a contribution rate that cannot exceed XOF 250,000, for both the employee and the employer.
## Local Economic Contribution (*Contribution Economique Locale* or CEL)
The CEL is a new contribution replacing the business license tax and consisting of two different taxes:
The company’s properties contribution is assessed annually on the rental value of the company’s business premises. The rental value corresponds to 7% of the cost price.
The applicable rates are 15% for leases premises and 20% for owned premises, lands, and installations.
The company added value contribution is based on the added value produced by a company during the previous year. The tax rate is 1%. An upper ceiling of 70% of the turnover applies to the company added value contribution.
Specific tax rates are provided for companies such as operators of public telecommunication networks licensed in Senegal (0.30%) and port facility operators (1.5%).
