## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
## Employment income
Employees are taxed on all remuneration, including bonuses and certain employment benefits in kind. A number of important exemptions are available (*see Exempt income below*).
Employees are not taxed on reimbursements for business travel and business entertainment expenses.
## Self-employed income/Business income
Profits from a permanent establishment (PE) abroad are exempt from PIT, subject to anti-avoidance rules set out below.
The foreign PE exemption is applicable, unless the below anti-avoidance rule applies:
Losses from an ‘exempt foreign PE’ are eligible to be offset with other income subject to PIT. In such a case, future profits of an ‘exempt foreign PE’ become taxable in Cyprus up to the amount of losses previously allowed.
With effect from 1 July 2016, taxpayers may irrevocably elect to be subject to PIT on foreign PE profits. In such a case, credit in Cyprus will be available for foreign taxes paid on the foreign PE profits. Transitional rules may be applicable to such a credit where a foreign PE was previously exempt from taxation in Cyprus and subsequently a taxpayer elects to be subject to PIT on foreign PE profits.
## Carried interest / Performance fee for Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) and Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) fund managers
Certain employees and executives of investment fund management companies or internally managed investment funds may opt for a different mode of personal taxation:
Subject to conditions, their variable employment remuneration, which is effectively connected to the carried interest of the fund managing entity, may be subject to Cyprus tax at the flat rate of 8%, with a minimum tax liability of EUR 10,000 *per annum*. This special mode of taxation is available for a period of ten years in total, subject to the annual election of the individual, and is not added to any other income.
## Capital gains
## Dividend and interest income
Dividend and (most types of) interest income received by individuals are exempt from PIT but are subject to SDC, which is imposed at flat rates of 17% on dividend income and 17% on interest income (except for corporate and Cyprus government bonds where 3% rate applies).
We note that, as of 16 July 2015, individuals are subject to SDC only in those cases where they are both Cyprus tax resident and Cyprus domiciled for SDC purposes.
## Rental income
Gross rental income (without deductions) is also subject to SDC at an effective rate of 2.25%. However, on 13 September 2023, the CTA issued a Circular pursuant of which rental income from self-catering accommodation that is rented out via online platforms will be treated, subject to certain conditions, as business income (therefore, subject to PIT and exempt from SDC).
We note that, as of 16 July 2015, individuals are subject to SDC only in those cases where they are both Cyprus tax resident and Cyprus domiciled for SDC purposes.
## Exempt income
The following types of personal income are exempt from tax in Cyprus:
