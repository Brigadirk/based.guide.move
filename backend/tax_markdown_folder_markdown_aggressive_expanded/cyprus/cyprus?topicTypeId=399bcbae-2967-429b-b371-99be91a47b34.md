## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is imposed on the supply of goods and services in Cyprus as well as on the acquisition of goods from the European Union and the importation of goods into Cyprus. Taxable persons charge VAT on their taxable supplies (output tax) and are charged with VAT on goods or services that they receive (input tax).
The standard VAT rate in Cyprus is 19%. Additionally, three reduced VAT rates, a 9% rate, a 5% rate, and a 3% rate, as well as a zero rate VAT, apply in Cyprus:
Exports from Cyprus are zero-rated (i.e. no VAT must be charged on the export, and the company is entitled to recover the relevant input VAT suffered). In addition, the supply, modification, repair, maintenance, chartering, and hiring of qualifying aircraft and qualifying vessels, as well as the supply of goods for the fuelling and provisioning of qualifying vessels and qualifying aircraft and the supply of services to meet the client needs of qualifying vessels/aircraft are also treated as zero-rated. An aircraft meets the definition of a qualifying aircraft where it is used by airlines operating for reward chiefly on international routes, and a qualifying vessel is the vessel that is used in the navigation on the high seas for industrial purposes.
Supplies of goods taking place outside the European Union are outside the scope of Cyprus VAT.
Certain supplies in the public interest, such as postal services, education services, medical services, and supplies of charities, are exempt from Cyprus VAT.
The supply of financial services is also exempt.
Supplies of buildings also are exempt from VAT unless the supply relates to new buildings before first use up to 10 November 2022. As of 11 November 2022, according to the VAT Law, as amended by R.A.A. 423/2022, the supply of a building is subject to VAT when supplied before its first delivery and under any subsequent deliveries within a period of five years from its completion, provided that no actual use has occurred by an unrelated person for a period of at least 24 months.
For the purposes of the above provision, the following definitions shall take precedence:
Over the past few years, a number of amendments to Cyprus VAT legislation concerning transactions in real estate were enacted. These amendments comprise of:
Other amendments in the Law include the following:
### VAT registration
VAT registration is compulsory for business with:
Businesses with turnover of less than EUR 15,600, or with supplies that are outside the scope of VAT but for which the right to claim the amount of the related input VAT is granted, have the option to register on a voluntary basis.
An obligation for registration also arises for businesses that:
No registration threshold exists for the provision of intra-Community supplies of goods and services.
Additionally, an obligation for registration arises for businesses carrying out economic activities as a result of the receipt of services from abroad for which an obligation to account for Cyprus VAT under the reverse-charge provision exists, subject to the registration threshold of EUR 15,600 per any consecutive 12-month period.
Supply of goods and services that are exempt from VAT, and disposals of items of capital nature, are not taken into account for determining the annual turnover for registration purposes.
As of 20 August 2020, taxpayers who are not established in Cyprus but are engaged or expect to be engaged in taxable activities in Cyprus in the course of their business also have the obligation to register for VAT purposes without a VAT registration threshold.
### VAT declaration and payment/return of VAT
VAT returns must be electronically submitted on a quarterly basis, and the payment of VAT must be made by the tenth day of the second month that follows the month in which the VAT period ends.
VAT-registered persons have the right to request for a different filing period. The approval of the Commissioner of Taxation is required. The Commissioner of Taxation also has the right to request for a taxable person to file their VAT returns for a different period.
Where, in a quarter, input VAT is higher than output VAT, the difference is refunded (subject to certain conditions) or is transferred for set-off against the VAT payable of the next VAT returns.
Taxpayers who make a claim for VAT refund will be entitled to repayment of the principal amounts together with interest in the event that the repayment is delayed for a period exceeding four months from the date of the submission of the claim.
The grace period for the Tax Department to repay the refundable amounts is extended by another four months (i.e. eight months in total) in the event that the Commissioner of Taxation is carrying out an investigation in relation to the submitted claim.
From 20 August 2020, VAT refunds will be suspended if the taxpayer:
## Customs duties
The nature and value of the goods, as well as the relevant TARIC classification codes, determine whether quotas and other measures apply, as well as the level of customs duties to be imposed. Specifically, the Common Customs Tariff stipulates a tax rate to be applied to the value or number of imported goods, depending on their type. It can either be represented as a fixed amount applied to a certain quantity (i.e. specific tax) or as a percentage applied to the customs value (i.e. *ad valorem* tax).
## Excise taxes
Excise taxes are imposed on certain products, including petroleum, tobacco, and alcoholic drinks.
## Immovable property tax (IPT)
IPT has been abolished as of 1 January 2017.
## Stamp duty
The general rule is that Cyprus stamp duty is imposed only on written instruments relating to assets located in Cyprus or to matters that will take place in Cyprus. The applicable rates are based on the value stipulated in each instrument and are nil for values up to EUR 5,000, 0.15% for values from EUR 5,001 up to EUR 170,000, and 0.2% for values above EUR 170,000, subject to an overall maximum amount of stamp duty of EUR 20,000. Exemption from stamp duty applies in the case of a qualifying reorganisation scheme.
## Capital duty
As of 18 December 2018, capital duty of 0.6% on the authorised share capital or any increases thereof has been abolished.
As a result, no capital duty is imposed from that date onwards on (i) the initial authorised share capital upon incorporation of a new company, and (ii) any subsequent increase of authorised share capital.
The EUR 105 upon incorporation of a new company and the EUR 20 for the issuance of an 'issue and allotment of shares' certificate as regards (i) issued share capital upon incorporation if the shares are issued at a premium, and (ii) any subsequent increase of issued share capital, whether the shares are issued at nominal value or at a premium, remain applicable (i.e. not unaffected by the abolition of capital duty).
## Capital gains tax (CGT)
CGT applies only to gains relating to Cyprus-situated immovable property when the disposal is not subject to CIT.
Disposal for the purposes of CGT specifically includes sale, exchange, lease, gifting, abandoning use of right, granting of right to purchase, and any sums received upon cancellation of disposals.
CGT at the rate of 20% is imposed on gains arising from the disposal of immovable property situated in Cyprus or the disposal of shares in companies that own Cyprus-situated immovable property. CGT is also imposed on disposals of shares in companies that indirectly own immovable property situated in Cyprus where at least 50% of the market value of the said shares derives from Cyprus-situated immovable property. Shares listed on any recognised stock exchange are excluded from CGT.
In the case of disposal of company shares, the gain is calculated exclusively on the basis of the gain relating to Cyprus-situated immovable property. The value of the immovable property will be its market value at the time the shares were disposed of.
The taxable gain is generally calculated as the difference between the disposal proceeds and the original cost of the property plus any improvements as adjusted for inflation up to the date of disposal on the basis of the consumer price index in Cyprus. In the case of property acquired before 1 January 1980, the original cost is deemed to be the value of the property as at 1 January 1980 on the basis of the general valuation conducted by the Land Registry Office under the Immovable Property Law.
Other expenses that relate to the acquisition and disposal of immovable property are also deducted from the gain, subject to certain conditions (e.g. interest costs on related loans, transfer fees, legal expenses).
It is important to note that, subject to conditions, land, as well as land with buildings, acquired at market value (excluding exchanges, donations, and foreclosures) from unrelated parties in the period 16 July 2015 to 31 December 2016 will be exempt from CGT upon their future disposal.
Finally, certain disposals are totally exempt from CGT based on their nature (e.g. gifts from parents to children or between spouses).
## Immovable property transfer fees
The fees charged by the Department of Land and Surveys to the acquirer for transfers of Cyprus-situated immovable property are as follows:
| Market value (EUR) | Rate (%) | Fee (EUR) | Accumulated fee (EUR) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Up to 85,000 | 3 | 2,550 | 2,550 |
| 85,001 to 170,000 | 5 | 4,250 | 6,800 |
| Over 170,000 | 8 |  |  |
It is important to note that:
Certain debt-for-asset swap arrangements may, under certain conditions, be exempted from transfer fees.
Mortgage registration fees are 1% of the current market value.
In the case of companies’ reorganisations, transfers of immovable property are not subject to transfer fees or mortgage registration fees.
## Immovable property transfer levy
As of 22 February 2021, a levy of 0.4% applies on all disposals of immovable property that are within the current control of the Republic of Cyprus (i.e. both trading-nature and capital-nature disposals).
As of 18 November 2022, the levy applies on all disposals of immovable property as well as disposals of shares of a company that directly or indirectly holds immovable property.
In cases involving a direct disposal of immovable property, the levy is imposed on the disposal consideration, whereas in cases involving a disposal of shares of a company, the levy is imposed on the latest general valuation undertaken by the Department of Land and Surveys.
The obligation for payment of the levy lies with the seller.
The following direct or indirect disposals of immovable property are exempt:
During the period 22 February 2021 to 17 November 2022, different provisions applied with respect to certain aspects of the levy. For example, during this period, the levy is applied only on disposals of immovable property itself and disposals of shares of a company that directly held immovable property to the extent that the buyer of the shares assumes control of such company.
## Payroll taxes
In addition to the employers' own contributions on their employees’ gross salaries (*see below*), employers are also responsible to withhold from employees’ earnings the employees’ contributions to the social insurance fund, General Healthcare System (GHS), and employees' personal income tax (PIT) burden through the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system.
## Social security contributions
Employed persons are compulsorily insured under a state-administered social insurance fund. Contributions to the fund are borne by both employer and employee. The employer’s contributions are calculated as a percentage of the employee’s earnings. The employer also contributes to other funds as set out in the table below:
| Funds | Employer contribution (% of employee’s earnings) (1) |
| --- | --- |
| Social insurance fund | 8.8 (2, 3) |
| Redundancy fund | 1.2 |
| Training development fund | 0.5 |
| Social cohesion fund | 2.0 |
| GHS contributions | 2.90 (3, 4) |
| Holiday fund (if not exempt) | 8.0 |
Notes
1. With the exception of the social cohesion fund, the maximum amount of monthly earnings on which the contributions are paid is EUR 5,551 for 2025 (EUR 5,239 for 2024). This maximum is usually adjusted for inflation annually at the beginning of each calendar year.
2. The rate of 8.8% applies for both the employer and the employee as of 1 January 2024 and for the next five years. Thereafter, the rate will increase every five years until it reaches 10.3% to 10.7% (depending on the results of the actuarial studies to be performed) as of 1 January 2039.
3. The employee must also contribute at the same rate as the employer to the social insurance fund and the GHS fund at 8.8% and 2.65%, respectively (*see 4 below*), but not to the other funds. It is the employer’s responsibility to withhold this contribution upon payment of employee’s earnings.
4. GHS contributions are capped at EUR 180,000 annual income.
## Exit taxes
A Cyprus CIT payer will be subject to the Cyprus exit taxation provisions in cases where assets are transferred outside the Cyprus income tax net (outbound transfers) in any of the following circumstances:
Under certain conditions, temporary transfers of assets falling within the above-mentioned categories are excluded from the scope of the exit taxation provisions.
### Amount subject to tax
In the circumstances outlined above, at the time of the transfer the taxpayer is deemed to have transferred the assets at an amount equal to their market value at that time, such that any profit thereon is calculated as the difference between that market value less their value for tax purposes at that time. Such profit is subject to CIT law provisions (e.g. the transfer of a qualifying ‘title’ [such as shares in a company] will be exempt upon transfer as qualifying titles are exempt from Cyprus income tax).
### Deferral of payment of tax
Where there is a transfer subject to Cyprus CIT (*see above*), it is chargeable to tax at the time of transfer. In certain cases, the taxpayer has the choice to make the relevant CIT payment in instalments over a period of five years. Deferral of payment is a possible option for the taxpayer only in cases where the transfer is to another EU member state, or an EEA state with which Cyprus (or the European Union) has an agreement on the recovery of tax claims equivalent to the mutual assistance provided for in the EU Directive (2010/24/EU) concerning mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to taxes, duties, and other measures.
When a taxpayer opts for payment of tax in instalments, then the Cyprus tax authorities will charge interest. Additionally, the Cyprus tax authorities may, in certain cases, request a guarantee.
If certain future events occur, deferral of payment of tax will be immediately discontinued and the balance of the tax debt will become immediately payable.
### Inbound transfers
Where assets are transferred to Cyprus from another EU member state under the same scope as for outbound transfers (*see above*), then the assets’ starting value for tax purposes in Cyprus is the value at the time of transfer as established by the transferor EU member state (unless this does not reflect the assets’ market value at that time).
