## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 21 July 2024
All expenses that are necessary and normal to the business, paid or accrued, are allowable deductions, provided the expense meets the following conditions:
## Depreciation
A depreciation deduction is allowed under the following limitations as stipulated by the law:
Depreciation for tax purposes is calculated as follows, based on the following five categories of depreciable tangible or intangible assets, other than land:
| Asset category | Depreciation rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Fixed buildings | 5 |
| Industrial and agricultural movable buildings | 10 |
| Factories, machines and equipment, computer application programs, passenger cars, and cargo vehicles | 25 |
| Expenditures for geological surveying, drilling, exploration, and other preliminary work to exploit and develop natural resources and their fields | 20 |
| All other tangible or intangible assets not included in previous categories, such as furniture, planes, ships and trains, and goodwill | 10 |
The declining-balance method of depreciation, according to the above rates, should be followed for tax purposes. However, straight-line depreciation is allowed for Zakat payers as per Zakat regulations.
There are also rules for depreciation relating to assets either acquired or disposed of. Essentially, 50% of the allowable acquisition price or disposal proceeds is added to or subtracted from the asset pool in the first year, and the remaining 50% in the following year.
From 1 January 2018, the cost base of assets transferred or distributed between companies that are part of the same group should be set at the net book value.
Assets under build, own, and transfer (BOT) and build, own, operate, and transfer (BOOT) are allowed to be depreciated over the contract period. This presumes, although it is not clear, that assets under the BOT and BOOT schemes actually will have a separate grouping in addition to the above prescribed groups.
## Start-up expenses
Tax treatment of start-up expenses depend on how they were treated under Saudi generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Generally, they can be fully expensed in the first financial year or can be capitalised and amortised.
## Loan charges (interest expenses)
An interest deduction is limited to the lower of the loan charge incurred during the tax year, if related to income that is subject to tax, or the result of the following formula, whichever is less.
The taxpayer’s total income from loan charges, plus 50% of (A minus B) as below:
A = income subject to tax other than income from loan charges.
B = expenses allowed under the law other than loan charge expenses.
Note that this formula does not apply to banks and interest charges used to finance capital assets that are capitalised / added to the value of the asset during the construction phase of that asset.
## Bad debt
Bad debts are deductible, provided they meet all of the following conditions:
## Charitable contributions
In determining the tax base of each taxpayer, a deduction is allowed for donations paid during the taxable year to public agencies or philanthropic societies licensed in Saudi Arabia, which are non-profit organisations and are allowed to receive donations.
## Allocations and reserves
Allocations and reserves formed during the year are deductible as follows:
A reserve for unearned premiums means a part of premium amounts collected or stated in books that covers risks related to the future tax year(s). A reserve for unexpired risks mean the amount of compensation claimed or reported, but for which the payment process falls short of completion during the tax year.
## School fees
School fees paid by taxpayers for their employees’ children are deductible expenses, provided they meet the following conditions:
## Pension fund
Employers’ contributions to employees’ pension funds or savings funds established under Saudi Arabia’s rules and regulations are deductible, provided that such contribution, one payment or in aggregate, is not in excess of 25% of the employee’s income before the employer’s contributions and that the fund meets the following criteria:
A capital company is allowed to deduct its contribution to a retirement fund, a social insurance fund, or any other fund established for the purpose of settling employee end-of-service benefits or to meet staff medical expenses, provided they meet certain conditions. It should be noted that there is a notification requirement to ZATCA in order to claim any deduction of the contribution.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties related to income tax, paid or payable in Saudi Arabia or to other countries, are not deductible.
Financial fines or penalties paid or payable to any party in Saudi Arabia, such as traffic fines or fines for causing damage to public utilities, are also not deductible.
Fines or penalties paid for breach of contractual obligations, such as fines on delayed or defaulted completion of contracts, are deductible, provided they are documented by the contracting party and the income from such penalties is reported in the year of recovery.
## Taxes
Income taxes are not deductible.
## Non-deductible expenses
The following expenses are non-deductible:
## Net operating losses
A taxpayer may carry forward operational losses, as adjusted, to the years following the loss year until the cumulative loss is fully offset. The maximum profit percentage of any year that could be used to offset cumulative losses should not exceed 25% of the year’s taxable profit as reported in the taxpayer’s return. Carryback of losses is not allowed.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments made to head offices located abroad by local branches are not deductible. Such payments include:
The value of goods or services delivered to the taxpayer by related parties is not deductible to the extent that it is in excess of an arm’s-length value.
