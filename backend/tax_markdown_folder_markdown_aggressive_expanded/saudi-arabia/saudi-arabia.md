# Saudi Arabia
## Overview
Last reviewed - 21 July 2024
The country is a leading producer of oil and natural gas. The government continues to pursue economic reform and diversification, particularly since Saudi Arabia's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in December 2005, and promote foreign investment. A burgeoning population, aquifer depletion, and an economy largely dependent on petroleum output and prices are all ongoing governmental concerns.
Saudi Arabia possesses about 20% of the world's proven petroleum reserves, ranks as the largest exporter of petroleum, and plays a leading role in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
In April 2016, Saudi Arabia introduced the Vision 2030 plan to reduce its dependence on oil, diversify the economy, and develop service sectors, such as health, education, infrastructure construction, recreation and tourism, and many more. The sweeping reforms outlined in the Vision 2030 and National Transformation Plan affect vast areas of the government, the economy, and citizens. Tax policy will play a significant role in these reforms as part of the government’s efforts to diversify revenues away from oil and address broader social and economic objectives while maintaining a fertile business environment and continuing to attract foreign direct investment (FDI).
Furthermore, Saudi Arabia is encouraging the growth of the private sector in order to diversify its economy and to employ more Saudi nationals. Diversification efforts are focusing on power generation, telecommunications, natural gas exploration, and petrochemical sectors. Roughly 10 million foreign workers play an important role in the Saudi economy, particularly in the oil and service sectors.
