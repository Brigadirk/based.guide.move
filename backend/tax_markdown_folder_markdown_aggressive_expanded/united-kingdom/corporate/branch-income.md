## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 15 December 2024
Tax rates on the profits of UK PEs of non-resident corporations are the same as for domestic corporations.
As part of the legislative consultation back in June 2023, in addition to the PE threshold options considered (*see 'Permanent establishment (PE)' in the [Corporate residence](corporate-residence.html) section for more information*), HMRC is considering amending the domestic provisions in relation to profit attribution to align with the AOA. As noted above, the Government has announced that it will further consult on these reforms in Spring 2025.
Tax is not generally withheld on transfers of profits from a UK PE to the head office.
