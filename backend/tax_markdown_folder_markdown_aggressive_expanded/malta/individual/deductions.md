## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
## Employment expenses
To be deductible, expenses of an employee must be incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of the income and must be necessarily incurred. Where the employer reimburses employees for expenses incurred on the employer's behalf, no tax liability should arise in the hands of the recipients unless a gain or profit accrues to them from the arrangement.
## Personal deductions
Alimony payments paid by a taxpayer to an estranged spouse are allowed as a deduction, while the receipt of the alimony is taxable in the hands of the recipient. The receipt of a payment for the maintenance of children is not taxable in the hands of the estranged spouse and not deductible in the hands of the person making the payment.
Certain deductions are allowable, which include:
## Personal allowances
No personal allowances by way of deductions or credits are granted.
## Business deductions
