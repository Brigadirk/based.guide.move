## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 19 January 2025
In accordance with the Iraqi Investment Law, approved industrial projects are given certain custom duty and tax incentives; however, oil and gas is not one of the sectors that is normally granted investment promotion exemptions incentives.
The tax incentives may include corporate tax, individual tax, and others; however, the tax incentives vary from one project to another.
The Board of Investment Promotion has the authority to add any sector or specific project to the list of sectors or projects that benefit from the investment promotion law incentives.
## Foreign tax credit
Income tax paid to a foreign country on income earned in that country may be credited against tax paid to Iraq. The amount of the credit may not exceed the amount of tax assessed in Iraq.
