# Iraq
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 19 January 2025
In general, all expenses incurred by the taxpayer in order to produce income during the year are deducted from income, provided that such expenses are confirmed by acceptable documents, with some exceptions.
## Depreciation
The depreciation method is either a straight-line method or declining-balance method.
## Goodwill
Iraqi tax law does not contain a provision that covers the deductibility of goodwill.
## Start-up expenses
Iraqi tax law does not contain a provision that covers the deductibility of start-up expenses. However, as per Iraqi GAAP, such cost will be capitalised and amortised once the operation is started.
## Interest expenses
Iraqi tax law does not contain a provision that covers the deductibility of interest expenses.
## Bad debt
Bad debt is deductible if it was included in earlier income and there is proof of the unsuccessful steps to collect it.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions to the Government and Socialist Sector departments and to scientific, cultural, educational, charitable, and spiritual organisations, which are legally recognised (provided that the Minister of Finance has issued a list containing the names of these organisations), are deductible.
## Bribes and illegal payments
Bribes and illegal payments are not allowed or deductible.
## Fines and penalties
Broadly speaking, fines and penalties are not deductible items.
## Taxes
Broadly speaking, taxes are not deductible items.
## Net operating losses
Under the tax law, losses of a taxpayer from some sources of income arising in Iraq, substantiated by legally accepted documents, are generally deducted from profits arising from other sources.
Losses that can be settled in this manner shall be carried forward and deducted from the income of the taxpayer over five consecutive years, provided that losses may not offset more than half of the taxable income of each of the five years and the loss is from the same source of income from which it has arisen.
Losses cannot be carried back.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Iraqi tax law does not contain a provision that covers the deductibility of payments to foreign affiliates.
