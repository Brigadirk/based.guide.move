## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 19 January 2025
## Social security contributions
Social security tax is imposed on salaries and benefits of local and expatriate employees, after the deduction of allowances. The employer's contribution is 12% and the employee's contribution is 5% from net salaries. The contribution of employers that are categorised as prime will be 25%.
## Consumption taxes
### Sales tax
A new sales tax law was issued in early 2015 whereby a sales tax of 300% will be imposed on alcohol and tobacco (cigarettes), 15% on travel tickets, 15% on cars, and 20% on mobile recharge cards and internet. This is in addition to services rendered by deluxe and first class restaurants and hotels, which were already subject to a 10% sales tax.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Iraq.
## Inheritance and gift taxes
Inheritance is taxed as follows:
Taxation of gifts is unclear, but it may be subject to the normal PIT rate.
## Property taxes
A basic tax of 10% is assessed on the annual revenue for all real estate and is collected from the real estate owner or the long-term lessee (five years). In cases where the owner or long-term lessee cannot be located, the person occupying the real estate will be assessed. Note that the annual revenue for each real estate is discounted by 10% for expenses and maintenance before assessing the tax on that real estate.
## Luxury and excise taxes
There is no tax provision in the Iraqi Tax Law addressing excise taxes.
