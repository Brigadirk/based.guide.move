# Sweden
## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Introduction of the concept of 'economic employer'
The Swedish government implemented the concept of ‘economic employer’ into Swedish tax law as of 1 January 2021. Previously, Sweden applied a more formal employer concept.
The new concept particularly applies when interpreting the so-called ‘183-days rule’ in tax treaties where Sweden is a contracting state. The regulations will, however, not impact employees working in Sweden for a maximum of 15 days in a row or 45 days in total during a calendar year.
## New rules on mandatory tax withholding
In addition to the introduction of the economic employer concept, new rules on on tax withholding for work performed in Sweden were introduced from 1 January 2021.
A withholding tax (WHT) obligation now applies for Swedish payers when making payments to a foreign company, or to a non-resident person, for work carried out in Sweden, unless the recipient of the payment is approved for F-tax (an F-tax certificate signifies that you are an entrepreneur who is responsible for paying your own taxes and contributions).
