## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 16 December 2024
A corporation resident in Mauritius is subject to tax on its worldwide income. A non-resident corporation is liable to tax on any Mauritius-source income, subject to any applicable tax treaty provisions.
Corporations are liable to income tax on their net income, currently at a flat rate of 15%. Companies engaged in the export of goods are liable to be taxed at the rate of 3% on the chargeable income attributable to exports based on a prescribed formula.

All corporate bodies incorporated in Mauritius (except certain approved funds and associations) are subject to income tax. Income derived by local partnerships (resident *sociétés*) is shared and taxed in the hands of the partners.
