## Social security contributions
### Contribution Sociale Generalisee (CSG)
As of 1 September 2020, the pension system under the National Pensions Fund (NPF) is being abolished and replaced by the CSG. Every participant and every employer of a participant is liable to pay CSG at prescribed rates depending on their remuneration. A participant means an employee or self-employed person, on a full-time or part-time basis, but does not include a public sector employee.
The rate of contribution applicable is shown in the table below.
| Category of employee | Rate applicable on the basic wage or salary of the employee and to be deducted from the wage or salary of the employee (%) | Rate applicable on the basic wage or salary of the employee and payable by the employer (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| An employee, other than a public sector employee, earning a basic wage or salary not exceeding MUR 50,000 in a month. | 1.5 | 3.0 |
| An employee other than a public sector employee earning a basic wage or salary exceeding MUR 50,000 in a month. | 3.0 | 6.0 |
| Public sector employee earning a basic wage or salary not exceeding MUR 50,000 in a month. | Not applicable | 4.5 |
| Public sector employee earning a basic wage or salary exceeding MUR 50,000 in a month. | Not applicable | 9.0 |
| An employee who is in the domestic service earning a basic wage or salary not exceeding MUR 3,000 in aggregate in a month from one or more employers. | Not applicable | 3.0 |
Failure to comply with the above entails a penalty of 10% of the unpaid tax and an interest of 1% per month or part of the month during which the tax remained unpaid.

Employers are required to contribute 2.5% of remuneration to the NSF and to pay a monthly levy of 1.5% of basic salaries and wages of every employee. Employees are required to pay a 1% levy.
