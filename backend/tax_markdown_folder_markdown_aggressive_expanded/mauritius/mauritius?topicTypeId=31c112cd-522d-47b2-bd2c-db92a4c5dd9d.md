## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 14 October 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year in Mauritius runs from 1 July to 30 June.
## Tax returns
Income tax returns are filed in respect of a year of assessment ending 30 June on the basis of the income earned during the preceding income year ended 30 June.

has to declare one's income to the MRA by submitting an individual tax return not later than 30 September following that income year on a prescribed form, disclosing income from all sources as well as full particulars of deductions, allowances, and tax credit reliefs claimed.

A married woman is assessed separately from her husband with regard to all income derived by her. She is entitled to claim all personal reliefs and deductions available to an individual taxpayer.
The number of dependants for whom deductions may be claimed is limited to four by either the wife or the husband.

If tax is underpaid under the PAYE system, the unpaid balance becomes payable on or before 30 September following the end of the income year. If tax is overpaid, a refund of the excess tax is made to the taxpayer, normally within three months from the date of filing of the annual return of income.
