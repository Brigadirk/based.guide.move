## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
Withholding agents must withhold CIT from certain payments. Withholding agents include resident legal entities, resident individuals registered as sole proprietorships or acting as employers, and non-residents having a PE or acting as employers in Estonia. The tax must be reported and paid by the tenth day of the month following the payment. CIT is not withheld from payments to resident companies, registered sole proprietorships, and registered PEs of non-resident companies. The following rules are in place with respect to payments that are subject to WHT:
For non-residents without a PE in Estonia, the tax withheld from these payments at domestic or treaty rates constitutes final tax in terms of their Estonian-source income, and they do not have any tax reporting requirements in Estonia.
For certain types of Estonian-source income, non-residents are liable under Estonian domestic law to self-assess their Estonian tax and submit a tax return to the Estonian tax authorities. These types of income include:
From 2019, Estonia has effective tax treaties with the territories listed in the table below. A treaty has been signed with Morocco, but this is not yet effective.
The following WHT rates apply to dividends, interest, and royalties paid to a recipient or beneficial owner resident in a tax treaty country. The lower of the domestic or the treaty rate is given.

Notes
1. Under the domestic law, the rate is nil for all non-resident corporate shareholders and 7% for non-resident individual shareholders if the dividend distribution has been taxed with the reduced CIT rate at the hands of the distributing company.
2. Under the domestic law, the rate is nil for all non-resident individual and corporate creditors.
3. The rate is nil for arm’s-length royalties paid to an associated EU or Swiss company if certain conditions are met.
4. The lower 5% rate applies to royalties paid for the use of industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment.
5. The lower 5% rate applies to royalties paid for the use of copyright royalties, excluding software royalties.
6. The lower 8% rate applies to royalties paid for the use of industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment.
7. The definition of royalties precludes fees paid for the use of equipment, and royalties are exempt from WHT in Estonia.
