## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
Registered PEs of non-residents, much as with resident companies, are subject to CIT only in respect of profit distributions, both actual and deemed, as defined in domestic law.
Transactions and dealings between a head office and its PE(s) should be conducted on arm’s-length terms. Thus, such profits should be attributed to a PE of a non-resident taxpayer that the PE would be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate taxpayer engaged in the same or similar activities, and under the same or similar conditions, and dealing in a wholly independent manner with its head office.
