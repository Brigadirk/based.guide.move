## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 12 June 2024
WHT will also be payable on income earned by non-resident or resident individuals on the basis of repurchase of used products, semi-final products, and agricultural products from a manufacturer registered for VAT purposes.
Distributions of dividends and share of profits are also subject to WHT if the recipient is a Montenegrin resident (either an individual or legal entity).
The general WHT rate is 15%.
Application of a double tax treaty (DTT) may reduce or eliminate Montenegrin WHT. To qualify for the beneficial rates prescribed by the treaty, a non-resident must prove tax residency of a relevant treaty country and beneficial ownership over the income. In order to qualify for a preferential tax rate according to a DTT, a non-resident will need to provide the tax residency certificate filled out and stamped by the relevant authority of its country of residence.
Although Serbia is regarded as the legal successor of the Serbia and Montenegro State Union that ceased to exist in June 2006, the Republic of Montenegro, upon its Decision on Independence (dated 3 June 2006), continues to honour international treaties that were applicable in the State Union, including those executed by State Union’s legal predecessors (Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, i.e. former Yugoslavia).
