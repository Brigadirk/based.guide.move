# Cayman Islands
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 29 November 2024
Since no corporate income, capital gains, payroll, or other direct taxes are currently imposed on corporations in the Cayman Islands, corporate residency is not relevant in the context of Cayman Islands taxation.
Entities engaged in 'scheduled' trade and business in the Cayman Islands (as defined in the Trade & Business Licensing Law) are required to have a trade and business licence. Effecting and concluding contracts in the Cayman Islands and exercising, in the Cayman Islands, powers necessary for the carrying on of a business outside the Cayman Islands is generally not considered to be engaging in trade and business in the Cayman Islands.
