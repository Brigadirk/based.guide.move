## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 19 September 2024
## Inventory valuation
Inventory can be valued at weighted-average cost, first in first out (FIFO), or current value at the close of the period, where this value is lower than the purchase price or production cost. Work-in-progress should be valued at production costs.
## Capital gain
Capital gains form part of taxable income.
## Dividend income
Dividend income forms part of taxable income.
Gross dividend income received by a resident company from a non-resident enterprise is subject to CIT. A foreign tax credit for taxes paid on these dividends is allowed for deduction from the CIT. The maximum amount of the foreign tax credit is the CIT liability with respect to that dividend income.
## Passive income
Designated passive income (such as interest, royalties, and rent) forms part of taxable income.
## Foreign income
Resident entities are taxed on their worldwide income, and tax credits are available for foreign taxes incurred. Foreign income is taxable in the period it is earned; there is no provision allowing tax to be deferred on the income earned overseas.
