## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 19 September 2024
## **VAT exemption on certain e-commerce financial transaction services**
The General Department of Taxation (GDT) issued letter No. 29613 to confirm to the Associations of Banks and Microfinance that certain e-commerce financial transaction services are considered non-taxable supplies. They are summarised as follows:
1. Expenses on education, training, relevant study documents and educational documents in electronic form (e.g. electronic documents, books, videos) supplied by educational institutions officially recognised by the countries where the institutions are established.
2. Overseas lawyer service fee expenses supplied by law firms.
3. Independent director fee expenses.
4. Expenses on risk rating assessment services provided by Moody, S&P or Fitch, the agencies recognised by the National Bank of Cambodia.
5. Monthly fees, bank charges and TT fees and charges related to money settlement transactions, money transfers or inward remittance services for customers or the bank itself from overseas banks.
6. Expenses on overseas transfers for customers.
7. Expenses on transactions to obtain overseas loans (e.g. interest and other charges by the lenders).
8. Direct expenses incurred for money transfers charged by SWIFT or BOTTOMLINE. Annual fees for system usage, license, royalty or system maintenance paid to SWIFT or BOTTOMLINE are subject to VAT on e-commerce transactions.
9. Direct expenses incurred for settlement transactions via credit or debit card and cash withdrawal services from ATM charged by Visa, Mastercard, Union Pay, UPI, AMEX or JCB company. Annual fees for system usage, license, royalty or system maintenance paid to Visa, Mastercard, Union Pay, UPI, AMEX, or JCB companies are subject to VAT on e-commerce transactions.
10. Customer’s expense for staying at VIP lounge in airports in other countries is not non-taxable supply and not subject to VAT on E-commerce transactions.
The above confirmation is not retroactive for tax amounts already paid.
## **Clarification of 1) tax relief for a rent-free period during construction, improvements or reparation and 2) claimable input VAT credit on mobile phone service charges used for business purposes**
At the GDT and Private Sector Tax Working Group meeting on 4 July 2024, the private sector raised various points for discussion, including the following.
During the rent-free period provided by the landlords for the lessees to prepare for construction, improvements or reparation, the GDT agreed that the relevant taxes, including income tax, VAT or withholding tax, are not applicable as long as those period and purposes are stated clearly in the lease contracts. Income or expenses were recognised by the relevant parties during that period. The GDT will prepare regulations to clarify further.
## **Some other tax incentive measures**
1. Extension of capital gains tax (CGT) exemption for real estate business until the end of 2025. At this stage, it is still unclear whether the extension applies to capital gains arising from other investments (e.g. share disposals).
2. Exempt penalty and interest for voluntarily filing amended tax returns until the end of June 2025.
3. Extensions of other tax incentives for specific sectors such as tourism in Siem Reap province, agriculture, and education.
The relevant regulations will be issued later.
## **Establishment of special tax audit unit under the General Department of Taxation (GDT) of the Ministry of Economy and Finance**
The Cambodian Government issued a sub-decree to establish a special tax audit unit under the supervision of the GDT of the Ministry of Economy and Finance on 16 July 2024. The unit’s rank is equal to the GDT’s department level. The purpose of the newly established unit is to advance and speed up resolutions to taxpayers’ problems with tax audits, to improve the business and investment environment in Cambodia.
The key roles and responsibilities of the unit include:
The special tax audit unit can ask the Director General of the GDT to review and resolve outstanding issues in the tax audits of the enterprises it oversees, working together with other GDT units.
Enterprises that may be transferred under the supervision of this special tax audit unit include those that have received a Gold Tax Compliance Certificate and other enterprises determined by a committee to be established by the GDT.
## Reduction of withholding tax (WHT) and specific tax (SPT) rates for airline companies
The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) issued Instruction 009 to provide the following instructions for implementing WHT and SPT to relieve airline companies’ tax burden on the lease of aircrafts from foreign companies and the burden of people travelling by air.
## Standard operating procedures for tax audits (SOP for tax audits)
The Cambodian tax authorities have issued a tax audit SOP to guide tax officers in managing the tax audit process. This SOP aims to prevent different departments from creating duplicate tax audits.
## Income tax incentives for the expansion of qualified investment projects (QIPs)
The MEF issued Prakas 313 dated 10 May 2024 to provide further guidelines for income tax incentives for the expansion of QIPs as stated in Article 16 of Sub-Decree 139 on Implementation of the Investment Law in Cambodia.
The income tax exemption is provided for the below expansion of QIPs:
The expansion of the QIP is entitled to a specific period of income tax exemption in line with initial investment activities, which ranges from three to nine years depending on the sectors and investment activities as stated in the annex of Sub-Decree 139.
The qualified expansion is limited only to additional investment capital paid each year and used for construction materials and new production equipment (excluding the value of land and working capital).
## Tax for public lighting (TPL)
The Royal Government of Cambodia has issued a Sub-Decree to determine the TPL rate for the supply of alcoholic or tobacco products in Cambodia.
Effective from 1 April 2024, the TPL rate for the supply of alcoholic or tobacco products will be 5%.
Detailed rules and procedures for managing the TPL collection will be determined by a Prakas of the MEF.​
## Amendment to SPT rates for domestically produced non-alcoholic drinks
Effective from 1 September 2023, the SPT rates for domestically produced and supplied non-alcoholic drinks will be as follows:
The SPT calculation base will follow Prakas 012 MEF.BrK dated 14 January 2020 on the amendment to the SPT base for certain locally produced goods.
## Implementation of value-added tax (VAT) on imported cigarettes
With the Samdech Prime Minister’s endorsement, the MEF issued Instruction 017 on the implementation of VAT on imported cigarettes. It stipulates the following:
This Instruction will be effective from 1 August 2023.
## Instruction on advance income tax payments on dividend distributions
The instruction sets out the following guidelines:
### Tax base for advance income tax payments on dividend distributions
In the current taxable year, if an enterprise distributes dividends derived from different sources of income that are subject to different annual income tax rates, the enterprise must comply with the following rules:
- 25% for the first two years.
- 50% for the next two years.
- 75% for the last two years.
### Advance income tax payments on dividend distributions
Advance income tax payments on dividend distributions are determined as follows:
## Updated VAT instruction on eCommerce
The General Department of Taxation (GDT) has issued Instruction No. 2520, dated 24 January 2023, on the reverse-VAT charge. This replaces Instruction No. 20522, dated 8 December 2021. The contents of both instructions are largely the same, except for these changes that may have an impact on your company:
## Insurance technical reserves
The MEF has issued Prakas No. 063 to provide guidelines on calculating the technical reserves of companies in the insurance industry in Cambodia. These guidelines are to be used for income tax computation purposes. Failure to maintain sufficient insurance technical reserves, to submit a quarterly technical reserve report, as well as prepare an annual report on insurance premium computing recommendations by the stipulated deadlines, will result in penalties based on this Prakas and current tax laws and regulations.
For 12 months from the date of this Prakas, the previous calculation method for technical reserves can still be used by insurance companies.
## Use of official exchange rates for taxpayers under the self-declaration regime
The GDT has revised the use of the official exchange rates as follows:
### The daily official exchange rate
Taxpayers shall use the official exchange rate issued daily by the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) or a market exchange rate, but it must not be lower than the NBC’s official daily exchange rate for Cambodian riel for the total price of the invoice. If there are specific days or other times that the NBC doesn’t issue its official exchange rate, taxpayers will use the official exchange rate that the NBC issued one day prior.
Non-resident taxpayers who register for simplified VAT are not required to use Cambodian riel for the total price of the invoice.​ For preparing tax returns in Cambodian riel and calculating VAT to be paid, non-resident taxpayers shall use monthly official exchange rates (*see below*).
### Official exchange rate for tax on salary
Taxpayers will use the official exchange rate issued by the NBC on the 15th day of each month when calculating salary tax. If the 15th day of each month falls on a day the NBC doesn’t issue its official exchange rate, taxpayers will use the NBC’s official exchange rate issued one day prior.
### Monthly official exchange rate
Taxpayers will use the official exchange rate issued by the NBC on the last day of each month to calculate monthly tax payments for supplies by non-resident taxpayers who have registered for simplified VAT or any transaction without Cambodian riel on an invoice, such as transactions supplied by a person not under the self-declaration regime or a non-resident.
### Annual official exchange rate
Taxpayers will use the official exchange rate issued by the NBC on the last day of December of each year for which the annual tax returns are prepared and annual tax payments are calculated.
This new Instruction will be effective from the date of its signature. Instruction No. 10362 GDT, dated 17 May 2022, on using official exchange rates for taxpayers under the self-declaration regime will be abrogated.
## VAT state-charge for basic daily food items
The MEF issued Prakas 009 to determine that VAT on certain basic food items for the people’s daily living shall be borne by the state for the next two years.
Under this Prakas, ‘basic food’ refers to certain food necessary for the daily living, such as the following:
The VAT on domestic supplies of these basic foods will be considered as a state-charge for the two years from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2023.
Under this Prakas, food supplied by restaurants shall be excluded from the above.
## E-document submission system
The GDT has cancelled the E-document facility from 10 January 2023.
## Capital gains tax
The MEF issued Prakas No. 346 to implement capital gains tax on sale or transfer of immovable property, leases, investment assets, goodwill, intellectual property (IP), and foreign currencies. The tax rate on capital gains is flat at 20%.
### Calculation of the capital gains tax
Taxpayers must submit tax returns and pay capital gains tax to the GDT within three months after realising the capital gain.
Under this Prakas, the capital gains tax would have been effective from 1 July 2020. However, the RGC has announced the delay of implementation of the capital gains tax until the end of 2025.
