## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 04 March 2024
Taxation of branch income is the same as for corporate income. However, a 20% WHT on profit is due at the time the profit is taken by the head office (located abroad) of the branch. This rate is reduced to 10% in case of the existence of a tax treaty.
## Simplified tax regime for oil subcontractors
The simplified tax regime for oil subcontractors is abrogated from 1 January 2022.
## Specific regime for regional offices (*quartiers généraux*)
A regional office is a company or a branch that renders various administrative services, such as management or accounting, exclusively to other companies of the same group based in a given geographical area (usually a group of countries).
The derogatory tax regime that was applicable to the said regional offices has been abrogated by the amended Financial Act for 2021. The tax base of such offices is then determined in accordance with the common law regime.
