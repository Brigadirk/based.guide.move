Kosovo is a member of the Central European Free Trade Area (CEFTA).
The Stabilization and Association Agreement aimed at liberalizing trade with the European Union entered into force in April 2016.
The Free Trade Agreement between the Republic of Kosovo and Republic of Turkey entered into force in September 2019.
There is a Partnership, Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the Republic of Kosovo and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

The IGA requires, in particular, the exchange of certain information with respect to US reportable accounts on an automatic basis.
