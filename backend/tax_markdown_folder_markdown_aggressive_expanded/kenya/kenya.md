# Kenya
## Overview
Last reviewed - 18 February 2025
Kenya is located along the Indian Ocean on the East coast of Africa and is bordered by Tanzania to the south, Uganda to the west, South Sudan to the northwest, Ethiopia to the north, and Somalia to the northeast. The capital city of Kenya is Nairobi, and the official languages are Swahili and English. The official currency is the Kenya shilling (KES).
In the last decade, the real gross domestic product (GDP) growth has averaged over 5%.
As outlined in the draft Government Budget Policy Statement 2025, economic growth is estimated to be 4.6% in 2024 from a growth of 5.6% in 2023 reflecting deceleration of economic activities in the first three quarters of 2024 and the slowdown in private sector credit growth. The draft Government Budget Policy Statement 2025 expects growth to pick up to 5.3% in 2025 and retain the same momentum over the medium term largely driven by enhanced agricultural productivity, resilient services sector and ongoing implementation of priorities under Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA).
Kenya participates in several regional initiatives and is a member of the East African Community (EAC), Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), and the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), amongst others.
