## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 18 February 2025
## Inventory valuation
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value, with the exception of biological assets, whose value is prescribed by the Commissioner.
## Capital gains
## Dividend income
Kenya-source dividends paid to a Kenyan resident are taxable in Kenya at the rate of 5% unless the recipient is a Kenya resident company holding 12.5% or more of voting power of the company paying the dividend.
The WHT paid is a final tax. Dividends paid to non-residents and any overseas holding company attract 15% WHT.
## Interest income
Interest income is generally included in the determination of taxable income unless expressly exempted for income tax.
## Royalty income
Royalty income is generally included in the determination of taxable income and is subject to CIT at 30%. Where royalties paid to a Kenyan taxpayer attract Kenyan WHT, the WHT credit can be used to offset against the tax liability arising from the royalty income
## Foreign income
In Kenya, companies are taxed on income accrued or derived from Kenya. Certain income such as royalty, interest, and management and professional fees, paid to non-residents are deemed to have accrued or derived from Kenya.
