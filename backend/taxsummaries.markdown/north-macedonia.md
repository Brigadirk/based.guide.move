# North Macedonia


## Overview

Last reviewed - 18 February 2025

North Macedonia, a landlocked country located in Southeastern Europe, is bordered by Greece to the south, Bulgaria to the east, Kosovo and Serbia to the north, and Albania to the west. It gained its independence in 1991 and has a republican form of government. North Macedonia is divided into 80 municipalities, with Skopje as the capital. The official language in the country is Macedonian, and the currency is the Macedonian denar (MKD).

In the first few years after independence, the Macedonian economy suffered a plunge resulting in steep falls in gross domestic product (GDP) and the loss of a large and protected market. This led to a period of economic decline with high inflation, large fiscal deficits, and almost no foreign investment. At the end of 1994, the government initiated and successfully implemented a stabilisation program, with the assistance of international donors including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

According to the data of the State Statistical Office, the number of active business entities in the Republic of North Macedonia in 2018 was 72,315. The sectors with the highest number of business entities were wholesale and retail trade, as well as motor vehicle repair. The sectors with the least number of business entities represented were electricity, gas, steam, and air conditioning supply, as well as mining and quarrying.

North Macedonia looks toward European Union (EU) membership for continued economic growth. Macroeconomic stability has been maintained by a prudent monetary policy, which has kept the domestic currency at the pegged level against the euro, at the expense of raising interest rates.

PwC North Macedonia, which was founded in August 1992, is the auditor and consultant in numerous audit engagements, financial due diligence projects, and tax and legal services in the country. The firm has developed multi-disciplined teams to work with clients with extensive industry knowledge and experience in industrial products, technology, info-com and entertainment, energy, utilities and mining, and financial services.

PwC North Macedonia's tax practice provides a full range of services, including:

* International tax planning.
* Personal taxation and executive remuneration.
* Customs and trade consultancy.
* Estate planning and taxation.
* Pensions planning.
* Value-added tax (VAT).
* Intellectual property and technology transfer.
