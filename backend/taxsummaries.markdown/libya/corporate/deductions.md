## Corporate - Deductions

Last reviewed - 01 December 2024

Taxable income is determined after deducting all expenditure and costs incurred in the realisation of the gross income (*for more details on the deemed profit basis of assessment on branches of foreign companies, see the [Branch income](branch-income.html) section*).

For any entity (not a foreign branch) seeking to be assessed on an add-back basis, it should ensure, in accordance with Stamp Duty Law, that the majority of its costs can be supported by tax-registered documents (i.e. declared payrolls and registered contracts and invoices).

## Depreciation

Depreciation should be calculated in accordance with the Executive Regulations of the law.

| Assets | Depreciation rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Buildings: |  |
| Building in which machines are fixed | 4 |
| Building without fixed machines | 2 |
| Moveable buildings | 10 |
| Means of transport: |  |
| Passenger | 20 |
| Cargo and freight: |  |
| Less than 3 tons | 15 |
| Over 3 tons | 10 |
| Ships | 5 |
| Fishing boats | 5 |
| Aeroplanes | 8 |
| Furniture: |  |
| Office, ship, and domestic furniture | 15 |
| Hotel, restaurant, cafes, and hospital furniture | 20 |
| Work camps outside of cities | 20 |
| Food utensils and furnishings for restaurants, hotels, and the like | 25 |
| Machines: |  |
| Office machines | 15 |
| Electric generators | 20 |
| Computers and accessories | 25 |
| Software | 50 |
| Other machines | 15 |

## Goodwill

Purchased goodwill can be amortised on a straight-line basis over five years.

## Organisation and start-up expenditure

Organisational and start-up expenditure can be capitalised and amortised over five years on a straight-line basis.

## Interest expenses

No specific rules apply for the deduction of interest expenses.

## Bad debt

Bad debts are only recognised to the extent that they have been recognised as such legally.

## Charitable contributions

Donations to charities recognised by the state are permitted at up to 2% of net income.

## Fines and penalties

No specific rules apply for the deduction of fines and penalties.

## Taxes

No specific rules apply for the deduction of taxes.

## Net operating losses

Losses may be carried forward and deducted from future profits, for up to five years. The Income Tax Law has no provision for the carryback of losses.

## Payments to foreign affiliates

No specific rules apply for the deduction of payments to foreign affiliates.
