# Singapore


## Overview

Last reviewed - 30 May 2024

Singapore, an island country in Southeast Asia, is located off the southern edge of the Malay Peninsula, between Malaysia and Indonesia. Its official languages are English, Malay, Chinese, and Tamil, and the currency is the Singapore dollar (SGD).

Singapore is one of the world's most prosperous countries, with strong international trading links (its port is one of the world's busiest in terms of tonnage handled) and with a *per capita* gross domestic product (GDP) comparable to or exceeding that of many nations in Western Europe.

Singapore has a highly developed and successful free-market economy. The economy depends heavily on exports, particularly in information technology products and pharmaceuticals, as well as a vibrant financial services sector.

Over the longer term, the government aims to establish a new path that focuses on innovation and value creation. Singapore has attracted major investments in pharmaceuticals and medical technology production, and it will continue to establish itself as Southeast Asia's financial and technology hub.

In Singapore, PwC has more than 3,500 partners and staff to help resolve complex issues and identify opportunities for public, private, and government organisations to progress. As part of the PwC network with over 364,000 people in 151 countries, we are among the leading professional services networks in the world focusing on helping organisations and individuals create the value they are looking for.
