# Mauritania


## Overview

Last reviewed - 18 July 2024

Mauritania, located in Northwest Africa, is bordered by Western Sahara to the north and northwest, Algeria to the northeast, Mali to the east and southeast, Senegal to the southwest, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. Mauritania is divided into 15 regions, with Nouakchott as its capital. The official language of Mauritania is Arabic, and the currency is the Mauritania ouguiya (MRU).

PwC does not have a permanent office offering tax services in Mauritania. However, PwC Senegal has a dedicated team responsible for providing consulting services relating to Mauritania tax issues.

PwC has an extensive network of offices in most countries on the African continent. PwC Senegal offers a range of tax, audit, and consulting services. Our professionals support clients with local knowledge and skills and with access to a broad range of other professionals across the PwC global network of firms.
