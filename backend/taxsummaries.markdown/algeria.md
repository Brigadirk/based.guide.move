# Algeria


## Overview

Last reviewed - 31 May 2024

Algeria is a country in the Maghreb region of North Africa on the Mediterranean Sea. The capital is Algiers, the official language is Arabic (French is commonly used as well), and the currency is the Algerian dinar (DZD).

The head of state is the President of Algeria, who is elected for a five-year term. The President appoints the Prime Minister, who is also the head of government. The Algerian Parliament is bicameral, with a lower house (the People’s National Assembly) and an upper house (the Council of the Nation). Algeria is divided into 58 provinces (*wilayas*).

The economy is reliant on hydrocarbons. The Algerian national oil company is Sonatrach, which plays a key role in all aspects of the oil and natural gas sectors in Algeria. Algeria is a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank.

PwC Algeria offers different tax and legal services, such as tax registration services, tax audit services, assistance in tax litigations/controversy, international tax services, indirect tax services, corporate legal secretarial services, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) services, and transfer pricing services.
