# Netherlands


## Corporate - Withholding taxes

Last reviewed - 16 January 2025

## WHT on dividends

Dividends from Dutch resident corporations are generally subject to a 15% Dutch dividend WHT. In general, this does not apply to the Dutch cooperative (i.e. ‘co-op’) in a business-driven structure, a widely used vehicle for holding and financing activities, although anti-abuse rules are applicable. Additionally, dividends may be exempted under Dutch tax law, subject to anti-abuse rules, if:

* the recipient of the dividends distributed by the Dutch entity is a resident of the European Union, European Economic Area, or another state with which the Netherlands has concluded a tax treaty that includes a dividend article (provided that the company is not regarded as tax resident of another country based on a tax treaty between the state mentioned above and another country), and
* the recipient of the dividends would have been able to apply the Dutch participation exemption or the participation credit to the dividends if it would have been a resident of the Netherlands.

*For more detail on anti-abuse rules applicable to Dutch WHTs, please see Anti-abuse provisions in the [Tax](netherlands%3FtopicTypeId=c3980974-40d6-4ba4-8a3e-eba74cf5f5b9.html) [administration](netherlands%3FtopicTypeId=c3980974-40d6-4ba4-8a3e-eba74cf5f5b9.html) section*.

## Conditional WHT on interest, royalty, and dividend payments

The Netherlands applies a conditional withholding tax (WHT) on dividend, interest, and royalty payments (the Conditional Source Taxation Act). This tax is only levied on interest, royalty and dividend payments to affiliated companies in designated low-tax jurisdictions and in certain (tax abuse) situations. In principle, the tax is withheld from the company that makes the payment, but levied from the recipient. However, if the withholding tax has not been applied correctly, the tax inspector may also issue an additional tax assessment to the recipient of the payment or even the director of the paying company. The withholding tax applies to payments made to companies in designated low-tax jurisdictions (i.e. jurisdictions with a statutory CIT rate of less than 9 per cent) or are on the EU list for non-cooperative jurisdictions. A Dutch list of low-taxed and non-cooperative jurisdictions is updated annually on the 1st of October, and becomes applicable the following year. Currently Listed Countries (both Dutch and EU and applicable as of 2025) are American Samoa, Anguilla, Bahamas, Bahrein, Barbados, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Fiji, Guam, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey, Palau, Panama, Russia, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkmenistan, Turks and Caicos Islands, US Virgin Islands, Vanuatu.

The conditional WHT will only be levied on payments between affiliated companies. For purposes of the conditional WHT, companies are affiliated if there is a controlling relationship, whether or not directly held or through other affiliated entities. There may also be affiliation for conditional WHT purposes if there is a certain collaboration between one or more entities that jointly have a controlling interest. Apart from direct payments made to affiliated companies in Listed Countries, the WHT may also apply to abusive situations (situations where artificial structures are put in place with the main purpose or one of the main purposes to avoid the Dutch WHT).

The WHT tax is levied at a rate equal to the highest rate of Dutch CIT in the current tax year. For 2025, this rate is 25.8%. The WHT rate may, however, be reduced by a tax treaty. The table below sets out the rates of WHT applicable to the most common payments of dividends under Dutch domestic law where such a liability arises and the reduced rates that may be available under an applicable tax treaty. For interest and royalty payments, we included the levies under the relevant treaty, but keep in mind that the tax is conditional and may not be applicable in your specific situation.

## Multilateral instrument

The Multilateral Instrument (MLI) may have effect on Dutch tax treaties from 1 January 2020 onwards. The MLI allows countries to quickly and efficiently amend their tax treaties to combat tax avoidance, without the need for renegotiation and has a fundamental impact on how taxpayers access any tax treaty that both contracting states have opted to be covered by the MLI, subject to the options and reservations both have made in relation to a range of matters (including the date on which it will take effect for particular taxes).  

To prevent treaty abuse, countries can choose to apply the Limitations On Benefits (LOB) provision or the Principal Purpose Test (PPT). The Netherlands has opted to apply the PPT (art. 7 paragraph 1 of the MLI). This means that the benefits of a covered tax treaty will not be attributed for a component of income if obtaining that treaty benefit was one of the principal reasons for an arrangement or transaction that resulted in that benefit, unless it is established that granting that benefit is consistent with the object and purpose of the relevant treaty provision.

## Overview of WHT rates for domestic corporations

The table below provides an overview of the taxes that domestic corporations are required to withhold. The effect of the MLI has been included for the tax treaties of which [synthesised texts](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/publicaties/2021/06/01/synthesised-texts-belastingverdragen-waarvoor-het-mli-geldt) [have been published (](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/publicaties/2021/06/01/synthesised-texts-belastingverdragen-waarvoor-het-mli-geldt)Australia, Bosnia Herzegovina, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Georgia, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Kazakhstan, Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, New Zealand, Norway, Qatar, Serbia, Singapore, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom) In these texts, the concrete consequences of the MLI are presented in a legible manner in the continuous text of the treaty.

Notes

1. A 0% dividend WHT rate applies to payments to a resident corporation when its shareholding qualifies for the participation exemption and the shares form part of a company whose activities are carried on in the Netherlands. However, dividend WHT may be levied on certain profit participating loans. The 25.8% percent rate is levied if the conditional withholding tax is applicable.
2. The lowest rate applies if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership and/or with limited liability / a capital divided into shares) that directly holds at least 25% of the capital of the Dutch company paying the dividends. For the treaty with Morocco, there is also an anti-abuse rule applicable. For Serbia, the Slovak Republic, as well as Israel and France, an additional 365 day holding period applies (under the MLI).
3. The 5% rate is applicable if the foreign company directly owns 10% of the capital of the Dutch company. The 0% rate is applicable if the dividend originates from ordinary taxed profits and the dividend is tax exempt in the hands of the recipient.
4. Based upon the treaty concluded with former Yugoslavia; subject to the Principal Purpose Test (PPT) under the MLI.
5. In a press release dated 14 March 2024, the Dutch government announced it is (re)negotiating (revisions) of the tax treaties with Benin, Ecuador and Sweden. Furthermore, it declared that it would continue its negotiations with Aruba, Belgium, Brazil, Germany, Morocco, Mozambique, Uganda, Portugal, Romania and Suriname. Also, treaties with Colombia and Curacao are in the final stages of becoming effective.
6. Indicates that this country is a member state of the European Union. The EU Parent/Subsidiary Directive has been in effect since from 1 January 1992. According to the Directive, dividends paid by a Dutch company (BV or NV) to a qualifying parent company resident in another EU member state must be exempt from Dutch WHT, provided certain conditions are met. Among other things, the EU parent company must hold at least 10% of the Dutch dividend-paying company’s capital (or, in certain cases, voting rights) for a continuous period of at least one year. Please note that the Dutch tax legislation is more lenient with respect to the minimum holding; it only requires a holding of 5% at the moment of distribution. A provisional exemption from dividend WHT will apply from the start of the one-year holding period. The exemption will be cancelled retroactively if, following the dividend distribution, the one-year holding requirement is not actually met. The Dutch dividend-distributing company must provide to the Dutch tax authorities a satisfactory guarantee for the payment of dividend WHT that, but for the provisional exemption, would be due. The exemption is also applicable if the parent company is a resident of an EU member state and owns at least 10% of the (voting) shares in the Dutch company but only on the basis of reciprocity (Finland, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, Spain, and United Kingdom). Should the WHT exemption not be available under the EU Parent/Subsidiary Directive, the treaty rate(s) set out in the right-hand side of the same column (following ‘or’) will apply.
7. The lower rate applies if the foreign company (beneficial owner) directly or indirectly owns at least 25% of the capital of the Dutch company. For Chile, there is also a holding requirement of 365 days.

Depending on the tax percentage levied in the other state, the Dutch dividend WHT will be restituted accordingly.
