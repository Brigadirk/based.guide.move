# Barbados


## Overview

Last reviewed - 17 February 2025

Barbados, the eastern-most Caribbean island, gained full independence in 1966 and maintained ties to the British monarchy, represented in Barbados by the Governor General. On 30 November 2021, Barbados transitioned from a parliamentary constitutional monarchyto a parliamentary republic with a ceremonial indirectly elected president as head of state. The prime minister remains head of government. The island's capital city is Bridgetown, and the official language is English. The currency of Barbados is the Barbados dollar (BBD), which is pegged to the United States dollar (USD) at USD 1 = BBD 2.

Barbados has a largely free-enterprise, small open economy that was, until the 1970s, based primarily on sugar agriculture. Barbados now has four key productive industries: tourism, international financial services, agriculture, and manufacturing. Construction and real estate services have also increased significantly. The priority in economic growth is the generation of steady growth through foreign exchange earnings and employment generation, with special emphasis on tourism and international financial services.

PwC’s tax advisors in Barbados use their knowledge of taxation policies and legislation on behalf of our local, regional, and international clients, whether they are individuals, public companies, or private companies, including those licensed as international business companies. As part of PwC's worldwide network of tax experts, our advisors are also able to offer a truly international service, ensuring compliance on the part of local companies seeking to do business internationally and foreign investors wishing to establish operations in Barbados. The professionals in Barbados’ Tax Services division provide a wide array of services, including compliance (corporate and personal), tax accounting, tax planning, tax advocacy, tax registrations, exchange control applications, immigration services, and severance.
