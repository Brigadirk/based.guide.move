## Individual - Income determination

Last reviewed - 17 September 2024

## Employment income

Salary and wages and the value of any of the following payments or benefits received in connection with employment are treated as the employee’s taxable income:

* Loans granted to a physical person at an interest rate that is lower than the interest rate at the interbank credit auction. The difference between the amount that would be paid under the interbank credit auction rate and the amount to be paid at the provided lower rate is treated as taxable income.
* The assignment of goods (works, services) or gratuitous transfer thereof by an employer to an employee. Tax is levied on the difference between the value of these goods (works, services) based on their fair market value and the amount paid by the employee.
* The amount of reimbursed non-business expenses by the employer to an employee.
* Where an employee’s debt or obligation to the employer is written off, the amount of such debt or obligation.
* Insurance premiums paid by the employer.

## Dividend income

WHT is withheld from Azeri-source dividend income at 5%. Dividends received by physical persons and taxed at source in Azerbaijan are not subject to further taxation in Azerbaijan.

## Interest income

WHT is withheld from Azeri-source interest income at 10%. Interest received by physical persons and taxed at source in Azerbaijan is not subject to further taxation in Azerbaijan.
