# Romania


## Overview

Last reviewed - 25 April 2024

Romania is located at the crossroads of Central and Southeastern Europe, bordering the Black Sea between Bulgaria and Ukraine. The capital and largest city is Bucharest. The official language is Romanian, and the currency is the Romanian leu (RON).

Romania borders to the north with Ukraine, to the south with Bulgaria, to the east with Moldova, and to the west with Hungary and Serbia. It is the ninth country in area and seventh in terms of population among the member states of the European Union (EU).

According to the information published by the National Bank of Romania (NBR), non-residents' direct investment in Romania totalled 1.229 million euros (EUR) in the period January 2024 through February 2024 (compared with EUR 1.345 million in the period January 2023 through February 2023), of which equity participations (including estimated net reinvestment profit) totalled a net value of EUR 1.105 million and intra-group loans recorded a negative net value of EUR 124 million.

PwC has been present in the Romanian market since 1991 and has developed a broad range of professional services that we continue to expand. With our in-depth knowledge of Romania’s business environment, PwC provides its services to both international and Romanian enterprises. Overseen by 21 partners and employing over 800 specialists and support staff, PwC operates in Romania and Moldova from a network of six offices in Bucharest, Timisoara, Cluj-Napoca, and Chisinau.
