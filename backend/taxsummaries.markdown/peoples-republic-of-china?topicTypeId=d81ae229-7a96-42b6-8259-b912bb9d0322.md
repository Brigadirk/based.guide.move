## Corporate - Withholding taxes

Last reviewed - 03 January 2025

Non-TREs without establishments or places of business in China shall be subject to a WHT at 10% on gross income from dividends, interest, lease of property, royalties, and other China-source passive income unless reduced under a tax treaty.

If a non-TRE shareholder uses dividends distributed from a China TRE to make direct investment into China or acquire a China TRE from third parties, the non-TRE shareholder is eligible for WHT deferral treatment on the dividends, provided that certain conditions are met. The non-TRE shareholder shall report and settle the deferred tax if it later recoups the investment through equity transfer, equity buyback, liquidation of the China TRE, etc.

Dividends distributed by a foreign investment enterprise out of its pre-2008 profit to non-TRE shareholders are still exempted from WHT.

WHT rates under China’s tax treaties with other countries/nations are as follows (as of 31 December 2024):

| Recipient | WHT (%) | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
