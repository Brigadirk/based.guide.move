# Slovak Republic


## Individual - Other taxes

Last reviewed - 06 February 2025

## Social security contributions

Slovak and European Union (EU) nationals working in Slovakia, as well as other employees of Slovak companies, must contribute to the Slovak statutory social security and health insurance schemes, unless they have an exemption to this under EU rules (e.g. they contribute in their home state and have issued a form E101/PD A1) or under a social security treaty between Slovakia and the country in which they pay contributions.

As of 1 January 2018, employee’s social security contributions total 9.4% of remuneration; however, due to caps on the amounts on which these contributions are levied, the total contribution does not exceed EUR 1,478.62 per month in 2025.

The employee’s health insurance contributions total 4% of remuneration; however, as of 1 January 2017, caps on amounts on which these contributions are levied were abolished and the health insurance contributions are levied from the total remuneration of the employee.

Employer’s social security contributions total 24.4% of remuneration; however, due to caps on the amounts on which these contributions are levied, the total contribution does not exceed EUR 3,838.12per month in 2025, plus they pay injury insurance contributions of 0.8% of employees' total salary costs per month, which are not capped.

The employer’s health insurance contributions total 11% of remuneration; however, as of 1 January 2017, caps on amounts on which these contributions are levied were abolished and the health insurance contributions are levied from the total employee’s remuneration.

The regular monthly contributions to the health insurance system are treated as advance payments for the yearly liability and are subject to an annual reconciliation of health insurance contributions. Reconciliations are performed by a health insurance company.

Note that non-cash benefits and income from the sale of shares are subject to health insurance contributions. Dividend income received from profits arising from 2012 until 2016 is subject to health insurance contributions at a rate of 14%, up to 60-times the average monthly salary from two years prior (i.e. EUR 51,480). The recent amendment of the Income Tax Act (ITA) abolishes the 14% statutory health insurance contribution from dividends received from profits arising from 1 January 2017 or later years.
