# Hungary


## Individual - Other taxes

Last reviewed - 04 February 2025

## Social security contributions

The social security contribution base is the gross income paid to the employee. The employer's contribution rate (so-called 'social tax') is 13% in 2024. The employees' social security contribution rate is 18.5%. 15% of the unused amount of the child tax base allowance can be deducted from the total amount of 18.5% social security contribution obligation.

As of 1 January 2025, the amount of the minimum wage is 290,800 Hungarian forint [HUF] per month, and the guaranteed minimum wage for those employed in jobs requiring at least secondary level qualifications or vocational training is HUF 348,000. Employers (seated in Hungary) are liable for both social security payments and the electronic filing of monthly social security declarations. Non-Hungarian employers have similar obligations; however, if they fail to complete them, the employees will be responsible for these tasks.

As a general rule, dependent persons over 18 years of age are only eligible for healthcare services if they pay healthcare service contributions. Uninsured persons are liable for monthly contributions in the amount of HUF 11,800/month in 2025.

Interest income is subject to 13% social tax that is payable by the individual. The term interest income includes the capital gains of publicly traded bonds and investment fund units, furthermore the profit realised from insurance products.

Dividend income – with the exception of the dividend paid by companies the shares of which are traded on an EEA stock exchange – and certain other private income streams are also subject to 13% social tax. However, the base of this tax is capped at 24 times the minimum wage, and the cap is reduced by other income elements subject to social tax.

From 2025, income realised from long-term savings accounts are also subject to social tax. The tax rate is 13% if the savings account is terminated in the first three years after the conclusion of the contract and 8% in the next two years. No social tax needs to be paid after five years.

### Social tax allowances

Only one type of allowance can be applied on a given employee; however, it is the employer's decision which is the most beneficial based on the given circumstances.

With these allowances, the government intended to reduce the employment cost relating to the employees like jobseekers, jobseeker mothers with three or more young children, individuals with reduced ability to work, researchers, etc.

With employment of the above employees, the employer can apply social tax allowances. The eligibility periods of the allowances and their exact amounts depend on the employee.

### Social security contribution of foreign nationals

In order to determine whether a foreign national should become subject to Hungarian social security contributions, both the local and international rules should be carefully reviewed. One should count with Hungarian social charges typically when the foreign nationals:

* are employed locally by a Hungarian employer in the territory of Hungary
* work in Hungary as employees of a non-Hungarian employer and are nationals of a European Union (EU) member state or of a country that has a social security treaty with Hungary but cannot remain covered by the social security system of their home country, or
* are third-country nationals assigned to Hungary from a non-EEA country and the length of their assignment exceeds two years.

## Consumption taxes

### Value-added tax (VAT)

VAT is payable on sales of goods and the supply of services at the general rate of 27%. Reduced rates of 18% and 5% are applicable for some goods and services (*see the [Other taxes](hungary%3FtopicTypeId=399bcbae-2967-429b-b371-99be91a47b34.html) section in the Corporate tax summary for more information*).

## Net wealth/worth taxes

There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Hungary.

## Inheritance, estate transfer, and gift taxes

The general inheritance and gift tax rate is 18%, and a preferential 9% tax rate applies to residential property. The transfer of property without consideration between lineal relatives (including the spouse of the deceased) is tax exempt. There is a preferential tax rate for residential property in case of estate transfer tax as well. The estate transfer tax rate is 4% or 2%, depending on the value of real estate. In case the value of real estate is maximum HUF 1 billion, then the tax rate is 4%. In relation to the portion of the value that exceeds HUF 1 billion, the applicable rate is 2%. Nevertheless, the amount of the estate transfer tax cannot exceed HUF 200 million per property.

## Property and land taxes

Hungarian municipalities have the right to levy property tax and land tax at their own discretion until the relevant caps are reached (*see the [Other taxes](hungary%3FtopicTypeId=399bcbae-2967-429b-b371-99be91a47b34.html) section in the Corporate tax summary for more information*).

## Company car tax

The measure of the company car tax depends on the power in KW and the environmental classification of the company car.

Company car tax may also be payable if company car costs are borne by a Hungarian company or if individuals use their own cars for business purposes and are reimbursed for the costs.

The use of company cars for private purposes does not incur an additional PIT liability.

On 1 July 2022, the monthly rates of the company car tax increased by 81% to 87%. For example, a car with a Euro 5 engine and 150 hp of power is subject to HUF 20,000 car tax per month.
