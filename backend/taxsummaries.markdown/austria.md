# Austria


## Overview

Last reviewed - 20 January 2025

Austria, a landlocked country of approximately nine million inhabitants in Central Europe, is bordered by the Czech Republic and Germany to the north, Slovakia and Hungary to the east, Slovenia and Italy to the south, and Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the west. Austria is divided into nine federal states, with Vienna as the capital. The official language of Austria is German, and the currency is the euro (EUR).

Austria's economy features a large service sector, a sound industrial sector, and a small, but highly developed, agricultural sector. The Austrian economy has greatly benefited from its strong commercial relations to the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) region, specifically in the banking and insurance sectors.

PwC has five regional offices in Austria (Vienna, Graz, Klagenfurt, Linz, and Salzburg) allowing proximity to our clients. With over 1,450 employees, the Austrian practice provides services in the areas of assurance, tax, and advisory. Further, PwC Legal is a full-service business law firm and covers all major areas of commercial law.

To provide our clients with a wider service offering, PwC Austria, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Turkey have formed an alliance. Through this partnership, PwC Austria is able to increase its number of services and adjust to customers' needs on a variety of issues, whether they are a purely Austrian private or public operation or an international conglomerate.
