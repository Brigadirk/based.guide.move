# Poland


## Corporate - Withholding taxes

Last reviewed - 22 July 2024

## Domestic provisions: General rules

The general domestic WHT rate for dividends is 19%. For the purpose of applying Polish WHT rules, the term ’dividends‘ should be understood as encompassing certain other revenues (incomes) from participation in profits of legal persons having their seat or management office within the territory of the Republic of Poland, including, among others, the income from liquidation of a company and the income from the redemption of shares (with the exception of gain from voluntary redemption, which is treated as a capital gain subject to the 19% CIT rate in Poland if the gain is realised by a taxpayer from a non-treaty country or the treaty includes a so-called 'real estate clause'). The WHT rate on the dividend might be reduced based on the applicable DTT provision or specific participation exemption rules.

The general domestic WHT rate on interest and royalties paid to non-residents is 20% (10% regarding services of sea or air transportation). These WHT rates may also be reduced by DTTs.

There is also a 20% WHT on payments made to non-residents for intangible services listed in the CIT Act (such as consulting or management services). However, if a payment is made to a country that has a DTT with Poland, then, as a rule, this payment may be exempt from WHT (under a business profits clause) provided certain administrative formalities and WHT due diligence are completed (see below). However, a few DTTs treat payments for technical services as royalties (e.g. India or Malta).

The 'beneficial owner' clause determines that in order to apply the exemption from WHT based on the Polish provisions implementing the Interest-Royalties Directive, the entities receiving royalties and interest must constitute their beneficial owners (i.e. they should be in possession of the right to use and enjoy the payment received, and this right cannot be constrained by a contractual or a legal obligation to pass the payment; in addition to the above, they should conduct actual business activity in the country of their registered office if the receivables are obtained in connection with the conducted business activity). The beneficial ownership requirement has also become one of the conditions to apply reduced tax rates or exemptions on interest and royalties by Polish remitters under applicable DTTs, despite the fact that not all Polish DTTs directly include such a clause. A similar approach has been presented by the tax authorities in Poland towards dividend payments. The verdicts issued by administrative courts mostly reject the view that a Polish company, as a payer of CIT on the dividend, is required to check whether the recipient of the dividend is its beneficial owner. Nevertheless, the opposite approach is presented as well.

As of 1 January 2019, a mechanism of settlement of WHT in relation to payments exceeding PLN 2 million *per annum* for each taxpayer has been introduced (the so-called 'pay and refund' mechanism). The application of this mechanism was suspended until the end of 2021. The package of changes introduced to the Polish tax law regulations starting from January 2022 (the so-called 'Polish Deal') has limited the original scope of the application of this mechanism. Under the rules applicable from January 2022, the conditional exemption from WHT or application of the reduced tax rate stipulated in the applicable DTT or local specific rules is restricted in terms of the passive payments (i.e. dividends, interest, license fees) in the amount exceeding PLN 2 million *per annum* made to each related entity. In such cases, the tax remitter is required to automatically collect the tax at the statutory domestic rate (19% or 20%), regardless of the fulfilment of the conditions allowing for the application of the exemption or the reduced rate on the basis of the local law or DTT.

Moreover, the tax remitter is required to collect the tax with regard to other payments if the total amount of payments in one tax year to one taxpayer exceeds 2 million PLN when transactions are not classified as passive payments without justified economic reasons (e.g. a payment is artificially classified as a service).

In compliance with the pay and refund mechanism, the taxpayer/remitter has the right to claim for a WHT refund.

The following payments subject to WHT do not fall within the scope of the pay and refund mechanism:

* Intangible services (unless classified as passive payments without justified economic reasons).
* Interest or royalties paid to unrelated parties.
* Passive payments to the benefit of related entities not exceeding PLN 2 million per annum for each taxpayer (though the tax remitter should demonstrate due diligence).

* Dividends paid between Polish residents (regardless of their amount).

Regardless of the payment amount, the payer is required to undertake due diligence during the verification of the payment recipient in order to apply the preferential WHT rules (the level of verification shall be stronger for related entities).

The pay and refund mechanism allows the remitters not to withhold tax in relation to payments exceeding PLN 2 million *per annum* if the remitter submits a statement to the tax authorities confirming that:

* it possesses all documents necessary for applying reduced WHT rate or exemption from WHT, and
* it is not aware of any circumstances that speak against granting tax exemption.

The further amendment to the rules on submitting the remitter's declaration made it more flexible by extending the time scope. The submission of a declaration allows this mechanism not to apply until the end of the remitter's tax year, including the declarations submitted in 2022. Changes also included the exemption from the application of certain obligations of payers with respect to withholding taxation of interest and discount on certain securities.

In case of tax authorities challenging the amount of withheld tax in the course of the tax audit, the remitter may be held accountable for uncollected tax as to the completeness of the documents and correctness of the facts considered. In addition to the uncollected WHT, a penalty of 10% to 30% of the tax base may be imposed if the tax authorities question the due diligence or the certification process. Fines under the Fiscal-Penal Code may be imposed on the persons responsible for tax matters in a remitter’s organisation in case of misstatement.

Alternatively, the taxpayer or the remitter can apply to the tax authorities for a ruling (binding opinion) on the application of WHT reduced rates / exemptions. The opinion is valid for three years.

## Special treatment: EU Directives

The CIT law provisions implementing EU Directives provide a special treatment for dividends, interest, and royalties paid to residents of EU or EEA member countries.

In general, the WHT exemption rules on interest and royalty payments paid by Polish corporate residents only apply to associated EU or EEA companies (parent-subsidiary relationships or sister-sister relationships) in which capital involvements are significant, i.e. the paying company owns (or is owned in a share of) at least 25% by the receiving company or the paying company and the receiving company are owned at least in the share of 25% by the same parent company. Shareholding should be kept for a minimum of two consecutive years.

Dividends paid to corporate residents of EU and EEA countries (or Switzerland) are exempt from WHT, subject to certain conditions specified in the CIT law. The basic requirement is that the foreign recipient directly holds at least 10% (or 25% in case of Switzerland) of the shares in the Polish company for a minimum of two consecutive years.

The condition regarding holding shares is also fulfilled if two years passes after the day of the dividend/interest/royalty payment. If the period is interrupted afterwards, the company is obligated to pay the tax at the standard rate with interest.

Note that several additional conditions have to be met in order to apply the exemption implemented upon the Directives (e.g. the company receiving the dividend/interest/royalty cannot be exempt from tax on all its income, regardless of its source; the recipient has to have ownership title to the shares in the Polish company; the recipient has to obtain a written statement confirming fulfilment of exemption conditions).

Additionally, the CIT law states that to enjoy the exemption from WHT based on the Directives’ provisions, the relevant DTT or other agreement concluded by Poland should allow for the exchange of tax information between the tax authorities of Poland and the country of the payment recipient. Given the fact that Poland did not conclude a DTT with Liechtenstein, payments made to tax residents of Liechtenstein should not benefit from the exemption.

It should be noted that the Polish WHT due diligence and pay and refund rules also apply to payments exempt under provisions implementing the EU Directive.

## Treaty rates

If EU special rules do not apply, the domestic WHT rates can be decreased by a DTT concluded between Poland and the payment recipient’s country of residence if certain administrative conditions are met (i.e. the payer obtains a valid certificate of a fiscal residence of the payment recipient/beneficial owner).

The following table lists the WHT rates as provided in the treaties concluded by Poland. Notably, the following table shows only rates that result from general treaty provisions; the treaties themselves occasionally include special provisions (applicable in special circumstances or to special entities) that provide lower WHT rates than the ones listed.

Furthermore, if a treaty rate is higher than a domestic one, the latter should apply.
