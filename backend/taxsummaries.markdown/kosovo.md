# Kosovo


## Overview

Last reviewed - 22 January 2025

Kosovo is a landlocked country in the central Balkan Peninsula. With its strategic position, it serves as an important link in the connection between central and south Europe, the Adriatic Sea, and the Black Sea. Its capital and largest city is Pristina, and other major urban areas include Prizren, Peja, and Gjakova. Kosovo borders Albania to the southwest, the Republic of Macedonia to the southeast, Montenegro to the west, and Serbia to the north and east.

Kosovo covers an area of 10,890 square kilometres and has a population of 1,873,000 with a density of 172 per square kilometre.

The official languages in Kosovo are Albanian and Serbian. Turkish, Bosnian, and Roma languages have the status of official languages at the municipal level. The official currency is the euro (EUR).

Kosovo is a multi-party parliamentary representative democratic republic, with legislative, executive, and judicial institutions.

Kosovo’s economy has been recovering at a steady pace post-pandemic. In 2020, the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate decreased by 5.2%. Based on estimated figures, the GDP growth rate in 2022 is projected to increase by 3.9%, which is then expected to trend around 4.2% in 2023.

Kosovo is a member of several international organisations, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, while its membership to the European Union (EU) and United Nations (UN) is still under way. Kosovo has a liberal trade regime as part of Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) that allows producers in Kosovo to export duty-free to CEFTA members. The EU Autonomous Trade Preference regime also enables duty-free exports for the majority of Kosovo goods to the EU market. The April 2016 implementation of the Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with the European Union reinforced trade liberalisation and removed many of the remaining trade and tariff barriers for the European Union.

In Kosovo, PwC provides a full range of assurance, tax, and advisory services. PwC has the knowledge and understanding of the local and global business climate to help clients reach their goals. At PwC Kosovo, each line of service is equipped with highly qualified, experienced professionals whose goal is to build trust in society and solve important problems.

Tax services include corporate compliance services in accounting, corporate, indirect, and employment tax compliance, as well as tax advisory on domestic and international taxation, transfer pricing, tax dispute resolution, and tax disclosures.
