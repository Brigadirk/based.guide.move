## Corporate - Withholding taxes

Last reviewed - 30 December 2024

Non-resident enterprises earning income from Georgian sources, other than through a PE, are subject to WHT at the following rates:

| Income | WHT (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Dividends | 5 |
| Interest | 5 |
| Royalties | 5 |
| Oil and gas subcontractor income | 4 |
| International transportation/communication | 10 |
| Income from services rendered in Georgia | 10 |
| Other Georgian-source income | 10 |
| Insurance and re-insurance | 0 |

Payments of interest, royalties, or other Georgian-source income to non-residents registered in so called ’black listed’ countries are subject to WHT at a 15% rate.

The list of such countries is determined by the MoF of Georgia.

## Double tax treaties (DTTs)

For those countries with which Georgia has entered into DTTs, the WHT rates are the following:

Notes

1. Some agreements provide a 0% rate on the interest paid by the government or any of its units or on the interest guaranteed by them or dividends paid to the government; this table doesn’t consider such provisions.
2. The 0% rate applies if the foreign company owns at least 50% of the Georgian company and has invested more than 2 million euros (EUR)/US dollars (USD).
3. Royalty rate paid for the enterprise is 5%.
4. The 0% rate refers to the copyright of any literature, art, or scientific works (except software), and films and records; the 5% rate refers to lease of techniques.
5. N/A
6. The 0% rate applies if the foreign company owns at least 50% of the Georgian company and has invested more than EUR 3 million.
7. The 0% rate applies if the foreign company owns at least 50% of the Georgian company and has invested more than 2 million pound sterling (GBP).
8. The 0% rate applies if the foreign company owns at least 25% of the Georgian company in any continuous 12-month period prior to distribution of dividends.
9. The 0% rate applies if the foreign company controls at least 50% of the voting power in the Georgian company and has invested more than EUR 2 million.
10. N/A
11. The 0% rate applies if the foreign company has invested in the Georgian company more than 3 million United States dollars (USD).
12. The 0% rate applies if the foreign company owns at least 10% of the Georgian company.
13. The 0% rate applies if the foreign company owns at least 10% of the capital or the voting power of the Georgian company.
14. Domestic WHT rates are applicable when a treaty provides a relief with more unfavourable rates.
15. Domestic WHT rate on dividends is 5%. A treaty provides a relief with the same or more unfavourable rate, thus the domestic rate is applicable.
16. Effective date for the treaties with Poland and Kyrgyzstan is 1 January 2024.
17. The 0% rate applies if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) that is a resident of the other state and directly holds at least 50% of the capital of the company paying the dividends.
