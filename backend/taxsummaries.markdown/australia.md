# Australia


## Overview

Last reviewed - 16 December 2024

Australia is a country in the Southern Hemisphere comprising the mainland of the Australian continent as well as the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Australia is divided into six states and two territories, with Canberra as its capital. The official language of Australia is English, and the currency is the Australian dollar (AUD).

Six British colonies, which were created in the late 18th and 19th centuries, were federated and became the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901. In recent decades, Australia has transformed itself into an internationally competitive, advanced market economy. It boasted one of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD's) fastest growing economies during the 1990s, a performance due in large part to economic reforms adopted in the 1980s. Australia's abundant and diverse natural resources attract high levels of foreign investment and include extensive reserves of coal, iron ore, copper, gold, natural gas, uranium, and renewable energy sources. Australia also has a large services sector and is a significant exporter of natural resources, energy, and food.

PwC Australia's industry teams combine skills and experience in assurance, business advisory, and taxation to offer clients competitive solutions. The industries include agri-business, asset management, banking and capital markets, constructions and transportation, energy and resources, entertainment and media, government, healthcare, industrial products, infrastructure, insurance, retail and consumer, and technology and digital.

PwC Australia's Tax and Private practice has over 1,000 professionals. Our clients include public and private Australian companies and organisations, entrepreneurs, family businesses, trusts, partnerships, private individuals, and international businesses. Combining the skills of financial and tax specialists with those of economists, lawyers, and other in-house specialists, PwC Australia's tax specialists solve tax problems from the ideas stage through to implementation of systems and processes, providing proactive business solutions to clients' complex business needs.
