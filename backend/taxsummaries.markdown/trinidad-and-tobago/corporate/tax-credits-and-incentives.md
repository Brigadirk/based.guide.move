## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives

Last reviewed - 31 January 2025

## Foreign tax credit

Double taxation is avoided or mitigated by means of foreign tax credits.

## Tax holidays

### Fiscal Incentives Act, 1979

An approved enterprise, which must be a locally incorporated resident corporation, may be granted an exemption from corporation tax for a period of up to ten years, depending on the category under which it is approved. Exemption may be total or partial. Subject to approval, profits may be distributed tax free to shareholders, except in the case of certain non-resident shareholders, where the relief is restricted to the amount of tax that exceeds their liability in their country of residence. Net losses during the tax holiday period (i.e. the excess of total losses over total profits) may be carried forward for set-off without limitation for five years from the end of the tax holiday period, after which the normal set-off provisions for losses apply. As of 1 January 2007, the tax holiday in respect of corporation tax is no longer granted.

### Approved tourism projects

Under the Tourism Development Act 2000, approved tourism development projects, including hotels, are granted a tax holiday for periods of up to seven years. In addition, a carryover from a tax exemption period is permitted of any loss arising out of the operation or renting of an approved tourism project to be written off against profits in accordance with normal income tax loss provisions, subsequent to the tax holiday period. An approved tourism project means a project declared to be so by the government.

Benefits under designated Special Economic Zones include zero rating for VAT purposes of goods supplied to the Zone and custom duties exemption on importation of all approved capital goods, spare parts, raw materials, stock in trade, and other articles used in the Zone.
