# Singapore


## Corporate - Tax administration

Last reviewed - 30 May 2024

## Taxable period

The tax basis period is the calendar year; however, the accounting period will generally be adopted.

## Tax returns

Tax is computed for each tax year based on the income earned in the preceding year (the tax basis period). The corporation files an estimate of its income within three months of the end of the accounting period followed by a return of income by 30 November of the tax year, and the tax is assessed by the Comptroller of Income Tax. All companies are required to file their tax returns electronically. There is no fixed date for the issue of assessments.

## Payment of tax

Assessed tax is payable within one month after the service of the notice of assessment, whether or not a notice of objection to the assessment has been lodged with the tax authorities. Application may be made to the Comptroller to pay estimated tax liabilities on a monthly basis. However, the Comptroller is under no obligation to grant such an application.

Late payment of tax will attract penalties, up to a maximum of 17% of the outstanding tax.

## Tax audit process

The IRAS adopts a risk-based approach to identifying compliance risk, with a focus on improving the behaviour of taxpayers who pose a higher risk of non-compliance. It also prioritises and tailors specific compliance programmes that aim to identify taxpayers who have made mistakes in their tax returns, create an audit presence in the community to deter non-compliance by other taxpayers, educate taxpayers on their tax obligations and how to comply with these, and identify areas of tax law, policies, and processes where the tax system can be simplified.

## Statute of limitations

The statute of limitations is four years from the year of assessment, but does not apply where there has been fraud or wilful default by the taxpayer.

## Topics of focus for tax authorities

The IRAS is focusing its compliance efforts on the following:

* WHT.
* The timely filing of corporate tax returns.
* Claiming of private or non-deductible expenses.
* The classification of income and expenses for income taxable at concessionary and prevailing corporate tax rates.
* The recognition of income from construction contracts and provisions claimed by construction companies.
* Companies that are dormant and exempted from filing corporate income tax returns.
* Taxability of income/gains from sale of properties.
* Digital economy.
* Deductibility of interest expenses and borrowing costs.

The IRAS is currently focusing its GST audit and investigation efforts on businesses involved in Missing Trader Fraud arrangements.
