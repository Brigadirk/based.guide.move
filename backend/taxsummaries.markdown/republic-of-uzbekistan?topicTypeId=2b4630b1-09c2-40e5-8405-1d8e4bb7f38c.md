# Uzbekistan, Republic of


## Individual - Other taxes

Last reviewed - 09 February 2025

## Social Tax (ST)

ST is charged on gross payroll of local and foreign employees and payable by the employers.

The rates of ST are provided below:          

| Taxpayers | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Budget organisations | 25.0 |
| Association of 'SOS Children’s Villages of Uzbekistan' | 7.0 |
| Taxpayers using the labour of persons with disabilities working in specialised workshops, sections, and enterprises | 4.7 |
| Other taxpayers | 12.0 |

## Consumption taxes

The standard value-added tax (VAT) rate is 12%. This tax is applicable to the sales value of products, works, and services. Exports of goods are taxed at 0%. There is a list of goods, works, and services exempt from VAT (e.g. certain education, transportation, medical, financial, insurance services, import by individuals within norms).

## Net wealth/worth taxes

There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Uzbekistan.

## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes

There are no inheritance, estate, and gift taxes in Uzbekistan. However, PIT may be payable by individuals receiving property by way of gifts, depending on the type of the property and its source.

## Property taxes

### Property tax

Property tax is imposed on property located in Uzbekistan and owned by Uzbek legal entities or non-resident individuals. The tax applies to buildings, unfinished constructions, railways, trunk pipelines, and residential real estates on the territory of Uzbekistan.

Tax is levied at the rate of 0.31% to 1.5% of the value of the property, depending on type of property. For objects of construction not completed within the regulatory period, the applicable tax rate is set at 3%.

Non-residents are required to calculate and accrue property tax independently.

### Land tax

Individuals owning, renting, or using land in Uzbekistan are subject to land tax. Rates of tax vary depending on the location and the quality of the land. Land tax should be paid twice a year in equal shares by April 15 and October 15.

### Contributions to Road Fund

For acquisition of cars, contributions to the Road Fund are established as follows:

* At 3% of the acquisition price for new cars.
* From 5% to 16% of BCU per each horsepower, depending on service life, for used cars and vehicles.
* From 1 January 2022, the fee for purchase and/or temporary import of vehicles into the territory of the Republic of Uzbekistan is abolished. Prior to that, fees varied as follows:
  + For passenger vehicles: From 6% to 11% of BCU per each horsepower, depending on the service life.
  + For motorcycles (including mopeds) and bicycles: From 5% to 10% of BCU.
  + For other cars: From 9% to 16 % of BCU.

## Luxury and excise taxes

Due to the expiration of the Protocol on the Application of the Agreement on the Free Trade Area of the CIS Member States with Uzbekistan (dated 31 May 2013), Uzbekistan has cancelled excise taxes for all product lines from 1 January 2021.

The Tax Code provides excise tax rates for locally produced excise-liable goods as well as goods imported in the Republic of Uzbekistan, including tobacco and alcohol.
