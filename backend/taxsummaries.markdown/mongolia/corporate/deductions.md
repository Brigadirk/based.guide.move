## Corporate - Deductions

Last reviewed - 06 January 2025

Expenses mostly associated with income-generating activities are deductible for CIT purposes (provided they meet deductible expenses requirements), and the requirements and limitations on the deductible expenses are provided in the legislation.

## Accrued expenses

Accrued expenses are deductible only if they are supported by valid documentation and relevant WHTs are imposed and paid.

## Contingent liabilities

Contingent liabilities are not deductible.

## Depreciation and amortisation

Depreciation of fixed assets and amortisation of intangibles are deductible within the limits provided in tax legislation. A straight-line method is used, and the years of usage are determined for tax purposes.

| Non-current asset class | | Useful life (in years) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Building and construction / Land improvements | 40/25 |
| 2 | Machinery and equipment | 10 |
| 3 | Computer, computer parts, and software | 2 |
| 4 | Intangible asset with defined useful life (includes licence for mineral exploration and extraction) | Period in force |
| 5 | Other non-current asset | 10 |

A taxpayer not holding minerals, radioactive minerals, oil exploration, and mining licences can depreciate its newly built property in Baganuur, Bagakhangai, and Nalaikh districts of the capital city and other aimags and soums from 1 January 2023 for 15 years on a straight-line basis by its own choice.

## Goodwill

There is no specific provision in the tax law regarding the deductibility of goodwill.

## Organisational and start-up expenses

Organisational and start-up expenses are deductible if they meet the requirements for deductible expenses.

## Interest expenses

Interest expenses are deductible. However, there are limits with respect to the deductibility of interest expense. *See Thin capitalisation in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section for more information*.

## Bad debt

Bad debt provisions are not deductible. There is no clear guidance in the tax legislation as to whether bad debt is deductible or not; however, in practice, the tax authorities disallow deductibility of bad debt.

## Charitable contributions

Charitable contributions are not deductible, except for donations to the fund of vocational training, donations to reduce air pollution, and donations up to MNT 10 million to support the activity of a sport club, association, or NGO established by a disabled Mongolian citizen.

**As per the amendment made in August 2024, and applicable until 1 January 2035:**

In connection with the CIT credit (*see the [Tax credits and incentives](tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section*), the following expenses shall not be deductible from taxable income:

* Financial support provided to vocational education and training institutions for the purpose of training specialists on order.
* Donations up to MNT 10 million provided to non-governmental organisations established by persons with disabilities in Mongolia.
* Donations up to MNT 100 million provided to support the activities of sports associations and clubs, organise Olympic and continental competitions, and construct and operate sports facilities in compliance with international sports association standards.
* Donations and investments provided to the fund supporting vocational education and training.
* Donations provided to reduce air pollution.
* Donations provided to support cultural creative industries and protect cultural heritage, not exceeding 5% of taxable income.
* Operational expenses for social welfare and care services performed under agreements with social welfare organisations.

## Pension expenses

Compulsory pension insurance premiums paid to the Social Security Authority of Mongolia are deductible. Additional voluntary insurance premiums are deductible but shall not exceed 15% of taxable income.

## Payment for directors

If a payment for directors is a salary payment on which social insurance and PIT is levied, it is considered as deductible.

## Bribes, kickbacks, and illegal payments

Bribes, kickbacks, and illegal payments are not deductible. Per anti-corruption law, monetary amounts involved with respect to such payments will be confiscated and criminal proceedings will be instituted.

## Fines and penalties

Fines and penalties are not deductible for tax purposes.

## Taxes

Certain taxes paid by a taxpayer, as well as social contributions of employers, are generally deductible for tax purposes.

## Tax losses

Tax losses generally may be carried forward for up to four years. However, the annual amount of carried forward losses deductible from taxable income may not exceed 50% of the taxable income in the tax year.

There is no provision for the carryback of losses.

## Payments to foreign affiliates

As a general rule, deductible expenses shall be supported by proper documentation. Deductibility of payments to foreign affiliates depends on the nature of the payment, as follows:

* Interest payments are deductible but with restrictions (i.e. thin capitalisation rule may apply, interest paid on loans for construction of buildings and installation of equipment needs to be capitalised during that period).
* Dividend payments are not deductible.
* Technical assistance service payments are deductible if applicable taxes were levied.
* Payments for other services are deductible if applicable taxes were levied.
