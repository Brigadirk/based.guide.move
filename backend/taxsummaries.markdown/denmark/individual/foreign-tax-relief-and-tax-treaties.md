## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties

Last reviewed - 03 February 2025

## Foreign tax relief

An individual resident in Denmark is entitled to deduct foreign income taxes paid or accrued on foreign-source income from the Danish tax payable up to a maximum of Danish tax paid on that part of the taxable income that is foreign-source income. Relief according to DTTs may be claimed if their provisions are more favourable.

Unutilised credits are not refundable and cannot be carried back or forward.

## Tax treaties

### Double taxation treaties (DTTs)

To avoid double taxation on income, Denmark has concluded DTTs with a large number of countries. All tax treaties contain rules on tax information exchanges, and specific EU regulations also apply.  
  
Double taxation may also occur in relation to inheritance tax. To counteract this situation, Denmark has concluded treaties with the other Scandinavian countries, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and the United States in this respect.  
  
Countries with which Denmark currently has DTTs and where the treaty contains a remuneration clause are:

| Argentina | Faroe Islands | Latvia | Sweden |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Algeria | Finland | Lithuania | Switzerland |
| Armenia | France | Luxembourg | Taiwan |
| Australia | Germany | Macedonia | Tanzania |
| Austria | Georgia | Malaysia | Thailand |
| Azerbaijan | Ghana | Malta | The Netherlands |
| Bangladesh | Greece | Mexico | Trinidad and Tobago |
| Belarus | Greenland | Montenegro | Tunisia |
| Belgium | Guernsey | Morocco | Turkey |
| Bermuda | Hungary | New Zealand | Uganda |
| Brazil | Iceland | Norway | Ukraine |
| British Virgin Islands | India | Pakistan | United Kingdom |
| Bulgaria | Indonesia | Philippines | United States |
| Canada | Ireland, Republic of | Poland | Venezuela |
| Cayman Islands | Isle of Man | Portugal | Vietnam |
| Chile | Israel | Romania | Yugoslavia |
| China, People's Republic of | Italy | Russia | Zambia |
| Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) | Jamaica | Serbia |  |
| Croatia | Japan | Singapore |  |
| Cyprus | Jersey | Slovak Republic |  |
| Czech Republic | Kenya | Slovenia |  |
| Egypt | Korea, Republic of | South Africa |  |
