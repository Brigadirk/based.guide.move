# Cyprus


## Corporate - Withholding taxes

Last reviewed - 17 December 2024

Aside from certain cases where payments are made to companies in jurisdictions that are included on the EU blacklist, Cyprus does not levy a WHT on dividends, interests, and royalties paid to non-residents of Cyprus. Royalties on rights used within Cyprus are subject to WHT of 10% (5% in the case of cinematograph films). Such Cyprus WHT on royalties for rights used within Cyprus may be reduced or eliminated by DTTs entered into by Cyprus or by the EU Interest and Royalty Directive as transposed into the Cyprus tax legislation.

As of 31 December 2022, Cyprus applies WHT on certain payments to companies in jurisdictions included on the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions on tax matters (commonly referred to as the EU ‘blacklist’) as follows:

* WHT of 17% applies on payments of dividends by non-quoted companies.
* WHT of 17% applies on payments of interest (excluding payments by individuals).
* WHT of 10% applies on payments of royalties and similar type payments (excluding payments by individuals).

## WHT on other types of income

Cyprus levies a 10% WHT on the remuneration of non-Cyprus tax residents for technical services derived from sources in Cyprus, subject to certain conditions. No such WHT is levied if such services are performed via a PE in Cyprus or between ‘associated’ companies as defined by the EU Interest and Royalty Directive as enacted into the Cyprus tax legislation.

Cyprus also levies a 10% WHT on the gross income/receipts derived from the exercise in Cyprus by a non-resident individual of any profession or vocation and the remuneration of non-resident public entertainers (e.g. theatrical, musical, football clubs, other athletic missions).

Further, a 5% WHT is levied on gross income derived from within Cyprus by non-residents with no local PE for services in regards to the exploration, extraction, or exploitation of the continental shelf, as well as the establishment and use of pipelines and other installations on the ground, on the seabed, and on the surface of the sea.

## WHT on dividend, interest, and royalties table

In the table below, we illustrate the applicable Cyprus WHT rates outbound for dividend, interest, and royalty payments.
