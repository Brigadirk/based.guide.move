# Saudi Arabia


## Overview

Last reviewed - 21 July 2024

Saudi Arabia, located in the Middle East between the Arabian Gulf and the Red Sea, is the birthplace of Islam and home to Islam's two holiest shrines, in Makkah and Madinah. The modern Saudi state was founded in 1932 after a 30-year campaign to unify most of the Arabian Peninsula. Saudi Arabia is divided into 13 provinces, with Riyadh as the capital. The official language of Saudi Arabia is Arabic, and the currency is the Saudi riyal (SAR).

The country is a leading producer of oil and natural gas. The government continues to pursue economic reform and diversification, particularly since Saudi Arabia's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in December 2005, and promote foreign investment. A burgeoning population, aquifer depletion, and an economy largely dependent on petroleum output and prices are all ongoing governmental concerns.

Saudi Arabia possesses about 20% of the world's proven petroleum reserves, ranks as the largest exporter of petroleum, and plays a leading role in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).

In April 2016, Saudi Arabia introduced the Vision 2030 plan to reduce its dependence on oil, diversify the economy, and develop service sectors, such as health, education, infrastructure construction, recreation and tourism, and many more. The sweeping reforms outlined in the Vision 2030 and National Transformation Plan affect vast areas of the government, the economy, and citizens. Tax policy will play a significant role in these reforms as part of the government’s efforts to diversify revenues away from oil and address broader social and economic objectives while maintaining a fertile business environment and continuing to attract foreign direct investment (FDI).

One of the key targets of Vision 2030 is to increase FDI to 5.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030, from 3.8%. There is a large pool of research demonstrating the positive impact that double taxation treaties (DTTs) can have on FDI flows. Saudi Arabia should consider DTTs as a key way of attracting foreign firms into the Kingdom by offering them the reassurance that income will not be taxed twice. DTTs already prevail over domestic tax rules, and over 50 have been signed with countries including the United Kingdom, China, Switzerland, and Japan. The next step should be to focus on other key trading partners, particularly the United States, but also Germany and Australia.

Furthermore, Saudi Arabia is encouraging the growth of the private sector in order to diversify its economy and to employ more Saudi nationals. Diversification efforts are focusing on power generation, telecommunications, natural gas exploration, and petrochemical sectors. Roughly 10 million foreign workers play an important role in the Saudi economy, particularly in the oil and service sectors.

PwC Saudi Arabia supports clients with the local knowledge and skills of its people and with access to a broad range of other professionals across the PwC global network of firms. PwC Saudi Arabia has more than 1,000 professionals offering assurance, tax, and advisory services at several locations.
