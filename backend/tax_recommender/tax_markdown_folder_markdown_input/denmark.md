# Denmark
## Overview
Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
Denmark, a Scandinavian country located in Northern Europe, is bordered primarily by the Baltic Sea and the North Sea. It is divided into five main regions, with Copenhagen as its capital. The official language of Denmark is Danish, and the currency is the Danish krone (DKK).
PwC Denmark is one of the largest firms in the country within its three main areas: audit, tax, and consulting services. We serve a significant proportion of Denmark's largest companies, public and private institutions, and have a soundly based portfolio of clients in most industries. Through product development and national, as well as international, experience, our professionals have developed broad expertise and are able to provide unique services. Tax planning and tax reporting have become more extensive and opaque for businesses. At the same time, it also means more for the company's finances and reputation. Frequent changes in tax laws place both Danish and foreign companies under great pressure. PwC's approximately 280 Danish tax specialists offer solution-oriented tax advice based on specific tax challenges and create value to our clients' bottom line. Clients receive personalised service with local expertise in a global network.
