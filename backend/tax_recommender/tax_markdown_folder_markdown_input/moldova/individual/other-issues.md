# Moldova
## Individual - Other issues
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Temporary visas
Foreign nationals generally require entry visas to enter Moldova, with exceptions for certain countries, including EU member states.
Moldova issues long-stay ‘D’ visas for extended stays, which are renewable. Citizens of some countries may also need an invitation from Moldova immigration authorities.
## Work permits
Foreign employees working in Moldova have to obtain the residence permit for work purposes. This permit is obtained based on decisions granting the right to stay for work purposes in Moldova issued by relevant Moldovan state authorities.
The law provides for simplified immigration compliance procedures in case of:
* Immigrant workers.
* Employees with priority occupations (as defined by Moldovan law).
* Individuals responsible for management.
* Foreigners engaged in projects of national importance.
* Foreigners engaged in external assistance projects.
* Highly qualified individuals.
* Seconded foreigners.
* Foreigners who carry our teaching activities in the fields of culture, health, and sports.
* Individuals with management positions within an applicant beneficiary engaged in the IT activities, as well as specialists in the IT field.
* Foreigners employed by a resident of a free economic zone.
* Seasonal agricultural workers and frontier workers.
* Foreign specialists in the field of information technology.
* Employees seconded for a period of up to 90 days during a calendar year.
## Residence permits
Foreign nationals staying in Moldova for more than 90 days within a six-month period must obtain a residence permit. Non-compliance can result in entry bans and penalties.
Specific exemptions apply to professional sellers, providers of contractual services, and independent professionals from a European Union member state.
## Exemptions for non-resident employees in Moldovan companies
As of 2023, certain categories of non-resident workers are allowed to work without obtaining a visa, the right to stay, or a provisional residence permit. This applies to those who have been initially registered and assigned a state identification number for individuals (IDNP) and an electronic identity, and meet cumulatively the following conditions:
* The immigrant worker holds an IDNP and an electronic identity.
* The immigrant worker will not be present in Moldova during the employment period for longer than allowed by the law.
* The immigrant worker is not a resident of Moldova as per Moldovan tax law.
* The work is based on an electronic employment contract, signed with a qualified electronic signature issued as per the Moldovan law.
Failure to meet at least one of these conditions results in the need to comply with the general conditions for work as outlined in this chapter.
Since 2022, Moldova has recognised EU issued electronic signatures. Implementation of these mechanisms is ongoing.
