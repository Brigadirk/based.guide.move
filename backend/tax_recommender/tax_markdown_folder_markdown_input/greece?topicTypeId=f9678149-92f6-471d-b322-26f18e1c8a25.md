## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Social security contributions
Social security contributions are due on salary and benefits in cash or in kind granted by an employer to its employees, with the exception of specifically enumerated extraordinary benefits of social character (e.g. marriage gifts, birth gifts). More specifically,as per the benefits in kind, said benefits might only be exempted from social security contributions,as lond as they are offered:
i) voluntarily by the employer and for the better serving of the employer's operational need, also contributing to the increase of the employees' productivity and the better quality of the employee's workplace,or
ii) they constitute a measure adopted for the hygiene and safety of the employees, as well as
iii) they are offered personally to the employees and not in cash.
The imposition of social security contributions depends on the social security fund in which the employee is registered.
As of 01.01.2025,the social security contributions will amount to 13.37% at the level of the employee and contributed at 21.79% at the level of the employer,i.e. totally 35.16%. The  monthly social security contribution cap for EFKA is set at 7,572.62 from 1 January 2025.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
## Uniform Tax on the Ownership of Real Estate Property (ENFIA)
The ENFIA applies to all types of real estate rights, including full ownership, usufruct, occupancy and surface rights on all real estate properties in Greece (principal tax). The supplementary tax on individuals was abolished by the provisions of L. 4916/2022 for the year 2022 onwards and replaced by an increase of the principal tax ranging from 5% to 20% according to the total value of the immovable property if it exceeds EUR 500,000.
Specifically, ENFIA is determined based on the data of real estate property of the previous year and respective changes occured, as indicated on the 1st January of the next year of the Real Estate Property Declaration (Specific Form E9).
The principal tax on buildings is calculated by multiplying the square metres of the building by the principal tax ranging from EUR 2 to EUR 16.20 per square metre and other coefficients affecting the value of the property (e.g. location, use).
The principal tax on land is calculated by multiplying the square metres of the land by the principal tax ranging from EUR 0.0037 to EUR 9.2500 per square metre and other coefficients affecting the value of the property (e.g. location, use).
Pursuant the provisions of the new tax law 5162/2024, starting from the year 2025, the Unified Property Tax (ENFIA) for insured individuals' residences will be reduced by 20%, provided that the taxable value of the property does not exceed 500,000 euros. If the property's value exceeds this threshold, the reduction remains at 10%. To qualify for this exemption, the insurance must cover the previous year and have a minimum duration of three months. If the insurance duration is less than one year, the real estate tax reduction will be applied proportionally.
## Inheritance Tax
Pursuant to the Greek tax legislation, Inheritance Tax is assessed on the current value of the property inherited. The said property includes any kind of movable and immovable property located in Greece, regardless of the descendant’s nationality. The taxable value of real estate property inherited is the 'objective value' (it is calculated on the basis of certain predetermined factors set by the Ministry of Finance) on the day of death of the deceased. Immovable assets located abroad are not subject to Greek Inheritance Tax, regardless of nationality and residency.
The tax rates are graduated and vary considerably, depending on the relationship between the deceased (inherited person) and the heir. Tax rates are based on a progressive scale. Relevant rates depend on the parties’ relationship (grade of relation, etc., and certain other factors - e.g. disabilities of the beneficiary); such rates range from 1% to 40%, while there is a tax-free amount (which depends on the proximity of the relationship). As a general rule, the closer the relationship the lower the tax rate. For example, in case of inheritance realised by individuals to their spouses or children (i.e. subject to A' category of the progressive scale), the respective rates range from 1% to 10%, while the tax-free amount is up to EUR 150,000.
Indicatively, the above mentioned tax category Α’ includes spouses, children, grandchildren, parents, and grandparents, category Β’ includes children from a spouse’s former marriage, parents-in-law, brothers, uncles, nephews etc., and category C’ includes distant relatives and non-relatives (blood or affinity relatives other than those referred to in the above-mentioned categories A’ and B’) as well as third parties.
| Value (EUR) | Tax rate (%) | Tax (EUR) | Total value (EUR) | Total tax (EUR) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Category A'** (a. the spouse, b. the children, c. the grandchildren, d. the parents, etc.) | | | | |
| 150,000 | - | - | 150,000 | - |
| 150,000 | 1 | 1,500 | 300,000 | 1,500 |
| 300,000 | 5 | 15,000 | 600,000 | 16,500 |
| Above | 10 |  |  |  |
| **Category B'** (a. the great-grandchildren et seq., the grandparents and great-grandparents, c. the brothers and sisters, etc.) | | | | |
| 30,000 | - | - | 30,000 | - |
| 70,000 | 5 | 3,500 | 100,000 | 3,500 |
| 200,000 | 10 | 20,000 | 300,000 | 23,500 |
| Above | 20 |  |  |  |
| **Category C'** (all the rest of the relatives) | | | | |
| 6,000 | - | - | 6,000 | - |
| 66,000 | 20 | 13,200 | 72,000 | 13,200 |
| 195,000 | 30 | 58,500 | 267,000 | 71,700 |
| Above | 40 |  |  |  |
## Donation tax and parental grant
Donation tax and parental grant (i.e. transfer of assets while the transferor is alive) are assessed on the current value of the property donated. Taxable property includes any kind of movable and immovable property located in Greece. The tax rates are graduated and vary considerably, depending on the relationship between donor and donee. In general, tax liabilities arise upon receipt of gifts and are paid by the donee. The acquisition of real estate property through donation is subject to the same tax scale as inheritance tax. The respective tax return should be submitted to the competent Greek tax office before the signing of the contract.
In case of parental grants (i.e. donation between each parent and each child), the respective tax is imposed on the basis of the same tax progressive scale for category A’ (ranging from 1% to 10%), whereas a tax free amount of EUR 800,000 is provided by law.
## Real estate transfer tax (Law 1587/1950)
Each transfer of real estate, which is not subject to VAT, is subject to real estate transfer tax. The real estate transfer tax is imposed at a rate of 3% on the taxable value of the property. Moreover, on the amount of main transfer tax is imposed an extra tax of 3% in favour of municipalities and communities.
## Other duties
### Municipality Duty (called Telos Akinitis Periousias or TAP)
The real estate ownership is subject to a Municipality Duty. The said duty is levied and collected annually through the electricity bill in favour of municipalities and communities at a currently calculated rate ranging between 0.25‰ and 0.35‰ on the real estate’s objective value (i.e. multiplying the real estate’s square metres by the specific value per square metre, depending on the area where the real estate property is situated [i.e. determined by the Ministry of Finance], and further multiplied by the rate deriving from the building age).
### Duty for the provision of cleaning and lighting services
A duty in compensation for the collection of garbage and waste and for the lighting of the streets, collected by the electricity bill, is due from the user of real estate. According to the relevant law provisions, these duties are calculated by multiplying the real estate’s square metres by a certain rate determined by the municipal council.
## Tax on electrified spaces
The Municipal Council may levy a tax on real estate connected to the grid, the collection of which is effected through the electricity bill. The tax is calculated by multiplying the real estate’s square metres by a rate determined by the municipal or community council ranging between EUR 0.018 and EUR 0.073. The said rate can be increased every year up to 20%.
