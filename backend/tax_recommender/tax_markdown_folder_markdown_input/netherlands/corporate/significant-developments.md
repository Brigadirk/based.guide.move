# Netherlands
## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Pillars One and Pillar Two
The Netherlands implemented Pillar Two as of 1 January 2024, in line with the European Union (EU) Pillar Two Directive. The Dutch legislation l is almost entirely in line with the Directive. Entities established in the Netherlands that are part of a (multinational or large domestic) group with a consolidated group turnover of at least 750 million euros (EUR) will fall within the scope of the new legislation. Certain sectors, such as investment funds and pension funds, are outside the scope of Pillar Two.
Currently, the Netherlands does not levy a digital service tax.
## Conditional source taxation on dividends
## Fit for 55: EU climate agreement - Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) transition phase applies from October 2023 until December 2025
The European Union aims to reduce its net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels, and reach climate neutrality by 2050. On 14 July 2021, the European Commission presented the Fit for 55 Package with proposals aiming to deliver the 2030 CO₂ reduction target and to pave the way to become the world's first climate-neutral continent by 2050.
A number of key proposals from this package have been adopted, namely Revision of EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), Effort Sharing Regulation, CO₂ emissions standards for cars and vans, LULUCF, Social Climate Fund, Fuel Maritime (Sustainable maritime fuels), Energy Efficiency Directive (EED), Alternative fuels infrastructure Regulation (AFIR), Renewable Energy Directive III (RED III), and ReFuelEU Aviation.
On 1 October 2023, CBAM came into effect. After the transitional phase (October 2023 through 2025), with administrative and reporting obligations, CBAM provides for a levy on the importation of certain greenhouse gas (GHG) intensive goods into the European Union.
*Read more on the EU Fit for 55 Package [here](https://www.pwc.nl/en/services/tax/managing-tax-and-energy-transition/fit-for-55.html)*.
## 2025 Tax Plan
The 2025 Tax Plan includes a.o. the following tax measures:
* Reversal of the abolition of the dividend tax buyback facility;
* Interest deduction limitation on earnings stripping from 20 per cent to 24.5 per cent;
* Introduction of the General Anti-Abuse Rule (GAAR) of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD);
* The earlier announced abolition of reduced VAT rate for cultural goods and services - with the exception of cinemas and daytime recreation (2026) - will be reversed. However, pending on covering the budgetary deficit arising from this decision, it is still uncertain what compensating measures will take be taken;
* Abolition of reduced VAT rate for accommodation - with the exception of camping sites (2026).
*Read more on 2025 Tax Plan [here](https://www.pwc.nl/en/budget-day.html).*
## Abolition of 'open cv' as an independent taxpayer
According to the Secretary of State, a limited partnership (CV) can still be independently taxable (non-transparent) under the proposed rules if it qualifies as a mutual fund (FGR).
In some cases where a currently transparent CV or similar foreign entity me be reclassified as a non-transparent FGR as of 1 January 2025, because it meets the criteria for an ‘open’ FGR. A transitional law provision will be introduced, which, under certain conditions, offers some time for the restructuring of an investment fund into an so- called ‘inkoopfonds’, which will then still be transparent. One of these conditions is that the fund already intends in 2024 to meet the conditions of an ‘inkoopfonds’ in the course of 2025.
## Qualification foreign legal forms
## Amendments to the FBI regime
Dutch Fiscal Investment Institutions (FBIs) are no longer allowed to directly invest in real estate located in the Netherlands. It remains possible for an FBI to be involved in the management of a real estate entity related to the FBI. It will also remain possible to directly invest in foreign real estate.
## Business in Europe: Framework for Income Taxation (BEFIT)
BEFIT is a Directive proposal by the European Commission issued on 12 September 2023. BEFIT introduces an aggregated common company tax base for the so-called ’BEFIT groups‘ that is distributed among the EU Member States on the basis of a seven-year transitional allocation rule for the further application of domestic corporate income tax (CIT) rules.
If adopted, BEFIT will enact substantial alterations to the corporate tax system across the EU27, impacting both domestic, EU, and non-EU headquartered groups doing business in the European Union. Consensus among all EU Member States is necessary for the adoption of BEFIT. In such a case, BEFIT would apply in parallel with the Pillar Two rules in EU27 and national CIT systems.
*See* *our EU Gateway publication* [*BEFIT proposal: a new company tax system in the EU?*](https://www.pwc.nl/nl/dienstverlening/tax/documents/eu-gateway-publication-befit-proposal-a-new-company-tax-system-in-the-eu.pdf) *for more information on BEFIT as well as its parallel application with Pillar Two laws in the European Union*.
## Transfer Pricing Directive Proposal
On 12 September 2023, the European Commission published a legislative proposal for a Directive on Transfer Pricing. This Directive (if adopted) would incorporate the arm’s-length principle into EU law and EU Member States’ domestic legislation, harmonise key transfer pricing rules, and create the possibility to establish common binding rules in the European Union on specific transfer pricing subjects. The proposal also looks to clarify the role and status of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines.
The proposal will undergo negotiation by the EU Member States with the goal of achieving the required unanimous approval. This is expected to be a challenging process. Limited enthusiasm for the legislative proposal prompted the presidency to explore non-binding solutions, such as a Transfer Pricing Platform. Further efforts are required to move this file forward. If approval is obtained, the Directive will come into force as of 1 January 2026.
The Dutch government understands the problem statement in the Directive proposal, which states that the options and possibilities for interpreting the OECD guidelines can lead to less certainty for companies. However, it questions whether a solution is achieved if limiting options and possibilities for interpretation is only designed within the EU context. In addition, the Netherlands has questions about the implications of the proposal concerning the position of individual EU Member States in the OECD meetings on Transfer Pricing.
*See our EU Gateway publication* [*The Transfer Pricing Directive: The Fundamental Changes and Impact on Groups Operating in the EU*](https://www.pwc.nl/nl/assets/documents/eu-gatewaypublication-the-transfer-pricing-directive.pdf). *In this EU Gateway publication, we present the fundamental aspects of the proposed Transfer Pricing Directive and their impact for groups operating in the EU Member States. Each aspect is accompanied by our EU Gateway observations*.
## Head Office Tax system proposal
## Loss relief
An unlimited-in-time loss carry-forward rule is applicable as of 1 January 2022. However, carry-back and carry-forward losses are only deductible up to an amount of EUR 1 million in taxable profit. In the event the taxable profit in one year exceeds EUR 1 million, the losses are only offsetable for up to 50% of that higher taxable profit, minus the amount of EUR 1 million that may always be offset.
## Reporting obligations for digital platform operators (DAC7)
Through the DAC7 Directive, the European Union is introducing new measures to increase tax transparency in the digital economy. Digital Platform Operators are targeted to identify, trace, and report on revenues made by sellers on their digital platforms. DAC7 is implemented in national law as of 1 January 2023. Digital Platform Operators are required to report on the year 2023 for the first time in 2024. Digital Platform Operators should already have seller due diligence procedures and controls in place as of 1 January 2023.
## Treaty developments
The Netherlands pursues an active tax treaty policy in order to maintain and extend its wide tax treaty network. Most Dutch bilateral tax treaties are based on the OECD Model Tax Convention. The government has expressed that treaties with developing countries will be based on the United Nations (UN) Model Convention more often than was the case. In addition, in a press release dated 14 March 2024, it was stated that The Netherlands strives to include anti-abuse measures in its tax treaties with developing countries.The Netherlands has concluded bilateral tax treaties for the avoidance of double taxation on income and capital with over 90 countries worldwide. As of 1 July 2019, the multilateral instrument (MLI) has entered into force for the Netherlands. It first had effect on 1 January 2020.
New treaties are concluded regularly: new treaties were signed with Belgium (2023, Andora (2023), Kyrgyzstan (2023), Moldavia (2023) and Bangladesh (2024) (all are yet to come into effect). Currently double tax treaties are negotiated or renegotiated with 13 countries: Aruba, Benin, Brazil, Ecuador, Germany, Morocco, Mozambique, Portugal, Romania, Suriname, Sweden and Uganda.
