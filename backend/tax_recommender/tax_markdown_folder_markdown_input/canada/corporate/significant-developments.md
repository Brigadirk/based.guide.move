## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 10 December 2024
Canada's corporate tax summary reflects all 2024 federal, provincial, and territorial budgets. This summary is based on enacted and proposed legislation and assumes that the proposed legislation will become law. Generally, budget proposals and draft legislation are enacted into law, even with a minority federal government, which is currently the case. *For more details of the proposed new business tax measures noted in the summary, see our Tax Insights on the 2024 federal budget at [www.pwc.com/ca/budget](https://www.pwc.com/ca/budget).*
## 'Clean economy' investment tax credits
The 2022, 2023, and 2024 federal budgets introduced multiple 'clean economy' refundable investment tax credits (ITCs) for: carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS); clean technology; clean hydrogen; clean technology manufacturing (which includes electric vehicle supply chain investment); and clean electricity generation. Recently enacted legislation implements the ITCs for CCUS, clean technology, clean hydrogen, and clean technology manufacturing and applications are now being accepted. Draft legislative proposals introduce the ITC for clean electricity generation. *See Federal environmental incentives in the* [*Tax*](tax-credits-and-incentives.html)*[credits and incentives](tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section and our Tax Insights 'Clean economy investment tax credits (August 2024 update)' and 'Finance releases draft legislation for the clean hydrogen and clean technology manufacturing investment tax credits' (5 June 2024 update) at [www.pwc.com/ca/taxinsights](https://www.pwc.com/ca/taxinsights) for more information*.
## Capital gains inclusion rate
## Tax on equity repurchases
## Transfer pricing
The government released a consultation paper to gather stakeholder input on various questions and proposals related to modernisation of Canada’s transfer pricing legislation. *See Transfer pricing in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section and our Tax Insights ‘Finance launches consultation on reforming and modernizing Canada’s transfer pricing rules’ at [www.pwc.com/ca/taxinsights](https://www.pwc.com/ca/taxinsights) for more information.*
## Interest deductibility limits
Recently enacted legislation limits the amount of net interest and financing expenses that a corporation may deduct in computing its taxable income to a fixed ratio of its ‘tax EBITDA’ (taxable income before interest expense, interest income, income tax, and deductions for depreciation and amortisation), with an election to instead use a ratio based on the 'book EBITDA' of its group, effective starting with taxation years beginning after 30 September 2023. *See Interest deductibility limits in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section and our Tax Insights ‘Bill C-59: Excessive interest and financing expenses limitation (EIFEL) regime' (28 August 2024 update) at [www.pwc.com/ca/taxinsights](https://www.pwc.com/ca/taxinsights) for more information*.
## Hybrid mismatch arrangements
Recently enacted legislation (the first of two legislative packages) eliminates the tax benefits from hybrid mismatch arrangements, which are generally cross-border transactions that are characterised differently under the tax laws of different countries. The first package of rules applies for payments generally arising after 30 June 2022. *See Hybrid mismatch arrangements in the**[Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section and our Tax Insights ‘Canada introduces first package of hybrid mismatch rules' at [www.pwc.com/ca/taxinsights](https://www.pwc.com/ca/taxinsights) for more information*.
## Global minimum tax and the new international tax framework
* reallocate some portion of the profits of large multinational enterprises (MNEs) to countries where the MNE's customers are located (Pillar One), and
* adopt a global minimum effective tax rate of 15% (Pillar Two).
## Digital services tax (DST)
## Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) Assessment and Revenue Management (CARM)
## General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR)
Recently enacted legislation amends the GAAR by:
* introducing a preamble to guide the interpretation of the GAAR
* lowering the avoidance transaction standard and introducing an economic substance rule, and
* applying a three-year extension of the normal reassessment period and implementing a 25% penalty.
