# Canada
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 10 December 2024
## Employment expenses
In computing income from employment, an individual can claim only limited, specified deductions. Taxes and interest (except interest related to the earning of business and property income), most life insurance premiums, and casualty losses are not deductible. Allowable deductions in computing employment income include travelling and certain other expenses of officers or employees required as a condition of employment.
### Registered plans
A deduction is available with respect to an employee's contributions to a Registered Pension Plan (RPP), a Pooled Registered Pension Plan (PRPP), or to a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP), within certain limits. Income earned in these plans is taxed only on withdrawal. In certain cases, individuals can deduct their contributions to an employer-sponsored foreign pension plan if they participated in the plan before moving to Canada.
Self-employed individuals can also make deductible contributions to RRSPs.
For both employed and self-employed individuals, the deductible contribution to an RRSP is generally 18% of the total employment, self-employment, and rental income that was subject to Canadian tax in the preceding year, to a maximum annual contribution amount (CAD 31,560 in 2024). The allowable contribution is further limited when an individual is a member of an RPP, PRPP, or a foreign pension plan while working in Canada.
### Pooled Registered Pension Plans (PRPPs)
The federal PRPP is a voluntary savings plan aimed at individuals who do not have access to employer-sponsored pension plans. The tax rules for PRPPs complement the existing RPP and RRSP framework, and operate in a manner similar to multi-employer defined contribution RPPs. The provinces and territories must introduce their own enabling legislation to implement provincial and territorial PRPPs.
## Personal deductions
Deductible non-business expenses include alimony and maintenance payments (if taxable to the recipient), certain child-care expenses, and eligible moving expenses for relocation within Canada (usually in connection with a change of employment).
### Child-care expenses
## Interest expense
## Personal allowances
Unlike countries that permit personal exemptions and allowances in determining taxable income, Canada has adopted a system of tax credits. *See the [Other tax credits and incentives](other-tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for more information*.
## Business deductions
### Immediate expensing of capital property for individuals and partnerships
Unincorporated businesses carried on directly by certain individuals and partnerships can, in the year that the eligible property becomes available for use, immediately expense up to CAD 1.5 million per taxation year of eligible property acquired after 31 December 2021 that becomes available for use generally before 2025. Eligible property consists of capital property subject to the capital cost allowance (CCA) rules, other than property included in CCA classes 1 to 6, 14.1, 17, 47, 29, and 51 (*see Depreciation and amortisation in the [Deductions](../corporate/deductions.html) section of the Corporate tax summary for more information on CCA*).
## Capital losses
Capital losses are deductible, but generally only against capital gains. Any excess of allowable capital losses over taxable capital gains in the current year can be carried back three years and forward indefinitely, to be applied against net taxable capital gains from those years. No particular holding period is required. Intent is a major factor in determining whether the gain or loss is income or capital in nature. Draft legislative proposals clarify that the inclusion rate for net capital losses carried forward and applied against capital gains is adjusted to reflect the inclusion rate of the capital gains being offset.
