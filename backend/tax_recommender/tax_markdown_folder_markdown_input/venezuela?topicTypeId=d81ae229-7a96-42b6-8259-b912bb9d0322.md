## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
Resident corporations making certain types of payments must withhold taxes. T2 refers to Tariff 2. These include the following:
| Type of payment | Resident (%) (1) | | Non-resident (%) | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Corporation | Individual | Corporation | Individual |
| Commissions (2) | 5 | 3 | 5 | 34 |
| Dividends (5) | 34 | 34 | 34 | 34 |
| Royalties (6) | 0 | 0 | T2 on 90 | 34 on 90 |
| Interest to foreign financial institutions | N/A | N/A | 4.95 | N/A |
| Other interest | 5 | 3 | T2 on 95 | 34 on 95 |
| Professional fees | 5 | 3 | T2 on 90 | 34 on 90 |
| Technical assistance fees (3) | 5 | 3 | T2 on 30 | 34 on 30 |
| Technological service fees (3) | 5 | 3 | T2 on 50 | 34 on 50 |
| Real estate rentals | 5 | 3 | 5 | 34 |
| Tangible personal property rentals | 5 | 3 | 5 | 34 |
| Contractor and subcontractor services | 2 | 1 | T2 | 34 |
| Film and television exhibition rights | 5 | 3 | T2 on 25 | 34 on 25 |
| Insurance and reinsurance premiums | N/A | N/A | 10 on 30 | N/A |
| Payments to international media organisations | 5 | 3 | T2 on 15 | N/A |
| Acquisition of Venezuela commercial funds | 5 | 3 | 5 | 34 |
| Payments to non-domiciled international transportation companies (4) | N/A | N/A | T2 on 5 | N/A |
Notes
1. WHTs constitute prepayments against final tax liabilities as determined by the income tax return when filed.
2. Includes commissions earned in instances other than through a dependent relationship (e.g. employer/employee). Commissions are subject to withholdings in the same manner as salaries and wages.
3. The rates for non-residents are similar to those rates applicable for payments to a non-domiciled corporation not resident in a treaty country and rendering services from abroad with no PE in Venezuela.
4. Excludes payments exempted under international shipping agreements.
6. Domestic income tax withholding rules do not provide for withholding rates in case of resident beneficiaries. Although, in general, no withholding should be applied, a case-by-case review may be necessary.
## Tax treaties
There are currently comprehensive treaties for the avoidance of double taxation with the following countries:
| Recipient | WHT (%) | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dividends | Interest | Royalties |
| Non-treaty (1) | 34 | 4.95/T2 on 95 (2) | T2 on 90 |
