# Indonesia
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
Indonesian income tax is collected mainly through a system of WHTs. Where a particular income item is subject to WHT, the payer is generally held responsible for withholding or collecting the tax. These WHTs are commonly referred to using the relevant article of the Income Tax (*Pajak Penghasilan* or PPh) Law, as follows.
## Article 23/26 Income Tax (PPh 23/26)
Domestic Article 23 WHT is payable at the rate of 2% for most types of services where the recipient of the payment is an Indonesian resident and 15% for a variety of payments to resident corporations and individuals.
For non-residents, Art. 26 WHT of 20% is applicable. The WHT rate for bond interest income, including the capital gain (i.e. premium and discount) enjoyed upon disposal, that is received or obtained by non-residents other than PEs can be given a lower WHT rate of 10%. Under the operation of a tax treaty, lower rates may be applicable at the following rates:
| Recipient | WHT (%) | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dividends | | Interest | Royalties | Branch profits (8) |
| Portfolio | Substantial holdings |
| Resident corporations | 15 | 0 | 15 | 15 | N/A |
| Resident individuals | 10 | 10 | 15 | 15 | N/A |
