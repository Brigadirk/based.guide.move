## Payroll taxes
### Pay-as-you-earn (PAYE)
All compensation (including salary, cash allowances, and benefits in kind) paid to employees is generally taxable. For the calculation of the personal income tax (PIT) to be withheld by the employer, the tax administration provides a tax table determined on a monthly basis so that no calculation is necessary.
### Employer tax
Employers are subject to a 3% tax based on the total gross salaries paid to employees.
## Social Security contributions
Social Security contributions are borne exclusively by the employer.
The rate for the industrial accident/occupational disease branch has to be confirmed by the authority when registering the entity with the Social Security Office (applicable rate to be stated within the related certificate).
| Sector | Rate of contributions (only payable by employers) (%) | Maximum monthly basis of calculation (XOF) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Family | 7 | 63,000 |
| Industrial accident / Occupational disease | 1/3/5 | 63,000 |
## Retirement contributions
Retirement contributions are payable both by the employer and the employees:
| Regime | Rates of contributions (%) | | Maximum monthly basis of calculation (XOF) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Payable by employers | Payable by employees (withheld on the salary) |
| General | 8.4 | 5.6 | 432,000 |
| Executive | 3.6 | 2.4 | 1,296,000 |
## Employment medical coverage
The employer shall subscribe for all employees a medical coverage. The level of coverage depends on the type of agreement concluded with the dedicated organism. Usually, the employee is reimbursed for 80% of medical expenses, even though the law provides a range between 50% and 80%.
The maximum monthly rate is 15%, to be levied on a contribution rate that cannot exceed XOF 250,000, for both the employee and the employer.
## Local Economic Contribution (*Contribution Economique Locale* or CEL)
The CEL is a new contribution replacing the business license tax and consisting of two different taxes:
* the company’s properties contribution, and
* the company value added contribution.
The company’s properties contribution is assessed annually on the rental value of the company’s business premises. The rental value corresponds to 7% of the cost price.
The applicable rates are 15% for leases premises and 20% for owned premises, lands, and installations.
The company added value contribution is based on the added value produced by a company during the previous year. The tax rate is 1%. An upper ceiling of 70% of the turnover applies to the company added value contribution.
Specific tax rates are provided for companies such as operators of public telecommunication networks licensed in Senegal (0.30%) and port facility operators (1.5%).
## Tax on telecommunication
The tax rate is 5% on telecommunication use and access.
## Tax on vehicles
An owner of a motor vehicle (car, truck, or motorbike) must pay an annual tax fixed at XOF 1,000 per hectolitre, except for the pirogue gasoline.
## Company tax on vehicles
In addition to the tax on vehicles, companies owning or renting vehicles (more than 15 days a year) must pay a specific annual tax on them. Rates range from XOF 50,000 to XOF 200,000, depending on the type and horsepower of the vehicle.
## Levy on insurance companies (LIC)
Insurance companies approved in Senegal are liable to the LIC (fixed at 1% and a reduced rate of 0.5% for life insurance).
The basis of the LIC is turnover.
## Tax on insurance contracts
* 6% for insurance against risks of any kind of maritime, river, or air navigation.
* 5% for group insurance, including deferred annuity contracts of less than three years, subject to the exemptions provided for in article 540.
* 7% for life annuity contracts, including deferred annuity contracts of less than three years, subject to the exemptions provided for in article 540.
* 0.25% for export credit insurance.
* 14% for all other insurance.
## Sampling of consignments of petroleum products and hydrocarbon stores from foreign-flagged vessels
The taxable basis of this levy shall be:
* For consignment operations: The quantity in net kilograms of imported petroleum products.
* For fuelling: The quantity in net kilograms of hydrocarbons exported.
This levy is fixed at XOF 10 per net kilogram. The liquidation, recovery, and litigation of this levy are done as in customs.
The Industry Energy Tax rate is 2.5%, applied to the price excluding tax, of electricity consumed by the taxable person.
Individuals or entities considered as industrial operators are subject to this tax.
In addition, the electricity consumption of companies that have signed an agreement with the State of Senegal that exempts them from indirect taxes during the period of validity of the said agreement is exempt from this tax. Electricity exports made by SENELEC are also exempt from this tax.
## Export duties on non-monetary gold
## WHT on sale of hydrocarbons by non-resident entities
A tax equal to XOF 0.5 per kilogram sold is due by foreign companies that sell directly to local or foreign authorised importers the hydrocarbons they have in tanks built in Senegal.
