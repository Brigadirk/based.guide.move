# Poland
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 22 July 2024
A company is considered to be a resident in Poland if its registered office or management is located in Poland.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
### PE under Polish CIT law
According to the Polish CIT Act, definition of 'permanent establishment' covers:
unless a relevant DTT to which Poland is a party provides otherwise.
Note that Polish CIT law:
* does not encompass any provisions concerning the period required for construction works to create a PE
* does not include provisions indicating that an independent agent does not create a PE, and
* does not include provisions indicating that actions of an auxiliary or preparatory character do not lead to creation of a PE in Poland.
The above-mentioned standard PE existence triggers should be interpreted taking into account wording of a specific DTT, the provisions of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Commentary, and international practice.
### PE from a DTT perspective
In general, the provisions of DTTs concluded by Poland are based on the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital (OECD Model), except for provisions related to taxation of royalties, which are based on the United Nations (UN) Model Double Taxation Convention.
Under standard DTTs based on the OECD Model, PE in Poland may be triggered by a foreign entity having:
* a fixed place of business through which the business of the enterprise is wholly or partially carried on
* a dependent agent, or
* a building site, construction, assembly, or installation, or a supervisory or consultancy activity connected therewith.
Note that some DTTs concluded by Poland also encompass other PE concepts (e.g. service PE concept or offshore PE concept).
