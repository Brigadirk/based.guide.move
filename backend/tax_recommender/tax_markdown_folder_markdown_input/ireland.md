# Ireland
## Overview
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
The island of Ireland is situated in Northwest Europe and is approximately 20 kilometres from Great Britain at its nearest point. The total area of the island is 84,421 square kilometres of which Northern Ireland (politically part of the United Kingdom) comprises 14,139 square kilometres, with the remainder constituting an independent parliamentary democracy called Ireland. Ireland has a population of approximately 5 million people, with the greatest concentration being on the east and south coasts. The capital of Ireland is Dublin. Its official languages are Irish and English. Business is conducted in English, and the currency is the euro (EUR).
Ireland is a parliamentary democracy. The basic law of the country is contained in the Constitution of Ireland, which was adopted in 1937 and amended on a number of occasions since then by public referenda. The Constitution sets out the fundamental rights of the citizen, the form of government, and the powers of the government. It also defines the system of courts and regulates the appointment of the judiciary. The national parliament consists of the president and two houses: a house of representatives (*Dáil Éireann*) and a senate (*Seanad Éireann*). The President is Head of State only and does not have executive functions. Executive power is exercised by the Prime Minister (*Taoiseach*) and the cabinet, while the power of making laws rests with parliament.
The political environment in Ireland is stable and has been dominated by parties of a centre or a centre right persuasion over recent decades. Ireland is a member of the European Union (EU) and is also a member of most major international organisations but retains a neutral stance on military matters.
Furthermore, the Irish government has started to focus more on 'green' thinking and a more sustainable environment. The Climate Action Plan 2024 (launched on 20 December 2023) is the third annual update to Ireland’s Climate Action Plan 2019. This plan is the first to be prepared under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, following the introduction, in 2022, of economy-wide carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings. The plan implements the carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings and sets a roadmap for taking decisive action to halve Ireland’s emissions by 2030 and reach net zero no later than 2050, as committed to by Ireland in the Programme for Government.
PwC is the largest professional services firm in Ireland. We have over 3,000 professionals in seven locations, which are Dublin, Cork, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick, Waterford, and Wexford.
