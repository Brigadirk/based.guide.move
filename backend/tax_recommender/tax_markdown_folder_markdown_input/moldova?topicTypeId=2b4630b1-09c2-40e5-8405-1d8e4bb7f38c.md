# Moldova
## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Social security contributions (SSC)
Contributions to the Social Security Budget are mandatory; however, unlike taxes, they have an exact destination and are available for refund to the beneficiary individuals in the form of pensions, allowances, etc.
Employers must pay SSC of 24% (with some exceptions) of their employees' gross salary, meal tickets, and other remunerations to the Social Security Fund. The legislation provides annual fixed SSC for other categories of taxpayers in an amount approved for each year (e.g. MDL 20,518 applicable in 2025).
The table below summarises information about the type of employers and SSC rates applicable for them.
| Type of employer | Employer SSC rate |
| --- | --- |
| Employers in the private sector, higher education, and medical institutions | 24% |
| Employers for employees working in special conditions | 32% |
| Employers in agriculture | 24%, with 18% paid by the employer and 6% by the state budget |
Employers have to report SSC on a monthly basis (with certain exceptions) through the unique payroll tax return. The SSC due must be transferred by the employer to the budget no later than the 25th day of the month following the reporting one.
For foreign citizens and stateless people employed under labour agreements in Moldova, SSC are computed similarly as for Moldovan citizens (with some exceptions).
Moldova currently has social security agreements concluded with Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Turkey, Spain, Lavia. Moldova also has pension agreements concluded with Azerbaijan, Italy, Russian Federation, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.
## Health insurance contributions
The mandatory health insurance contribution, computed as a percentage of wages and other remuneration, is established at 9% and is fully borne by the employees. The legislation also provides for an annual fixed amount of health insurance contribution paid by other categories of taxpayers in an amount approved for each year (e.g. MDL 12,636 applicable in 2025).
For foreign citizens and stateless people employed under labour agreements in Moldova, health insurance contributions are computed similarly as for Moldovan citizens. In the absence of a local labour agreement, foreign citizens can opt for optional health insurance from a private provider.
Moldovan citizens who are unemployed and not insured by the government have the liability to pay fixed health insurance contributions if their presence in Moldova exceeds 183 calendar days.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate in Moldova is currently 20%. It is generally applied to local supplies of goods and services as well as to goods subject to import and services subject to the reverse charge mechanism.
## Wealth tax
Starting with 2016, a wealth tax has been introduced in Moldova for individuals who own real estate (except for land).
The object of taxation is considered the real estate of residential destination that meets simultaneously the following conditions:
* The total estimated value is at least 200 average monthly salaries in the economy forecasted and approved by the Government for the period for which the tax is calculated (in force starting 01 January 2025)..
* The total surface is equal to or greater than 120 square metres.
The taxable base of real estate is represented by its estimated value determined by territorial cadastral bodies (with some exceptions).
The wealth tax rate is 0.8% of the taxable base.
The wealth tax is payable by 25 December of the reporting year, based on the notification of payment presented by the territorial tax offices for the situation existing as at 1 November of the reporting year.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Patrimony received by Moldovan citizens by inheritance is not taxable. Moldovan tax law does not provide for separate gift taxes, such income being subject to general rules.
## Tax on immovable property
Property tax is imposed on property located in Moldova and owned both by Moldovan and foreign citizens. The tax applies to the estimated value of buildings, houses, apartments, and land and the rate depends on the location. The minimum rate is 0.05%, but the effective rate is determined by the representative local authorities annually.
The land tax rate for individuals depends on the land's destination (e.g. land for agriculture usage) and location, its cadastral index and surface, but cannot exceed MDL 30 for 100 square metres.
There are also separate rates for agricultural land with construction buildings on it (minimum rate of 0.1%, but the effective rate is determined by the representative local authorities annually).
Starting 1 January 2021, individuals may no longer benefit from a 15% discount at the full payment of the tax on immovable property by 30 June.
For certain categories of real estate, the local council can increase the real estate tax by up to 300%.
## Customs duties
Individuals are exempt from the payment of customs duties on goods whose customs value does not exceed 150 euros (EUR) per parcel of goods.
Individuals should pay import duties on goods imported by mail deliveries in business-to-consumer (B2C) commercial transactions. The provisions apply to goods of a commercial nature exceeding the quantitative limits established by the law or that have an intrinsic value exceeding EUR 150 per parcel of goods.
