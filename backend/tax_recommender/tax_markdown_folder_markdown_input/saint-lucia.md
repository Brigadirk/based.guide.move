# Saint Lucia
## Overview
Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
Saint Lucia is an island nation located in the Caribbean Sea. It has 11 quarters or parishes, with Castries as the capital and largest city. The official language of Saint Lucia is English, and the currency is the East Caribbean dollar (XCD).
Saint Lucia, with its fine natural harbour at Castries, was contested between England and France throughout the 17th and early 18th centuries (changing possession 14 times). It was finally ceded to the United Kingdom in 1814. Even after the abolition of slavery on its plantations in 1834, Saint Lucia remained an agricultural island, dedicated to producing tropical commodity crops. Self-government was granted in 1967 and independence in 1979.
The island nation has been able to attract foreign business and investment, especially in its offshore banking and tourism industries, with a surge in foreign direct investment in 2006, attributed to the construction of several tourism projects. Although crops such as bananas, mangos, and avocados continue to be grown for export, tourism provides Saint Lucia's main source of income, and the tourism industry is the island's biggest employer. The Saint Lucia manufacturing sector is the most diverse in the Eastern Caribbean, and the government is trying to revitalise the banana industry.
PwC does not have a permanent office offering tax services in Saint Lucia. However, PwC Barbados has a dedicated team responsible for providing consulting services relating to Saint Lucia tax issues.
