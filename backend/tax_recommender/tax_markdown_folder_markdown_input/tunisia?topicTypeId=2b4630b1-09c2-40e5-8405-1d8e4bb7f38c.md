# Tunisia
## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
## Social security contributions
The Tunisian social security system is financed by contributions from both employers (16.57%, reduced to 0.5% for wholly industrial exporting companies) and employees (9.18%) based on salaries. Employers collect and pay the social security contributions from each wage-earner.
For individuals carrying out independent activities, they may opt freely for one social regime among the regimes made available by the social authorities.
## Capital gains taxes
Capital gains derived from the disposal of immovable properties (lands and buildings) owned in Tunisia, expressly designated by the law, as well as shares in real estate civil partnerships, are subject to PIT according to the following rates:
* 10% in cases where the property was sold after a five-year period, starting from the date of its acquisition.
* 15% in cases where the property was sold before the expiry of a five-year period of detention, starting from the date of acquisition.
The above-stated regime is applicable to both resident and non-resident individuals.
For non-resident individuals, capital gains derived from the disposal of shares held in the capital of Tunisian-resident companies are subject to tax in Tunisia as follows:
* In cases where the shares are listed in the Tunisian Stock Exchange:
+ In cases where the shares were purchased prior to 1 January 2011, then capital gains will not be subject to tax in Tunisia.
+ In cases where the shares were purchased after 1 January 2011 and will be sold before the end of the year following the one during which they were acquired, then capital gains will be subject to tax. Otherwise (i.e. in cases where the shares will be sold after the expiry of the year following the one during which they were acquired), capital gains will not be subject to tax.
* In cases where the shares are not listed in the Tunisian Stock Exchange, capital gains derived from the disposal by non-Tunisian resident persons of non-listed shares are subject to tax in Tunisia.
For resident individuals, capital gains derived from the sale of shares held in the capital of non-listed Tunisian-resident companies are considered as securities income and are subject, as such, to income tax as follows:
* At the rate of 10% when the sale or retrocession took place after the expiry of one year following that of their subscription or their acquisition.
* At the rate of 15% when the sale or retrocession took place before the expiry of one year following that of their subscription or their acquisition.
Also, the Finance Law 2023 provides that for resident individuals, capital gains derived from the sale of shares held in the capital of listed Tunisian-resident companies are subject to income tax at the rate of 10% when the sale or retrocession took place before the expiry of one year following that of their subscription or their acquisition.
The taxable basis is calculated as the difference between the sale price and the purchase price.
In case of realisation of several sale operations during one fiscal year and in case some operations result in capital losses whereas some others result in capital gains, the taxable base is to be determined as the balance between the total realised capital gains and the total realised capital losses during the year. Note that the Finance Law 2023 repealed the TND 10,000 tax deduction.
For non-resident persons, the due tax will be levied through WHTs due at the rate of 10% on the basis of the realised capital gains with a ceiling of 2.5% of the selling price in case the seller is an individual.
However, in case the seller realises, during the same fiscal year, capital gains and capital losses derived from the disposal of shares, then the seller may opt for the filing of an annual tax return towards the Tunisian tax authorities and the payment of the due tax at the rate of 10%, on the basis of the balance between the realised capital gains and the realised capital losses.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is levied under the Tunisian VAT Code and is due on all transactions taking place in Tunisia. The sale of goods is considered as taking place in Tunisia and thus subject to VAT if the goods sold are delivered in Tunisia. The sale of services is considered as taking place in Tunisia and thus subject to VAT if the services sold are exploited or used in Tunisia.
The standard rate of VAT is 19%. Lower rates of 7% and 13% apply to specifically designated operations.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
The Finance Law 2023 has introduced a new category of tax called ’immovable property wealth tax‘. This tax concerns only individuals who hold, on 1 January of the fiscal year, real estate with net value equal to or exceeding TND 3 million, subject to DTTs.
The net value consists of the value of real estate, including the social rights in real estate civil companies (including those belonging to the dependent minor children) after deduction of debts (outstanding debts) attached to these real estates.
The tax rate is of 0.5%.
The taxable assets subject to this tax are built and not built real estate of any kind (e.g. villas, apartments, bare land).
However, the main house of the taxpayer and the real estate intended for the exercise of a professional activity (other than those not attached to a professional asset and intended for the rent to third parties) are not taxable.
This tax concerns:
* real estate located in Tunisia, notwithstanding the country of residence of the taxpayer, and
* real estate located abroad for taxpayers tax resident in Tunisia.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Inheritance of movable and immovable goods, from ancestors and descendants, are subject to registration fees at the rate of 2.5% calculated on the basis of the inherited goods value.
Inheritance of movable and immovable goods from brothers and sisters are subject to registration fees at the rate of 5% on the basis of the inherited goods value.
Inheritance of movable and immovable goods from uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, and cousins are subject to registration fees at the rate of 25% on the basis of the inherited goods value.
Inheritance of movable and immovable goods from relatives beyond the fourth degree and non-relatives are subject to registration fees at the rate of 35% on the basis of the inherited goods value.
## Property taxes
*See Net wealth/worth taxes above for a description of the immovable property wealth tax*.
## Luxury and excise taxes
There are no luxury or excise taxes in Tunisia.
