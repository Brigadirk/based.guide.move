# Croatia
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 07 January 2025
## General rules
Interest payments are subject to WHT at a 15 % rate, unless they relate to the following:
* Commodity loans for the purchase of goods used for carrying out a taxpayer’s business activity.
* Loans granted by a non-resident bank or other financial institution.
* Holders of government or corporate bonds who are non-resident legal persons.
WHT on dividends and profit shares is applied at the rate of 10 %. If the company uses a tax allowance for reinvested profit, other than that earned in the banking or the financial non-banking sector, WHT on such dividends and profit shares is not applied.
## EU Directives
The CIT Act provisions and certain EU Directives provide special treatment for dividends, interest, and royalties paid to related companies in Switzerland or states of the European Economic Area (EEA; Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein).
Regarding interest and royalty payments, full exemption only applies to payments between related companies if:
* there is a direct minimum holding of 25 % for an uninterrupted period of at least two years, and
* the beneficial owner of the interest or royalties is a company of Switzerland or an EEA state, or a PE located in Switzerland or an EEA state, whose company is headquartered in the Republic of Croatia.
Regarding dividend and profit shares payments, full exemption applies when dividends and shares of profits are distributed to a parent company of Switzerland or an EEA state, provided that:
* the recipient of the dividend or profit share has a minimum holding of 10 % in the capital of a company distributing the dividend or profit share, and
* the minimum holding is held for an uninterrupted period of at least two years.
The recipient of a dividend or profit share is any company:
* that takes one of the forms that are subject to the common system of taxation applicable to parent companies and subsidiaries of Switzerland or EEA states
* resident in Switzerland or an EEA state for tax purposes and, under the terms of a DTT concluded with a third state, not considered to be resident for tax purposes outside Switzerland or the European Economic Area, and
* subject to one of the taxes in the common system of taxation applicable to parent companies and subsidiaries of different EEA states or Switzerland, without the possibility of an option or of being exempt.
EU Directives benefits can apply even before the prescribed holding period expires if the taxpayer provides a bank guarantee on the amount of potential WHT liability. If the holding period eventually will not be met, the guarantee will be used to settle the tax liability.
## Treaty rates
If a country has a DTT signed with Croatia, WHT rates are lowered if the treaty rate is lower than the non-treaty rate. There are specific applications that need to be fulfilled in order to benefit from a DTT between countries.
The following countries have a DTT with Croatia:
