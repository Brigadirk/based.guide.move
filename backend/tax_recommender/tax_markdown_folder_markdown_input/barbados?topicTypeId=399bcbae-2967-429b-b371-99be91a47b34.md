# Barbados
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is levied at the rate of 17.5% on the value of a wide range of goods and services imported or supplied in Barbados by VAT-registered persons.
A number of services, including financial services, real estate, medical services, and education, are exempt. Intergroup transactions are taxable.
Persons operating under Barbados’ VAT regime must be registered for VAT. The threshold for VAT registration is 200,000 Barbados dollars (BBD), but voluntary registration is permitted for persons whose annual turnover is less than BBD 200,000.
Registered persons may deduct input tax from their output tax in calculating the tax payable for that VAT accounting period. Where input tax exceeds output tax, the registrant will be entitled to a refund of VAT.
Effective 1 December 2019, VAT applies on digital services to local consumers on the island by suppliers of digital services. The foreign company must apply, collect, and remit VAT on their digital sales.
The new measure will affect:
* the collection of VAT on goods and services purchased online from a vendor outside Barbados where the goods and services are for consumption in Barbados
* the collection and transmission of VAT on goods and services purchased online from local vendors by consumers in Barbados where the goods and services are for consumption in Barbados and the transaction is processed outside Barbados, and
* the collection and transmission of VAT on goods and services purchased online from local vendors by persons outside Barbados where the goods and services are for consumption in Barbados.
## Custom duties
Customs duty is levied on a wide range of imported goods at rates specified in Part 1 of the First Schedule of the Customs Act. Barbados’ Customs Tariff is based on the Common External Tariff of the Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM), with special derogations for certain items (e.g. spirituous beverages). Customs duty is calculated on either an *ad valorem* basis or at specific quantitative rates. The *ad valorem* rates for most items vary between 0% and 20%, but certain goods regarded as luxury items are subject to higher rates (e.g. jewellery 60%). In addition, a select group of items that are produced within Barbados and CARICOM (including some agricultural products) are subject to a duty rate of 60% when imported from outside the region.
Manufacturers and agriculturists, including persons involved in fishing and horticulture, are exempt from the payment of duty on inputs (including packaging materials, machinery, equipment, and spares) imported for use in their businesses.
The various departments and institutions, international bodies, and organisations listed in Part II-B of the Customs Tariff are exempt from the payment of customs duty. Specific goods (e.g. computers), also mentioned in Part II-B, are exempt from customs duty.
## Excise taxes
Five categories of goods (both locally manufactured, as well as imported) are subject to excise taxes. These are sweetened beverages, motor vehicles, spirituous beverages, tobacco products, and petroleum products. Most excisable goods are subject to the tax at a specific rate, with the exception of motor vehicles and sweetened beverages, which are subject to *ad valorem* rates.
A few persons and goods are exempt from excise taxes. These include motor vehicles imported by the diplomatic corps and other organisations exempt from customs duty under Part II-B of the Customs Tariff, goods imported for temporary use or for a temporary purpose that will be re-exported within three months, and goods (other than spirits) intended to be used as raw materials for the manufacture or production in Barbados of other taxable goods.
## Fuel tax
Effective 1 July 2018, a fuel tax was imposed on importations of gasoline and diesel at a rate of BBD 0.40 per litre and kerosene at a rate of BBD 0.50 per litre.
## Land tax
The following land tax rates are in effect:
| Land | Land tax rate |

| On amounts between BBD 150,000 and BBD 450,000 | 0.10% of the improved value |
| On amounts between BBD 450,000 and BBD 850,000 | 0.70% of the improved value |
| On amounts exceeding BBD 850,000 | 1% of the improved value, capped at BBD 100,000 |
| On the improved value of each parcel of land on which there is a building other than a residence | 0.95% of the improved value |
| On the site value of each parcel of unimproved land | 0.80% of the site value up to 4,000 sq. ft; 0.90% of the site value over 4,000 sq. ft and valued up to BBD 450,000; 1% on excess |
The following concessions have been granted for land taxes:
* For villas, as defined by the Tourism Development Act, a rebate of 25% is granted on production of a certificate from the Barbados Tourism Authority.
* For hotels, as defined by the Tourism Development Act, land tax is calculated and payable on only 50% of the tax demanded.
* A 10% discount is granted if the land tax is paid within 30 days from the date of the tax demand notice or 5% if paid within 60 days. Hotels and restaurants are allowed to pay their land tax bills during January to March without losing access to the discount granted.
* Any person certified by the Minister Responsible for Energy to be engaged in the production of solar energy and/or the manufacture of goods to be used in the production of solar energy will be entitled to a rebate of no more than 50% of the tax demanded for that year. Such persons are required to have settled all outstanding liabilities with the Comptroller of Customs and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to access the rebates.
