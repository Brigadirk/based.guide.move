## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 15 January 2025
* They are necessary expenses to obtain actual or potential income, taxed under the law.
* Any withholding obligations, as stated in other sections of the law, have been carried out.
However, the Tax Administration may reject or disregard the expense or cost, in whole or in part, if it is considered as excessive, inadmissible, or not indispensable to obtain taxable income.
## Depreciation
The straight-line and sum-of-the-years-digits methods of depreciation are allowed over the following useful lives:
| **Assets** | **Useful life (years)** |
| --- | --- |
| Buildings | 50 |
| Machinery and equipment | 10 |
| Furniture and fixtures | 10 |
| Vehicles | 10 |
| Agricultural plantations | 2 to 10 |
The Tax Administration, at the request of the taxpayer, can adopt technically acceptable special depreciation methods in cases duly justified by the taxpayer. In addition, the Tax Administration can authorise, through general resolution, accelerated depreciation methods on new assets acquired by corporations with monetary activities requiring constant technological updates, higher installed production capacity, and productive reconversion processes in order to maintain and strengthen their competitive advantage.
## Goodwill
From an income tax perspective, the CIT Law states that goodwill is considered as a non-deductible expense.
## Start-up expenses
A company’s organisational expenses may be deducted in the tax year in which they are paid or credited, or, if they accumulate, in five consecutive tax years, starting from the date of start of productive operations, until the balance is exhausted.
Organisational expenses are those costs and expenses that are necessary to initiate the production of taxable income that, in accordance with the law, are deducted from gross income.
## Interest expenses
Interest and other financial expenses paid or incurred by the taxpayer during the fiscal year directly related to the management of their business and the creation of taxable income are deductible from gross income if those interest expenses are not capitalised.
Note that those interest expenses with rates that exceed the usual market rates will not be considered deductible expenses by the Tax Administration.
The Law on Strengthening Public Finances, Law number 9635 establishes a limit on the deduction of non-bank interest; said deduction is 20% of the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) for each tax period.
There is a temporary provision stating that, for the first year, the above-mentioned limit will be 30%, decreasing 2% each year until it reaches the 20% ultimate floor. The deductions limit established for every year is:
| **2021** | **2022** | **2023** | **2024** | **2025** | **2026** | **2027** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 30% | 30% | 28% | 26% | 24% | 22% | 20% |
## Bad debt
Manifestly uncollectible unpaid debt will be deductible if this debt is originated in habitual operations from the taxpayer's business and all legal actions towards its collection have been exercised.
## Charitable contributions
The Income Tax Law, Law number 7092 establishes a limit on donations of 10% of the net income calculated by the donor contributor, without considering the donation.
## Taxes
Regarding the income tax, penalties, interests over any tax obligation, all other expenses related to the company's habitual commercial activity will be considered deductible, if they can be properly proved.
In VAT´s case, tax credit can be accrued from expenses required for the company's habitual commercial activity, which means it can be offset against the debit balance.
Any other tax is able to have its own exception to non-deductibility, which may be established in its own special law.
## Net operating losses
With the changes made to the Income Tax Law Regulations by Executive Decree 41818, as of June 17, 2019, all companies that have tax losses in a fiscal period may deduct them in the following three fiscal periods. In the case of agricultural companies, the deduction may be made in the following five periods.
This section did not receive any modification when Executive Decree 43198 replaced the old regulation with the new one on December 17, 2021.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Corporations may claim deductions for royalties, technical and management service fees, and interest charges paid to foreign affiliates if they have withheld the proper tax (25% for royalties, franchises, and professional services and 15% for interest). However, the deductions for technical, management service fees, and royalties may not exceed 10% of gross sales in the aggregate if paid to the parent company.
