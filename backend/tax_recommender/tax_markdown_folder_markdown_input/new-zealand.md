# New Zealand
## Overview
Last reviewed - 20 December 2024
New Zealand, a country located in the South Pacific, comprises two major islands stretching north and south and separated by Cook Strait. Its capital city is Wellington. The two languages are English and Māori, and the currency is the New Zealand dollar (NZD).
New Zealand's real gross domestic product (GDP) decreased by 1.0% in the September 2024 quarter. Unemployment increased to 4.8% in the September 2024 quarter, while the consumer price index (CPI) increased by 2.2% for the year to September 2024. Annual inflation is therefore within the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's target range of 1% to 3%.
The minimum hourly wage is NZD 23.15 as of 1 April 2024, increasing to NZD 23.50 as of 1 April 2025.
