### Tax credit for education expenses

### Tax credit for insurance premiums
The tax credit rate is 12% for qualified insurance premiums paid for the following types of insurance (beneficiary can be either the taxpayer or the dependants who have no income for the year): life insurance, life insurance for the handicapped, damage and accident insurance, fire and burglary insurance, and insurance similar thereto. The maximum tax credit is KRW 120,000 *per annum*. The national health insurance and unemployment insurance premiums shall be fully tax deductible.
### Tax credit for medical expenses
The tax credit rate is 15% for medical expenses paid up to KRW 7 million, but only if they exceed 3% of total employment income. However, medical expenses paid for taxpayers, dependants aged 65 or older, or the handicapped, are not subject to the KRW 7 million limit for the tax credit. With effect from 1 January 2024, the limit will no longer apply to medical expenses paid for children aged six or younger.
### Tax credit for individual pension premium
The tax credit rate is 12% for the pension premium paid up to KRW 9 million *per annum*. However, the tax credit rate becomes 15% for the taxpayer whose income is less than KRW 45 million *per annum*.

## Personal deductions
Korean tax law provides all resident taxpayers with the following standard personal deductions from individual taxable income.
### Basic deductions
* For the taxpayer: KRW 1.5 million per year. Non-residents of Korea are allowed to claim only the personal deduction for themselves.
* For a spouse who lives with the taxpayer and has an adjusted gross income of less than KRW 1 million *per annum*: KRW 1.5 million per year.
* For each eligible dependant who lives with the taxpayer and has an adjusted gross income of less than KRW 1 million *per annum*: KRW 1.5 million per year.
### Additional deductions
* Handicapped person in the taxpayer's household: KRW 2 million for each handicapped person. The handicapped person may be the taxpayer, spouse, or other dependants.
* Person aged 70 or older: KRW 1 million for each taxpayer, spouse, or dependant aged 70 or older in the taxpayer’s household.
* Female taxpayer: KRW 500,000. To qualify for this additional deduction, the female taxpayer should be a head of household with dependants but no spouse or should be a married woman, and the qualifying female taxpayer should have an annual taxable income of KRW 30 million or less (approximately KRW 40 million in total annual compensation).
* Single parent: KRW 1 million. In case a single parent claims the female taxpayer deduction above, only the single parent deduction of KRW 1 million is allowed.
## Business deductions
All business-related expenses, such as moving expenses, travel expenses, automobile expenses, and certain amounts of entertainment expenses, are tax deductible. Alternatively, reimbursements for such expenses can be claimed by the business as deductible expenses and need not be included in the individual's taxable income.
## Losses
Business losses excluding rental losses are deductible against employment income, pension income, other income, interest income, and dividend income in order to calculate the tax base. Unused losses can be carried forward for ten years. However, rental losses are deducible against only rental income and unused rental losses can be carried forward for ten years.
Capital losses are deductible only against capital gains. Unused losses may not be carried forward.
