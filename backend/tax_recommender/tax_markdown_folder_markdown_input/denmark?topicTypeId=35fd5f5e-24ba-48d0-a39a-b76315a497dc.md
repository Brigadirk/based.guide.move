## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
An individual may be taxed in Denmark as having full tax liability to Denmark, as having limited tax liability to Denmark, or according to special expatriate rules or rules regarding work force hire.
Individuals who are residents in Denmark are subject to full tax liability (i.e. liable to tax on their worldwide income unless the individual is considered to be tax resident in another country according to a double taxation treaty [DTT]).
An individual who is fully tax resident in Denmark will, as a main rule, be taxed according to the ordinary tax scheme by up to 52.07% (55.90% including AM tax, which is also income tax for DTT purposes) in 2025. A number of deductions are applicable; consequently, the effective tax rate is lower in most cases.
An individual not fully tax liable may have limited tax liability to Denmark. Limited tax liability is restricted to income from Danish sources, listed in the Danish Tax at Source Act, Section 2, including:
* salary for work performed in Denmark paid by or on behalf of an employer with a legal venue in Denmark
* salary for work performed in Denmark where the stay exceeds 183 days within 12 months
* certain other types of personal income, including directors fees, pension distributions, and social security benefits
* remuneration covered by the special rules on hiring out personnel (*see Work force hire scheme below*)
* income arising from a business enterprise with a permanent establishment (PE)
* income from property located in Denmark
* dividends from Danish companies
* royalty income from Denmark, and
* remuneration for advisory assistance, under certain circumstances.
An individual with limited tax liability to Denmark will, as a main rule, be taxed by up to 52.07% (55.90%, including AM tax) on income from sources in Denmark in 2025.
## Personal income tax rates
Generally, individuals are subject to national income tax, municipal tax, labour market tax, and church tax (*all described below*).
When assessing the tax under the ordinary scheme, the following types of income apply:
* Personal income (salary, benefits in kind, self-employment income, pension income, etc.).
* Capital income (interest income, interest expenses, net taxable capital gain, etc.).
* Taxable income (personal income added to capital income and adjusted for certain itemised deductions).
* Share income (dividends, capital gains on shares).
* Property value (value of property situated in Denmark or abroad).
The different types of income are subject to different taxes and are consequently taxed with different rates. This also means that the value of a deduction differs depending on in which income the deduction can be made.
The tax rates are as follows:
| Taxes (2025) | Income basis | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| State taxes: |  |  |
| Bottom tax | Personal income | 12.01 |
| Local taxes: |  |  |
| Municipal tax (average) | Taxable income | 25.068 |
| Labour market tax | Personal income | 8.00 |
| Share tax: |  |  |
| 0 to 67,500 Danish kroner (DKK) | Share income | 27.00 |
| More than DKK 67,500 | Share income | 42.00 |
Note that tax bands and local taxes may be adjusted annually.
Altogether, the marginal tax rate cannot exceed 52.07% (2025). However, labour market tax, share tax, property value tax, and church tax are not comprised by this rule.
Net capital income is taxed at a rate up to 42% (in 2025). Negative net capital income and other allowances may be deducted but not with full effect.
## National taxes
### Bottom tax
The bottom tax base is represented by the personal income plus positive net capital income. Bottom tax implies a taxation of 12.01% (2025).
## Local taxes
### Municipal tax
Local income tax (municipal tax) is calculated on taxable income at a flat rate dependent on the municipality in question. The country average is 25.068% (2025).
## Labour market tax
Labour market tax amounts to 8% of the personal income.
## Share tax
Share income up to DKK 67,500 (2025) (DKK 135,000 for a married couple) is taxed at 27%. Share income in excess of this amount is taxed at 42%.
## Church tax
Church tax is imposed at a flat rate dependent on the municipality in question. The country average for church taxpayers is approximately 0.64% (2025). Church tax is imposed by municipalities and is only charged for members of the Danish State Church (Lutheran). When registering in Denmark, all individuals should explicitly state if they should not be comprised.
## Other income taxes
### Special expatriate scheme
As the labour market tax also applies, the combined tax rate is 32.84% each year during the 84-month period.
### Work force hire scheme
Note that there is particular focus from the tax authorities on the work force hires rules and compliance in general.
