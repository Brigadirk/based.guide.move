# Slovak Republic
## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
A tax resident of the Slovak Republic is subject to tax on worldwide income, irrespective of whether the income is remitted to the Slovak Republic.
A Slovak tax non-resident is liable to tax on Slovak-source income only. Slovak-source income includes income from work performed in the Slovak Republic, including director's fees, income from an independent business done through a permanent establishment (PE), and income from services carried out in the Slovak Republic. Slovak-source income also includes interest income, licence fees, and income from the sale or rental of property located in the Slovak Republic.
## Personal income tax rates
The tax rates applicable in Slovakia are as follows:
* The tax base of up to 176.8 times the subsistence level (i.e. EUR 48 441,43 for 2025) is subject to a 19% tax rate. The exceeding part of the tax base is taxed at 25%.
* Dividend income arising from profits before 2004 and between 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2023 is included in a specific tax base taxable at a 7% rate (if paid from abroad) and 7% withholding tax (WHT) if paid by a Slovak company. Dividend income arising from profits generated in 2024 is included in a specific tax base taxable at a 10% rate (if paid from abroad) and 10% withholding tax (WHT) if paid by a Slovak company. Dividend income arising from profits generated after 1 January 2025 will be subjected to 7% withholding tax (WHT).
* Income of constitutional authorities from dependent activity is, in addition to the tax calculated as listed above, subject to a special tax rate of 5%.
* Income from capital gains is included in a specific tax base taxable at a 19% rate.
## Local taxes on income
There are no local taxes on personal income in Slovakia.
