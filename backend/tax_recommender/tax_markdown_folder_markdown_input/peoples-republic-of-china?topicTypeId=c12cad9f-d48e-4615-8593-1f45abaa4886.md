## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Tax resident enterprises (TREs) are subject to corporate income tax (CIT) on their worldwide income. A non-TRE that has no establishment or place in China is taxed only on its China-source income. A non-TRE with an establishment or place in China shall pay CIT on income derived by such establishment or place from sources in China as well as income derived from outside China that effectively is connected with such establishment or place.
Under the CIT law, the standard tax rate is 25%.
A lower CIT rate is available for the following sectors/industries on a national basis:
* Qualified new/high tech enterprises are eligible for a reduced CIT rate of 15%. An enterprise has to fulfil a set of prescribed criteria and be subject to an assessment in order to qualify as a new/high tech enterprise.
* Encouraged designated key software enterprises and encouraged designated integrated circuits (IC) design enterprises are eligible for a reduced CIT rate of 10% after the first five years of CIT exemption.
* Qualified technology-advanced service enterprises are eligible for a reduced CIT rate of 15%. An enterprise has to fulfil a set of prescribed criteria and be subject to an assessment in order to qualify as a technology-advanced service enterprise.
* For qualified small and thin-profit enterprises, the annual taxable income up to 3 million yuan renminbi (CNY) (inclusive) is subject to an effective CIT rate of 5% from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2027.
* Qualified enterprises engaged in pollution prevention and control are eligible for a reduced preferential CIT rate of 15% from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2027.
A lower CIT rate is available in specific regions for specific sectors/industries as follows:
* From 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2030, encouraged enterprises in the Western Regions are eligible for a reduced preferential CIT rate of 15%.
* From 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2025, encouraged enterprises established in the Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Services Industry Cooperation Zone with operational substance are eligible for a reduced CIT rate of 15%.
