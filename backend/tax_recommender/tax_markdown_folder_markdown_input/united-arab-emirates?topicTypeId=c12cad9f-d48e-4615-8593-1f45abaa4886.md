# United Arab Emirates
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 21 February 2025
Under the Emirate-level tax decrees, income tax is payable under a progressive rate system, with rates up to 55%. However, in practice, these tax decrees have not been applied. Instead, branches of foreign banks are subject to income tax at a flat rate of 20% under separate Emirate-level bank decrees. Companies engaged in UAE oil and gas and petrochemical activities are subject to income tax at varying rates under their individual UAE concession agreements or fiscal letters.
The Federal UAE CT Law, which is effective for each taxable person’s new financial year beginning on or after 1 June 2023, is applicable across all Emirates and applies to all business and commercial activities, except to the following exempt persons (subject to conditions):
* UAE government entity.
* UAE government-controlled entity.
* Person engaged in an extractive business in the UAE.
* Person engaged in a non-extractive natural resource business in the UAE.
* Qualifying public benefit entity.
* Qualifying investment fund.
* Public pension or social security fund, or a private pension or social security fund that is subject to regulatory oversight of the competent authority in the state and that meets any other conditions that may be prescribed by the Minister.
* Juridical person incorporated in the state that is wholly owned and controlled by certain exempt persons.
* Any other person as may be determined in a decision issued by the Cabinet at the suggestion of the Minister.
UAE CT is applicable at the following rates:
| Taxable income | UAE CT rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| * Taxable income not exceeding 375,000 UAE dirham (AED). * Qualifying income of a Qualifying Free Zone Person (QFZP).\* | 0 |
| * Taxable income exceeding AED 375,000. * Non-qualifying income of a QFZP. | 9 |
\* *Please refer to Free Zones in the [Tax credits and incentives](united-arab-emirates/corporate/tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section**.*
* [Corporate - Significant developments](united-arab-emirates/corporate/significant-developments.html)
