# Turkey
## Overview
Last reviewed - 02 May 2024
Türkiye (hereafter Turkey), known officially as the Republic of Turkey, is a transcontinental Eurasian country. Its location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia makes Turkey a country of significant geostrategic importance. The capital of Turkey is Ankara, and the official currency is the Turkish lira (TRY). The official language of Turkey is Turkish.
The modern Republic of Turkey was established in 1923, with Mustafa Kemal Atatürk as its first president. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, constitutional republic. It has become increasingly integrated with the West through membership in organisations such as the Council of Europe, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and the G-20 major economies. Turkey began full membership negotiations with the European Union (EU) in 2005, having been an associate member of the European Economic Community (EEC) since 1963 and having reached a customs union agreement in 1995.
Turkey has also fostered close cultural, political, economic, and industrial relations with the Eastern world, particularly with the Middle East and the Turkic states of Central Asia, through membership in organisations such as the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO).
The Turkish economy, the 19th largest economy in the world , where he CAGR (Compound Average Growth Rate) realised was 5% over the last decade, With the latest figures, the size of the Turkish economy is 906 billion United States dollars (USD) as of year-end 2022, with a *per capita* GDP of USD 10,655.
In addition to its strong fundamentals, demographic structure; near-shoring and reshoring opportunities led foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows to Turkey to continue. Including real-estate investments, Turkey attracted USD 13 billion each year on average over the last ten years.
