# Guernsey, Channel Islands
## Overview
Last reviewed - 27 January 2025
The Channel Islands, located in the English Channel, are the last remnants of the medieval Dukedom of Normandy. Guernsey, which encompasses the 10 parishes on the Island of Guernsey as well as the islands of Herm, Jethou, Burhou, and Lihou, is a British Crown dependency. Alderney is the closest of the Channel Islands to France, as well as being the closest to England, and is part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey. The only parish of Alderney is the parish of St. Anne, which covers the whole island. The United Kingdom (UK) is constitutionally responsible for defence and international representation of the Channel Islands. The capitals of Guernsey and Alderney are St. Peter Port and St. Anne respectively. The official languages of Guernsey are English and French. The currency in Guernsey is the British pound sterling (GBP).
Financial services, including banking, fund management, and insurance, have a major influence on employment and the economy in Guernsey. There has been economic growth in the financial services, construction, retail, and public sectors. Low income taxes and death duties make Guernsey and Alderney a popular destination.
