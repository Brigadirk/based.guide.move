# Poland
## Overview
Last reviewed - 22 July 2024
Poland, situated in Central Europe, is bordered by Germany and the Czech Republic to the west, Slovakia to the south, Ukraine and Belarus to the east, and Lithuania and Russia to the north. Through the Baltic Sea, it has easy access to Scandinavia. Poland is divided into 16 provinces (*voivodeships*), with Warsaw as the capital. The official language is Polish, and the currency is the zloty (PLN).
Poland is a member of many international organisations, including the European Union (EU), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
Poland is a republic. The government of the Republic of Poland is based on the separation of and balance between the legislative, executive, and judicial powers. Legislative power is vested in the Sejm and the Senate, executive power is vested in the President of the Republic of Poland and the Council of Ministers, and judicial power is vested in the courts and tribunals.
The Polish public administrative system is based on the division into central and regional (self-government) administration. Local authorities are elected by citizens. The sources of universally binding law of the Republic of Poland are: the Constitution, legal acts, ratified international agreements, and regulations.
The courts and tribunals constitute a separate power and are independent of other branches of power. Judges are appointed for an indefinite period by the President and are not removable. Court proceedings have at least two stages.
The growth of Polish gross domestic product (GDP) in 2023 was 0.1%. In 2023, the net inflow of capital due to foreign direct investment amounted to USD 28.7 billion, down almost 9% compared to  2022 (USD 31.5 billion).
PwC Poland has over 6,000 staff that are located in Warsaw, Gdansk, Poznan, Cracow, Wroclaw, Katowice, Łódź, Lublin, and Opole. We provide assurance, consulting and deals, tax and legal, and technology services. We hire over 500 tax experts, including over 130 certified tax advisors, as well as legal counsels, advocates, and statutory auditors.
