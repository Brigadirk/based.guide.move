# Finland


## Corporate - Withholding taxes

Last reviewed - 24 January 2025

Finnish corporations paying certain types of income are required to apply a 20%, 15%, or 35% WHT on payments to foreign corporations and a 30% or 35% WHT on payments to non-resident individuals or other than corporate entities.

According to domestic legislation, interest paid to a non-resident is usually tax exempt in Finland.

No WHT is levied on dividend payments received by companies resident in the EU/EEA, which would have been tax-free if paid to a Finnish corporate body, if the WHT cannot be fully credited in the company’s country of residence.

Dividends paid to a company referred to in the EC Parent-Subsidiary Directive, owning at least 10% of the capital of the dividend distributing company, are also tax exempt.

The domestic WHT rate may be 15% (or lower under a relevant tax treaty) in cases where the shares of the distributing company belong to the investment assets of the non-resident beneficiary of dividends and if certain prerequisites are met.

*See the table below for WHT rates on dividends and other payments from Finland to non-residents*.

For countries not included in the table, the WHT rate is 20% (corporate entity) and 30% (individual or other than corporate entity).

Note that each tax treaty should be studied carefully because there are often exceptions to general rules.
