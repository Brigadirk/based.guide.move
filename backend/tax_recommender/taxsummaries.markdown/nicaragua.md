# Nicaragua


## Overview

Last reviewed - 19 December 2024

Nicaragua is the largest country in Central America, bordered by Honduras to the north, Costa Rica to the south, the Pacific Ocean to the west, and the Caribbean Sea to the east. It became an independent republic in 1838, and Managua is the capital city. The official language of Nicaragua is Spanish, and its currency is the Nicaraguan córdoba oro (NIO).

Currently, 70.9% of the population is younger than 40, and elementary, high school, and university education are mandatory, the first two being free. There is one Nicaraguan branch of a United States university that has been accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). The Nicaraguan government is increasing funding to improve educational opportunities in the country and has promoted increased enrolment in universities.

All schools, including elementary and high school, are under the general supervision and regulation of the National Ministry of Education.

In early 2004, Nicaragua secured 4.5 billion United States dollars (USD) in foreign debt reduction under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, and, in October 2007, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a new poverty reduction and growth facility (PRGF) program.

Nicaraguan expects an increase in the gross domestic product (GDP) of between 3.5% and 4.5% in 2024, after having experienced a 4.6 % increase in 2023. The above contrasts with the decrease of -1.8% in 2020, and the increase of 10.3% in 2021, but is in line with the 2022 growth of 3.8%. The US-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) has been in effect since April 2006 and has expanded export opportunities for many agricultural and manufactured goods. Textiles and apparel account for nearly 60% of Nicaragua's exports.
