# Ghana


## Overview

Last reviewed - 03 December 2024

Ghana is a country located in West Africa, bordered by the Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire) to the west, Burkina Faso to the north, Togo to the east, and the Gulf of Guinea to the south. Formed from the merger of the British colony of the Gold Coast and the Togoland trust territory, Ghana, in 1957, became the first sub-Saharan country in colonial Africa to gain its independence. Ghana is divided into 16 regions, and its capital is Accra. The official language of Ghana is English, and the currency is the Ghana cedi (GHS).

Well-endowed with natural resources, Ghana has roughly twice the *per capita* output of other countries in the West Africa sub-region. In terms of its political terrain, Ghana has a stable multiparty constitutional democracy founded on elections by open and free universal adult suffrage. The country has witnessed three smooth transitions of change of governments in the current democratic dispensation. The main arms of government are the Executive, Legislature, and Judiciary, each of which is independent of the other. At the local level, the District Assemblies are to be the highest political and administrative authority in each district, with deliberative, executive, and legislative powers.

Gold, cocoa, and oil productions, as well as remittances from citizens working abroad, are the major sources of foreign currency.

Ghana’s domestic economy continues to revolve around agriculture, which accounts for more than a third of gross domestic product (GDP) and employs more than half of the workforce, mainly small landholders.

### PwC Ghana

PwC is one of the largest professional services firms in Ghana. In 2013, PwC Ghana opened a branch office in Sierra Leone. The Ghana firm has over 400 employees and 18 resident partners providing audit, assurance, tax, and advisory services to our clients across the country.

The Tax Line of Service provides direct tax services to companies and individuals, including strategic tax planning services, tax advisory services, lobbying government agencies and regulatory authorities, salary planning, payroll management and international assignment services, transfer pricing services, withholding tax (WHT) management, and indirect tax products, such as value-added tax (VAT) advisory and compliance services. Services around customs and excise duties are also provided. Further, PwC Ghana is involved in several thought leadership initiatives, such as seminars on taxes in various industries and contributing to the national budget through our pre-budget and post-budget forums.
