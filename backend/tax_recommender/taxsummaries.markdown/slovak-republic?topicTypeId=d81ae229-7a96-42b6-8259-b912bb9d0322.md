# Slovak Republic


## Corporate - Withholding taxes

Last reviewed - 06 February 2025

Mainly, the following payments are subject to WHT when made by Slovak companies to foreign parties. Dividends are also subject to tax, effective as of 1 January 2017 (subject to specific rules - if paid to private individuals). However, a DTT may reduce or eliminate the rate.

| Payments | WHT (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Fees for services | 19/35 |
| Royalties \* | 19/35 |
| Interest on loans and deposits \* | 19/35 |
| Dividends \*\* | 7/10/19/35 |

\* Royalties and interest paid to related EU-resident companies are not subject to WHT if certain conditions are met.

\*\* Dividends paid out of profits arising from 2004 to 2016 are not subject to Slovak WHT (subject to anti-avoidance provisions). *Please see Dividend income in the Corporate* [*Income determination*](slovak-republic%3FtopicTypeId=acb0dfca-7ffb-4322-9fd9-f9f8521a016c.html) *and Individual [Income determination](slovak-republic/individual/income-determination.html) sections*.

A 35% WHT rate applies on payments to taxpayers from non-cooperative jurisdictions (i.e. where no DTT or TIEA exists, the taxpayer is from a jurisdiction that is listed in the EU's List of Non-Cooperating Countries or a state that does not apply CIT, or a zero CIT rate applies) or where the beneficial owners of the income cannot be identified.

Service fees may be subject to tax in Slovakia only if the service is provided in the territory of Slovakia or if paid for by a Slovak tax resident.

WHT should be paid to the Tax Office no later than 15 days from the end of the calendar month following that in which the payment was made. The withholding obligation lies with the Slovak resident taxpayer. The taxpayer must also notify the tax administrator of the tax withheld and transferred. If the tax is not properly withheld, the unpaid tax becomes the Slovak tax resident’s tax liability, and a penalty may be assessed.

This table highlights countries with which Slovakia has entered into a DTT.
