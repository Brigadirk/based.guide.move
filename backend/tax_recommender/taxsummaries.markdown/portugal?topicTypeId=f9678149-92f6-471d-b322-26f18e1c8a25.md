# Portugal


## Individual - Other taxes

Last reviewed - 20 February 2025

## Social security contributions

### Employees

Social security contributions are shared by the employee and the employer. In general terms, the contributions are due on the employee’s gross remuneration at rates of 11% and 23.75% by the employee and the employer, respectively. These contributions cover family, pension, and unemployment benefits.

In addition to social security contributions at a general rate of 23.75%, employers must buy an insurance premium to cover occupational accidents. The premium varies according to work and risk classification.

### Members of the board

Regarding members of the board, the social security rates correspond to 9.3% with respect to the individual contributions and 20.3% for employer contributions. However, the contribution rate applicable to members of statutory boards who are considered as managers or administrators is set at rates of 23.75% and 11% to employers and members of statutory boards, respectively. The contributions of members of statutory boards are based on their effective remuneration but subject to a monthly minimum income level of EUR 522.50.

Members of statutory boards who are considered as managers or administrators, and some types of self-employees, become entitled to protection in the event of unemployment.

### Self-employees

The contributions rate applicable to self-employees corresponds to 21.4%. For self-employees under the simplified tax regime, the monthly contribution basis corresponds to 1/3 of the relevant remuneration determined in each reporting period and produces effects in that month and in the following two months. For the determination of the relevant remuneration of the self-employee, it is considered the income received in the three months previously to the reporting month. The relevant remuneration corresponds to 70% of the income from services rendered and to 20% of the income related to the production and sales of products.

The basis of contributions considered in each month has a limit of 12 times the IAS.

A 10% contribution rate is due by employers if 80% or more of the fees earned by the self-employee come from services for the same company, for the same person with a business activity, or to the same group. A 7% contribution rate is due by employers when the economic dependence of the self-employee varies between 50% and 80%. The contribution is payable upon the issue of a tax assessment by the social security authorities.

In 2025, the Portuguese monthly minimum wage is EUR 870.

## Consumption taxes

### Value-added tax (VAT)

There are three VAT rates: the standard rate of 23% (22% in the Autonomous Region of Madeira; 16% in the Autonomous Region of the Azores), the intermediate rate of 13% (12% in Madeira; 9% in the Azores), and the reduced rate of 6% (4% in Madeira and in the Azores). *See the [Other taxes](portugal%3FtopicTypeId=399bcbae-2967-429b-b371-99be91a47b34.html) section in the Corporate tax summary for more information.*

## Net wealth/worth taxes

There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Portugal.

## Inheritance and gift taxes

Free acquisition of goods by individuals (inheritance and gifts) is taxed under the stamp tax at 10%.

Donation of property is subject to an additional rate of 0.8%.

## Property taxes

Municipal property tax is charged on the registered value of real estate. *See the [Other taxes](portugal%3FtopicTypeId=399bcbae-2967-429b-b371-99be91a47b34.html) section in the Corporate tax summary for more information.*
