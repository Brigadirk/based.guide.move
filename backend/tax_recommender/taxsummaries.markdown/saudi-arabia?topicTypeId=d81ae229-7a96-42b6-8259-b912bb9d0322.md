# Saudi Arabia


## Corporate - Withholding taxes

Last reviewed - 21 July 2024

Payments made from a resident party or a PE to a non-resident party for services performed are subject to WHT. The rates vary between 5%, 15%, and 20% based on the type of service.

The WHT should be paid within the first ten days of the month following the month during which the payment was made.

The domestic rate for WHT is 5% on dividends, 5% on interest, and 15% on royalties.

## Tax treaties

Saudi Arabia has entered into tax treaties with several countries. Treaties currently or about to be effective are listed below.

DTTs have not yet been effectively tested in Saudi Arabia. However, they generally follow the OECD Model Treaty and may provide certain relief, including WHT on dividends, interest, and royalties.

The following are the treaty WHT rates for payments made from Saudi Arabia to treaty country recipients. Each tax treaty should be studied carefully because there could be exceptions to the general rules.

ZATCA offers a choice of automatic application of relevant tax treaty without going through the refund procedure. The choice is given to Saudi Arabia residents or PEs of non-residents that make payments subject to WHT in Saudi Arabia.

They can apply reduced rates or full relief upon making the payment. The following conditions are imposed on taxpayers that choose to apply DTT automatically:

* Report, via monthly WHT returns, the full details of each payment made to non-resident parties (beneficiaries).
* Still file a request form for application of DTT together with tax residence certificate of the beneficiary.
* Undertake full responsibility for any understatement of tax, including penalties.

As mentioned above, ZATCA provides a choice; taxpayers can still withhold tax and comply with the refund procedure.
