## Corporate - Withholding taxes

Last reviewed - 18 December 2024

A foreign corporation with income derived from sources in Korea is subject to normal CIT rates on such income if it has a Korean PE. If a foreign corporation has no PE in Korea, it will be subject to tax on its Korean-source income on a withholding basis in accordance with the tax laws and the relevant tax treaty, if applicable.

With effect from 1 January  2023, non-residents or foreign corporations without a PE in Korea and a qualified overseas financial institution (as approved by the Korean tax authority) are exempt from WHT on Korean-source interest income and capital gains derived from government bonds, currency stabilisation bonds, and other bonds specified in the Enforcement Decree of the CITL. The non-resident or foreign corporation and qualified overseas financial institution must file an application with a district tax office to receive the tax exemption. Where a Korean resident or a domestic corporation is included among the investors in an overseas collective investment vehicle that meets the requirements specified in the CITL and its Enforcement Decree, the domestic investors must file and pay tax directly on the interest income and capital gains that are exempt from WHT.

For a tax resident of a country having a tax treaty with Korea, reduced WHT rates may apply to Korean-source income, subject to the substance-over-form principles of Korean tax laws. An application form and documents supporting the substantive ownership of the Korean-source income must be submitted by a foreign entity to the Korean entity paying the income (acting as a withholding agent) in order to apply the treaty rate. The documentation requirement for the substantive ownership shall apply to application for a reduced tax treaty rate on or after 1 January 2023. If such application is not provided or a substantive owner of Korean-source income cannot be identified in the submitted documents, the withholding agent should withhold income tax at the non-treaty rate under the Korean tax laws.

For dividends, interest, and royalties, the WHT rates are limited as follows:

| Recipient | WHT (%) | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dividends | Interest | Royalties |
