The heat map above shows each territory in a color corresponding to its highest statutory CIT rate (inclusive of surtaxes and exclusive of local taxes). The color key is based on CIT rate percentage. Clicking a region will then allow you to hover over and/or click a territory. Hovering over a territory will provide that territory's highest statutory CIT rate. Clicking a territory will take you to that territory's 'Taxes on corporate income' page.

Note that the rate applicable to a majority of industries is used for heat map purposes if rates are industry-specific. If rates are based on resident status, then the resident rate is used for heat map purposes. If a territory does not have a CIT, then a rate of 0% is used for heat map purposes. In instances where the highest statutory CIT rate cannot be easily defined, the territory color will be grey (but can still be viewed by hovering over it).





NA stands for Not Applicable (i.e. the territory does not have the indicated tax or requirement)

NP stands for Not Provided (i.e. the information is not currently provided in this chart)

All information in this chart is up to date as of the 'Last reviewed' date on the corresponding territory Overview page.
