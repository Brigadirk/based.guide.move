The heat map above shows each territory in a color corresponding to its standard VAT rate. The color key is based on VAT rate percentage. Clicking a region will then allow you to hover over and/or click a territory. Hovering over a territory will provide that territory's standard VAT rate. Clicking a territory will take you to that territory's 'Other taxes' page.  

  

Note that in instances where a territory has a consumption tax similar to a VAT (e.g. GST, sales tax, turnover tax), that rate is used. If a territory does not have a VAT or similar tax, then a rate of 0% is used for heat map purposes. In instances where the standard VAT rate cannot be easily defined, the territory color will be grey (but can still be viewed by hovering over it).





NA stands for Not Applicable (i.e. the territory does not have the indicated tax or requirement)

NP stands for Not Provided (i.e. the information is not currently provided in this chart)

All information in this chart is up to date as of the 'Last reviewed' date on the corresponding territory Overview page. This chart has been prepared for general guidance on matters of interest only, and does not constitute professional advice. You should not act upon the information contained in this chart without obtaining specific professional advice.
