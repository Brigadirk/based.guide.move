# Moldova


## Overview

Last reviewed - 20 January 2025

The Republic of Moldova is a small and densely populated landlocked country in Eastern Europe, located between Romania to the west and Ukraine to the north, east, and south, which gained its independence in 1991. Chisinau, the capital of Moldova, is situated in the centre of the country, has a population of around 891,725 people, and represents the cultural, political, and economic hub of the country. The currency of Moldova is the leu (MDL), and the main spoken language is Romanian.

Moldova is a democratic republic, based on the rule of law. Its legal framework is based mainly on statutory law. Under the Constitution, Moldova undertakes to respect the treaties and conventions to which it is party.

As of 27 June 2014, the Republic of Moldova ratified the Association Agreement with the European Union (EU) that fully entered into force as of 1 July 2016. Consequently, Moldova should gradually harmonise local legislation with the provisions of EU law. As of 23 June 2022, Moldova has been granted EU candidate status. Moldova set a target date of 2030 for EU accession.

On 14 December 2023, the European Council decided to open accession negotiations with Moldova. It is one of nine current EU candidate countries, together with Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, Turkey, and Ukraine.

From January to September 2024, the gross domestic product (GDP) of Moldova totalled MDL 233.1 billion, which represents an increase of 0.6 % in real terms compared to the same period of 2023.

Overseen by 27 partners and employing over 1,237 specialists and support staff, PwC operates in Romania and Moldova. PwC Moldova was established in Moldova in 1996 and currently has 124 local professionals specialised in different areas, of which 11 are tax and legal advisory experts. We have continuously expanded our scope of services and currently offer a full range of professional services to both international and Moldovan enterprises. Our client base includes some of the largest Moldovan and multinational companies in Moldova. Our close interactions with economic and state bodies allow us to keep up with the fast-changing environment in which businesses work in Moldova.

To meet the needs of Moldova's key industries, which include financial services, energy and utilities, industrial products, pharmaceuticals, retail and consumer, technology, information, communications, and entertainment, PwC Moldova has dedicated industry professionals who understand the unique challenges of these industries and work with companies in order to help them to improve their efficiency and effectiveness.

PwC Moldova's tax and legal advisory practice is comprised of international and local tax experts as well as customs, value-added tax (VAT), individual taxation, and human resources specialists. As the country's largest tax consulting department, we are specialised in all areas of tax, including corporate taxation, indirect taxation, and integrated personnel solutions.
