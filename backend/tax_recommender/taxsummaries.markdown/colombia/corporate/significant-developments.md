# Colombia


## Corporate - Significant developments

Last reviewed - 06 February 2025

## Tax Reform (Law 2277 of December 2022) passed and enacted

### Corporate taxation

* General corporate income tax (CIT) rate remains unchanged (35%).
* Drawing from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)-propelled Pillar II, but certainly broader in scope and goals, a minimum effective tax rate (METR) of 15% is introduced beginning in 2023 for resident corporations (a few industries are exempted).
* A permanent surcharge is introduced for crude oil and coal extraction and production industry players with taxable income equal to or greater than over 471,000 United States dollars (USD) of up to 15%.
* A temporary surcharge of 3% is introduced for hydro-electric power companies with taxable income equal to or greater than 30.000 tax units (Approx. USD 347.434) for years 2023 to 2026.
* The preferential 20% rate for other qualified Free Trade Zone (FTZ) companies will survive for qualified taxpayers until 2022 and during the term of the initially granted qualification. For new qualified taxpayers, the 20% rate is subject to an export-oriented plan.
* Starting from fiscal year (FY) 2023, capital gains tax increases from 10% to 15% for residents and non-residents.
* Industry and Trade Tax remains as 100% CIT deductible.
* Certain non-taxable income items, special deductions, exempt income, and tax credits are to be capped at 3% of the taxpayer's net income before their subtraction.
* Starting from FY 2023, profits from the sale of stock listed on the Colombian Stock Exchange, if owned by the same owner, and provided it is not more than 3% (down from 10%) of the total outstanding shares of the listed company in the taxable year, will continue to be treated as non-taxable income.
* Starting from FY 2023, effective place of management (EPOM) rules are broadened and will operate around less subjective tests to include scrutiny over the place where day-to-day activities are carried out, as well as the place where management usually exercises authority and responsibility over the entity’s affairs.
* Starting from FY 2024, a significant economic presence (SEP) rule is unilaterally introduced whereby the sale of goods or provision of digital services into Colombia will attract withholding tax (WHT) at 10% or, at the election of the provider, a 3% tax (over gross revenues) will apply subject to registration and an annual income tax filing. Exceeding a revenue cap of 31.300 tax units (Approx. USD 363.000) per year, as well as a 300,000 customer/user threshold, opens the door to eligibility for SEP.
* Starting from FY 2023, dividend tax will rise to 20% (up from 10%). Dividends paid out of untaxed profits will be taxed at 35%, and 20% will be imposed on the net (effective tax rate of 48%).

### Corrective taxes

#### Carbon tax

Starting from FY 2023, the scope of the existing carbon tax is broadened to include the sale, self-consumption, and importation of coal (certain exemptions apply, including coal for export). Rates will rise while continuing to be specific values per ton, gallon, or cubic square. A phased approach is introduced for rates for coal from 2023 thru 2027. Carbon tax will be deductible for income tax purposes.

#### Tax on single-use plastics used for packing and wrapping

An excise tax will be imposed on the sale, withdrawal, or import for self-consumption of single-use plastic products for packing and wrapping goods (certain exemptions apply). The manufacturer or importer is to be the taxpayer. A rate for specific value per gram is to be applied. This tax will not be deductible for income tax purposes.

#### Tax on sugar-rich ultra-processed drinks

A newly introduced excise tax will apply beginning November 2023 on the sale by producers and import of self-consumption of select sugar-rich beverages (certain exemptions apply), subject to rate based on specific value of millilitres, and will be deductible for income tax purposes.

#### Tax on sugar and sodium-rich ultra-processed food

A 10% excise tax (15% in 2024 and 20% from 2025) will be imposed beginning November 2023 on the production, import, and self-consumption of sugar and sodium-rich ultra-processed food products. In scope items will include, among other, those under tariff classification 04.04.90.00.00, 16.01, 16.02, 17.04. Individuals that are small-sized producers (revenue not in excess of 10.000 tax units (Approx. USD 115.000) will be out of scope.
