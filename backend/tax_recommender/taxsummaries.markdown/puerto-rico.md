# Puerto Rico


## Overview

Last reviewed - 10 November 2023

Puerto Rico, located in the Caribbean Sea, is an archipelago that includes the main island of Puerto Rico and a number of smaller islands. The capital of Puerto Rico is San Juan, the official languages are English and Spanish, and the currency is the United States dollar (USD).

Puerto Rico is a Commonwealth of the United States. Puerto Ricans were granted US citizenship in 1917. In 1952, a constitution was enacted providing for internal self-government.

Puerto Rico has one of the most dynamic economies in the Caribbean region. A diverse industrial sector has far surpassed agriculture as the primary locus of economic activity and income. Encouraged by duty-free access to the United States and by tax incentives, US firms have invested heavily in Puerto Rico since the 1950s. Tourism has traditionally been an important source of income, with estimated arrivals of more than 5.2 million tourists in 2017.

PwC Puerto Rico supports clients with the local knowledge, including tax knowledge, and skills of its people and with access to a broad range of other professionals across the PwC global network of firms. PwC Puerto Rico serves a variety of industries, including manufacturing, pharmaceutical, technology, professional services, retail, insurance, and communications, among others.
