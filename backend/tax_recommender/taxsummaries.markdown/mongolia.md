# Mongolia


## Overview

Last reviewed - 06 January 2025

Mongolia, a landlocked country in north-central Asia, is bordered by China and Russia. The country is known for its vast, rugged expanses and nomadic culture. The country is a vibrant democracy and has experienced remarkable economic growth, tripling its gross domestic product per capita in real terms over the past 30 years. With a young and highly literate population and abundant natural resources, Mongolia holds tremendous economic growth potential. The nation is divided into 21 provinces, with Ulaanbaatar as its capital. The official language is Mongolian, and the national currency is the Mongolian tugrik (MNT).

Historically, Mongolia's economy was primarily based on agriculture. Today, it is rich in mineral resources and is recognised by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as one of 29 resource-rich developing countries. The principal reserves mined in Mongolia include coal, copper, and gold. The mining sector is expected to grow further, driven by rising commodity prices, foreign investment, and Mongolia’s strategic proximity to China, a major global consumer of mining products.

Looking ahead, Mongolia's economic growth is projected to reach 5.0% in 2024 according to state authority in Mongolia, supported by the commencement of underground operations at the Oyu Tolgoi mine and the implementation of the New Revival Policy, which includes strategies for Port, Energy, and Industrial Revival.
