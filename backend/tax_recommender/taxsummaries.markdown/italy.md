# Italy


## Overview

Last reviewed - 10 February 2025

Italy, which is located along the Mediterranean Sea in Southern Europe, became a nation-state in 1861 when the regional states of the peninsula (along with Sardinia and Sicily, the two largest islands in the Mediterranean Sea) were united under the Kingdom of Italy. After the Second World War, in 1946, a popular referendum abolished the monarchy and proclaimed Italy a parliamentary republic.

Italy is composed of 20 administrative regions, with Rome as the capital. It has a population of about 60 million, and its territory covers about 301,000 square kilometres. The official language of Italy is Italian, and the currency is the euro (EUR).

Italy has a diversified economy, which is divided into a developed industrial north, featuring many private companies, and a less-developed south. The economy is driven in large part by the manufacture of high-quality consumer goods produced by small and medium-sized enterprises, many of which are family owned. Due to its archaeological and artistic heritage, tourism is one of the most important sectors.

Italy is a founding member of the European Economic Community (EEC) and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). It is also a member state of the United Nations (UN), World Trade Organization (WTO), and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

PwC Italy supports clients with the local knowledge and skills of its people and with access to a broad range of other professionals across the PwC global network of firms.

In particular, PwC Tax & Legal has 19 offices in Italy with more than 980 professionals and is active in local and international markets providing tax and legal services. The covered areas are: corporate income tax, indirect tax, international tax, legal, mergers and acquisitions, tax accounting, tax controversy and dispute resolution, transfer pricing, etc.
