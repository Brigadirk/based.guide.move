# Honduras


## Overview

Last reviewed - 20 January 2025

Honduras, strategically located in the heart of Central America, is bordered by Guatemala to the west, El Salvador to the southwest, Nicaragua to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the north, and the Pacific Ocean to the south. Honduras is divided into 18 departments. While its political capital is Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula is the industrial capital due to its contribution to the country's economy. The official language of Honduras is Spanish, and the currency is the lempira (HNL).

Honduras is a distribution centre, with Puerto Cortés as the main seaport in Central America. The economy relies heavily on a range of exports, notably apparel, bananas, and coffee. However, it has emerging sectors in agriculture, textile, light manufacturing, sustainable tourism, and business services. The United States-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) entered into force in 2006 and has helped foster investment in this country. The economy expects to register positive economic growth in 2025.

PwC InterAmericas is a regional entity comprised of seven firms: PwC Guatemala, PwC El Salvador, PwC Honduras, PwC Nicaragua, PwC Costa Rica, PwC Panama, and PwC Dominican Republic. Together, we have over 1,000 professionals ready to provide our clients with audit, tax, legal, and consulting services. PwC InterAmericas firms are backed by over 40 years of experience rendering a high standard of professional services to the private sector, public sector, and non-profits. PwC Honduras supports clients with the local knowledge and skills of its people and with access to a broad range of other professionals across the PwC global network of firms.
