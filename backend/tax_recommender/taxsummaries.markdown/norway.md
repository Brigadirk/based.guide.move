# Norway


## Overview

Last reviewed - 14 January 2025

Norway is a country in Northern Europe occupying the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula. The capital city of Norway is Oslo. Norwegian is the official language of Norway, and the Norwegian krone (NOK) is the currency.

Norway has a parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy type of government, wherein the King is the head of state and the Prime Minister is the head of government. Norway's well-established monarchy has had an uninterrupted chain of successors to the throne since 1905, and is currently led by King Harald V.

In 1949, Norway became a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The discovery of petroleum in adjacent waters in the late 1960s boosted Norway's economic fortunes. In referenda held in 1972 and 1994, Norway rejected joining the European Union (EU). However, Norway is a member of the European Economic Area (EEA).

The Norwegian government controls key areas, such as the vital petroleum sector and the major hydropower producers, through large-scale, publicly-majority-owned enterprises.

Norway is richly endowed with natural resources, such as petroleum, hydro power, fish, forests, and minerals, and is highly dependent on the oil and gas sector, which accounts for approximately half of the total value of Norway’s exports of goods. Norway is the world's third largest exporter of natural gas and one of the world's largest oil exporters.

Gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to increase by 0.8% in 2024.

PwC Norway has more than 2,500 employees in 27 offices offering auditing, consulting, tax, and value-added tax (VAT) services. We support our clients with the local knowledge and skills of our people and provide access to a broad range of professionals across the PwC global network. Our employees specialise in areas such as oil and gas, hydro power, financial industry, shipping, energy, fisheries, and telecom.
