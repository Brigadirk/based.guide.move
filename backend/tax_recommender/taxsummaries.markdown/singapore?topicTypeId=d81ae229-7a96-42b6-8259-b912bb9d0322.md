# Singapore


## Corporate - Withholding taxes

Last reviewed - 30 May 2024

Certain payments to non-residents are subject to WHT.

Unless a lower treaty rate applies, interest on loans and rentals from movable property are subject to WHT at the rate of 15%. Royalty payments are subject to WHT at the rate of 10%. The tax withheld represents a final tax and applies only to non-residents that are not carrying on any business in Singapore and have no PE in Singapore. Technical assistance and management fees for services rendered in Singapore by non-resident companies are taxed at the prevailing corporate rate. However, this is not a final tax. Royalties, interest, rental of movable property, technical assistance, and management fees can be exempt from WHT in certain situations or subject to a reduction in tax rates, usually under fiscal incentives or DTAs.

Payments made to public entertainers and non-resident professionals who perform services in Singapore are also subject to a final tax of 15% on their gross income. For public entertainers, this appears to be a final tax unless they qualify to be taxed as Singapore tax residents. However, non-resident professionals may elect to be taxed at the prevailing tax rate for non-resident individuals of 24% on net income if this results in a lower tax cost.

Ship charter fee payments are not subject to WHT.

The WHT rates are shown in the following table.

Notes

1. Singapore has no WHT on dividends over and above the tax on the profits out of which the dividends are declared. However, some treaties provide for a maximum WHT on dividends should Singapore impose such a WHT in the future.
2. The non-treaty rates (a final tax) apply only to non-residents who do not carry on business in Singapore and who do not have a PE in Singapore. This rate may be further reduced by tax incentives.
3. Interest:

   2. Exempt if paid to the government.
   3. Lower rate or exemption if paid by an approved industrial undertaking.

   9. Exempt if paid by a financial institution.
   10. Exempt if paid by the government.
   11. Exempt if paid in respect of a loan that is guaranteed or insured by the government.
   12. Exempt if paid in respect of any debt instrument listed on a recognised stock exchange.
   13. Exempt if received by the government or a financial institution, received from and paid by a company (other than a partnership), or paid in respect of a loan, debt-claim, or credit that is guaranteed or insured by the government.
   14. Exempt if paid in connection with the sale on credit of any industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment, or merchandise.
   15. Exempt if paid by an enterprise to another enterprise.
   16. Excludes interest on funds directly connected with the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic.
   17. Lower rate if paid to a bank for a loan of at least five years for the financing of equipment or of investment projects.
4. Royalties:
