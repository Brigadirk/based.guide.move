## Corporate - Withholding taxes

Last reviewed - 31 December 2024

Ordinarily, WHT is the mechanism by which the Spanish tax authorities collect the final tax levied on non-residents. In the case of resident beneficiaries, however, it is simply an advance payment of a tax that is then normally self-assessed by the resident taxpayer in the final annual tax return.

The advance payment system of WHT for resident beneficiaries referred to above also applies if non-resident companies/individuals not established in Spain sell their title to Spanish real estate. In this case, the acquirer of the real estate must levy a 19% WHT on the selling price on account of the tax chargeable to the seller on its capital gain. Other capital gains (for instance, from a sale by a non-resident of a substantial interest in a Spanish company where neither a DTT nor internal rules establish a tax exemption) are taxed in the hands of the non-resident transferor, but the mechanics of levying the tax are not those of a WHT. In this case, the non-resident’s tax is paid directly, through its representative or by the depositor or manager of the assets in question, if any.

The following table states the general WHT rates on income obtained by resident/non-resident companies. The main characteristics of the rates for each type of income are stated in footnotes to the table. Always refer to specific treaties to ensure the values are up-to-date and check the potential impact of the MLI which has not been included in the different treaties.

As a general rule, corporate shareholders with at least a 5% interest held for at least one year may apply this tax exemption on the dividends received.
   2. For residents of other EU member states or EEA countries with which there is an effective exchange of tax information, the rate is 19%.

2. 1. The 19% WHT rate does not apply if, amongst other cases, the recipient is a resident bank or savings or other financial institution subject to CIT, provided that this income is not portfolio income.

   2. A 19% WHT rate is levied on income generated under royalty and technical assistance agreements that constitutes an economic activity from leases or from the granting of rights when ownership is not transferred.

3. 1. Transposition of the EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive into Spanish law gives EU shareholders a WHT exemption on dividends from Spanish companies, subject to compliance with certain requirements. Luxembourg recipients of income that are companies under paragraph 1 of the Protocol to the Tax Treaty with Spain (holding companies) do not qualify for this exemption.
   2. In accordance with Spanish internal Non-Resident Income Tax regulations dividends paid by subsidiary companies resident in Spanish territory to their parent companies resident in other Member States of the European Union or to the permanent establishments of the latter located in other Member States shall be exempt from IRNR and therefore not subject to WHT, provided the following requirements are met:

* That both companies are subject to, and not exempt from, any of the taxes that tax the profits of legal entities in the Member States of the European Union, mentioned in article 2.c) of the Parent-Subsidiary Directive.
* That the distribution of profits does not result from the liquidation of the subsidiary company.
* That both companies take any of the forms provided for in the Annex to the Directive. A parent company shall be considered to be an entity that holds a direct or indirect stake in the capital of another company of at least 5 percent uninterruptedly for at least one year.

The exemption will not be applicable when the parent company is resident for tax purposes in a tax haven or when the permanent establishment is located in a tax haven.

1. In accordance with Spanish internal Non-Resident Income Tax regulations royalties paid by a company resident in Spain or by a permanent establishment located in Spain of a company resident in another Member State of the European Union to a company resident in another Member State or to a permanent establishment located in another Member State of a company resident in a Member State shall be exempt from IRNR and therefore not subject to WHT when the following requirements are met:

* That both companies are subject to and not exempt from one of the taxes mentioned in article 3.a).iii) of the Interest and Royalties Directive.
* That both companies are in one of the forms provided for in the annex to the Directive.
* That both companies are tax residents in the European Union and, for the purposes of an agreement to avoid double taxation on income concluded with a third State, they are not considered residents of that third State.
* That both companies are associated. For these purposes, two companies shall be deemed to be associated when one holds a direct interest in the capital of the other of at least 25 percent, or a third holds a direct interest in the capital of each of them of at least 25 percent with a minimum holding period of one year.
* That, where applicable, such amounts are deductible for the permanent establishment that pays the income in the State in which it is located.
* That the company receiving such payments does so for its own benefit and not as a mere intermediary or authorized agent of another person or company and that, in the case of a permanent establishment, the amounts it receives are effectively related to its activity and constitute taxable income in the State in which it is located.

4. According to internal law, interest paid to EU lenders is exempt from WHT. The exemption will not be applicable when interest is obtained through a tax haven.
5. Taxable income from supplies of services, technical assistance, or assembly/installation work under engineering contracts provided or carried out by non-resident companies with no PE in Spain does not follow the general rule for gross income.
