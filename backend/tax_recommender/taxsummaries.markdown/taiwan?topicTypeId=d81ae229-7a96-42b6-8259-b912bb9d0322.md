## Corporate - Withholding taxes

Last reviewed - 19 August 2024

Resident corporations paying service fees to foreign entities are often subject to 20% WHT. However, under the following scenarios, the WHT might be reduced:

* WHT on service income may be reduced by deducting costs and expenses and applying a contribution ratio.
* Technical services income can utilise a deemed profit rate of 15%, thereby reducing the net WHT rate to 3%.
* Cross-border electronic services income may be taxed after deducting costs and expenses and applying a contribution ratio.
* A foreign entity that is a tax resident of a country with a tax treaty with Taiwan can evaluate the nature of its income to determine whether the income qualifies for business profits tax exemption in accordance with the applicable tax treaty.

In addition to the above, resident corporations paying certain types of income are required to withhold tax as follows:

| Recipient | WHT (%) | | |
