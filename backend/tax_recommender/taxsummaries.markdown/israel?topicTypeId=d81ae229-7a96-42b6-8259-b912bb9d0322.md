## Corporate - Withholding taxes

Last reviewed - 17 September 2024

Under Israeli domestic tax law, WHT on payments of Israeli-source income is generally deducted at the corporate tax rate from all income remittances abroad, unless a tax certificate is obtained from the ITA authorising withholding-exempt remittances or a reduced rate of tax pursuant to an applicable tax treaty.

Set out below is a listing of WHT rates for dividends, interest, and royalties under domestic tax law and pursuant to tax treaties in force. Detailed rules apply under certain tax treaties for eligibility to the treaty-reduced rates (e.g. beneficial ownership, having no PE in Israel). The applicable tax treaty should be consulted to determine the relevant WHT rate and to examine detailed conditions that may apply for the specific circumstance.

Israel has adopted the Multilateral Instrument (MLI) amendments to tax treaties. The changes to the DTTs provided for in the MLI will generally apply for those Israeli treaties when the country treaty partner has also ratified the MLI in their respective country and for those provisions on which both countries have not submitted reservations to the OECD. Therefore, in examining treaty eligibility for reduced WHT rates, it is important to examine the relevant treaty together with its MLI amendments as applicable (e.g. amended provisions regarding residency).

Notes

\* Some Israeli tax treaties provide for an exemption from WHT on interest involving governmental and quasi-governmental parties. Such exemptions are not separately indicated in the table above.

1. Dividends between Israeli resident companies are generally exempt from Israeli tax. Dividends paid from a foreign resident company received via an Israeli payer (e.g. bank) are subject to WHT at the rate of 23% when paid to an Israeli resident company and at the rate of 25% when paid to an individual.
2. 30% rate applies in the case of a ‘substantial shareholder’, which is, in general, a shareholder that holds 10% or more of the rights of the company (detailed rules apply).
3. 10% where beneficial owner directly holds at least 25% of the capital of the company paying the dividends.
4. At a rate that is 50% of the rate that would have been imposed but for this provision but not to exceed 12.5% and not less than 7.5%. A 10% rate applies where paid from profits generated by an enterprise entitled to special tax rates under the Encouragement of Investment Law.
5. 5% if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) that directly holds at least 25% of the capital of the company paying the dividends; 10% rate if the beneficial owner is a company that directly holds at least 10% of the capital of the company paying the dividends where that latter company is a resident of Israel and the dividends are paid out of profits that are subject to tax in Israel at a rate that is lower than the normal rate of Israeli corporate tax; 15% rate applies in all other cases.
6. 5% if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) that directly holds at least 15% of the capital of the company paying the dividends; 15% rate in all other cases.
7. 0% if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) that directly holds at least 10% of the capital of the company paying the dividends; 5% rate in all other cases.
8. 5% if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) that directly holds at least 10% of the capital of the company paying the dividends; 10% rate if the beneficial owner is a company that directly holds at least 10% of the capital of the company paying the dividends where that latter company is a resident of Israel and the dividends are paid out of profits that are subject to tax in Israel at a rate that is lower than the normal rate of Israeli corporate tax; 15% rate in all other cases.
9. If the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) that directly controls at least 10% of the voting power in the company paying the dividends, the rate is 5%, but increased to 10% if the dividends are paid out of profits which, by virtue of provisions in Israeli law for the Encouragement of Investment in Israel, are subject to a tax rate lower than the standard rate levied on the profits of a company resident in Israel; 15% rate in all other cases.
10. 5% if the beneficial owner is a company that directly or indirectly holds at least 10% of the capital of the company paying the dividends; 10% rate if the beneficial owner is a company that directly or indirectly holds at least 10% of the capital of the company paying the dividends and the dividends are paid out of profits that are subject to tax in Israel at a rate that is lower than the normal rate of Israeli corporate tax; 15% rate in all other cases.
11. At the domestic Israeli tax rate.
12. 5% if the recipient directly holds at least 10% of the capital of the company paying the dividends.
13. 10% if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) that directly holds at least 25% of the capital of the company paying the dividends.
14. 15% if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) that directly or indirectly holds at least 10% of the voting power of the company paying the dividends.
15. 5% if the beneficial owner is a company that owns at least 25% of the voting shares of the company paying the dividends during the period of six months immediately before the end of the accounting period for which the distribution of profits takes place.
16. 5% if the beneficial owner is a company that directly or indirectly holds at least 10% of the capital of the company paying the dividends; 10% rate if the beneficial owner is a company that holds 10% of the capital of the company paying the dividends and the dividends are paid out of profits that are subject to tax at a rate that is lower than the normal rate of the corporation tax; 15% rate in all other cases.
17. 5% if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) that directly holds at least 10% of the capital of the company paying the dividends; 10% rate if the beneficial owner is a company that directly holds at least 10% of the capital of the company paying the dividends where the dividends are paid out of profits that by virtue of provisions in the Israeli Law of Encouragement of Investments in Israel are exempt from tax or subject to tax at a rate that is lower than the normal rate of Israeli corporate tax; 15% rate in all other cases.
18. 5% if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) that directly holds at least 10% of the capital of the company paying the dividends; 10% rate if the beneficial owner is a company that directly holds at least 10% of the capital of the company paying the dividends and the dividends are paid out of profits that are subject to tax in Israel at a rate that is lower than the normal rate of Israeli corporate tax; 15% rate in all other cases.
