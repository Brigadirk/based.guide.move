# Jamaica


## Overview

Last reviewed - 02 August 2024

Jamaica is the third largest island, and the largest English-speaking island, in the Caribbean. It is 4,243 square miles (10,993 square kilometres) in size and has a population of 2.8 million. Between the years 1494, the year in which Christopher Columbus claimed the island on behalf of the Spaniards, and 1655, Jamaica was colonised by Spain. It was thereafter subjected to over 300 years of British rule until it gained full independence in 1962. It is a vibrant and stable democracy with the two major political parties being the Peoples National Party (PNP) and the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP).

The official language of Jamaica is English, and the currency is the Jamaican dollar (JMD).

Jamaica is divided into 14 parishes. Its capital is Kingston, located on the south coast of the island. Other major cities and towns include Montego Bay, Spanish Town, Port Antonio, Ocho Rios, Mandeville, and Negril. Although small in size, Jamaica boasts a rich and unique culture, and many Jamaicans (e.g. Bob Marley, Jimmy Cliff, Marcus Garvey, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, and Usain Bolt) have made an indelible impact in the fields of music, politics, religion, and sports worldwide.

The principal drivers of the Jamaican economy are tourism, manufacturing, agribusiness, energy, business process outsourcing, and bauxite/alumina. The country also relies heavily on remittances from citizens living and employed overseas.

The last two decades have seen significant improvements in the country's infrastructure, including several tolled highways and by-passes, which have enhanced road access within the island. Its major airports are Norman Manley International in Kingston and Sangster International in Montego Bay (both of which have seen significant modernisation and improvements) as well as a smaller third international airport, Ian Fleming Airport located in Boscobel, Saint Mary, which is near Ocho Rios.

The principal seaports are Kingston and Montego Bay. There are also extensive cruise shipping facilities in Montego Bay, Ocho Rios, Falmouth, and Port Antonio. The Port of Kingston is located on the world's seventh largest natural harbour, at the centre of the north-south and east-west axes through the Caribbean, approximately 32 miles from the trade routes passing through the Panama Canal.

Jamaica's telecommunication system has also grown significantly in the last decade and is now one of the most sophisticated in the Caribbean. Jamaica's advanced telecoms infrastructure utilises a hybrid of fixed-line and wireless technologies, including 3G and 4G broadband networks.

PwC is Jamaica's leading professional services firm, focused on providing audit, tax, assurance, and related business advisory services. PwC Jamaica, whose origins began in 1916, now employs over 400 professionals in two offices located in Kingston and Montego Bay.

We advise more companies listed on the Jamaica Stock Exchange than any other professional services firm in Jamaica and are the only firm in the English-speaking Caribbean that has been certified by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. We also provide services to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registrant companies, international conglomerates, and statutory bodies, as well as individuals. Our client base includes firms engaged in banking, insurance, other financial services, manufacturing, retail and distribution, tourism, telecommunications, energy, mining, and agriculture.
