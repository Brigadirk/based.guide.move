# Serbia


## Overview

Last reviewed - 12 June 2024

Serbia is a landlocked country in Central Southeast Europe. It is bordered by Hungary to the north; Romania and Bulgaria to the east; North Macedonia to the south; and Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro to the west. Its capital and largest city is Belgrade. The official language of Serbia is Serbian, and the currency is the Serbian dinar (RSD).

The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was formed in 1918. Its name was changed to Yugoslavia in 1929. Yugoslavia (i.e. the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) joined the United Nations (UN) as an original member in 1945. By 1992, it had been effectively dissolved into five independent states (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia), which were all subsequently admitted to the United Nations. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, whose name later changed to the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, was admitted to the United Nations on 1 November 2000. The state union effectively came to an end after Montenegro's formal declaration of independence on 3 June 2006.

After renewing its membership in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in December 2000, Serbia continued to reintegrate into the international community by rejoining the World Bank's International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).

Serbia has made progress in trade liberalisation and enterprise restructuring and privatisation, including telecommunications and small and medium-size firms. It has made some progress towards European Union (EU) membership, signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Brussels in May 2008 and with fully implementing the Interim Trade Agreement with the European Union in February 2010. The European Union granted Serbia candidate status in March 2012. 

Serbia is also pursuing membership in the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and the process of accession to the WTO is expected to continue during 2024.

The IMF projects that Serbia's real gross domestic product (GDP) will grow by 3.0% in 2024.

PwC Serbia supports clients with the local knowledge and skills of its people and with access to a broad range of other professionals across the PwC global network of firms.

PwC Serbia provides a full range of assurance, tax, business advisory, and legal services to local clients and international corporations present in Serbia. Our office has over 200 local and expatriate specialists with knowledge of local regulations and international best practice.

Our teams have skills and experience in all areas of taxation, including local and international corporate taxation, indirect taxation, customs and trade regulations, expatriate taxation, HR management, and accounting services.
