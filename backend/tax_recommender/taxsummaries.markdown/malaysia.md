# Malaysia


## Overview

Last reviewed - 13 December 2024

Malaysia, located in Southeast Asia, is separated by the South China Sea into two non-contiguous regions: the Peninsula Malaysia region bordering Thailand (i.e. West Malaysia) and the Malaysia Borneo region bordering Indonesia and Brunei (i.e. East Malaysia). Malaysia is divided into 13 states and three federal territories, with Kuala Lumpur as the capital and Putrajaya as the seat of the federal government. The official language of Malaysia is Bahasa Malaysia, and the currency is the Malaysian ringgit (MYR).

Over the last 60 years, Malaysia has developed from a primary commodities exporter to a strong industrial base for foreign electrical and electronics multinational corporations. As an oil and gas exporter, Malaysia has profited from higher world energy prices, but the government recognises the need to reduce the dependence on petroleum as the main source of revenue. In the last decade, as it moved up the industry value chain, Malaysia has emerged as an attractive regional hub for services, including financial services, information and communications technology (ICT), and logistics sectors. Malaysia is increasingly being recognised as an innovative international Islamic financial centre. It is also emerging as a springboard or centre for regional expansion into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in view of its strategic, central location and multi-lingual ‘Truly Asia’ mix of Malay, Chinese, and Indian populace.

PwC Malaysia has a team of more than 3,000 strong in Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Ipoh, Melaka, Johor Bahru, Kuching, and Labuan and has played an integral part in the growth and progress of Malaysia since 1900. Today, PwC Malaysia continues to work with many large multinationals, public sector entities, and Malaysian companies, providing solutions to their complex business issues. PwC Malaysia provides a wide range of services to assist public and private clients that includes assurance, consulting, deals, digital services, entrepreneurial and private business, and tax.
