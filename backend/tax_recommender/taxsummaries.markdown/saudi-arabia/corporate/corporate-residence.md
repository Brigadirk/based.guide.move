# Saudi Arabia


## Corporate - Corporate residence

Last reviewed - 21 July 2024

A company is considered a resident company if it is formed under the Saudi Arabian Regulations for Companies or if its central management is located in Saudi Arabia.

## Permanent establishment (PE)

According to the Saudi tax regulations, the following are the requirements for considering a non-resident party to have a PE:

* A PE of a non-resident in Saudi Arabia, unless otherwise provided below, consists of the permanent place of activity of the non-resident through which one carries out business, in full or in part, including business carried out through an agent.
* The following are considered a PE:
  + Construction sites, assembly facilities, and the exercise of related supervisory activities.
  + Installations or sites used for surveying for natural resources, drilling equipment, or ships used for surveying for natural resources, and the exercise of related supervisory activities.
  + A fixed location where a non-resident natural person carries out business.
  + A branch of a non-resident company that is licensed to carry out business in Saudi Arabia.
* A place is not considered a PE of a non-resident in Saudi Arabia if it is used in Saudi Arabia only to do the following:
  + Store, display, or deliver goods or products belonging to the non-resident.
  + Keep an inventory of goods or products belonging to the non-resident only for the purposes of processing by another person.
  + Purchase goods or products only for the collection of information for the non-resident.
  + Perform any other activities that are preparatory or auxiliary in nature for the interests of the non-resident.
  + Prepare contracts relating to loans, supply of products, or perform technical services for signature.
  + Execute any group of the activities mentioned above.
* A non-resident partner in a resident personal company is considered an owner to a PE in Saudi Arabia in the form of a share in a personal company.

Furthermore, the agent mentioned in the above article is identified as a dependent agent who has any of the following authorities:

* Negotiate on behalf of a non-resident.
* Conclude contracts on behalf of a non-resident.
* Has a stock of goods, owned by a non-resident, on hand in Saudi Arabia to supply the clients’ demands regularly on behalf of the non-resident.

A place from which a non-resident carries out insurance and/or reinsurance activity in Saudi Arabia through an agent is considered a PE of the non-resident even though the agent is not authorised to negotiate and conclude contracts on behalf of the non-resident.
