## Corporate - Withholding taxes

Last reviewed - 12 June 2024

Montenegrin CIT Law imposes WHT on income realised from a Montenegrin source and distributed to a non-resident. The scope of the WHT applies to dividends and profit distribution, capital gains, interest, royalties, intellectual property rights fees, rental income, fees for consulting, market research, and audit services, and distribution of liquidation proceeds, as well as to income earned on the basis of performing variety, entertainment, artistic, sport, or similar programmes in Montenegro.

WHT will also be payable on income earned by non-resident or resident individuals on the basis of repurchase of used products, semi-final products, and agricultural products from a manufacturer registered for VAT purposes.

Distributions of dividends and share of profits are also subject to WHT if the recipient is a Montenegrin resident (either an individual or legal entity).

The general WHT rate is 15%.

Application of a double tax treaty (DTT) may reduce or eliminate Montenegrin WHT. To qualify for the beneficial rates prescribed by the treaty, a non-resident must prove tax residency of a relevant treaty country and beneficial ownership over the income. In order to qualify for a preferential tax rate according to a DTT, a non-resident will need to provide the tax residency certificate filled out and stamped by the relevant authority of its country of residence.

Although Serbia is regarded as the legal successor of the Serbia and Montenegro State Union that ceased to exist in June 2006, the Republic of Montenegro, upon its Decision on Independence (dated 3 June 2006), continues to honour international treaties that were applicable in the State Union, including those executed by State Union’s legal predecessors (Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, i.e. former Yugoslavia).

The list of the treaties is provided below:

Notes

1. If the recipient company owns/controls at least 25% of the equity of the paying company, the lower of the two rates applies.
2. A new DTT was signed with Egypt in 2005, but it is not applicable yet. Meanwhile, the old treaty is still applicable.
3. Instruments of ratification have not been exchanged between the two countries.
4. A tax rate of 5% will be applicable to literary, scientific, and work of art, films and works created like films, or other sources of reproduction tone or picture. A tax rate of 10% will be applicable to patents, petty patents, brands, models and samples, technical innovations, secret formulas, or technical procedure.
5. Only in cases when dividends are to be paid to Montenegrin residents. If paid to Malaysian residents, they are taxable at 15% in Montenegro.
6. A 5% rate is applicable for intellectual property and 10% rate for industrial property.
7. A 0% rate is applicable in cases when the income recipient is the government or government-owned banks.
8. A 5% rate is applicable in cases when the beneficial owner is a company that holds at least 5% of the capital of the payer of the income. In all other cases, a 10% rate applies.
9. A 5% rate is applicable in cases when the beneficial owner is a company that holds at least 10% of the capital of the payer of the income. In all other cases, a 10% rate applies.
