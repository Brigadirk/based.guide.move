# Denmark


## Overview

Last reviewed - 04 February 2025

Denmark, a Scandinavian country located in Northern Europe, is bordered primarily by the Baltic Sea and the North Sea. It is divided into five main regions, with Copenhagen as its capital. The official language of Denmark is Danish, and the currency is the Danish krone (DKK).

Once the home of Vikings and later a major Northern European power, Denmark is a modern, prosperous nation that is participating in the general political and economic integration of Europe. It joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949 and signed the convention founding the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 1960. Since 1973, Denmark has also been a member of the European Union (EU).

Denmark has a thoroughly modern market economy, which features a high-tech agricultural sector; a state-of-the-art industry with world-leading firms in pharmaceuticals, maritime shipping, and renewable energy; and a dependence on foreign trade. The Danish economy is also characterised by extensive government welfare measures, an equitable distribution of income, and comfortable living standards. Denmark is a net exporter of food and energy and enjoys a comfortable balance of payments surplus. The country has opted out of certain elements of the EU's Maastricht Treaty and issues concerning certain justice and home affairs. Despite meeting the criteria to join the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), so far Denmark has decided not to join, although the krone is pegged to the euro.

PwC Denmark is one of the largest firms in the country within its three main areas: audit, tax, and consulting services. We serve a significant proportion of Denmark's largest companies, public and private institutions, and have a soundly based portfolio of clients in most industries. Through product development and national, as well as international, experience, our professionals have developed broad expertise and are able to provide unique services. Tax planning and tax reporting have become more extensive and opaque for businesses. At the same time, it also means more for the company's finances and reputation. Frequent changes in tax laws place both Danish and foreign companies under great pressure. PwC's approximately 280 Danish tax specialists offer solution-oriented tax advice based on specific tax challenges and create value to our clients' bottom line. Clients receive personalised service with local expertise in a global network.
