# Sweden


## Corporate - Withholding taxes

Last reviewed - 27 December 2024

There are no Swedish taxes on interest and service fees paid to non-resident corporations or individuals. Such payments to resident corporations and individuals are taxed as ordinary income.

WHT on dividends, royalties, and certain rentals vary according to domestic law and tax treaties, as shown below.

Pursuant to the amendment of the Parent Subsidiary Directive (EU general anti-avoidance rule [GAAR]), a minor change in the Swedish WHT Act (for outbound dividends) has been made, targeting structures put in place to obtain WHT exemption through the use of decoy arrangements. This anti-avoidance provision has long existed under current Swedish law, but an explicit clarification is made as of 1 January 2016 that the provision can also be applicable in cases covered by the Parent Subsidiary Directive.

Apart from the highlighted treaties, Sweden has concluded agreements on exchange of information in tax matters and partial tax treaties. Since 1 April 2017, when the tax information exchange agreement (TIEA) with the United Arab Emirates entered into force, Sweden has information exchange agreements with all the world’s tax jurisdictions. It could also be noted that amendments to the EU Directive on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation have been implemented in Swedish legislation with effect as of 1 January 2017.

The Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (MLI) was approved by the Swedish Parliament in May 2018. As five jurisdictions have deposit instruments of ratification, the MLI entered into force in July 2018 at an international level. Further, as Sweden has submitted the documents required for ratification, the MLI entered into force at a Swedish level in October 2018. However, the Swedish legislative process requires that the amendments are incorporated into Swedish law in respect of each bill. In general, Sweden has made reservations in regards of MLI's tax allocation articles, implying that existing tax allocation articles continue to apply. In regards of other articles in the MLI, minimum standards have been chosen.

In the light of EU case law (Case C-575/17, Sofina SA and Others), rules allowing deferment of payment of WHT upon application entered into effect as of 1 January 2020. In general, certain loss-making residents in jurisdictions where special treaties apply, or entities within the European Union, may apply for such deferment. The deferment is applied until four months after the end of the tax year that follows the tax year whose deferment scope is the basis for the deferment (e.g. WHT relating to a dividend paid during 2020 may be deferred until April 2022).

Notes

1. According to domestic law, there is no WHT on dividends to a foreign company on shares held for business reasons (*for the definition of shares held for business reasons, see Capital gains in the [Income determination](sweden%3FtopicTypeId=acb0dfca-7ffb-4322-9fd9-f9f8521a016c.html) section*), provided that the foreign company is similar to a Swedish limited liability company (and some other legal entities) and is subject to income tax at a level similar to that imposed on a Swedish company. Further, there is no tax liability for a legal entity of a member state of the European Union if the entity owns 10% or more of the share capital in the distributing company and fulfils the conditions of the Directive (90/435) regarding a parent company and subsidiaries.
2. The reduced rate shown before a stroke (/) refers to payments to corporations having requisite control. Where appropriate, the particular treaty should be consulted to see whether the reduced rate is applicable.
3. Swedish-source royalties and certain rental fees are treated as a special form of PE, taxable at the corporate tax rate, subject to treaty reduction or waiver. Royalties paid from Sweden to a company within the European Union should not be taxed in Sweden if one of the companies holds at least 25% (capital) of the other or, where there are two companies concerned, at least 25% are held by another company within the European Union. Indirect participation does not benefit from the legislation. Both the payer and the recipient must be legal entities under the EU directive.
4. Payments to resident corporations and individuals are taxed as ordinary income. Only resident banks and similar entities are required to withhold tax on payments of cash dividends to resident individuals.
5. Royalties and certain rentals paid by Swedish licensees are treated as business income taxable in Sweden and do not incur WHT (*see Note 3*).
6. Note also the domestic provision stating a 0% WHT on dividends distributed to qualifying entities based on EU Directive (90/435) and/or where the shares are held for business purposes (*see Note 1*).
7. Dividends: 10% of the gross amount if the company receiving the dividends owns at least 25% of the foreign company’s capital.   
     
   Royalties: of the gross amount paid for the use of, or the right to use:
   * News: 3%.
   * Copyright of literary, dramatic, musical, or other artistic work: 5%.
   * Any patent, trademark, design or model, plan, or secret formula or process; industrial or scientific equipment or information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific experience; payments for the rendering of technical assistance: 10%.
   * All other cases: 15%.
8. Royalties are normally taxable only in the recipient’s home country. However, where the royalty is paid by a Swedish legal entity that is more than 50% owned by one Austrian recipient, entity or individual, the tax in Sweden is a maximum of 10%.
9. Literary, artistic, or scientific royalties: 0%; other royalties: 5%.
10. Royalties for use of industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment: 5%; with respect to patents, secret formulas or processes, or for information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific experience: 3%; other royalties: 10%.
11. Royalties for use of copyright and literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic royalties: 0%. Other royalties: 10% (treaty should be consulted).
12. The treaty has effect on income derived on or after 1 January 2006.
13. The double taxation treaty does not include Hong Kong.
14. The same treaty is applicable to the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.
15. According to the Nordic multilateral tax treaty.
16. Dividends are exempt from tax if the recipient of the dividends is a company directly owning at least 10% of the capital of the company paying out the dividends. Certain rentals are subject to tax if there is a PE in a country other than the home country and the claim is connected with the business carried on from the PE. Concerning Iceland, dividends are normally exempt from tax for companies, but the tax rate is 15% if the dividends have been deducted from the income of the distributing company.

After that, dividends paid to a resident in Portugal and Greece are subject to Swedish WHT under domestic law and the exemptions included therein.
37. Sweden has decided to suspend its tax treaty with Russia in its entirety following Russia's unilateral decision to suspend several provisions of the agreement. To effectively carry out this suspension (which thus is made on an international law basis), Sweden must repeal the law that incorporated the treaty into Swedish domestic law. The repeal is proposed to take effect on a date set by the government, allowing for the swift suspension of the treaty. The aim is that the treaty is to be suspended in February 2025.  Once the tax treaty is suspended, the benefits described therein will no longer apply . Instead, dividends paid to residents in Russia will be subject to WHT under domestic law and the exemptions included therein.
