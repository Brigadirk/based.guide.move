# Pakistan


## Overview

Last reviewed - 18 December 2024

Pakistan, located in South Asia, is bordered by India to the east, China to the northeast, Afghanistan to the north and west, Iran to the southwest, and the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman to the south. The northern and western highlands of Pakistan contain the towering Karakoram and Pamir mountain ranges, which include some of the World’s highest peaks: K2 (8,611 metres) and Nanga Parbat (8,126 metres). The Baluchistan Plateau lies to the west; the Thar Desert and expanse of alluvial plains, the Punjab, and Sindh lie to the east. The 1,000 mile long (1,609 km) Indus River and its tributaries flow through the country from the Kashmir region to the Arabian Sea. Pakistan is divided into 170 districts (including the capital of Islamabad and districts of Azad Kashmir). The official languages of Pakistan are Urdu and English, and the currency is the Pakistani rupee (PKR).

There is a great potential for investment and business opportunities in Pakistan in almost all sectors, considering the size of its population, as it is a habitat of more than 250 million people.

PwC is operating in Pakistan with its three active offices in the major cities of Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad, covering a significant portion of industry and business.
