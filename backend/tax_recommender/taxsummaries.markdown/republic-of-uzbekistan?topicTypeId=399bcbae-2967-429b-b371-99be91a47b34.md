# Uzbekistan, Republic of


## Corporate - Other taxes

Last reviewed - 09 February 2025

## Value-added tax (VAT)

Legal entities are subject to VAT, which is applied to the turnover of goods and services. The taxable base is determined as the sale price of supplied goods/services.

Foreign legal entities carrying out activities in Uzbekistan via PE become VAT payers. Moreover, certain categories of taxpayers, including agricultural producers and law firms, may also be subject to VAT.

Foreign legal entities that supply e-services to individuals whereby the place of supply is considered Uzbekistan are subject to VAT in Uzbekistan. In such a case, the foreign service provider is liable for registering for VAT purposes in Uzbekistan. The taxable base shall comprise the actual sales price of such services inclusive of VAT.

The rate for taxable turnover is 12%. This rate also applies to taxable imports, for which the tax base is determined as the customs value plus import duties and excise tax (on excise-liable goods). Export of goods is generally zero-rated. Insurance and most types of financial services are exempt from VAT.

From 16 November 2023 till 1 January 2028, sales turnover, as well as the import of goods (services) purchased within the framework of projects financed through loans from the International Financial Institutions and foreign governmental financial organisations (except those refinanced through banks of Uzbekistan), attracted by state organisations and entities with a state share of 50% and above are exempt from VAT.

All entities with turnover exceeding UZS 1 billion, as well as PEs of foreign legal entities, are considered as VAT payers. Legal entities selling gas, diesel fuel, and gas through gas stations to end consumers and all business entities that are importers of goods and products are considered as VAT payers regardless of the amount of their annual turnover.

Reporting and tax payments are made on a monthly basis.

As of 1 April 2024, the following VAT incentives have been abolished:

* Sales of medical and veterinary services, medicines, veterinary medicines, and medical and veterinary products.
* Import into the territory of the Republic of Uzbekistan medicines, veterinary medicines, and medical and veterinary products, as well as raw materials imported according to a list determined by law.
* Sales to households of water supply, sewerage, sanitary cleaning, and heat supply.

These turnovers were previously taxed at 0% VAT.

Starting from July 1, 2025, the VAT exemption on passenger transportation services at uniform rates will be abolished to ensure the continuity of the value-added chain.

Starting from January 1, 2025, VAT exemptions for the turnover from the sale of goods and services by legal entities, whose sole founder is an association of persons with disabilities, are abolished.

## Customs duties

Import of certain goods to Uzbekistan is subject to customs duties. The taxable base is determined as the customs value of imported goods. Rates of customs duties vary from 5% to 70%, depending on the type of imported goods. Fixed rates are also set for certain goods as a minimum (e.g. the rate for coconuts is 20% but cannot be less than 0.2 United States dollars [USD] per kg).

From 1 January 2021, customs clearance fees were revised and should be calculated at the rates nominated in Base Calculation Units (BCUs), depending on range of the customs value of the goods. For example, the customs clearance fee for goods valued USD 100,000 to USD 200,000 should comprise 15 BCU (approximately USD 430).

A number of goods (per government approved list) imported for construction, renovation, and equipping of hotels, business centres, and retail stores will be exempt from customs duties between 1 March 2024 and 1 March 2026 (e.g. special equipment, appliances, raw materials, components, furniture, construction materials).

Until 1 January 2027, there will be an exemption from customs duties on imported raw materials and other materials, components, and spare parts necessary for the production of textile products and not produced in the republic, according to the list.

Starting from January 1, 2025, customs authorities are required to provide tax authorities with:

* real-time information on import operations, information on export operations after crossing the customs border of goods, as well as information on the movement of goods, including those carried out in the form of e-commerce, across the customs border of the Republic of Uzbekistan;
* monthly information on the storage of goods by non-residents of the Republic of Uzbekistan in customs warehouses of the Republic of Uzbekistan.

## Excise taxes

Due to the expiration of the Protocol on the Application of the Agreement on the Free Trade Area of the CIS Member States with Uzbekistan (dated 31 May 2013), Uzbekistan has cancelled excise tax for 73 product lines from 1 January 2021.

Legal entities producing or importing excise-able goods (e.g. cigarettes, petrol, alcohol drinks) are subject to excise tax. Rates vary from 15% to 70%, depending on the type of goods produced/imported. The taxable base is determined as the value of produced/imported goods, excluding VAT. Excise tax is reported monthly.

Excise tax is charged for provision of sale of petrol, diesel, liquefied gas, and compressed gas to final consumers. Since 1 April 2025, excise taxes on petroleum products (gasoline, aviation kerosene, diesel fuel, environmentally friendly diesel fuel), engine oils, and liquefied and compressed gases have been increased by 10%. For cigarettes, starting from January 1, 2025, the *ad valorem* rate of 10% of the cost is excluded from the excise tax rate calculation, and from July 1 2025, the rates for imported and local cigarettes will be equalised. Excise tax on mobile communication services is abolished from January 1, 2025.

Fixed excise tax rates on local alcohol and tobacco products have been indexed by 12%.

Starting 1 April 2024, fixed excise tax rates on petroleum products have been indexed by 12%.

As of 1 April 2024, excise tax is also charged on:

* Carbonated drinks containing sugar or other sweetening or flavouring substances and packaged in consumer packaging (except for energy and toniс drinks) at UZS 500 per litre.
* Energy and tonic drinks at UZS 2,000 per litre.

Starting from April 1, 2025, the excise tax will be extended to all soft drinks with sugar content. An excise tax of 500 UZS per 1 liter is imposed on non-carbonated beverages (fruit drinks, lemonades, kvass and others), with the exception of juices made from fruits and (or) vegetables that are naturally sweet and do not contain additional sugar and other sweetening or aromatic substances.

In addition, excise tax on polyethylene granules was reduced to 10% .

The gas excise tax rate has been reduced from 20% to 12%. At the same time, the excise tax on imported gas was returned, which also amounts to 12%.

The excise tax rate on export of natural gas is reduced to 0% from 1 October 2021.

It is planned to introduce a single excise tax rate on both locally manufactured and imported petrol. Imported gasoline is subject to an excise tax rate of 5%.

In addition, excise tax on liquefied gas was reduced to 20%, and excise tax on polyethylene granules was abolished.

Excise tax rates for some products increased by an average of 10% from 1 February 2023.

## Property taxes

The headline property tax rate is 1.5% for legal entities (3% for overdue construction in progress). The tax is computed annually, based on the net book value of the immovable property and the value of overdue construction and idle equipment/construction. Along with reduction of the property tax rate, the minimum taxable base for each square metre of immovable property was introduced. The amount of such a taxable base depends on the location of the immovable property and varies from UZS 1 million to UZS 2.5 million.

The property tax rate for legal entities remains unchanged at 1.5%, but the minimum tax base for 1 sqm has been increased as follows:

* Tashkent: UZS 3.3 million.
* Nukus and regional centres: UZS 2.2 million.
* Other cities and rural areas: UZS 1.3 million.

Alternative energy producers (meeting certain criteria on rated power) are exempt from property tax on renewable energy installations for a period of ten years from the date of registration.

Property tax is reported annually by 1 March following the reporting year.

The Tax Code provides for the list of certain non-taxable property, mostly including public service facilities (e.g. waterwork facilities), gas and heat distribution lines, land plots, and highways.

The ‘reduced tax rate’ established for particular objects is 0.6% in relation to:

* public railways, main pipelines, communication lines, and power transmission lines, as well as structures that are an integral technological part of these facilities, and
* real estate and construction in progress, for which a decision was made by the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan on their conservation.

New oil and gas wells are exempt from property tax in the first two years starting from the month of their commissioning and benefit from a 50% rate reduction for the consequent three years.

Taxpayers for newly constructed industrial high rise buildings (excluding those located in the cities of the republic, as well as in the Zangiata, Kibray and Tashkent districts of the Tashkent region) pay the amount of the accrued tax using a reduction coefficient of 0.5-0.9 to the accrued amount of this tax depending on the number of stories of a building from the month of its commissioning for a period of no more than three years.

## Land tax

Enterprises, including foreign legal entities operating in Uzbekistan via a PE, owning land plots or rights of their use are subject to land tax or land lease payment annually. Land tax is charged at fees that are set in absolute values with precise amounts determined by the Law on State Budget of the Republic of Uzbekistan that vary depending on the quality, location, and level of water supply of each land plot. Land lease payment is charged at negotiable rates; however, the minimum amount cannot be less than the land tax rate for the respective land plot. Land tax and land lease payment are computed based on the area of the land in use.

Land tax base for non-agricultural land and for individuals have been indexed by 10%.

Producers of energy from renewable sources are exempt from payment of tax on land plots occupied by renewable energy installations for a period of ten years from the date of their commissioning.

Beginning from 1 January 2020, the Tax Code introduces a norm, which provides that in case of improving the quality of agricultural land (increasing the yield class), the tax is paid by legal entities on the normative value of agricultural land based on a new yield class from the beginning of the year following the year of soil bonitation, without recounting it in periods when the agricultural activities were completed.

Starting from 1 January 2022, land plots allotted for exploration works are not subject to land tax.

## Transfer taxes

There are no transfer taxes in Uzbekistan.

## Stamp duties

According to Uzbek legislation, stamp duty (state due) is an obligatory payment charged for performance of legal actions and/or issuance of legal documents.

The following actions, among others, are subject to stamp duties: filing claims, performing notary actions, civil registration, state registration of a legal entity, obtaining licences/permits to carry out certain activities, etc.

The rates of stamp duties generally vary from 0.5 to 20 times the BCU, depending on the type of action executed. For instance, the duty for filing a claim depends on the amount and nature of the claim. Under the civil claim, the duty comprises 4% of claim amount, but not less than 1 BCU; for business claims, the duty is 2% of the claim amount, but not less than 1 BCU. Duty for notarisation of copies of documents for legal entities is 2% of the BCU per each page of the document. Duty for registration of legal entities with foreign investment comprises 10 times the BCU if submitted in person and 50% of this if submitted through the automated online registration system.

## Social Tax (ST)

Employers are subject to ST assessed on total payroll cost related to local and expatriate staff. This tax is collected by the tax authorities. The rate of ST is stated as 12% for all kind of entities with extension to certain new categories of taxpayers, including individual entrepreneurs and their employees, members of family enterprises, farming enterprises, and artisans, etc. Budget organisations pay ST at the rate of 25%.

Income of foreign personnel paid to non-resident legal entities as part of secondment fees under personnel provision agreements is subject to ST. The taxable base for calculation of ST on such income shall be the income of foreign personnel provided, but not less than 90% of the secondment fee payable under the personnel provision agreement. ST is reported monthly.

From January 1, 2025 to January 1, 2028, companies that hire low-income employees with salaries above 1.5 minimum wage will pay a social tax rate of 1%.  
From September 1, 2024 to September 1, 2027, the social tax for companies that employ students from schools, colleges and technical schools under the age of 30 for vocational training is paid a 1% social tax on income paid to them in the form of wages.

Companies that hire foreign teachers are exempt from social tax until January 1 2030.

From 1 January 2025, an ST rate of 1% previously applied to businesses engaged in retail, catering, hospitality, passengers and freight transportation by vehicle, repair and maintenance of vehicles, computer services, repair of household appliances, agro- and veterinary services, and services provided in entertainment centres was not extended and considered abolished.

## Payroll taxes

In addition to ST, employers are responsible for withholding PIT and pension fund contributions from salaries and remitting them to the state budget.

The following types of income are exempt from PIT:

* Amounts invested in shares during an IPO in the framework of employee share plan programs, within the limits of an employee’s monthly salary and equivalent payments.
* Salaries and other income of taxpayers in the amount of up to 100 minimum wages allocated to an individual’s investment account for purchase of securities on the local stock market under certain conditions and limitations.

## Water-use tax

Enterprises (including PEs) using water in their production are subject to water-use tax. The tax rate is set by the Tax Code and depends on the source of water consumption (i.e. surface or underground). Water-use tax is calculated based on the volume of the water consumed. Water-use tax is reported annually.

Since January 1, 2025 tax rates for the use of water resources have been increased by 10% for water users, including power plants, utilities, producers of soft drinks and alcoholic beverages, except beer and wine, and industrial enterprises. In accordance with the Presidential Decree No. 107 dated April 1, 2023, water tax rates for other sectors will be gradually unified with industrial tariffs.

## Taxes of subsurface users

In addition to standard taxes, subsurface users (i.e. legal entities and individuals exploring and extracting natural resource) are subject to subsurface users’ specific taxes, as listed below:

### Subsurface use tax (royalty)

Subsurface use tax is charged on the volume of produced (extracted) natural resources that are ready for sale or transfer (including free of charge) and consumption for internal purposes. The taxable base is determined as the average weighted sales price.

Starting from January 1, 2025, separate tax rates for the use of mineral resources for marble, granite, natural facing stone, sand and gravel mixtures (including construction sand and sandstones) have been established, given that the share of tax in relation to their purchase price is very low.

Some examples of the tax rates are:

| Business activity | Tax rate examples |
| --- | --- |
| Extraction of natural resources (tax rates effective from 1 January 2023) | natural gas 10%, oil and gas 10%, gold and copper 7%, silver 7% |
| Utilisation of by-products received during the extraction of natural resources | 50% of tax rate applicable to main natural resources extracted |

Subsurface use tax is reported monthly by legal entities and annually by individuals.

### Mineral extraction rent tax

Starting from 1 January 2022, legal entities extracting precious, non-ferrous, and radioactive metals, rare and rare-earth elements, as well as hydrocarbons (natural gas, gas condensate, and oil), will be subject to a new rent tax. The taxable base comprises the amount of rent income, which is defined as the difference between the revenue from sales of respective products (net of VAT and excise tax) and expenses directly related to their extraction. If there is a rent loss, the taxable base shall be nil. The taxable base is calculated separately for each licensed subsoil plot (group of licensed plots).

Rent tax will not apply to rent income connected with extraction of natural resources on subsoil fields where the extraction started between 1 January 2024 and 31 December 2025. This exemption will apply for the entire period of extraction works.

Enterprises with foreign investments engaged in extraction of metals and hydrocarbons may determine the taxable base in US dollars based on the accrual method. In such a case, the taxable base indicated in foreign currency is converted into national currency at the exchange rate of the Central Bank of Uzbekistan established as at the date of tax filing. If a loss is incurred after the first tax period, the taxpayer is allowed to account for it in a separate account in US dollars and apply an uplift each year at the rate equal to the Uzbekistan sovereign bonds yield with maturity in ten years increased by two percentage points. Expenses of the first tax period may include historical costs.

The minimum tax rate comprises 25% of the taxable base. During a competitive bidding (tender) for the right to use a subsoil plot for geological exploration or extraction, the organiser or participants have a right to propose a higher rent tax rate to be paid.

The tax period for rent tax is a calendar year. The reporting period is a quarter. Rent tax is paid quarterly not later than the 20th day of the next month, and, for annual payments, not later than 1 March of the year following the reporting one.

### Excess profits tax

Excess profits tax is abolished from 1 January 2020.

### Subscription and commercial discovery bonuses

Subscription and commercial discovery bonuses are one-off payments to the state budget. The subscription bonus is payable for the right to engage in exploration and extraction of natural resources and range from 50 to 5,000 times the BCU, depending on the type of minerals. The commercial discovery bonus is paid for each field where a subsurface user discovers the natural resources and comprises 0.1% from the cost of the proved reserve volume.

Starting from 1 January 2022, a special procedure is introduced for tendering of subsoil rights for geological exploration and/or production in respect of previously explored fields having significant commercial potential (i.e. hydrocarbons, precious metals, non-ferrous, rare, and radioactive metals, and other types of minerals). At this, the cost of subsoil rights acquired replaces commercial discovery and subscription bonuses, which are abolished.

### Licence fee

Starting from 1 January 2022, an annual licence fee is introduced for the use of subsoil for geological exploration. It is calculated based on the allotted area and types of minerals, in the amounts established by legislation.
