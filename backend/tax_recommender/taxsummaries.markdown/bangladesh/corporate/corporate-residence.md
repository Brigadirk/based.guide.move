# Bangladesh


## Corporate - Corporate residence

Last reviewed - 03 January 2025

A company is treated as a resident in Bangladesh if it satisfies either of the two following conditions:

* It is a company incorporated under the laws of Bangladesh.
* The control and management of the affairs are undertaken wholly in Bangladesh.

A Hindu Undivided Family (HUF), firm, or other AOP is treated as resident in Bangladesh if the control and management of the affairs is undertaken wholly or partly in Bangladesh.

## Permanent establishment (PE)

In relation to income from business, the PE is the fixed place or place of business through which such business of a person is wholly or partly carried on, and shall include:

* any place of management
* any branch
* any agency
* any office
* any warehouse
* any factory
* any workshop
* any mine, oil or gas well, quarry, or any other place of exploration, exploitation, or extraction of natural resources
* any farm or plantation
* any building site, any construction, or installation project, or supervisory activities in connection therewith
* the furnishing of services, including consultancy services, by a person through employees or other personnel engaged by the person for such purpose if activities of that nature continue (for the same or a connected project) in Bangladesh, and
* an associate of a non-resident person or any person commercially dependent on such non-resident person carrying on any activity connected with any sale made by the non-resident person in Bangladesh.

The existence of a PE in Bangladesh is also required to be analysed as per the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs) entered into by the People’s Republic of Bangladesh with various other countries.
