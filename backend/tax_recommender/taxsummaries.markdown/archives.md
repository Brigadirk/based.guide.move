**Notes**

Worldwide Tax Summaries - Corporate Taxes is no longer published annually in PDF format. The data provided in the online tool is updated and maintained regularly throughout the year, and the print functionality of the online tool allows users to print or create PDF versions of a territory's corporate and/or individual tax summary in real time. 

The 2018/19 edition of Worldwide Tax Summaries - Corporate Taxes was the final annual edition published as a PDF. There are no PDF versions of the corporate tax summaries for years prior to 2010/11 or after 2018/19. There are no PDF versions of the individual tax summaries for any years.

Due to the size of the books, the PDFs are quite large. The amount of time it takes to download a PDF will vary according to your Internet connection speed.

Because our PDFs are secure, some users have experienced issues viewing this content or using the bookmarks within a browser's viewer. If this is an issue, try downloading the PDF to your desktop and opening it within the native Adobe Reader application.
