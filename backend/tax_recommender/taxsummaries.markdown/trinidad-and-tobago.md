# Trinidad and Tobago


## Overview

Last reviewed - 31 January 2025

Trinidad and Tobago, with its capital in Port of Spain, gained its independence in 1962. It is one of the most prosperous countries in the Caribbean, largely due to petroleum and natural gas production and processing.

The official language of Trinidad and Tobago is English, and the currency is the Trinidad and Tobago dollar (TTD).

Trinidad and Tobago has earned a reputation as an excellent investment site for international businesses. Growth has been fuelled by investments in liquefied natural gas, petrochemicals, and steel. Additional petrochemical, aluminium, and plastics projects are in various stages of planning.

Trinidad and Tobago is one of the leading Caribbean producers of oil and gas, and its economy is heavily dependent upon these resources, but it also supplies manufactured goods, notably food products and beverages, as well as cement, to the Caribbean region. The country is also a regional financial centre, and tourism is a growing sector, although it is not as important domestically as it is to many other Caribbean islands. The economy benefits from a growing trade surplus.

PwC Trinidad and Tobago's Tax practice is comprised of talented individuals with the experience and expertise to offer our clients the highest quality service in all areas of tax compliance and tax planning. The firm provides advice on a wide range of issues that could have a significant impact on a company's tax liabilities. Some of these include:

* The corporate structures most suitable to the business needs of incoming investors.
* The range of fiscal and other initiatives available in Trinidad and Tobago.
* The tax implications of alternative financial structures.
* The tax implications of cross-border transactions involving related party and other non-resident parties.
* Treatment of accounting items, such as capital gains or losses, dividends, interest, etc.
* Tax efficiency of mergers and acquisitions.
* Double tax treaties (DTTs) and their implications for local and foreign investors.
* Retirement and executive compensation plans and their tax implications.
* The applicability of value-added tax (VAT) to business transactions, including international operations.
