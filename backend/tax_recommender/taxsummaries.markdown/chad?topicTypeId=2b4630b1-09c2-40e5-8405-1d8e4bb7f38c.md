Last reviewed - 12 August 2024

## Apprenticeship tax

The tax base includes the gross amount of salaries, premiums, related sums, and benefits in kind paid to all employees (permanent and temporary).

The rate is 1.2%.

The filing deadline is the 15th day of the month following the month of payment of salaries and the payment of the due tax is at latest the month end following this filing.

The penalties are as follows:

* For late filing: the interest delay is 1.5% up to 50% per month determined on the principal amount of the due tax.
* For late payment: the interest delay is 2% per month determined on the principal amount of the due tax.

## Fixed tax

The fixed tax is related to permanent employees of a company. The tax base includes the gross amount of wages, salaries, various allowances, pensions, allocations, and bonuses paid during the calendar year concerned, without any need to distinguish between the periods to which they relate; it also includes benefits in kind.

The rate is 7.5%.

The filing deadline is at latest the 15th day of the month following the month of payment of the salaries and the payment of the due tax is at latest the month end following this filing.

The penalties are as follows:

* For the late filing: the interest delay is 1.5% up to 50% per month determined on the principal amount of the due tax.
* For the late payment: the interest delay is 2% per month determined on the principal amount of the due tax.

## Rural Intervention Fund (FIR)

The FIR is a fixed tax of XAF 40 per employee per month to be withheld on the salary.

The payment and the depositing of the corresponding tax return have to be performed prior to the month end following the month of payment of the salaries.

## Social security contributions

Social security contributions in Chad are due both by the employer and the employee. Employer contributions are 16.5% of the gross salary limited to XAF 500,000 per month (XAF 82,500 upper limit). Employee contributions are 3.5% of the gross salary limited to XAF 500,000 per month (XAF 17,500 upper limit). The social security contributions due by the employee are deductible from taxable income and are withheld by the employer on a monthly basis.

The table below summarises the items and applicable rates.

| **Type** | **Rate (%)** | **Basic ceiling of contribution (XAF)** | **Ceiling of contribution (XAF)** |
