# Indonesia


## Overview

Last reviewed - 23 December 2024

Indonesia, located between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean along the equator between Asia and Australia, is divided into 38 provinces, with Jakarta as its capital. The official language of Indonesia is Indonesian, and the currency is the rupiah (IDR).

Indonesia, which consists of over 17,000 islands and approximately 280 million people, is the world's fourth-most-populous country. It is also the world's third-largest democracy, and the world's largest archipelagic state.

Indonesia continues its serious efforts to promote foreign investment as well as domestic investment, capital accumulation, and the export of goods other than energy and mineral resources to expedite economic development and to become internationally competitive. A broad range of deregulatory measures have been implemented, and additional measures and tax facilities can be expected to further enhance the investment climate.
