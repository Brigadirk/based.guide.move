## Corporate - Withholding taxes

Last reviewed - 05 September 2024

WHT rates are as follows:

| Type of income | WHT rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Dividends | 5 |
| Interest | 15 |
| Royalties and other payments | 20 |
| Fees for technical projects, management fees, and consultancy and other related services | 20 |
| By exception, fees received by contractors of every kind of technical projects and lessors of public, municipal, association, or port proceeds | 3% on the value of the project under construction or lease payment |

Legal entities tax resident in Greece are not subject to WHT in relation to royalties, fees received for the provision of consultancy and other related services, and management fees, unless provided to general government bodies.

Legal entities that are not tax resident in Greece and do not maintain a PE in Greece are not subject to Greek WHT in relation to technical services, consultancy services, or other related services and management fees.

By virtue of the provisions of the Ministerial Circular 1007/2017, it is clarified that the fees for technical services, management fees, fees for consulting services, and the remuneration for similar services received by an EU legal entity through its PE in Greece are not subject to WHT.

The above exemption does not include the fees received by EU legal entities from the services provided to the general government bodies, as well as the fees for technical services received by the EU legal entities.

Conversely, non-EU foreign legal entities that maintain a PE in Greece are subject to Greek WHT in relation to the provision of the aforementioned services.

Legal entities that are tax resident in Greece or foreign legal entities that maintain a PE in Greece are not subject to WHT in relation to royalty payments.

The exemption from the obligation of WHT for payments of dividends, interest, and royalties by a Greek subsidiary to its parent company includes payments of dividends, interest, and royalties to Greek parent companies.

For the exemption from dividend WHT, the following conditions apply:

* The receiving legal entity should own shares, parts, or a participation of at least 10%, on the basis of the value or number, in the share capital, right to profits, or voting rights of the distributing taxpayer.
* The minimum holding percentage of shares or parts or participations should be held for at least 24 months (subject to providing a bank guarantee, the exemption may apply prior to completing the 24-month holding period).
* The receiving legal entity should be:
  + included in the forms enumerated in Annex I Part A of Directive 2011/96/EU, as in force
  + tax resident in an EU member state according to the legislation of such state and not be considered as tax resident in a third country in application of the terms of the DTT concluded with such third country, and
  + subject, without the option or exemption, to one of the taxes mentioned in Annex I Part B of Directive 2011/96/EU, or to any other tax that may in the future replace one of those taxes.

A general anti-abuse rule is applicable by virtue of which the tax exemption in case of collection and payment of dividends is lifted in case it is considered that a ‘non-genuine arrangement’ exists. A ‘non-genuine arrangement’ is an arrangement that has not been put into place for valid commercial reasons reflecting the economic reality.

For the exemption from WHT for interest and royalty payments, the following conditions apply:

* The receiving legal entity should directly own shares, parts, or a participation of at least 25%, on the basis of the value or number, in the share capital, right to profits, or voting rights of the paying taxpayer; the paying taxpayer directly owns shares, parts, or a participation of at least 25% in the share capital of the receiving entity; or a third legal entity directly owns shares, parts, or a participation of at least 25% in the share capital of the receiving entity and the paying legal entity.
* The minimum holding percentage of shares or parts or participations should be held for at least 24 months (subject to providing a bank guarantee, the exemption may apply prior to completing the 24-month holding period).
* The receiving legal entity should be:
  + included in the forms enumerated in Annex I Part A of Directive 2003/49/EU, as in force
  + tax resident in an EU member state according to the legislation of such state and not be considered as tax resident in a third country in application of the terms of the DTT concluded with such third country, and
  + subject, without the option or exemption, to one of the taxes mentioned in Annex I Part B of Directive 2003/49/EU, or to any other tax that may in the future replace one of those taxes.

Payments of interest of bank loans (excluding bond loans), including default interest, as well as interest of intra-bank deposits, are exempt from WHT.

Interest received from Greek government bonds and treasury bills, as well as from listed corporate bonds, by legal entities that are not tax resident in Greece and that do not maintain a PE in Greece are not subject to WHT.

The following table provides a summary of the WHTs applicable under the respective DTTs entered into by Greece:

18. Exemption (0% rate) applies when the beneficiary is a bank or when the interest is paid or guaranteed to/by certain government or local authorities or paid for the sales on credit of industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment or sales on credit of goods or products between enterprises.
19. The 5% rate is applicable if the beneficial owner is a company that directly or indirectly held, throughout a six-month period that includes the date on which the right to dividends is determined, at least 10% of: (i) the capital or voting rights of the said company in the case where the company distributing the dividends is a resident of Greece or (ii) the voting rights of the said company in the case where the company distributing the dividends is a resident of Japan, unless the dividends are deducted in calculating the taxable income of the company in this Contracting State, in which case 10% should apply.

In general, it should be noted that certain DTTs may include specific clauses in specific cases that are not all captured in the table; therefore, a careful review of each DTT is highly advisable.
