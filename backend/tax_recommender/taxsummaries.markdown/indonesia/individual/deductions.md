## Individual - Deductions

Last reviewed - 23 December 2024

## Employment expenses

Deductible employment expenses are:

|  | IDR (*per annum*) |
| --- | --- |
| Occupational expenses (5% of gross income, maximum IDR 500,000/month) | 6,000,000 |
| Employee contribution to *BPJS Ketenagakerjaan* for old age security savings (2% of gross income) | Full amount |
| Pension contribution (1% of gross income, maximum IDR 100,423/month) \* | 10,042,300 |

\* Valid for March 2024 through February 2025.

## Personal deductions

Non-business expenses are not claimable as tax deductible expenses.

### Charitable contributions

Certain donations, such as for national disaster, research and development, education facility, sport development, and social infrastructure, are deductible if the requirements are met. Some religious contributions/alms (e.g. *zakat* for Muslim taxpayers and tithe for Christian taxpayers) are also deductible if paid to certain bodies acknowledged by the government.

## Personal allowances

The annual personal relief available is shown below.

|  | IDR |
| --- | --- |
| Taxpayer | 54,000,000 |
| Wife | 4,500,000 |
| Dependants (maximum three), each | 4,500,000 |

Personal relief is deductible against taxable income. Relief is not available to non-resident taxpayers.

## Business deductions

Business expenses are generally claimable as tax deductible expenses, in most respects, in the same manner as for corporate taxpayers (*see [Deductions](../corporate/deductions.html) in the Corporate tax summary*), except for certain individuals (*see Business income in the [Income determination](income-determination.html) section*).

## Losses

Losses incurred by individuals that are attributable to their business and are not subject to a final income tax and not opting for a calculation norm tax may be carried forward for a maximum of five years.
