## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives

Last reviewed - 09 February 2025

The Tax Code introduced that, generally, tax incentives can be provided by the Tax Code only.

However, benefits for certain taxes, except VAT, excise tax, and tax for subsoil use, can be provided by the President of Uzbekistan, but only in the form of reduction of the established tax rate and not by more than for 50% and not for the period of more than three years.

## Tax incentives in free economic zones

The free economic zones of Navoi, Urgut, Gijduvan, Kokand, Termez, Namangan, Sirdaryo, Bukhoro-agro, Khazarasp, and Andijan; the pharmaceutical free economic zones of Nukus-pharm, Zaamin-pharm, Kosonsoy-pharm, Sirdaryo-pharm, Boysun-pharm, Bustanlik-pharm, Andijon-pharm, and Parkent-pharm; the special industrial zones of Angren and Djizzak; the fish production zone of Balik ishlab chikaruvchi; the free touristic zone of Charvak; and the special industrial hub of mechanical and electrical engineering in the region of Andijan are exempt from:

* land tax, property tax (for legal entities), and water usage tax
* customs payments (except for VAT and customs processing fee) for construction materials not produced in Uzbekistan and imported for implementation of projects as per the investment agreement for the period of construction
* customs payments (except customs processing fee) at importation of technological equipment not produced in Uzbekistan, as per approved list, and
* customs payments (except customs processing fee) at importation of raw materials, and materials and components used in production of goods intended for export.

By virtue of the Law of the Republic of Uzbekistan of 12 July 2022, amendments have been introduced to the Tax Code of Uzbekistan. Specifically, participants of special economic zones are exempt from payment of CIT for specific periods depending on the amount of their investment:

| Amount of investment (USD) | Period (years) |
| --- | --- |
| 3 million to 5 million | 3 |
| 5 million to 15 million | 5 |
| 15 million and more | 10 |

Participants of special economic zones are also entitled to deferred payment of VAT on import of goods for a period of up to 120 days.

## Tax incentives in certain zones

Effective from 14 September 2021, certain territories of the Fergana region have been selected as territories with a special tax regime: Sokh district, Chungar mahalla of Rishtan district, as well as Shakhimardan mahalla, Yordan, and st. Tashtepa - two mahallas of Khosilot of Fergana region. The tax rates for CIT, PIT, ST, and turnover tax is set at 1% in these territories.

In addition, a coefficient of 0.1 is applied to the tax rates for property tax, land tax, and tax for the use of water resources in relation to immovable property and land plots located in separate territories, as well as water resources used in these territories.

## Tax incentives for foreign direct investments

As per the Tax Code, enterprises attracting direct foreign investments may be exempt from payment of property tax, land tax, and water usage tax, subject to certain criteria, including share of foreign participation, type of activity (as per the pre-approved list), location of the enterprise, etc.

Entities attracting foreign direct investments are granted tax exemptions for specific periods, which vary depending on investment amount.

The above tax incentives are granted if the following conditions are met (without limitation):

* Enterprises shall be specialised in production of goods or provision of services/works in certain industries as per approved list.
* The enterprises are located in any city or rural area settlement of Uzbekistan, except for Tashkent region and Tashkent city (exception is provided to companies providing travel services and waste management services).
* Republic of Uzbekistan does not provide sovereign guarantees for such foreign investment.
* Share of foreign capital of enterprises should not be less than 33%.
* Investment should be made in hard currency or new/modern technological equipment.
* At least 50% of the respective tax savings should be reinvested for further development of enterprises.

## Incentives for oil and gas exploration and extraction companies

Foreign companies carrying out oil and gas exploration works, as well as their foreign contractors/subcontractors engaged in such works, are exempt from payment of:

* Income tax (except for interest received from funds placed in commercial banks), property tax, land tax, and water usage tax for the period of exploration work.
* Customs payments (except for VAT and customs clearance fees) when importing equipment, material, and technical resources and services necessary for the exploration and related work.

Exemption of VAT when importing equipment, material, and technical resources and services necessary for the exploration and related works was abolished from 1 October 2020.

Resident corporations supplying materials and rendering services to foreign companies carrying out oil and gas exploration are not exempt from VAT as of 1 October 2020.

Moreover, the seven-year CIT holiday envisaged for oil and gas production joint ventures was also abolished from 1 October 2020.

## Incentives for the electrical and agricultural engineering industry

Companies in the electrical industry are granted tax benefits for the period from 1 January 2024 to 1 January 2027 in the form of a 50% reduction in income tax and property tax rates. These benefits can be used by entities where the amount of revenue from the sale of electrical products at the end of the reporting period is at least 80% of the total revenue.

Until 1 January 2027, the rates of the CIT and property tax for enterprises of the electrical industry are reduced by 50%.

## Incentives for carrying out export activities

Since January 1, 2025, in accordance with the WTO agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures, income tax and turnover tax benefits for exporters and re-exporters of goods and services have been abolished.

Abolition of Export Privileges from January 1, 2025: 0% CIT rate for the export of goods (services) is abolished. Turnover taxpayer will include income from exports into the turnover tax base.

From 1 April 2021, 50% of the expenses of domestic exporters related to the opening and maintenance of trading houses, office rent, retail and warehouse premises, and advertising campaigns will be compensated at the expense of the Export Promotion Agency under the Ministry of Investment and Foreign Trade.

From 1 June 2021, participants in foreign economic activity engaged in the import of goods for more than three years, who have fulfilled their obligations under customs payments, but due to their financial situation are not able to pay in due time, are granted the right to pay customs payments in instalments. At the same time, the amount of taxes or customs payments paid in instalments should not exceed 50% of the total amount of taxes paid in the last three years.

## Incentives for the textile industry

As of 1 January 2025, tax incentives available to textile and knitwear enterprise exporters (earning at least 80% of revenue from foreign supplies) were not extended and considered abolished (previously 1% ST rate and deferral of debt repayment on property tax).

Textile enterprises should now pay VAT at importation of cotton, artificial and synthetic fibres, wool, raw materials, etc. At the same time, exemption from other customs payments (excise tax and customs duty) at importation of the above goods remains effective and extended to all textile enterprises (previously, limited to the members of 'Uztextilprom' association).
