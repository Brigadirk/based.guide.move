# Equatorial Guinea
## Overview
Last reviewed - 07 May 2024
Equatorial Guinea (EG), a country located on the west coast of Central Africa, obtained its independence from Spain in 1968. It is composed of a mainland portion plus five islands. The country is divided into eight provinces, and its capital city is Malabo. Equatorial Guinea has a republican form of government, and the official languages are Spanish, Portuguese, and French. Equatorial Guinea's currency is the *Coopération Financière en Afrique centrale* (Central African CFA) franc (XAF).
Equatorial Guinea has experienced rapid economic growth due to the discovery of large offshore oil and gas reserves. In the last decade, Equatorial Guinea has become Sub-Saharan Africa's third largest oil and gas producer and exporter. Public works, banking, forestry, and fishing are also major components of its gross domestic product (GDP). Undeveloped natural resources include titanium, iron ore, manganese, uranium, and alluvial gold.

# Equatorial Guinea
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 07 May 2024
The corporate income tax (CIT) must be paid by any resident entity.
Taxable profit is determined by deducting from gross income all expenses tied to the performance of taxable activities in Equatorial Guinea. In principle, all expenses are deductible, but the Tax Code provides deductibility rules for some of them.
Resident companies are subject to CIT on their worldwide income (even if, in practice, it is tolerated for CIT only to be applied to income related to activities carried out in Equatorial Guinea). Non-resident entities and individuals are subject to a 10% withholding tax (WHT) on gross income derived from Equatorial Guinea sources. Mobilisation and demobilisation services performed by resident entities or individuals are subject to WHT at a rate of 5%.
The CIT rate is 25% on taxable profits.
## Minimum income tax (MIT)
The MIT rate for fiscal year 2025 is 1,5% of the turnover of the company for the current year. MIT is paid in two modalities : the first payment is due by July 15th (taxable basis : income received by the company from January to June) and the second payment is due by January 15th (taxable basis : income received by the company from July to December).
MIT is an advance payment of the CIT and therefore, deductible from the final CIT due by a taxpayer.
## Local income taxes
There are no provincial or local income taxes in Equatorial Guinea.

# Equatorial Guinea
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 07 May 2024
## WHT in the general regime (i.e. any sector other than the oil and gas sector)
According to the New EG Tax Code, there is a 10% tax withheld on the gross incomes obtained in Equatorial Guinea by non-resident entities. Therefore, as of 1 January 2025, all services provided to entities located in Equatorial Guinea will be subject to 10% WHT in Equatorial Guinea since the income is from an Equatorial Guinea source.
There is a 10% WHT on royalties for non-CEMAC residents.
Dividends and interests paid to non-residents are subject to 15% WHT.
Concerning CEMAC resident entities or individuals, they are subject to a maximum WHT rate of 10%. For the record, CEMAC countries include Cameroon, Gabon, Chad, Central African Republic, Republic of Congo, and Equatorial Guinea.
## WHT on the oil and gas sector
In Equatorial Guinea:
In practice, the tax authorities consider this tax only applies to sales of services.
The tax basis is composed of the gross amount paid to the provider.
The WHT paid by non-resident entities/individuals is considered as final tax.
The WHT suffered by resident entities/individuals is considered as a tax credit to be offset against the CIT due.

# Equatorial Guinea
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 07 May 2024
## Depreciation
A straight-line method of computation of depreciation should be applied to fixed assets according to the normal useful lives of the assets involved, as provided by the Tax Code.
## Goodwill
Goodwill is, in principle, not deductible.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses can be amortised (regarding tangible assets) or fully deductible (regarding registration costs and fees).
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are fully deductible..
## Bad debt
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions are deductible, given they are for philanthropic, sport, educative, scientific, social, or family purposes and do not exceed 0.25% of the turnover for the fiscal year of the company.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are not deductible.
## Taxes
Only professional taxes are deductible.
## Net operating losses
Net operating losses can be carried forward for five years. Losses cannot be carried back. Losses of one entity cannot be transferred to another entity in a reorganisation.
In theory, when the results of a company, no matter the kind of company, are negative during a maximum period of five consecutive years, this company may immediately be removed from the tax register by the Tax Administration for the practice of the activity for which it was registered, except when the company is newly created.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
The deductibility of the technical assistance made by the parent company to its subsidiary is limited to 5% of the intermediary tax result (accounting result plus potential fiscal reintegration).

# Equatorial Guinea
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 07 May 2024
Equatorial Guinea law does not provide specific provisions for taxation of groups.
## Transfer pricing
According to the New EG Tax Code, entities or companies that depend on or are controlled by companies established outside of Equatorial Guinea, as well as those that maintain relationships of connection between them, whose annual income volume is equal to or greater than XAF 250,000,000 or, whose net assets are equal to or greater than XAF 125,000,000, must attach to their Annual CIT return, a detailed statement of the gross amounts of the operations carried out between them.
Furthermore, the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC) Directive related to CIT states that head office costs are fully deductible if they correspond to real operations, and they are neither unusual nor exaggerated.
However, there is no regulation in force providing a definition of ‘transfer of profits’ and neither any criterion that would allow the determination of the ‘exaggerated’ nature of costs.
Finally, the new foreign exchange regulations applicable within the CEMAC Zone since 1 March 2019 provides the following requirements for inter-group services: requirement to respect the arm's-length principle, requirement of effective service delivery and that they correspond to real needs, and requirement for the payment of a fair price.
## Thin capitalisation
According to the Tax Code:
“Interest paid to the partners for amounts made available to the company, in addition to their capital contributions, no matter the form of the company, will be admitted (for deduction) within the limits established for the Central Bank plus three (3) points"
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
“Regarding legal entities located outside of Equatorial Guinea and which have subsidiary or interdependence ties with other legal entities or companies located in Equatorial Guinea, the place of their taxation will be the same as that of the legal entities or companies with which it maintains those ties (i.e. Equatorial Guinea). These latter are jointly and severally liable for the payment of the tax owed by the legal entities located outside of Equatorial Guinea.”
