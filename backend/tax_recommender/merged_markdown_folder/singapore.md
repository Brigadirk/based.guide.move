## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 06 May 2024
## Social security contributions
### Central Provident Fund (CPF)
The CPF is Singapore's national pension scheme. Contributions are payable by Singapore citizens and Singapore Permanent Residents (i.e. SPR obtained via immigration rules) only. Employers and employees contribute 17% and 20%, respectively, of ordinary monthly wages, up to an income ceiling of SGD 6,800 (from 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2024). Their respective maximum contributions are therefore SGD 1,156 and SGD 1,360 per month. The rates are applicable to Singaporeans and SPRs (from third year and onwards) aged 55 years and below.
These rates also apply to additional wages (e.g. year-end bonus), up to the maximum contributions below:
| Total wages |  | Additional wages subject to CPF contribution (calendar year 2024) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Not more than SGD 102,000 | Annual ordinary wages not more than SGD 81,600\* | Actual additional wages |
| Annual ordinary wages exceed SGD 81,600\* | Actual additional wages |
| Exceed SGD 102,000 | Annual ordinary wages not more than SGD 81,600\* | SGD 102,000 less annual ordinary wages |
| Annual ordinary wages exceed SGD 81,600\* | SGD 20,400 (SGD 102,000 - SGD 81,600\*) |
\* This rate above is based on the annual ordinary wage ceiling for calendar year 2024 (i.e. SGD 6,800 x 12).
Reduced rates apply for employees who are earning less than SGD 750 per month, as well as for those above 55 years of age, although these rates are being gradually increased.
The income ceiling will be increased to SGD 7,400 from 1 January 2025 and SGD 8,000 from 1 January 2026. The annual ordinary wage ceiling and maximum monthly contributions for employers and employees will be increased accordingly; however, the annual salary (comprising ordinary wages and additional wages) ceiling remains at SGD 102,000.
Foreign nationals and their employers are precluded from making CPF contributions. Foreign employees who become Singapore permanent residents, and their employers, may contribute at reduced rates for the first two years.
### Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS)
The SRS is a voluntary scheme to encourage employees and the self-employed to save for retirement over and above their CPF savings. The maximum amount to be contributed is subject to an income cap of SGD 102,000. Employers are allowed to contribute to their employees’ SRS accounts, subject to the contribution limits below. Employees will be taxable on these employer contributions, but will be allowed corresponding tax relief.
The contribution rate caps for contributions made to the SRS scheme are as follows.
| Residency status | Rate cap (%) | Contribution cap (SGD) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Singapore citizens or permanent residents | 15 | 15,300 |
| Foreigners | 35 | 35,700 |
## Capital gains taxes
There is no capital gains tax in Singapore. Where an individual enters into a series of capital transactions, however, the tax authorities may take the view that the individual is carrying on a business and assess that person to income tax accordingly.
## Goods and services tax (GST)
### Supplies made in Singapore and importation of goods
GST is charged at 9% on the supply of goods and services made in Singapore by a taxable person in the course or furtherance of one's business and on the importation of goods into Singapore.
The only exemptions from GST are prescribed financial services, the sale or rental of residential properties, the sale of digital payment tokens, and the import and local supply of prescribed investment precious metals. Zero-rating only applies to the export of goods and international services (subject to conditions).
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth or net worth taxes in Singapore.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Estate duty has been abolished for deaths occurring on or after 15 February 2008.
## Property tax
Property tax is levied annually on the value of houses, land, buildings, or tenements.
For residential properties, owner-occupier tax rates range from 0% to 32% and non-owner occupier tax rates range from 12% to 36%. The tax rates depend on the annual value bands, which are subject to periodic revisions.
A one-off property tax rebate at tiered rates of 15% to 100% of property tax payable is provided for owner-occupied residential properties in 2024.
For non-residential properties, such as commercial and industrial buildings and land, the tax rate is 10%.
## Excise taxes
Excise duties are imposed on certain intoxicating liquors, tobacco products, motor vehicles, and petroleum products. Duties are also imposed on gambling and other games of chance.
## Other non-income taxes
### Stamp duties
Stamp duties are levied on written documents (as well as electronic instruments executed on or after 4 October 2018) relating to immovable properties, leases, and stocks and shares.
#### Immovable properties
Stamp duties are typically payable by the buyer (i.e. buyer’s stamp duty or BSD); however, seller's stamp duty (SSD) and additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) have been introduced as measures to cool the residential property market.
There is BSD of up to 6% for residential property and up to 5% for non-residential property on the purchase price or market value, whichever is the higher. There is an ABSD of up to 65% and an SSD of up to 15% on the price or market value of the property, whichever is the higher, depending on the type of property (residential or industrial), the residency status of the buyer, the holding period of the property, and the number of properties owned.
Foreigners of certain nationalities who fall within the scope of the respective free trade agreements will be accorded the same treatment as Singaporeans.
Certain transfers of equity interest in property-holding entities (PHEs) that own (directly or indirectly) primarily Singapore residential properties could attract additional conveyance duties (ACDs) for buyers (up to 71%) and sellers (at 12%) who are significant owners (as defined) of PHEs, as well as for a buyer who would become a significant owner after acquiring an equity interest in the PHEs. For acquisition of equity interest in a company, share duty remains payable in addition to the ACDs.
ABSD and ACDs are also levied on transfers of any residential property and equity interest in PHEs (where the significant ownership threshold is met) into living trusts where there is no identifiable owner of the property or equity interest at the time of transfer. Renunciation of interest in residential properties held in trust in certain scenarios will also attract applicable duties.
#### Leases
Leases attract duty at 0.4% of the total rent (for leases of up to four years) or 0.4% of four times the average annual rent for the period of the lease (for leases longer than four years), but leases with average annual rents not exceeding SGD 1,000 are exempt from stamp duty.
#### Stocks and shares
Instruments effecting the transfer of stocks and shares are subject to stamp duty of 0.2% on the purchase price or market value of the shares transferred, whichever is the higher.
## Local non-income taxes
### Foreign Worker Levy (FWL)
The FWL is a monthly levy that employers are liable to pay for each foreign employee (Work Permit or S Pass holders) hired. The levy rate depends on the employer’s industry and the ratio of foreigners to Singaporeans and permanent residents employed in the company.
### Skills Development Levy (SDL)
Employers are required to contribute a levy for each employee at 0.25% of the monthly total wages. The minimum payable is SGD 2 for an employee earning less than SGD 800 a month and the maximum is SGD 11.25 for an employee earning more than SGD 4,500 per month.
The SDL and SDF are administered by the Skills Future Singapore Agency with the CPF Board as the collecting agent.

# Singapore
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 30 May 2024
## Taxable period
The tax basis period is the calendar year; however, the accounting period will generally be adopted.
## Tax returns
Tax is computed for each tax year based on the income earned in the preceding year (the tax basis period). The corporation files an estimate of its income within three months of the end of the accounting period followed by a return of income by 30 November of the tax year, and the tax is assessed by the Comptroller of Income Tax. All companies are required to file their tax returns electronically. There is no fixed date for the issue of assessments.
## Payment of tax
Assessed tax is payable within one month after the service of the notice of assessment, whether or not a notice of objection to the assessment has been lodged with the tax authorities. Application may be made to the Comptroller to pay estimated tax liabilities on a monthly basis. However, the Comptroller is under no obligation to grant such an application.
Late payment of tax will attract penalties, up to a maximum of 17% of the outstanding tax.
## Tax audit process
The IRAS adopts a risk-based approach to identifying compliance risk, with a focus on improving the behaviour of taxpayers who pose a higher risk of non-compliance. It also prioritises and tailors specific compliance programmes that aim to identify taxpayers who have made mistakes in their tax returns, create an audit presence in the community to deter non-compliance by other taxpayers, educate taxpayers on their tax obligations and how to comply with these, and identify areas of tax law, policies, and processes where the tax system can be simplified.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations is four years from the year of assessment, but does not apply where there has been fraud or wilful default by the taxpayer.
The IRAS is focusing its compliance efforts on the following:
The IRAS is currently focusing its GST audit and investigation efforts on businesses involved in Missing Trader Fraud arrangements.

## Overview
Last reviewed - 30 May 2024
Singapore, an island country in Southeast Asia, is located off the southern edge of the Malay Peninsula, between Malaysia and Indonesia. Its official languages are English, Malay, Chinese, and Tamil, and the currency is the Singapore dollar (SGD).
Singapore is one of the world's most prosperous countries, with strong international trading links (its port is one of the world's busiest in terms of tonnage handled) and with a *per capita* gross domestic product (GDP) comparable to or exceeding that of many nations in Western Europe.
Singapore has a highly developed and successful free-market economy. The economy depends heavily on exports, particularly in information technology products and pharmaceuticals, as well as a vibrant financial services sector.
Over the longer term, the government aims to establish a new path that focuses on innovation and value creation. Singapore has attracted major investments in pharmaceuticals and medical technology production, and it will continue to establish itself as Southeast Asia's financial and technology hub.

## Goods and services tax (GST)
### Supplies made in Singapore and importation of goods
GST is charged at 9% on the supply of goods and services made in Singapore by a taxable person in the course or furtherance of one's business and on the importation of goods into Singapore.
The only exemptions from GST are prescribed financial services, the sale or rental of residential properties, the sale of digital payment tokens, and the import and local supply of prescribed investment precious metals. Zero-rating only applies to the export of goods and international services (subject to conditions).
Import reliefs (e.g. Major Exporter Scheme, Approved Contract Manufacturer and Trader Scheme) are available to ease the cash-flow burden of GST-registered businesses.
GST registration is required if a business makes taxable supplies in excess of SGD 1 million for a 12-month period. Voluntary registration is permitted if the taxable supplies are below the registration threshold, subject to conditions. A business may claim input tax credits on its purchases and expenses after its GST registration, subject to satisfying the prescribed input tax conditions.
### Overseas Vendor Registration regime
The Overseas Vendor Registration regime brings to tax business-to-consumer (B2C) supplies of remote services (i.e. digital services and non-digital services) and imported low-value goods. There are specific definitions for remote services and imported low-value goods.
Under the Overseas Vendor Registration regime, suppliers belonging outside Singapore are required to register, charge, and account for GST on supplies of remote services and imported low-value goods supplied to non-GST registered customers in Singapore. Under certain conditions, local and overseas operators of electronic marketplaces may also be regarded as the supplier of the supplies made by the overseas suppliers through these marketplaces.
Overseas suppliers that supply imported low-value goods and remote services to Singapore non-GST-registered customers in excess of SGD 100,000 in a 12-month period and have a global annual turnover of at least SGD 1 million are required to register for GST in Singapore.
### Reverse charge
Reverse charge applies to local businesses that are subject to input tax restriction due to the making of certain exempt supplies or carrying on of non-business activities. If these businesses are registered for GST, they are required to self-account for GST on their purchases of in-scope imported services procured from overseas service providers and on their purchases of imported low-value goods. These businesses may, in turn, claim the GST accounted for as their input tax, subject to the normal rules for input tax recovery.
If these businesses are not registered for GST, they would be liable for GST registration under the reverse charge rules if their purchase of in-scope services and imported low-value goods exceeds SGD 1 million in a 12-month period.
## Customs and excise duties
Singapore is essentially a free port with minimal import restrictions. Customs and excise duties are imposed on certain intoxicating liquors, tobacco products, motor vehicles, and petroleum products.
## Property tax
Property tax is levied annually on the annual value of houses, land, buildings, or tenements.
For residential properties, owner-occupier tax rates range from 0% to 32% and non-owner occupier tax rates range from 12% to 36%. The tax rates depend on the annual value bands, which are subject to periodic revisions.
A one-off property tax rebate at tiered rates of 15% (capped at SGD 1,000 for private properties) to 100%, depending on the type of property, is provided for owner-occupied residential properties in 2024.
For non-residential properties, such as commercial and industrial buildings and land, the tax rate is 10%.
## Stamp duties
Stamp duties are levied on written documents (as well as electronic instruments executed on or after 4 October 2018) relating to immovable properties, leases, and stocks and shares.
### Immovable properties
Stamp duties are typically payable by the buyer (i.e. buyer’s stamp duty or BSD); however, seller's stamp duty (SSD) and additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) have been introduced as measures to cool the residential property market.
There is BSD of up to 6% for residential property and up to 5% for non-residential property on the purchase price or market value, whichever is the higher. There is an ABSD of up to 65% and an SSD of up to 15% on the price or market value of the property, whichever is the higher, depending on the type of property (residential or industrial), the residency status of the buyer, the holding period of the property, and the number of properties owned.
Foreigners of certain nationalities who fall within the scope of the respective free trade agreements will be accorded the same treatment as Singaporeans.
Certain transfers of equity interest in property-holding entities (PHEs) that own (directly or indirectly) primarily Singapore residential properties could attract additional conveyance duties (ACDs) for buyers (up to 71%) and sellers (at 12%) who are significant owners (as defined) of PHEs, as well as for a buyer who would become a significant owner after acquiring an equity interest in the PHEs. For acquisition of equity interest in a company, share duty remains payable in addition to the ACDs.
ABSD and ACDs are also levied on transfers of any residential property and equity interest in PHEs (where the significant ownership threshold is met) into living trusts where there is no identifiable owner of the property or equity interest at the time of transfer. Renunciation of interest in residential properties held in trust in certain scenarios will also attract applicable duties.
### Leases
Leases attract duty at 0.4% of the total rent (for leases of up to four years) or 0.4% of four times the average annual rent for the period of the lease (for leases longer than four years), but leases with average annual rents not exceeding SGD 1,000 are exempt from stamp duty.
### Stocks and shares
Instruments effecting the transfer of stocks and shares are subject to stamp duty of 0.2% on the purchase price or market value of the shares transferred, whichever is the higher.
## Foreign Worker Levy (FWL)
The FWL is a monthly levy that employers are liable to pay for each foreign employee (Work Permit or S Pass holders) hired. The levy rate depends on the employer’s industry and the ratio of foreigners to Singaporeans and permanent residents employed in the company.
## Payroll taxes
## Social security contributions
### Central Provident Fund (CPF)
The CPF is Singapore's national pension scheme. Contributions are payable by Singapore citizens and Singapore Permanent Residents (i.e. SPR obtained via immigration rules) only. Employers and employees contribute 17% and 20%, respectively, of ordinary monthly wages, up to an income ceiling of SGD 6,800. Their respective maximum contributions are therefore SGD 1,156 and SGD 1,360 per month. The rates are applicable to Singaporeans and SPRs (from third year and onwards) aged 55 years and below.
These rates also apply to additional wages (e.g. year-end bonus), up to the maximum contributions below:
| Total wages |  | Additional wages subject to CPF contribution (calendar year 2024) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Not more than SGD 102,000 | Annual ordinary wages not more than SGD 81,600\* | Actual additional wages |
| Annual ordinary wages exceed SGD 81,600\* | Actual additional wages |
| Exceed SGD 102,000 | Annual ordinary wages not more than SGD 81,600\* | SGD 102,000 less annual ordinary wages |
| Annual ordinary wages exceed SGD 81,600\* | SGD 20,400 (SGD 102,000 - SGD 81,600\*) |
\* This rate is based on the annual ordinary wage ceiling for calendar year 2024 (i.e. SGD 6,800 x 12).
Reduced rates apply for employees who are earning less than SGD 750 per month as well as for those above 55 years of age, although these rates are being gradually increased.
The income ceiling will be increased to SGD 7,400 from 1 January 2025 and SGD 8,000 from 1 January 2026. The annual ordinary wage ceiling and maximum monthly contributions for employers and employees will be increased accordingly; however, the annual salary (comprising ordinary wages and additional wages) ceiling remains at SGD 102,000.
Foreign nationals and their employers are precluded from making CPF contributions. Foreign employees who become Singapore permanent residents, and their employers, may contribute at reduced rates for the first two years.
### Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS)
The SRS is a voluntary scheme to encourage employees and the self-employed to save for retirement over and above their CPF savings. The maximum amount to be contributed is subject to an income cap of SGD 102,000. Employers are allowed to contribute to their employees’ SRS accounts, subject to the contribution limits below. Employees will be taxable on these employer contributions but will be allowed corresponding tax relief.
The contribution rate caps for contributions made to the SRS scheme are as follows:
| Residency status | Rate cap (%) | **Contribution cap (SGD)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Singapore citizens or permanent residents | 15 | 15,300 |
| Foreigners | 35 | 35,700 |
## Carbon tax
Carbon tax at a rate of SGD 25 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) of emissions is applied on the total greenhouse gas emissions of facilities that produce 25,000 or more tCO2e of emissions per year. The carbon tax applies uniformly to all sectors, without exemption, and takes the form of a fixed-price credits-based mechanism. The tax rate will be increased to SGD 45 per tCO2e of emissions for 2026 and 2027, and to SGD 50 to SGD 80 per tCO2e of emissions by 2030. Taxable facilities are allowed to use high quality international carbon credits to offset up to 5% of their taxable emissions.

# Singapore
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 06 May 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year in Singapore is the calendar year. An individual’s income from a preceding calendar year is assessed to tax in the following calendar year (i.e. year of assessment).
## Tax returns
Each taxpayer is required to make an annual return of income and of such particulars as may be required to determine the personal reliefs and deductions. The tax return must be filed on a calendar-year basis and must be submitted by 15 April. If filed electronically, the deadline is 18 April.
## Payment of tax
The tax assessed is payable within one month of the date of the assessment whether or not a notice of objection to the assessment has been lodged with the tax authorities. The notice of objection must be lodged within 30 days of the date of the notice of assessment, failing which the assessment will be treated as final.
In the case of an employee, the tax authorities will, upon application, generally allow the payment of tax by monthly instalments with no interest, using the Interbank GIRO system (an interbank fund transfer system).
### Clearance for foreigners
Singapore does not have payroll withholding. When a foreign citizen employee ceases employment in Singapore or leaves Singapore for a period exceeding three months or on an overseas posting, the employer needs to notify the Singapore tax authorities and withhold all monies due (unless the Singapore taxes are fully borne by the employer) until tax clearance is issued. The notification must be made no later than one month prior to the date of cessation/departure. Foreigners are also subject to tax on unexercised/unvested stock options/awards on a deemed gain basis when they cease employment or leave Singapore.
As a concession, tax clearance need not be obtained in the following scenarios:
## Tax audit process
The tax authority is the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS). It adopts a risk-based approach to identifying compliance risk, with a focus on improving the behaviour of taxpayers who pose a higher risk of non-compliance. The Singapore tax authorities also prioritise and tailor specific compliance programmes that aim to identify taxpayers who have made mistakes in their tax returns, create an audit presence in the community to deter non-compliance by other taxpayers, educate taxpayers on their tax obligations and how to comply with these, and identifying areas of tax law, policies, and processes where the tax system can be simplified.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations is four years from the year of assessment. It does not apply where there has been fraud or wilful default by the taxpayer.
The tax authorities are focused on self-employed taxpayers, who can include doctors, dentists, lawyers, accountants, consultants, commission agents, private tutors, renovation contractors, and bloggers.
Areas of focus include:

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 06 May 2024
Income is taxable when it accrues in or is derived from Singapore, whether or not the individual is resident in Singapore. Income derived from sources outside Singapore is only taxable if it is received in Singapore by a resident individual through a partnership in Singapore.
Resident individuals are entitled to certain personal reliefs and deductions and are subject to graduated tax rates ranging from 0% to 24%. Non-resident individuals are not entitled to any personal reliefs and deductions and are subject to tax at a flat rate of 24%. As a concession, employment income of non-residents is taxed at the higher of a flat rate of 15% or the graduated resident rates with personal reliefs. This concession does not apply to non-resident directors.
## Individual income tax rates
### Residents
A resident individual's taxable income (after setoff of personal reliefs and deductions) is subject to income tax at progressive rates. Current rates from the year of assessment 2024 (income year 2023) are shown below.
| Taxable income (SGD) | | Year of assessment 2024 onwards | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over (column 1) | Not over | Tax on column 1 (SGD) | Percentage on excess (%) |
| 0 | 20,000 | - | - |
| 20,000 | 30,000 | - | 2.00 |
| 30,000 | 40,000 | 200 | 3.50 |
| 40,000 | 80,000 | 550 | 7.00 |
| 80,000 | 120,000 | 3,350 | 11.50 |
| 120,000 | 160,000 | 7,950 | 15.00 |
| 160,000 | 200,000 | 13,950 | 18.00 |
| 200,000 | 240,000 | 21,150 | 19.00 |
| 240,000 | 280,000 | 28,750 | 19.50 |
| 280,000 | 320,000 | 36,550 | 20.00 |
| 320,000 | 500,000 | 44,550 | 22.00 |
| 500,000 | 1,000,000 | 84,150 | 23.00 |
| 1,000,000 |  | 199,150 | 24.00 |
For year of assessment 2024, all resident individuals will be granted a tax rebate of 50% of tax payable, capped at SGD 200.
### Non-residents
Non-resident individuals are taxed at a flat rate of 24%, except that employment income is taxed at a flat rate of 15% or at resident rates with personal reliefs, whichever yields a higher tax. A non-resident director’s remuneration does not qualify for the reduced rate, and withholding tax (WHT) at 24% must be deducted from remuneration paid to a non-resident director.
## Local income taxes
There are no other taxes on income in Singapore.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 06 May 2024
## Social security contributions
### Central Provident Fund (CPF)
The CPF is Singapore's national pension scheme. Contributions are payable by Singapore citizens and Singapore Permanent Residents (i.e. SPR obtained via immigration rules) only. Employers and employees contribute 17% and 20%, respectively, of ordinary monthly wages, up to an income ceiling of SGD 6,800 (from 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2024). Their respective maximum contributions are therefore SGD 1,156 and SGD 1,360 per month. The rates are applicable to Singaporeans and SPRs (from third year and onwards) aged 55 years and below.
These rates also apply to additional wages (e.g. year-end bonus), up to the maximum contributions below:
| Total wages |  | Additional wages subject to CPF contribution (calendar year 2024) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Not more than SGD 102,000 | Annual ordinary wages not more than SGD 81,600\* | Actual additional wages |
| Annual ordinary wages exceed SGD 81,600\* | Actual additional wages |
| Exceed SGD 102,000 | Annual ordinary wages not more than SGD 81,600\* | SGD 102,000 less annual ordinary wages |
| Annual ordinary wages exceed SGD 81,600\* | SGD 20,400 (SGD 102,000 - SGD 81,600\*) |
\* This rate above is based on the annual ordinary wage ceiling for calendar year 2024 (i.e. SGD 6,800 x 12).
Reduced rates apply for employees who are earning less than SGD 750 per month, as well as for those above 55 years of age, although these rates are being gradually increased.
The income ceiling will be increased to SGD 7,400 from 1 January 2025 and SGD 8,000 from 1 January 2026. The annual ordinary wage ceiling and maximum monthly contributions for employers and employees will be increased accordingly; however, the annual salary (comprising ordinary wages and additional wages) ceiling remains at SGD 102,000.
Foreign nationals and their employers are precluded from making CPF contributions. Foreign employees who become Singapore permanent residents, and their employers, may contribute at reduced rates for the first two years.
### Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS)
The SRS is a voluntary scheme to encourage employees and the self-employed to save for retirement over and above their CPF savings. The maximum amount to be contributed is subject to an income cap of SGD 102,000. Employers are allowed to contribute to their employees’ SRS accounts, subject to the contribution limits below. Employees will be taxable on these employer contributions, but will be allowed corresponding tax relief.
The contribution rate caps for contributions made to the SRS scheme are as follows.
| Residency status | Rate cap (%) | Contribution cap (SGD) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Singapore citizens or permanent residents | 15 | 15,300 |
| Foreigners | 35 | 35,700 |
## Capital gains taxes
There is no capital gains tax in Singapore. Where an individual enters into a series of capital transactions, however, the tax authorities may take the view that the individual is carrying on a business and assess that person to income tax accordingly.
## Goods and services tax (GST)
### Supplies made in Singapore and importation of goods
GST is charged at 9% on the supply of goods and services made in Singapore by a taxable person in the course or furtherance of one's business and on the importation of goods into Singapore.
The only exemptions from GST are prescribed financial services, the sale or rental of residential properties, the sale of digital payment tokens, and the import and local supply of prescribed investment precious metals. Zero-rating only applies to the export of goods and international services (subject to conditions).
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth or net worth taxes in Singapore.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Estate duty has been abolished for deaths occurring on or after 15 February 2008.
## Property tax
Property tax is levied annually on the value of houses, land, buildings, or tenements.
For residential properties, owner-occupier tax rates range from 0% to 32% and non-owner occupier tax rates range from 12% to 36%. The tax rates depend on the annual value bands, which are subject to periodic revisions.
A one-off property tax rebate at tiered rates of 15% to 100% of property tax payable is provided for owner-occupied residential properties in 2024.
For non-residential properties, such as commercial and industrial buildings and land, the tax rate is 10%.
## Excise taxes
Excise duties are imposed on certain intoxicating liquors, tobacco products, motor vehicles, and petroleum products. Duties are also imposed on gambling and other games of chance.
## Other non-income taxes
### Stamp duties
Stamp duties are levied on written documents (as well as electronic instruments executed on or after 4 October 2018) relating to immovable properties, leases, and stocks and shares.
#### Immovable properties
Stamp duties are typically payable by the buyer (i.e. buyer’s stamp duty or BSD); however, seller's stamp duty (SSD) and additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) have been introduced as measures to cool the residential property market.
There is BSD of up to 6% for residential property and up to 5% for non-residential property on the purchase price or market value, whichever is the higher. There is an ABSD of up to 65% and an SSD of up to 15% on the price or market value of the property, whichever is the higher, depending on the type of property (residential or industrial), the residency status of the buyer, the holding period of the property, and the number of properties owned.
Foreigners of certain nationalities who fall within the scope of the respective free trade agreements will be accorded the same treatment as Singaporeans.
Certain transfers of equity interest in property-holding entities (PHEs) that own (directly or indirectly) primarily Singapore residential properties could attract additional conveyance duties (ACDs) for buyers (up to 71%) and sellers (at 12%) who are significant owners (as defined) of PHEs, as well as for a buyer who would become a significant owner after acquiring an equity interest in the PHEs. For acquisition of equity interest in a company, share duty remains payable in addition to the ACDs.
ABSD and ACDs are also levied on transfers of any residential property and equity interest in PHEs (where the significant ownership threshold is met) into living trusts where there is no identifiable owner of the property or equity interest at the time of transfer. Renunciation of interest in residential properties held in trust in certain scenarios will also attract applicable duties.
#### Leases
Leases attract duty at 0.4% of the total rent (for leases of up to four years) or 0.4% of four times the average annual rent for the period of the lease (for leases longer than four years), but leases with average annual rents not exceeding SGD 1,000 are exempt from stamp duty.
#### Stocks and shares
Instruments effecting the transfer of stocks and shares are subject to stamp duty of 0.2% on the purchase price or market value of the shares transferred, whichever is the higher.
## Local non-income taxes
### Foreign Worker Levy (FWL)
The FWL is a monthly levy that employers are liable to pay for each foreign employee (Work Permit or S Pass holders) hired. The levy rate depends on the employer’s industry and the ratio of foreigners to Singaporeans and permanent residents employed in the company.
### Skills Development Levy (SDL)
Employers are required to contribute a levy for each employee at 0.25% of the monthly total wages. The minimum payable is SGD 2 for an employee earning less than SGD 800 a month and the maximum is SGD 11.25 for an employee earning more than SGD 4,500 per month.
The SDL and SDF are administered by the Skills Future Singapore Agency with the CPF Board as the collecting agent.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 30 May 2024
Certain payments to non-residents are subject to WHT.
Unless a lower treaty rate applies, interest on loans and rentals from movable property are subject to WHT at the rate of 15%. Royalty payments are subject to WHT at the rate of 10%. The tax withheld represents a final tax and applies only to non-residents that are not carrying on any business in Singapore and have no PE in Singapore. Technical assistance and management fees for services rendered in Singapore by non-resident companies are taxed at the prevailing corporate rate. However, this is not a final tax. Royalties, interest, rental of movable property, technical assistance, and management fees can be exempt from WHT in certain situations or subject to a reduction in tax rates, usually under fiscal incentives or DTAs.
Payments made to public entertainers and non-resident professionals who perform services in Singapore are also subject to a final tax of 15% on their gross income. For public entertainers, this appears to be a final tax unless they qualify to be taxed as Singapore tax residents. However, non-resident professionals may elect to be taxed at the prevailing tax rate for non-resident individuals of 24% on net income if this results in a lower tax cost.
Ship charter fee payments are not subject to WHT.
The WHT rates are shown in the following table.

# Singapore
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 30 May 2024
## Inventory valuation
There are no special rules as to which valuation basis should be adopted for inventories (stock-in-trade) in the case of a continuing business, as long as the basis is consistent from one year to another. However, a last in first out (LIFO) basis of valuation is not permitted for tax purposes. Generally, tax reporting conforms to book reporting.
Inventory that is appropriated on or after 16 November 2021 for a purpose other than for sale or disposal in the ordinary course of the trade or business is treated as having been sold at open market value (except for approved donations).
## Capital gains
There is no tax on capital gains. Where there is a series of transactions or where the holding period of an asset is relatively short, the tax authorities may take the view that a business is being carried on and attempt to assess the gains as trading profits of the corporation. The United Kingdom (UK) Badges of Trade, which are used in judicial decisions to distinguish capital and revenue transactions, are generally applied in determining this issue. They include the existence of a profit-seeking motive, the number of transactions, the nature of the asset, the existence of similar trading transactions or interests, the way the sale was carried out, the source of finance, the interval of time between purchase and sale, and the method of acquisition.
Gains derived by a company from the disposal of ordinary shares that take place between 1 June 2012 and 31 December 2027 will not be taxed if the company has held at least 20% of the ordinary shares in the investee company for a continuous period of at least 24 months prior to the disposal. This protection does not apply to gains derived by an insurance company or disposal of shares in certain companies that trade or hold immovable properties, as well as disposal on or after 1 June 2022 of unlisted shares in companies in the business of trading, holding, or developing immovable properties in Singapore or abroad.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, gains from the disposal of foreign assets on or after 1 January 2024 by any legal person (other than an individual), general partnership, limited partnership, or trust that does not meet the requisite economic substance requirements and is a member of a relevant group (i.e. its assets, liabilities, income, expenses, and cash flows are included in consolidated financial statements prepared by the parent entity of the group) are taxable when received in Singapore. *For further details on foreign-sourced income and the availability of foreign tax credit, refer to Foreign income below.*
## Dividend income
Singapore dividends are exempt in the hands of the recipient.
## Interest income
Singapore-sourced interest income is taxable when it arises, and foreign-sourced interest is taxable when it is received in Singapore. *For further details on foreign-sourced interest income and the availability of foreign tax credit, refer to Foreign income below*.
## Royalty income
Singapore-sourced royalty income is taxable when it arises, and foreign-sourced royalty income is taxable when it is received in Singapore. *For further details on foreign-sourced royalty income and the availability of foreign tax credit, refer to Foreign income below*.
## Foreign income
A corporation, whether resident in Singapore or not, is taxed on foreign income when it is received in Singapore. Legislative provisions govern the basis of treating foreign income as received in Singapore. There are no special rules for taxing the undistributed income of foreign subsidiaries.
Where income is earned from treaty countries, double taxation is avoided by means of foreign tax credit granted under those treaties. For non-treaty countries, unilateral tax credit is given in respect of foreign tax on all foreign-sourced income. These foreign tax credits may be pooled, subject to certain conditions.
Foreign dividends, foreign branch profits, and foreign service fee income received in Singapore may be exempt from tax if they fulfil certain conditions.

# Singapore
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 30 May 2024
In Singapore, the tax residence of a corporation is determined by the place where the central management and control of its business is exercised. This is taken generally to mean the place where the directors meet to exercise *de facto* control. The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) has also set out its practice on how it administers the residency rule, including for foreign-owned investment holding companies and where the board of directors meetings involve the use of virtual meeting technology.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The presence of a PE is largely irrelevant, except for treaty purposes, as Singapore taxes with reference to the source of income rather than the presence of a PE.
However, a PE is a clear indication of source.
The definition of a PE in Singapore’s double taxation agreements (DTAs) is largely based on the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Model Tax Convention definition.
It is generally taken to be a fixed place through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on, and normally includes a place of management, a branch, an office, a factory, a workshop, and a place of extraction of natural resources, etc.
In addition, and subject to the terms of the relevant agreements, a non-resident may have a PE in Singapore if one:
The Singapore tax legislation defines a PE more broadly than most of the DTAs; however, as mentioned above, this is largely irrelevant where a treaty can take precedence.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 30 May 2024
## Depreciation
Tax depreciation is allowable at specified rates on buildings used in qualifying industry sectors, subject to conditions. In 2010, industrial building allowances were replaced by a Land Intensification Allowance. The latter provides for faster depreciation but is subject to approval as it is allowed as a tax incentive. Transitional provisions for industrial building allowances are available for taxpayers that committed to qualifying capital expenditure on or before 22 February 2010.
Tax depreciation is available on machinery and equipment on a straight-line basis over their specified working life for all types of business. In lieu of the straight-line basis, accelerated tax depreciation allowances can be claimed by all businesses on all machinery and equipment in equal instalments over three years. For the year of assessment 2024, depreciation allowance claims may be made over two years, with 75% of the cost written off in the first year of assessment, and the remaining 25% in the following year.
A 100% depreciation allowance is available on capital expenditure incurred on computers, robots, standby generators, and prescribed automation equipment.
Writing down allowances on a straight-line basis over five years are allowable on the cost of acquisition of intellectual property (IP), subject to certain conditions. Taxpayers may make an irrevocable election to claim the writing down allowances over 10 or 15 years instead of five.
Gains on tax depreciable property (i.e. the excess of proceeds over tax base) are taxed as income to the extent that tax depreciation has been allowed; that is, there is a clawback of tax depreciation on the disposal of the asset.
## Goodwill
Payments for the acquisition of goodwill are generally capital in nature and not deductible.
## Start-up expenses
Generally, expenses incurred prior to the commencement of business are not tax deductible. However, most businesses are allowed to deduct expenses incurred in the 12 months immediately preceding the accounting year in which the business earned its first dollar of trading income. Deductible expenses are those that would have been allowed a deduction had they been incurred after the business commenced operations.
## Interest expenses
Interest incurred on capital employed in the production of income, and prescribed borrowing costs that are incurred as a substitute for interest or to reduce interest costs, will be allowed as a tax deduction.
For the years of assessment 2019 to 2028, enhanced tax deduction of 250% of qualifying expenditure is available for R&D carried out in Singapore, subject to conditions. Where the R&D is carried out overseas, a deduction of 100% of qualifying expenditure is allowed.
For the years of assessment 2024 to 2028, enhanced tax deduction of 400% for the first SGD 400,000 of qualifying R&D expenditure is available. *See Enterprise Innovation Scheme* *in the* *[Tax credits and incentives](tax-credits-and-incentives.html)* *section for details*.
Expenditure incurred in relation to R&D cost-sharing arrangements are accorded the same tax treatment as R&D expenses.
## Intellectual property (IP) acquisition expenses
For the years of assessment 2019 to 2028, enhanced tax deduction of 200% is available for each of the following:
## Bad debts
Bad trade debts and provisions for trade debts are deductible to the extent that they are incurred in the business and previously included as trading receipts. Doubtful debts are deductible if they are properly estimated and specific. General provisions for bad debts are not deductible.
Businesses that have elected to align their tax treatment of financial instruments with the accounting treatment prescribed by SFRS 109 (Financial Instruments) will be allowed a tax deduction for impairment losses on trade debts when recognised in the profit and loss account, to the extent that the debts are credit impaired. Correspondingly, any reversal of the credit impaired losses will be taxed.
## Charitable contributions
Donations are deductible only if they are made in cash or another prescribed form and to an approved recipient for the benefit of the local community. The deduction allowed for qualifying donations is generally 250% of the value of the donation. Businesses that send employees to volunteer and provide services to approved charitable institutions from 1 July 2016 to 31 December 2026 will be allowed to deduct 250% of the wages and incidental expenses incurred, subject to certain caps and conditions.
Qualifying donors with family offices operating in Singapore can claim a tax deduction (capped at 40% of the donor’s statutory income) for overseas donations made through qualifying local intermediaries. In addition, donors can claim a deduction (also capped at 40% of the donor’s statutory income) for qualifying cash donations towards overseas emergency humanitarian assistance causes made through designated charities from 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2028. Where both schemes apply, the total deduction will be jointly capped at 40% of the donor’s statutory income.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties imposed for violations of the law are not deductible.
## Taxes
Income taxes are generally not deductible in determining corporate income. However, irrecoverable GST is deductible under certain circumstances. The FWL and property taxes are deductible to the extent they are incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of income.
## Other significant items
Private automobile expenses are not deductible.
The tax deduction for medical expenses is limited to 2% of total payroll if the employer implements certain portable medical insurance or benefit schemes. Otherwise, the amount deductible will be limited to 1% of total payroll. Where the company is exempt or taxed at a reduced rate, the excess expenses will be taxed at the prevailing corporate rate.
A tax deduction for employee share-based remuneration (stock awards or stock option schemes) is allowed only if treasury shares in the company or its holding company are purchased to fulfil such obligations. A company may also claim a tax deduction when the share-based remuneration scheme is administered by a special purpose vehicle (SPV). The deduction is restricted generally to the lowest of the actual outlay incurred by the company, its holding company, or the SPV.
## Net operating losses
Loss carryover, including unutilised tax depreciation allowance, is unlimited, provided shareholdings in the loss-making corporation have not changed beyond 50% of the total number of issued shares. Additionally, for tax depreciation allowances to be carried forward, the same trade needs to be continued. The tax authorities may exercise discretion to allow carryover of tax losses and unutilised tax depreciation even when there has been a change in shareholding beyond 50%, absent any tax avoidance motives. Tax losses retained pursuant to the exercise of such discretion may only be deducted against income from the same trade or business in respect of which the losses arose.
Losses and tax depreciation of up to SGD 100,000 incurred by the company in the current year can be carried back for one year. The carryback of losses and tax depreciation is subject to the continuity of shareholding test, and additionally the same trade test applies for the carryback of tax depreciation.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments to non-residents, including foreign affiliates, are deductible, provided they are fair and reasonable, are revenue in nature, and can be seen to be relevant to earning the payer’s income.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 30 May 2024
A company is allowed to transfer excess current year trade losses, current year tax depreciation, and current year approved donations (other than donations for overseas causes) to another company within the same group if certain conditions are satisfied.
Broadly, to qualify for group relief, companies must be incorporated in Singapore, belong to the same group of companies where, among other things, there must be at least a 75% ownership relationship between claimant and transferor, and have the same accounting year-end. In addition, a group must comply with certain prescribed offset and apportionment rules.
## Transfer pricing
The Income Tax Act contains specific provisions that provide the tax authorities with a right to make transfer pricing adjustments in cases where taxpayers do not comply with the arm’s-length principle.
The transfer pricing provisions include mandatory contemporaneous documentation requirements, penalties for non-compliance, and a surcharge to be imposed at 5% of the transfer pricing adjustment value. In general, businesses with turnover exceeding SGD 10 million are required to maintain contemporaneous transfer pricing documentation, subject to certain exemptions as defined. Failure to comply with these requirements (including contemporaneous transfer pricing documentation) could result in penalties being imposed. The tax authorities are also given the power to disregard the form of a transaction where the substance of it is inconsistent with the form.
The tax authorities have issued revised transfer pricing guidelines to supplement the provisions in the Income Tax Act. Guidance is also provided on matters relating to mutual agreement procedures (MAPs) and advance pricing arrangements (APAs).
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
Singapore has signed the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on the exchange of CbC Reports, and Singapore-headquartered multinational enterprises with global revenues exceeding SGD 1,125 million have to submit to the IRAS an annual CbC report containing the income, taxes paid, and other indicators of level of economic activities in every tax jurisdiction where they operate. The IRAS will exchange CbC reports with jurisdictions with which Singapore has entered into bilateral agreements for the exchange of CbC reports.
## Thin capitalisation
There are no formal thin capitalisation rules in Singapore. However, general anti-avoidance and transfer pricing provisions may operate to deny or restrict deductions taken.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no CFC rules in Singapore.

# Singapore
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 30 May 2024
There are various tax incentives available to taxpayers involved in specified activities or industries identified as being beneficial to Singapore’s economic development.
Tax incentive applications are typically subject to an approval process during which the administering agency evaluates the applicant’s business plans in detail. Successful applicants are required to satisfy rigorous requirements and are expected to make significant economic commitments in Singapore.
Generally, applicants are expected to carry out substantive, high value activities in Singapore, and will be required to commit to certain levels of local business spending and skilled employment. Some factors that will be considered include the use of Singapore as a base from which to implement regional expansion strategies; introduction and anchoring of leading-edge skills, technology, and activities in Singapore; contributions to the growth of R&D and innovation capabilities; and potential spin-off to the rest of the economy.
## Pioneer tax incentive
Corporations manufacturing approved products with high technological content or providing qualifying services may apply for tax exemption for five to 15 years for each qualifying project or activity under the pioneer tax incentive. Corporations may apply for their post-pioneer profits to be taxed at a reduced rate under the Development and Expansion Incentive, *as discussed below*.
## Development and Expansion Incentive
Under the Development and Expansion Incentive, corporations engaging in new high-value-added projects, expanding or upgrading their operations, or undertaking incremental activities after their pioneer period may apply for their profits to be taxed at a reduced rate of not less than 5% for an initial period of up to ten years. The total tax relief period for each qualifying project or activity is subject to a maximum of 40 years.
## Investment allowance
Under the investment allowance, a tax exemption is granted on an amount of profits based on a specified percentage (of up to 100%) of the capital expenditure incurred for qualifying projects or activities within a period of up to five years (up to eight years for assets acquired on hire-purchase). Investment allowances of 100% of capital expenditure (net of grants) may be granted to businesses seeking to make substantial investment in automation, subject to a cap of SGD 10 million per project.
## Refundable investment credit
Companies making sizeable investments that bring high-value and substantive economic activities to Singapore in key economic sectors and new growth areas may apply for up to 50% investment credit on qualifying expenditure incurred during a qualifying period of up to ten years. The investment credit is to be offset against the company’s income tax payable, and any unutilised credits will be refunded to the company in cash within four years from when the company meets the conditions for receiving the credits. The scheme is intended to be consistent with the Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) Rules for Qualified Refundable Tax Credits.
## Incentives for internationalisation
The double tax deduction scheme for internationalisation allows companies expanding overseas to claim a double deduction for eligible expenses for specified market expansion and investment development activities. This includes qualifying manpower expenses incurred from 1 July 2015 to 31 December 2025 when Singaporeans or permanent residents of Singapore are deployed to overseas entities.
## Enterprise Innovation Scheme (EIS)
For the years of assessment 2024 to 2028, businesses that engage in the following qualifying activities will be allowed a 400% tax deduction or allowances for qualifying expenditure:
Qualifying businesses may opt to convert the above tax deductions to a cash payout. They would receive, in lieu of the deduction, a non-taxable cash payout of 20% of total qualifying expenditure of up to SGD 100,000 across all qualifying activities (i.e. maximum cash payout of SGD 20,000 per year).
## Intellectual Property Development Incentive (IDI)
The IDI scheme was introduced to encourage the use and commercialisation of IP arising from R&D activities of the taxpayer. An approved IDI company will be eligible for a reduced tax rate of either 5%, 10%, or 15% on a percentage of qualifying income derived from the commercialisation of certain IP. The percentage is determined by the modified nexus approach set out in the Action 5 report of the OECD base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project. The concessionary tax rate will increase at regular intervals as prescribed in the Income Tax Act.
## Mergers and acquisitions allowance
The mergers and acquisitions allowance allows a write-off of 25% of the value of qualifying mergers or acquisitions deals executed between 1 April 2015 and 31 December 2025. The amount of allowance, to be claimed over five years, is subject to a cap of SGD 5 million (for deals executed between 1 April 2015 and 31 March 2016) or SGD 10 million (for deals executed between 1 April 2016 and 31 December 2025) for all qualifying acquisitions made in the basis period for each year of assessment. This incentive is available to companies that are incorporated, tax resident, and carrying on a business in Singapore. A 200% tax allowance is also granted on transaction costs (capped at SGD 100,000 per year of assessment) incurred on qualifying deals.
## Financial services incentives
### Financial Sector Incentive (FSI) scheme
Under the FSI scheme, income from certain high growth, high-value-added activities, such as services and transactions relating to the bond market, derivatives market, equity market, and credit facilities syndication, may be taxed at 5%, while a broader range of financial activities will qualify for a 13.5% tax rate.
The concessionary tax rates available under the FSI scheme will be revised to either 10% or 13.5% for new awards and renewals of existing awards approved on or after 1 January 2024.
### Finance and treasury centre (FTC)
Interest payments to overseas banks and approved network companies are also exempt from WHT where the funds borrowed are used for approved activities.
### Debt securities incentives
A package of tax concessions is available to various players in the Singapore bond market, including those involved in certain Islamic financing arrangements.
### Insurance Business Development (IBD) scheme
The IBD scheme is an umbrella incentive for the insurance sector. Incentives offered under this scheme include a 10% concessionary tax rate for qualifying income of life, general, and composite insurers from carrying on insurance businesses from Singapore, and income derived from the provision of insurance broking and advisory services. This includes income from marine hull and liability insurance and captive insurance businesses.
### Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)
Distributions made to foreign non-individual investors by a listed REIT out of rental income from Singapore real estate are subject to a reduced tax rate of 10%, subject to certain conditions being met. Listed REITs investing in foreign properties can apply for tax exemption for certain foreign income received in Singapore. Distributions out of this income similarly are exempt.
Tax transparency treatment may be accorded for specified income of Singapore-listed REIT Exchange-Traded Funds (REIT-ETFs) so that there will be parity in tax treatment between investing in individual S-REITs and via REIT-ETFs with investments in S-REITs.
As a concession, Singapore-listed REITs are allowed to claim GST on expenses incurred for their business and for their special purpose vehicles, regardless of whether the REIT is eligible for GST registration, subject to a specified formula and certain conditions.
### Islamic financing arrangements
The income tax, stamp duty, and GST treatment of prescribed Islamic financing arrangements and Islamic debt securities (*Sukuk*) are aligned with that of the conventional financing contracts to which they are economically equivalent, subject to certain conditions.
### Infrastructure project finance incentives
Tax exemption is available for income earned from qualifying investments in qualifying infrastructure projects/assets. Income from qualifying project debt securities is also exempt. FSI companies that provide project finance advisory services related to qualifying projects/assets may enjoy certain tax concessions for their qualifying income.
### Sovereign wealth funds
Tax exemption is available for income derived by a sovereign fund entity and an approved foreign government-owned entity from funds managed in Singapore.
### Singapore Variable Capital Companies (VCC)
A VCC is treated as a company and a single entity for tax purposes. The tax exemptions for income from funds managed in Singapore and the existing GST remission for funds are extended to qualifying VCC. A 10% concessionary tax rate under FSI incentive for fund managers has been extended to approved fund managers managing an incentivised VCC.
## Headquarters schemes
Depending on their level of economic commitments to Singapore, international headquarters can apply for various tax incentives, including concessionary tax rates on qualifying income.
## Maritime Sector Incentive (MSI) scheme
The MSI scheme is the umbrella incentive for the maritime sector. Incentives offered include tax exemption for shipping companies and a 10% concessionary tax rate for international freight and logistics operators. Approved ship investment managers are also taxed at 10% on qualifying management-related income. The scheme also includes approved ship investment vehicles, which are tax exempt on their qualifying vessel lease income; approved container investment enterprises, which are taxed at 5% or 10% on qualifying income from container-leasing; and approved container investment management companies, which are taxed at 10% on qualifying management fees. From income year 2023 (year of assessment 2024), qualifying shipping entities may opt to apply an alternative net tonnage basis of tax.
Qualifying ship operators and lessors under the MSI scheme also enjoy automatic tax exemption on gains from the disposal of vessels, vessels under construction, and new building contracts.
## Global Trader Programme (GTP)
International traders are taxed at concessionary rates of 5%, 10%, or 15% on qualifying income from physical trading, brokering of physical trades, and derivative trading income.
## Other incentives
Other incentives include tax exemptions for not-for-profit organisations and a concessionary tax rate of 8% or 10% for approved aircraft lessors.

## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 30 May 2024
## Exchange of information (EOI)
Generally, Singapore’s tax treaties and EOI arrangements include provisions for the exchange of information for tax purposes. Treaty partners may make a request to the Comptroller of Income Tax for information, or the exchange may take the form of spontaneous EOI or automatic EOI.
### Spontaneous EOI
Singapore has committed to spontaneously exchange certain rulings under the agreed framework for the compulsory spontaneous EOI set out in the BEPS Action 5 Report ‘Countering Harmful Tax Practices More Effectively, taking into Account Transparency and Substance’.
### International Tax Compliance Agreements
Singapore has also concluded the following international tax compliance agreements and will exchange information pursuant to those agreements as follows:
#### Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
Singapore has a Model 1 FATCA intergovernmental agreement (IGA) with the United States in place to help ease the compliance burden of Singapore-based financial institutions (SGFIs). All Reporting SGFIs must submit a FATCA Return to the IRAS, setting out the required information in relation to every US Reportable Account.
#### Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
SGFIs are required to establish the tax residency of all their account holders. Further, they will need to report to the IRAS the requisite information for each Reportable Account relating to tax residents of jurisdictions with which Singapore has a Competent Authority Agreement to exchange information.
Singapore has also expressed its commitment to commencing automatic exchanges in crypto-assets reporting under the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework in 2027.
## Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
Companies incorporated in Singapore and Singapore branches of foreign companies are required by the Companies Act 1967 to prepare and present financial statements that comply with the Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (SFRS). In Singapore, the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) has the statutory authority to issue SFRS for adoption.
The broad policy intention is to adopt the IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB); however, the local economic and business circumstances and context, as well as the entity to which the IFRS would apply, is taken into consideration when evaluating the introduction of new IFRS for adoption in Singapore. The SFRS is principally based on and substantially similar to IFRS that are issued by the IASB. Singapore-incorporated companies that have issued, or are in the process of issuing, equity or debt instruments for trading in a public market in Singapore are required to apply Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS(I)s), Singapore's equivalent of the IFRS. Non-listed companies may voluntarily apply this framework.
Companies are required to submit financial statements as part of their tax return filing. The IRAS generally accepts financial statements prepared for statutory filing, although companies that have been allowed to prepare their financial statements using standards other than SFRS, such as IFRS or the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) adopted by the United States, may be required to explain and/or account for any differences and make the necessary tax adjustments, if any.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 06 May 2024
## Employment expenses
Employment expenses can be deducted from employment income if they are wholly and exclusively incurred in the production of the income in Singapore. These expenses must have been incurred by the employee in carrying out one's official duties and cannot have been reimbursed by the employer or of a capital/private nature.
## Personal deductions
### Charitable contributions
Generally, a 250% deduction may be claimed for qualifying donations to Community Chest or any approved institution of a public character (status accorded to certain charities).
### Mortgage deduction
Interest expense may be deductible, provided it is incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of taxable income. Mortgage interest is, therefore, deductible only where the property concerned yields income.
### Subscription fees
An individual can deduct annual subscriptions paid to professional institutes or societies in which membership is generally required as a condition of employment. Subscriptions paid to professional bodies or societies for professional updates, knowledge, and networking are generally allowed as a deduction as well if relevant to the individual’s employment duties.
### Medical expenses
No deductions are allowed for medical expenses or for any other personal or household expenditure.
### Spouses
Spouses cannot transfer qualifying deductions (including excess capital allowances, trade losses, donations, and rental deficits) to each other.
Any unabsorbed trade losses or capital allowances can be carried forward to future years to be offset against the future income of the taxpayer until the amount is fully utilised, subject to existing rules. Any unutilised donations can also be carried forward to future years to be offset against the future income of the taxpayer, up to a maximum of five years.
## Personal reliefs
For year of assessment 2024 (income year 2023), the following amounts are deductible from the assessable income of a resident individual to arrive at the income subject to tax:
Additional reliefs are granted for dependant great-grandparents and handicapped siblings.
PIT reliefs are subject to a cap of SGD 80,000 per year of assessment.
## Business deductions
Where an individual carries on a trade, business, profession, or vocation, deductions are allowed for all outgoings and expenses incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of the income being assessed (except expenses specifically prohibited under the Income Tax Act), including capital allowances (fiscal depreciation) on most fixed assets except for land and non-industrial buildings. Qualifying self-employed persons may claim a deemed amount of business expenses based on a prescribed percentage of the gross income earned (known as the Fixed Expense Deduction Ratio) instead of the actual expenses incurred.
## Losses
Business losses and unutilised capital allowances may be offset against other sources of income such as employment, interest, dividend, and rental income in the same year. Any remaining unabsorbed losses and capital allowances can be carried forward, subject to certain conditions.
Current year unutilised business losses and capital allowances of up to SGD 100,000 can also be carried back to the year of assessment immediately preceding the year of assessment in which the loss and capital allowance arose.

## Exchange controls
There are no exchange control regulations in Singapore, and, as a result, there are no restrictions on movement of funds out of Singapore. However, there is a reporting requirement if physical currency or bearer negotiable instruments brought into or out of Singapore exceed SGD 20,000.
## Tax equalisation or reimbursement plans
Generally, a tax reimbursement program is provided by an employer to alleviate the additional tax costs which may be incurred as a result of an overseas assignment. A tax reimbursement program may be modelled either as a ‘tax protection’ or ‘tax equalisation’ plan.
## **Exchange of information (EOI)**
Generally, Singapore’s tax treaties and EOI arrangements include provisions for the exchange of information for tax purposes. Treaty partners may make a request to the Comptroller of Income Tax for information, or the exchange may take the form of spontaneous EOI or automatic EOI.
### Spontaneous EOI
Singapore has committed to spontaneously exchange certain rulings under the agreed framework for the compulsory spontaneous EOI set out in the BEPS Action 5 Report ‘Countering Harmful Tax Practices More Effectively, taking into Account Transparency and Substance’.
### International Tax Compliance Agreements
Singapore has also concluded the following international tax compliance agreements and will exchange information pursuant to those agreements as follows:
#### Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
Singapore has a Model 1 FATCA intergovernmental agreement (IGA) with the United States in place to help ease the compliance burden of Singapore-based financial institutions (SGFIs). All Reporting SGFIs must submit a FATCA Return to the IRAS, setting out the required information in relation to every US Reportable Account.
#### Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
SGFIs are required to establish the tax residency of all their account holders. Further, they will need to report to the IRAS the requisite information for each Reportable Account relating to tax residents of jurisdictions with which Singapore has a Competent Authority Agreement to exchange information.
Singapore has also expressed its commitment to commencing automatic exchanges in crypto-assets reporting under the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework in 2027.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 06 May 2024
## Employment income
If the employment is exercised in Singapore, employment income is treated as earned in Singapore and is therefore taxable in Singapore. It generally does not matter where the employer is situated, where the remuneration is paid or which entities benefit from the services in determining the country of source of employment income.
Employment income includes salaries, bonuses, allowances, perquisites, and benefits in kind. All gains and profits derived by an employee due to employment is taxable unless exempted or given an administrative concession. Certain benefits in kind are accorded preferential rates, which are less than the actual cost to the employer.
The taxable value of housing accommodation provided to employees is the actual rent paid by the employer. In limited circumstances where there is no rent paid by the employer (e.g. employer-owned property), the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) may apply the annual (rental) value (AV) of the property, less the rent paid by the employee or other value deemed reasonable by the IRAS. The taxable benefit of furniture and fittings provided will be computed as a fixed percentage (40% or 50%, depending on whether the property is partially or fully furnished) of the AV of the property. If hotel accommodation is provided, the taxable benefit will be the amount paid by the employer, less any amount paid by the employee.
Where the employee is provided with a car benefit by the employer, the taxable benefit is calculated based on the prescribed formula which varies depending on whether the car provided is company-owned or leased, and whether actual running and maintenance costs are reimbursed by the employer. The taxability of other car-related items depends on the nature of the benefit.
The amount of tax borne by the employer is treated as additional income of the employee.
There are also concessions for certain benefits in kind (e.g. medical benefits [basic and non-basic], group medical, free/subsidised food and transport, transport and meal allowances/reimbursements, *per diems*), subject to certain conditions.
For group insurance policies (e.g. group term life insurance, group personal accident insurance) where employees are contractually entitled to the payout, the premiums paid by the employer will be taxable to the employee unless the employer elects not to claim a tax deduction for the premiums, in which case the premiums will be exempt to its employees. This concession does not apply to investment holding companies, tax exempt bodies, and service companies assessed on the 'cost-plus mark-up' basis.
Contributions made by an employer to a pension plan constituted outside Singapore on employment exercised in Singapore are taxable at the time the contributions are made. As a concession, mandatory contributions made to a pension/social security scheme operated by a foreign government may not be taxable, subject to certain conditions. This concession does not apply to investment holding companies, tax exempt bodies, and service companies assessed on the 'cost-plus mark-up' basis. In addition, this concession will be withdrawn with effect from year of assessment 2025, and employers’ contributions made on or after 1 January 2024 will be taxable on the employees.
Short-term visiting employees are not subject to tax on income from an employment exercised in Singapore if the employment does not exceed 60 days in a calendar year. This exemption, however, does not apply to a public entertainer or to a company director.
Area representatives of non-resident companies who reside in and use Singapore as a base for activities extending to other countries are assessed on the remuneration relating to the time actually spent in Singapore.
All retirement benefits other than CPF benefits, including gratuities and pensions, are generally taxable. Partial exemption may be possible in specified cases. The CPF scheme is only available to Singapore citizens and permanent residents and provides a lump sum at the normal retirement age, consisting of past contributions made at prescribed rates by the employee and the employer, as well as interest and other investment returns thereon. However, CPF contributions made under certain circumstances are deemed to be part of employment income, which is taxable.
Another retirement scheme is the SRS. Withdrawals from this scheme however may be fully taxable or 50% taxable, depending on whether certain specified conditions have been fulfilled. Penalties are levied for early withdrawals.
## Equity compensation
Gains derived from the exercise/vesting of stock options/awards granted during Singapore employment are taxable at exercise/vest unless a sale restriction is imposed. Non-Singapore citizens who cease employment in Singapore or leave Singapore for a period exceeding three months or on overseas posting will have to pay tax on any unexercised/unvested stock option/award on a deemed basis unless the tracking option is approved by the Singapore tax authorities for that individual. A refund may be claimed if the actual gain is less than the deemed gain that has been assessed. The claim must be filed within a prescribed period.
## Business income
Business income is income derived from carrying on a trade, business, profession, or vocation. It is taxable in the hands of the sole-proprietor or self-employed person. Identified intermediaries are required to submit income information of certain self-employed persons to the IRAS.
Deductions are allowed for all outgoings and expenses incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of the income being assessed (except expenses that are specifically prohibited under the Income Tax Act), including capital allowances (fiscal depreciation) on most fixed assets except for buildings and leasehold improvements. Qualifying self-employed persons may claim a deemed amount of business expenses based on a prescribed percentage of the gross income earned (known as the Fixed Expense Deduction Ratio) instead of the actual expenses incurred.
## Dividend income
Dividends received from a Singapore-resident company are exempt from tax in the hands of its shareholders.
All foreign-sourced income received by individuals is exempt from tax unless received by a resident individual through a partnership in Singapore.
## Interest income
Generally, interest income derived from Singapore-approved banks or licensed finance companies is not taxable.
All foreign-sourced income received by individuals is exempt from tax unless received by a resident individual through a partnership in Singapore.
## Rental income
Rental income derived from Singapore is taxable whether or not the individual is resident in Singapore. Individuals deriving passive rental income can opt to deduct 15% of gross rental income in lieu of the actual amount of deductible expenses incurred (excluding interest expenses, which can continue to be claimed based on the actual amounts incurred).

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 06 May 2024
Individuals are resident in Singapore if they reside there, except for such temporary absences as may be reasonable and not inconsistent with a claim to be resident in Singapore. Individuals who are physically present or who exercise an employment (other than as a board director of a company) in Singapore for 183 days or more during the calendar year preceding the year of assessment are treated as tax residents for that year of assessment. As a concession, a foreigner who stays or works in Singapore for a consecutive period spanning three calendar years (not necessarily three complete calendar years) is considered a tax resident.
As a further concession, a foreigner who works in Singapore for a continuous period straddling two calendar years and stays in Singapore for at least 183 days will be considered a tax resident for those two years. This does not apply to directors of a company, public entertainers, and professionals.
Foreigners will also be treated as tax resident if they are issued with a work pass that is valid for at least a year, but their tax residency status will be reviewed based on the tax residency rule above at the point of tax clearance.
