## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 20 December 2024
## Inventory valuation
Inventory must be valued by a cost-valuation method or, where market-selling value is lower than cost, may be valued at market-selling value. If the inventory is shares, it must be valued at cost. Cost is determined under New Zealand Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (NZ GAAP). Acceptable cost flow methods are first in first out (FIFO) or weighted-average cost. Some valuation concessions are available to small taxpayers.
## Capital gains
New Zealand does not have a comprehensive capital gains tax. However, income tax legislation specifically includes various forms of gains that would otherwise be considered a capital gain within the definition of ‘income’. Taxable income includes gains on the sale of land in certain circumstances and on personal property where the taxpayer acquired the property for resale or deals in such property or where a profit-making purpose or scheme can be deemed or imputed.
## Dividend income
Inter-company dividends paid between New Zealand resident companies are exempt within wholly owned groups (i.e. where there is 100% common ownership).
### Dividends from a foreign company
New Zealand’s controlled foreign company (CFC) and foreign investment fund (FIF) regimes apply to tax equity investments in foreign companies. *See*[*Income determination*](new-zealand/individual/income-determination.html) *in the Individual tax summary for a summary of these rules*.
A dividend derived by a company resident in New Zealand from a foreign company is treated as exempt income unless it is:
Dividends from foreign companies derived by taxpayers that are not companies (other than dividends to which the CFC and FIF regimes apply as described below) are taxable (generally with a credit for any foreign WHTs).
### Stock dividends
Bonus issues can be taxable or non-taxable. With a taxable bonus issue, the amount capitalised becomes available for tax-free distribution upon a subsequent share cancellation. With a non-taxable bonus issue, the amount capitalised is not available for tax-free distribution upon a subsequent share cancellation.
Shares issued under profit distribution plans (PDPs) are treated as taxable dividends.
## Interest income
All interest derived by a company is income. The financial arrangement rules may require income for tax purposes to be recognised on an accrual basis. When this is not required (because the person is classified as a 'cash basis' person), interest income is recognised as and when it is received.
## Royalty income
All royalty payments derived by a company are income. Royalty income includes payments for the supply of know-how. It also includes a payment of any kind derived as consideration for a copyright, patent, plant variety right, trademark, design or model, plan, and secret formula.
## Other significant items
The taxation of debt and debt instruments is governed by the financial arrangements rules, which are a specific set of timing rules. Income or expenditure (including foreign exchange gains and losses) from financial arrangements must be recognised on an accrual basis (generally, yield to maturity or other commercially acceptable method). On maturity or disposal, holders of financial arrangements are required to calculate a 'base price adjustment' (BPA). A BPA is a wash-up calculation that brings to tax all income and expenditure arising for a taxpayer in relation to a financial arrangement to the extent to which such income has not already been subject to tax or such expenditure deducted.
These rules generally do not apply to the income or expenditure of a non-resident if the financial arrangement does not relate to a business carried on in New Zealand. However, the financial arrangement rules may apply indirectly in calculating WHT on related-party loans into New Zealand in certain circumstances under the non-resident financial arrangements income (NRFAI) regime.
## Foreign income
A New Zealand corporation is taxed on foreign passive income as earned (other than income deemed to arise under the CFC and FIF rules). Double taxation with respect to all types of taxable income, including interest, rents, and royalties, is prevented by the recognition of foreign tax credits.
New Zealand does not offer specific tax deferral rules.

## Overview
Last reviewed - 20 December 2024
New Zealand, a country located in the South Pacific, comprises two major islands stretching north and south and separated by Cook Strait. Its capital city is Wellington. The two languages are English and Māori, and the currency is the New Zealand dollar (NZD).
New Zealand's real gross domestic product (GDP) decreased by 1.0% in the September 2024 quarter. Unemployment increased to 4.8% in the September 2024 quarter, while the consumer price index (CPI) increased by 2.2% for the year to September 2024. Annual inflation is therefore within the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's target range of 1% to 3%.
The minimum hourly wage is NZD 23.15 as of 1 April 2024, increasing to NZD 23.50 as of 1 April 2025.

Notes
1. Resident withholding tax (RWT) applies to both interest and dividends. For companies, unless the recipient holds an exemption certificate, and if the recipient provides an IRD number, the default rate of RWT on interest is 28%. Recipients can elect for the rate of RWT on interest to be 28%, 33%, or 39%. The rate of RWT on interest is 45% where the recipient does not provide an IRD number.
The rate of RWT on dividends paid is 33%, but the tax is reduced by the aggregate imputation and withholding payment credits attached to the dividend or taxable bonus share. Interest and dividends paid between group companies and in certain other limited circumstances are exempt from the NRWT. Where a fully imputed dividend is paid to a corporate shareholder, there is no requirement to withhold RWT or NRWT.
2. Resident corporations paying interest to non-associated, non-resident corporations and individuals need not withhold tax if they have approved-issuer status and the security under which interest is payable is registered with Inland Revenue. In this case, the resident corporation pays a 2% levy (tax deductible) on the interest payments instead of the NRWT otherwise applicable.
3. NRWT is imposed on dividends at the following rates, regardless of the jurisdiction to which the dividends are paid:
4. Net interest income is subject to reassessment at the company tax rate where the payer and the recipient are ‘associated persons’, but the NRWT imposed is the minimum liability. NRWT is not imposed where the recipient of the interest has a fixed establishment in New Zealand and the relevant interest is attributable to this fixed establishment, or where the recipient is a bank that has a fixed establishment in New Zealand and is not associated with the borrower.
5. NRWT on dividends is reduced from 15% to 5% for an investing company that has at least a 10% shareholding in the company paying the dividend. The rate reduces to 0% if the investing company holds 80% or more of the shares in the other company and meets other criteria. The NRWT rate on interest is 10% but is reduced to 0% if it is payable to eligible financial institutions.
6. New Zealand and Austria have signed the Second Protocol updating the DTA and First Protocol between the two countries. The Second Protocol is not yet in force. Under the Second Protocol, the NRWT rate on dividends will be as follows:
7. The NRWT on dividends is reduced from 15% to 5% for an investor who holds at least 10% of the shares in the company that pays the dividend. The NRWT rate on royalties is reduced from 15% to 10% generally, with a further reduced rate of 5% for royalties relating to copyright, computer software, and others.
8. The NRWT on interest is reduced to 10% if the interest received is derived from loans granted by banks or insurance companies. In all other cases, 15%.
9. The NRWT on interest may differ in accordance with the rates prescribed by New Zealand legislation for interest paid to ‘associated persons’.
10. The NRWT on dividends is reduced from 15% to 5% for an investing company that has at least a 10% shareholding in the company paying the dividend. The rate reduces to 0% if the investing company holds 50% or more of the shares in the other company and meets other criteria. The NRWT rate on interest is 10% but is reduced to 0% if it is payable to eligible financial institutions.
11. The NRWT rate on dividends is reduced from 15% to 0% for an investor who holds at least 10% of the voting power in the company paying the dividend (subject to certain conditions being met). The NRWT rate on interest is 10% generally and 0% if it is payable to eligible financial institutions.
12. The 0% NRWT rate applies where the foreign company owns at least 80% of the voting rights in the paying company (directly or indirectly) for 12 months prior to the date the dividend is paid and meets other criteria. The 5% rate applies if the foreign company has a direct interest of at least 10% of the voting rights in the paying company.
13. The NRWT rate on dividends will reduce from 15% to a maximum of 5% for an investor who holds at least 10% of the shares in the company that pays the dividend.
14. The standard NRWT rate on dividends reduces to 5% for an investing company that has at least a 10% shareholding in the company paying the dividend.
15. The NRWT rate on dividends is reduced to 5% if the beneficial owner is a company holding at least 10% of the voting power in the company paying the dividends and 15% in all other cases.
16. The NRWT rate on interest is reduced to 10% if it is received by a financial institution or it is paid with respect to debt arising from a sale on credit of any equipment, merchandise, or services. The NRWT rate is reduced to 10% for certain types of royalty.
17. The NRWT rate on dividends is reduced to 5% if the beneficial owner is a company holding at least 25% of the capital of the company paying the dividends and 15% in all other cases. The NRWT rate on interest is reduced to 10% if the interest is paid to a bank and 15% in all other cases.
18. The NRWT rate on dividends is 5% for an investor who holds at least 10% of the shares in the company that pays the dividend; 0% if the investor holds 80% or more of the shares in the company and meets other criteria; 15% in all other cases. The NRWT rate on interest is 10% but is reduced to 0% if it is payable to eligible financial institutions.
19. The NRWT rate on dividends is reduced to 5% if the beneficial owner is a company holding at least 50% of the voting power in the company paying the dividends and 15% in all other cases.
## Supplementary dividend tax credit regime
The supplementary dividend tax credit regime applies only to fully imputed dividends paid to shareholders holding less than 10% of the shares in the company and NRWT rates of at least 15%.
Broadly:
## Exclusions from dividend concept on liquidation of a company
An important exclusion from the dividend concepts is that amounts paid to shareholders on liquidation of a company will not be dividends (and therefore will not be subject to any tax, including WHT) to the extent they represent available subscribed capital (essentially paid-up share capital) plus net realised and unrealised capital gains in the company. This exclusion does not apply where the recipient shareholder is a non-resident company that is related to the New Zealand company paying the dividend.

# New Zealand
## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 20 December 2024
## KiwiSaver scheme
KiwiSaver is a voluntary workplace-based superannuation savings scheme. It was introduced from 1 July 2007. The KiwiSaver scheme is voluntary for all employees over the age of 18, both full and part-time. All New Zealand residents over the eligible age are able to join KiwiSaver, but membership is not compulsory.
The minimum rate for both member and employer contributions is 3%.
Employers must contribute to KiwiSaver for those of their employees who are KiwiSaver members.
Employers must calculate employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) at a rate equivalent to an employee’s annual salary and wage plus the employer’s annual gross contribution.
## Employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT)
Employer contributions to approved superannuation funds (such as KiwiSaver) are subject to ESCT, formally known as ‘specified superannuation contribution withholding tax’.
ESCT rates are based on the employee’s annual salary and wage, plus the employer’s gross contributions. Additionally, the method for determining the employee’s annual salary and wage is dependent on how long the employee has worked for the employer.
Contributions to other funds may be subject to fringe benefit tax (FBT).
## Accident compensation levies
A statutory-based scheme of accident insurance is funded in part by premiums payable by employers and employees.
Premiums paid by employers (including the self-employed) fund insurance for work-related accidents. Employers are liable to pay a residual claims levy and an employer levy. Premiums are payable at a rate set for the industrial category on leviable earnings up to these amounts.
Non-work accident insurance is funded by premiums paid by employees and the self-employed.
## Fringe benefits tax (FBT)
FBT is payable by employers when a fringe benefit (non-cash benefit) is provided to an employee or an associated person of the employee as a result of their employment relationship with the employer. The value of fringe benefits provided is not included in the gross income of employees.
The FBT quarters end with the last day of June, September, December, and March. Returns are due within 20 days of the end of the relevant quarter, except for the fourth quarter return (March), which is due 31 May. Any employer who has provided a fringe benefit is required to file a return setting out the fringe benefits received or enjoyed by employees in the quarter and a calculation of the amount of FBT payable on those benefits.
Employers with pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) and employer superannuation contribution tax deductions not exceeding NZD 1 million *per annum* for the previous tax year can pay FBT on an annual basis, or if the employer was not an employer in the previous tax year. An income year basis is also available for a company that provides fringe benefits to shareholder-employees.
### FBT rates
| Net remuneration (NZD) for the 2021–22 to 2024–25 income years | Net remuneration (NZD) for the 2025–26 and later income years | FBT rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 12,530 or less | 13,962 or less | 11.73 |
| 12,531 to 40,580 | 13,963 to 45,230 | 21.21 |
| 40,581 to 55,980 | 45,231 to 62,450 | 42.86 |
| 55,981 to 129,680 | 62,451 to 130,723 | 49.25 |
| Greater than 129,680 | Greater than 130,723 | 63.93 |
Changes to income tax rate brackets, which apply from 30 July 2024, will have consequential impacts on the FBT thresholds set out above. However, these changes are proposed to take effect from 1 April 2025.
Employers can pay FBT at either a single rate of 63.93% or use an alternate rate method (whereby benefits are attributed to employees). If the 63.93% single rate is used in all of the first three quarters, the employer may use an alternate rate calculation in the fourth quarter or continue to pay FBT at 63.93%.
There are currently three alternate rate methods: the full alternate rate, the short-form alternate rate, and the new pooled alternate rate.
Under the full alternate rate method, the applicable FBT rate depends on the net remuneration (including fringe benefits) paid to the employee. For employees who received attributed fringe benefits in any quarter during the year, the employer must calculate the employee’s fringe benefit inclusive of cash remuneration. The attribution calculation, which is performed in the fourth quarter, treats the fringe benefit as if it was paid in cash and calculates FBT as the notional increase in income tax that would otherwise have arisen.
The short-form alternate rate applies at a rate of 49.25% to all non-attributed benefits and a rate of 63.93% to all attributed benefits. In general, a benefit is attributable to an individual if it is principally assigned to, used, or available for use by that employee. However, there are other specific attribution rules to consider, such as the attribution rules for unclassified benefits.
The new pooled alternate rate calculation method has been introduced effective for the FBT year beginning 1 April 2021. The calculation of FBT to pay under this method is determined as follows.
A *de minimis* exemption may apply to exempt unclassified benefits from FBT. The thresholds for exempting unclassified benefits under the *de minimis* exemption is two-fold:
Where the NZD 22,500 threshold is breached, FBT must be returned on all unclassified benefits. Where only the NZD 300 threshold is breached, FBT needs to be returned only on those amounts.
Examples of benefits subject to FBT are as follows:
Self-powered and low-powered vehicles, vehicle-share services for self-powered and low-powered vehicles, and public transport are exempt from FBT.
FBT also applies to benefits received by an employee from a third party where there is a special arrangement between the employer and the third party. Generally, FBT does not apply to discounted goods or services received by an employee from a third party if the price paid by the employee is not less than the price that would be charged to other groups of people.
FBT is generally a tax-deductible expense. The effective FBT cost is intended to align with the receiving employee’s marginal tax rate.
## Consumption taxes
### Goods and services tax (GST)
A form of value-added tax (VAT), GST applies to most supplies of goods and services. The narrow category of exempt supplies includes financial services and residential accommodation. The rate applied to taxable supplies is 15% or 0%. The 0% rate applies to only a few supplies, including exports.
A ‘reverse charge’ mechanism requires the self-assessment of GST on the value of services imported by some GST registered persons. Financial services supplied to other registered businesses can be zero-rated under the GST business-to-business (B2B) regime.
Compulsory zero-rating (GST at 0%) applies to any supply involving land between two GST-registered parties if:
From 1 April 2024, existing GST rules for electronic marketplaces (that currently apply to remote services and low-value imported goods) were extended to taxable accommodation, ride-sharing, and food and beverage delivery services that are provided through electronic marketplaces. This means that electronic marketplace operators facilitating these services via their platform are required to collect and return GST at the standard rate of 15% when they are performed, provided, or received in New Zealand.
## Property taxes
Local authorities levy tax known as 'rates' on land within their territorial boundaries. Rates are levied on properties based on the properties' rateable value.
## Residential land withholding tax (RLWT)
RLWT applies to the sale of residential land in New Zealand by an 'offshore RLWT person'. RLWT applies in relation to land that was:
An RLWT offshore person includes all non-New Zealand citizens and non-permanent residents. It also includes a New Zealand citizen who is living overseas if they have been overseas for the last three years. A holder of a New Zealand residence class visa may be an offshore person if they are outside New Zealand and have not been in New Zealand within the last 12 or more months continuously. New Zealand trusts and companies may also be 'offshore persons' if there are significant offshore interests in them.
The amount of RLWT to be deducted is the lesser of:
### Administrative property tax rules
Offshore persons must have a New Zealand bank account in order to get a New Zealand Inland Revenue number. This also applies to New Zealanders who have been out of the country for three or more years.
### Purchase price allocation
Special purchase price allocation rules apply to sale and purchase agreements entered into from 1 July 2021. These rules govern the way parties to a transaction must allocate a transaction price across different classes of assets. The rules cover the situation where the transaction parties agree to an allocation, and also provide a default mechanism if no agreement is reached. In both instances, the allocation must ascribe relative market values to the assets, and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue may require the parties to adopt a different allocation if she considers that the allocation does not reflect market value.
Where the vendor and purchaser have agreed and documented a purchase price allocation before filing their respective income tax returns incorporating their tax position in relation to the transaction, the Income Tax Act 2007 now states that the parties must file in accordance with the agreed allocation. Agreement between the parties made within this timeframe will override any allocation made by the parties under the mechanisms outlined below.
Where the vendor and purchaser have not agreed to an allocation before filing their tax position in relevant returns, the Income Tax Act contains three mechanisms to give an allocation for the parties to use. These mechanisms are: (i) vendor allocation, (ii) purchaser allocation, or (iii) no allocation. If no allocation is made by the parties within six months of the change of ownership in the assets occurring, the Commissioner may allocate the purchase price across the assets at what she considers to be ’market value‘, and the vendor and the purchaser are treated as disposing and acquiring the property for this deemed market value.
Until an allocation is made by one of the parties (and notified to the Commissioner), or by the Commissioner, the purchaser will be treated as having no cost base in the assets acquired. Deductions disallowed as a result of this rule are intended to be deferred rather than denied.
## Luxury and excise taxes
Excise duty is levied, in addition to GST, on alcoholic beverages (e.g. wines, beers, spirits), tobacco products, and certain fuels (e.g. compressed natural gas, gasoline) under the Customs and Excise Act 2018. The excise duties are levied item-by-item at rates that vary considerably.
In addition, a duty is imposed on all gaming machine operators for the payment of gaming duty on the proceeds of a gaming machine under the Gaming Duties Act 1971.

The New Zealand corporate income tax (CIT) rate is 28%.
## Implementation of the Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) Rules - Global Minimum Tax
New Zealand has enacted legislation to implement the GloBE Rules, a key component of the OECD’s Two-Pillar Solution to address the tax challenges of digitalisation of the economy. The legislation includes the following:
These rules will impact large multinationals with annual global revenue of 750 million euros (EUR) or more, subject to certain exemptions.
## Local income taxes
There are no state or municipal income taxes in New Zealand.

# New Zealand
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 20 December 2024
## Taxable period
The New Zealand tax year ends on 31 March.
## Tax returns
Returns (if required) must be filed by 7 July each year, depending on the income type and/or the country of source. An extension of time until the following 31 March is available for taxpayers with a tax agent. Individuals file separate returns. There is no provision for joint returns for spouses. Failure to file a return (if required) may result in prosecution and penalties. There is no requirement to file a return for most individuals who earn only employment income, or income where tax is deducted at source at the appropriate rate.
## Payment of tax
Residual income tax (RIT) is the amount of income tax payable by a taxpayer after deducting tax credits but before deducting any provisional tax paid. Every taxpayer who is liable to pay RIT exceeding NZD 5,000 for an income year from 1 April 2020 will be a provisional taxpayer for the next year.
## Tax pooling
Taxpayers may reduce their exposure to use of money interest (UOMI) on provisional tax by using an Inland Revenue approved tax pooling intermediary. Tax pooling intermediaries facilitate the trading of under-payments and over-payments of provisional tax and typically save taxpayers some UOMI and late payment penalties that would have been charged in the absence of using tax pooling.
### Calculating provisional tax
Provisional taxpayers have four options for calculating their provisional tax payments.
These options are:
#### Standard uplift method
Under the standard uplift method, the general rule is that provisional tax payable is 105% of the RIT for the previous income year. However, if the prior year tax return has not been filed due to an extension of time for filing, the provisional tax payable can be based on 110% of the RIT for the income year before the previous income year (i.e. two years ago). The standard calculation method is the default calculation method, but it cannot be used if another method is adopted.
#### Estimate method
Provisional tax can be based on an estimate of the income year’s RIT. A taxpayer who chooses to estimate RIT is required to take reasonable care when doing so.
#### GST ratio method
The GST ratio method enables smaller taxpayers to align their provisional tax payments with their cash flow and reduce their exposure to UOMI. The option benefits those taxpayers with declining, seasonal, or fluctuating income. This option calculates provisional tax by reference to the taxpayer’s GST taxable supplies in the relevant provisional tax instalment period.
#### Accounting income method (AIM)
Available from the 2018/19 income year onwards, AIM is targeted at small to medium sized businesses with annual gross income of less than NZD 5 million. AIM uses accounting information from the business' accounting software for a period as a basis for calculating the tax liability of the business for that period. The resulting amount is payable by the taxpayer as a provisional tax instalment.
#### Voluntary payments
Taxpayers can also make voluntary payments. Such payments can minimise exposure to UOMI.
When the taxpayer files their tax return for the year, the provisional tax paid for that year is credited against the tax assessed. This results in either a refund or further tax to pay by way of terminal tax.
### Use of money interest (UOMI)
Taxpayers are required to pay interest when taxes are not paid by the due date for payment. There is a corresponding requirement for the Commissioner to pay interest to the taxpayer when the taxpayer has overpaid tax. UOMI applies to most tax obligations (e.g. income tax, PAYE, FBT, GST).
Certain taxpayers are subject to the UOMI regime. From the 2018 tax year, there have been changes to the way interest is calculated on over and underpayments. When RIT exceeds provisional tax paid, the taxpayer may be liable to pay interest on the underpayment. This is generally where they pay provisional tax on an estimated basis or when they have RIT exceeding NZD 60,000. Interest is payable regardless of culpability. When provisional tax paid exceeds RIT, the taxpayer in some scenarios may be entitled to receive interest on the overpayment.
Under the interest rules, from the 2018 tax year, as long as a taxpayer has made provisional tax payments in full and on time under the standard method, credit and debit interest starts from the day after the:
Taxpayers can also make voluntary payments. However, if provisional tax is paid under the standard method at the first and second instalment, this will minimise exposure to UOMI.
#### UOMI rates
From 16 January 2025, the interest rate for overpaid tax is 4.30% and the rate for underpaid tax is 10.88%. Interest is generally calculated from the due date for the third instalment of provisional tax if the taxpayer has paid under the standard method at the first and second instalment. Interest paid is deductible for both companies and individuals, while interest received is taxable.
### Tax penalties
An initial late payment penalty of 1% applies if the taxpayer does not pay tax by the due date. A further 4% late payment penalty applies if the tax is still not paid within seven days of the due date. Each additional penalty is applied on a compounding basis, i.e. it is imposed on any unpaid provisional tax plus any late payment penalties that have been imposed in respect of that unpaid tax.
Inland Revenue is required to notify a taxpayer the first time their payment is late rather than imposing an immediate late payment penalty. If the taxpayer does not make payment by a certain date, Inland Revenue will impose a late payment penalty. Taxpayers are entitled to one notification every two years. After receiving a first warning, Inland Revenue will not send further notifications for two years and will impose an initial late payment penalty in the normal manner.
#### Shortfall penalties
Shortfall penalties, calculated as a percentage of the tax shortfall resulting from the action or position taken by the taxpayer in a tax return, may also apply. These are:
| Action subject to penalty | Standard rate (%) | Rate after reduction by 100%/75% for disclosure before audit or timing error only (%) | Rate after reduction by 40% for disclosure during audit (%) | Rate after reduction by 75% for disclosure when filing (%) | Rate after increase by 25% for obstruction (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lack of reasonable care | 20 | 0/5 | 12 | NA | 25 |
| Unacceptable tax position | 20 | 0/5 | 12 | 5 | 25 |
| Gross carelessness | 40 | 10 | 24 | NA | 50 |
| Abusive tax position | 100 | 25 | 60 | 25 | 125 |
| Evasion | 150 | 37.5 | 90 | NA | 187.5 |
There is a 50% discount on certain penalties when the taxpayer has a past record of good behaviour and, in certain circumstances, a cap of NZD 50,000 on shortfall penalties for not taking reasonable care or for taking an unacceptable tax position.
When a taxpayer discloses a tax shortfall voluntarily before notification of a tax audit or investigation, penalties imposed for lack of reasonable care and for taking an unacceptable tax position are reduced by 100%.
## Employee share scheme reporting
From 1 April 2017, employers must disclose the value of share benefits that employees receive under employee share schemes. This requirement applies to shares and share options. Under the current payday filing rules, employers are also required to report the amount of tax withheld for the benefit (if any) to Inland Revenue. Employers are not required to disclose the specific details of the share scheme benefits provided.
## Tax audit process
The name of the New Zealand tax authority is the Inland Revenue Department (IRD). The IRD initiates a tax audit by sending a letter to the taxpayer notifying them they are undertaking an audit. The letter generally outlines the tax type(s) and year(s) under audit and includes a list of questions and/or document requests. The IRD normally provides a deadline for response within the letter.
## Statute of limitations
Inland Revenue generally has four years from the end of the tax year in which a tax return was filed to reassess the return. The limitation period does not apply to a tax return that is fraudulent or wilfully misleading or omits income.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 20 December 2024
## Taxable period
Tax returns are based on the fiscal year ending 31 March (also referred as the standard balance date), although other fiscal year-ends are possible if permission is obtained from Inland Revenue.
## Tax returns
The system is one of self-assessment, under which the corporation files an income tax return each year. For those not linked to a tax agent, returns must be filed by 7 July. The filing date for taxpayers linked to a tax agent is extended to 31 March of the following year.
## Payment of tax
Terminal tax payment is due on 7 February for balance dates between 31 March and 30 September. For other balance dates, terminal tax payments are generally due on the seventh day of the 11th month following the balance date. The terminal tax due date is extended by two months for taxpayers linked to a tax agent.
Provisional tax payments are generally due in three instalments: (i) 28th day of the seventh month before the balance date, (ii) 28th day of the third month before the balance date, (iii) 28th day of the month following the balance date.
### Calculating provisional tax
For the 2024/25 income year (i.e. year ending 31 March 2025), provisional taxpayers have the following five options:
1. Where the 2023/24 return of income has been filed, 2024/25 provisional tax can be based on 105% of the 2023/24 residual income tax.
2. Where the 2023/24 return of income has not been filed, due to an extension of time for filing, 2024/25 provisional tax can be based on 110% of the 2022/23 residual income tax, but only for the first two instalments. The final instalment must be calculated based on the first option above or the expected income tax liability for the period.
3. Provisional tax can be based on a fair and reasonable estimate of the 2024/25 residual income tax.
4. The GST ratio option.
5. The Accounting Income Method (AIM).
The GST ratio option enables smaller taxpayers to align their provisional tax payments with their cash flow and reduce their exposure to use of money interest. The option is intended to benefit those taxpayers with declining, seasonal, or fluctuating income. This option calculates provisional tax by reference to the taxpayer’s GST taxable supplies in the relevant provisional tax instalment period.
AIM is available for businesses with gross annual income of less than NZD 5 million. AIM uses accounting information from the business’ accounting software for a period as a basis for calculating the tax liability of the business for that period. The resulting amount is payable by the taxpayer as a provisional tax instalment.
Taxpayers can also make voluntary payments. Such payments can be made to minimise exposure to use of money interest. A taxpayer choosing to estimate residual income tax is required to take reasonable care when estimating.
When the taxpayer’s return of income for the year is furnished, the provisional tax paid for that year is credited against the tax assessed. This results in either a refund or further tax to pay by way of terminal tax.
For the 2017 and prior years, where provisional tax paid was less than the amount of income tax deemed due on that instalment date, use-of-money interest (UOMI) was imposed. If provisional tax was overpaid, interest was payable to the taxpayer. Interest was deductible for tax purposes by business taxpayers, and interest earned on overpaid provisional tax was gross income for tax purposes.
From the 2018 year and onwards, there is no interest charged by or received from Inland Revenue if the first and second instalments are in line with the standard uplift method (described as options 1 and 2 above). A taxpayer will be exposed to full UOMI from the point they choose to estimate. ‘Provisional tax associates' should use the same method (i.e. standard or estimation).
### Use-of-money interest (UOMI)
From 29 August 2023, the interest rate for unpaid tax is 10.91% and the rate for overpaid tax is 4.67%. Previously (from 9 May 2023 to 28 August 2023), the interest rate for unpaid tax was 10.39%, while the rate for overpaid tax was 3.53%.
#### Safe harbour from UOMI
A safe harbour rule from UOMI is available to taxpayers who have a relatively small amount of residual income tax in order to alleviate the impact of UOMI. Generally, if the taxpayer has paid all provisional tax instalments under one of the standard methods during an income year and has an amount of residual income tax for an income year that is less than NZD 60,000, UOMI will be deemed to be due and payable in one instalment on the taxpayer’s terminal tax date. If the taxpayer exceeds the threshold, UOMI will apply from the day after the final provisional tax instalment.
### Tax pooling
Taxpayers are able to pool their provisional tax payments with those of other taxpayers through an arrangement with a commercial intermediary. Tax pooling allows underpayments to be offset by overpayments within the same pool and *vice versa*. Tax pooling allows for more favourable interest rates for the taxpayer and greater flexibility.
### New provisional taxpayer
Where a new business has residual income tax of over NZD 60,000 in the first year of trading, it is required to pay provisional tax in one to three equal instalments. For taxpayers with a 31 March balance date, (i) if a business’s taxable activity commences before 29 July, they must pay three equal instalments, (ii) if the taxable activity commences on or after 29 July but before 16 December, they must pay two equal instalments, and (iii) taxable activities that commence on or after 16 December must pay one instalment of provisional tax to prevent UOMI arising.
## Tax penalties
An initial late payment penalty of 1% applies if a tax payment is not made on the due date. A further 4% late payment penalty applies if the payment is not made within seven days of the due date.
Inland Revenue is required to notify a taxpayer the first time their payment is late and will provide a grace period rather than imposing an immediate late payment penalty. If payment is not made by the new due date, a late payment penalty will be imposed from the original due date. Taxpayers will be entitled to one notification every two years. After receiving a first warning, Inland Revenue will not send further notifications for two years, and an initial late payment penalty will be imposed in the normal manner.
### Shortfall penalties
Shortfall penalties, calculated as a percentage of the tax shortfall resulting from the action or position taken by the taxpayer in a tax return, may also apply.
There is a 50% discount on certain penalties where the taxpayer has a past record of ‘good behaviour’ and, in certain circumstances, a cap of NZD 50,000 on shortfall penalties for not taking reasonable care or for taking an unacceptable tax position.
Shortfall penalties may also be reduced by making a voluntary disclosure of the relevant shortfall before notification (or commencement) of an audit.
## Tax audit process
Inland Revenue maintains an active audit programme across all tax types and taxpayer profiles and regularly publishes information about their compliance focus. Often, Inland Revenue audits are preceded by a risk review where Inland Revenue requests information in order to evaluate the risk of non-compliance. Where this review detects an issue that requires further inspection, Inland Revenue will then advise that an audit will be commenced.
## Statute of limitations
The general rule is that Inland Revenue has four years from the end of the New Zealand income tax year (31 March) in which the return is filed to re-assess the return, unless the return is fraudulent, wilfully misleading, or omits income of a particular nature or source.

# New Zealand
## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 20 December 2024
## KiwiSaver scheme
KiwiSaver is a voluntary workplace-based superannuation savings scheme. It was introduced from 1 July 2007. The KiwiSaver scheme is voluntary for all employees over the age of 18, both full and part-time. All New Zealand residents over the eligible age are able to join KiwiSaver, but membership is not compulsory.
The minimum rate for both member and employer contributions is 3%.
Employers must contribute to KiwiSaver for those of their employees who are KiwiSaver members.
Employers must calculate employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) at a rate equivalent to an employee’s annual salary and wage plus the employer’s annual gross contribution.
## Employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT)
Employer contributions to approved superannuation funds (such as KiwiSaver) are subject to ESCT, formally known as ‘specified superannuation contribution withholding tax’.
ESCT rates are based on the employee’s annual salary and wage, plus the employer’s gross contributions. Additionally, the method for determining the employee’s annual salary and wage is dependent on how long the employee has worked for the employer.
Contributions to other funds may be subject to fringe benefit tax (FBT).
## Accident compensation levies
A statutory-based scheme of accident insurance is funded in part by premiums payable by employers and employees.
Premiums paid by employers (including the self-employed) fund insurance for work-related accidents. Employers are liable to pay a residual claims levy and an employer levy. Premiums are payable at a rate set for the industrial category on leviable earnings up to these amounts.
Non-work accident insurance is funded by premiums paid by employees and the self-employed.
## Fringe benefits tax (FBT)
FBT is payable by employers when a fringe benefit (non-cash benefit) is provided to an employee or an associated person of the employee as a result of their employment relationship with the employer. The value of fringe benefits provided is not included in the gross income of employees.
The FBT quarters end with the last day of June, September, December, and March. Returns are due within 20 days of the end of the relevant quarter, except for the fourth quarter return (March), which is due 31 May. Any employer who has provided a fringe benefit is required to file a return setting out the fringe benefits received or enjoyed by employees in the quarter and a calculation of the amount of FBT payable on those benefits.
Employers with pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) and employer superannuation contribution tax deductions not exceeding NZD 1 million *per annum* for the previous tax year can pay FBT on an annual basis, or if the employer was not an employer in the previous tax year. An income year basis is also available for a company that provides fringe benefits to shareholder-employees.
### FBT rates
| Net remuneration (NZD) for the 2021–22 to 2024–25 income years | Net remuneration (NZD) for the 2025–26 and later income years | FBT rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 12,530 or less | 13,962 or less | 11.73 |
| 12,531 to 40,580 | 13,963 to 45,230 | 21.21 |
| 40,581 to 55,980 | 45,231 to 62,450 | 42.86 |
| 55,981 to 129,680 | 62,451 to 130,723 | 49.25 |
| Greater than 129,680 | Greater than 130,723 | 63.93 |
Changes to income tax rate brackets, which apply from 30 July 2024, will have consequential impacts on the FBT thresholds set out above. However, these changes are proposed to take effect from 1 April 2025.
Employers can pay FBT at either a single rate of 63.93% or use an alternate rate method (whereby benefits are attributed to employees). If the 63.93% single rate is used in all of the first three quarters, the employer may use an alternate rate calculation in the fourth quarter or continue to pay FBT at 63.93%.
There are currently three alternate rate methods: the full alternate rate, the short-form alternate rate, and the new pooled alternate rate.
Under the full alternate rate method, the applicable FBT rate depends on the net remuneration (including fringe benefits) paid to the employee. For employees who received attributed fringe benefits in any quarter during the year, the employer must calculate the employee’s fringe benefit inclusive of cash remuneration. The attribution calculation, which is performed in the fourth quarter, treats the fringe benefit as if it was paid in cash and calculates FBT as the notional increase in income tax that would otherwise have arisen.
The short-form alternate rate applies at a rate of 49.25% to all non-attributed benefits and a rate of 63.93% to all attributed benefits. In general, a benefit is attributable to an individual if it is principally assigned to, used, or available for use by that employee. However, there are other specific attribution rules to consider, such as the attribution rules for unclassified benefits.
The new pooled alternate rate calculation method has been introduced effective for the FBT year beginning 1 April 2021. The calculation of FBT to pay under this method is determined as follows.
A *de minimis* exemption may apply to exempt unclassified benefits from FBT. The thresholds for exempting unclassified benefits under the *de minimis* exemption is two-fold:
Where the NZD 22,500 threshold is breached, FBT must be returned on all unclassified benefits. Where only the NZD 300 threshold is breached, FBT needs to be returned only on those amounts.
Examples of benefits subject to FBT are as follows:
Self-powered and low-powered vehicles, vehicle-share services for self-powered and low-powered vehicles, and public transport are exempt from FBT.
FBT also applies to benefits received by an employee from a third party where there is a special arrangement between the employer and the third party. Generally, FBT does not apply to discounted goods or services received by an employee from a third party if the price paid by the employee is not less than the price that would be charged to other groups of people.
FBT is generally a tax-deductible expense. The effective FBT cost is intended to align with the receiving employee’s marginal tax rate.
## Consumption taxes
### Goods and services tax (GST)
A form of value-added tax (VAT), GST applies to most supplies of goods and services. The narrow category of exempt supplies includes financial services and residential accommodation. The rate applied to taxable supplies is 15% or 0%. The 0% rate applies to only a few supplies, including exports.
A ‘reverse charge’ mechanism requires the self-assessment of GST on the value of services imported by some GST registered persons. Financial services supplied to other registered businesses can be zero-rated under the GST business-to-business (B2B) regime.
Compulsory zero-rating (GST at 0%) applies to any supply involving land between two GST-registered parties if:
From 1 April 2024, existing GST rules for electronic marketplaces (that currently apply to remote services and low-value imported goods) were extended to taxable accommodation, ride-sharing, and food and beverage delivery services that are provided through electronic marketplaces. This means that electronic marketplace operators facilitating these services via their platform are required to collect and return GST at the standard rate of 15% when they are performed, provided, or received in New Zealand.
## Property taxes
Local authorities levy tax known as 'rates' on land within their territorial boundaries. Rates are levied on properties based on the properties' rateable value.
## Residential land withholding tax (RLWT)
RLWT applies to the sale of residential land in New Zealand by an 'offshore RLWT person'. RLWT applies in relation to land that was:
An RLWT offshore person includes all non-New Zealand citizens and non-permanent residents. It also includes a New Zealand citizen who is living overseas if they have been overseas for the last three years. A holder of a New Zealand residence class visa may be an offshore person if they are outside New Zealand and have not been in New Zealand within the last 12 or more months continuously. New Zealand trusts and companies may also be 'offshore persons' if there are significant offshore interests in them.
The amount of RLWT to be deducted is the lesser of:
### Administrative property tax rules
Offshore persons must have a New Zealand bank account in order to get a New Zealand Inland Revenue number. This also applies to New Zealanders who have been out of the country for three or more years.
### Purchase price allocation
Special purchase price allocation rules apply to sale and purchase agreements entered into from 1 July 2021. These rules govern the way parties to a transaction must allocate a transaction price across different classes of assets. The rules cover the situation where the transaction parties agree to an allocation, and also provide a default mechanism if no agreement is reached. In both instances, the allocation must ascribe relative market values to the assets, and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue may require the parties to adopt a different allocation if she considers that the allocation does not reflect market value.
Where the vendor and purchaser have agreed and documented a purchase price allocation before filing their respective income tax returns incorporating their tax position in relation to the transaction, the Income Tax Act 2007 now states that the parties must file in accordance with the agreed allocation. Agreement between the parties made within this timeframe will override any allocation made by the parties under the mechanisms outlined below.
Where the vendor and purchaser have not agreed to an allocation before filing their tax position in relevant returns, the Income Tax Act contains three mechanisms to give an allocation for the parties to use. These mechanisms are: (i) vendor allocation, (ii) purchaser allocation, or (iii) no allocation. If no allocation is made by the parties within six months of the change of ownership in the assets occurring, the Commissioner may allocate the purchase price across the assets at what she considers to be ’market value‘, and the vendor and the purchaser are treated as disposing and acquiring the property for this deemed market value.
Until an allocation is made by one of the parties (and notified to the Commissioner), or by the Commissioner, the purchaser will be treated as having no cost base in the assets acquired. Deductions disallowed as a result of this rule are intended to be deferred rather than denied.
## Luxury and excise taxes
Excise duty is levied, in addition to GST, on alcoholic beverages (e.g. wines, beers, spirits), tobacco products, and certain fuels (e.g. compressed natural gas, gasoline) under the Customs and Excise Act 2018. The excise duties are levied item-by-item at rates that vary considerably.
In addition, a duty is imposed on all gaming machine operators for the payment of gaming duty on the proceeds of a gaming machine under the Gaming Duties Act 1971.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 20 December 2024
## Goods and services tax (GST)
GST is a form of value-added tax (VAT) that applies to most supplies of goods and services, including low-value imported goods, services, and intangibles supplied remotely by an offshore supplier to New Zealand resident consumers. The narrow category of exempt supplies includes financial services. The rate applied to taxable supplies is currently 15% or 0%.
The 0% rate applies to a few supplies only, including exports and financial services supplied to other registered businesses. The 0% rate also applies to a supply that includes an interest in land between two GST-registered parties if the purchaser acquires the land with the intention of using it to make taxable supplies and the land is not intended to be used as a principal place of residence for the purchaser or an associate, or in relation to the sale of a business as a going concern.
There is also a ‘reverse charge’ mechanism that requires the self-assessment of GST on the value of certain imported services that are intended to be used to make exempt or non-taxable supplies.
GST is also imposed on remote services provided by non-residents to New Zealand private consumers. The concept of 'remote services' is wide and includes streamed and downloaded digital products (e.g. music, movie, and game downloads, e-books, e-magazines) as well as remotely provided webinars, software, web design and publishing, insurance, gambling, consulting, IT, and professional services. Offshore sellers are also required to register and account for GST at 15% on supplies of low-value imported goods (LVIGs) if sales to New Zealand private consumers in a 12-month period exceed 60,000 New Zealand dollars (NZD). The NZD 60,000 threshold is the same GST registration threshold that applies to domestic businesses and offshore suppliers of cross-border remote services.
Supplies of remote services, LVIGs, and certain other kinds of 'listed services' supplied through an electronic marketplace platform are subject to special rules. Under these rules, the electronic marketplace platform (and not the underlying supplier) is required to collect and return GST at 15%. Listed services for the purposes of these rules include taxable accommodation, ride-sharing, and food and beverage delivery services.
Since 1 April 2024, these rules also apply to taxable accommodation, ride-sharing, and food and beverage delivery services that are provided through electronic marketplaces. This means that electronic marketplace operators facilitating these services via their platform are required to collect and return GST at the standard rate of 15% when they are performed, provided, or received in New Zealand.
Non-residents who do not make taxable supplies in New Zealand can register for GST, provided they meet certain criteria, allowing them to claim a refund for their input GST costs.
## Customs duties
Customs duty is levied on some imported goods at rates generally ranging from 5% to 10%.
## Excise duty
Excise duty is levied, in addition to GST, on alcoholic beverages (e.g. wines, beers, spirits), tobacco products, and certain fuels (e.g. compressed natural gas, gasoline). The excise duties are levied item-by-item at rates that vary considerably.
## Property taxes
Local authorities levy tax known as 'rates' on land within their territorial boundaries. Rates are levied on properties based on the properties’ rateable value.
## Residential land withholding tax (RLWT)
RLWT applies to the sale of residential land in New Zealand by an 'RLWT offshore person'. RLWT applies in relation to land that was:
An 'RLWT offshore person' includes all non-New Zealand citizens and non-permanent residents. It also includes a New Zealand citizen who is living overseas if they have been overseas for the last three years. A holder of a New Zealand residence class visa may be an offshore person if they are outside New Zealand and have not been in New Zealand within the last 12 months. New Zealand trusts and companies may also be 'offshore persons' if there are significant offshore interests in them.
The amount of RLWT to be deducted is the lesser of:
## Transfer taxes
There are no taxes on the transfer of property in New Zealand.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty has been abolished in respect of instruments executed after 20 May 1999.
## Accident compensation levy
A statutory-based scheme of accident insurance is funded in part by premiums payable by employers and employees.
Premiums paid by employers (including the self-employed) fund insurance for work-related accidents. Employers are liable to pay a residual claims levy and an employer levy. The employer levy payable is determined according to the industry or risk classification of the employer and the level of earnings of employees.
## Fringe benefit tax (FBT)
Employers are subject to a tax-deductible FBT on the value of non-cash fringe benefits provided to their employees. Employers can elect to pay FBT at a flat rate (from 1 April 2021, 63.93%) or under an alternate rate method. Under the alternate rate methods, benefits are split into attributed and non-attributed benefits (i.e. those benefits that cannot be attributed to a particular employee), and a ’wash-up‘ calculation is performed in the final quarter. There are three different alternate rate methods available, being the full alternate rate, short form alternate rate, and pooled alternate rate). FBT is applied with reference to whether the benefit is attributed and the individual employees’ remuneration.
Under the full alternate rate option, the applicable FBT rate depends on the net remuneration (including fringe benefits) paid to the employee. The attribution calculation treats the fringe benefit as if it was paid in cash and calculates FBT as the notional increase in income that otherwise would have arisen.
The fringe benefit-inclusive cash remuneration thresholds and FBT rates are as follows:
### FBT rates
| Fringe benefit inclusive cash remuneration (NZD) (2021-22 to 2024-25 income years) | Fringe benefit inclusive cash remuneration (NZD) (2025-26 and later income years) | FBT rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 12,530 or less | 13,962 or less | 11.73 |
| 12,531 to 40,580 | 13,963 to 45,230 | 21.21 |
| 40,581 to 55,980 | 45.231 to 62,450 | 42.86 |
| 55,981 to 129,680 | 62,451 to 130,723 | 49.25 |
| Greater than 129,680 | Greater than 130,723 | 63.93 |
Changes to income tax rate brackets, which apply from 30 July 2024, will have consequential impacts on the FBT thresholds set out above. However, these changes are proposed to take effect from 1 April 2025.
Fringe benefits include motor vehicles available for private use, loans at below prescribed interest rates, contributions to medical insurance schemes, and non-monetary employer contributions to superannuation schemes.
In relation to motor vehicles, employers can value a vehicle on an annual basis either using 20% of the cost price or market value (GST inclusive) of the vehicle (depending on whether the vehicle is owned or leased by the employer) or 36% of the vehicle’s tax written down value (GST inclusive). In each case, the FBT value must be reduced proportionately for whole days when the vehicle is not available for private use at any time.
FBT is also applicable to benefits received by an employee from a third party where there is an arrangement between the employer and the third party and where the benefit would be subject to FBT if it had been provided by the employer.
## Employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT)
Employers’ contributions to an approved superannuation fund (excluding foreign schemes) are subject to ESCT. This includes employer contributions to KiwiSaver (or other qualifying registered superannuation schemes).
ESCT is generally deducted at the employee’s relevant progressive rate based on the total salary or wages and employer superannuation cash contributions paid to the employee in the previous year.
| Salary or wages plus superannuation contributions (NZD) (for 2024-25 income year) | Salary or wages plus superannuation contributions (NZD) (for 2025-26 and later income years) | ESCT rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Up to 16,800 | Up to 18,720 | 10.5 |
| 16,801 to 57,600 | 18,721 to 64,200 | 17.5 |
| 57,601 to 84,000 | 64,201 to 93,720 | 30.0 |
| 84,001 to 216,000 | 93,721 to 216,000 | 33.0 |
| Greater than 216,001 | Greater than 216,001 | 39.0 |
Changes to income tax rate brackets, which apply from 30 July 2024, will have consequential impacts on the ESCT thresholds set out below. However, these changes are proposed to apply from 1 April 2025.
## Non-resident contractor’s tax (NRCT)
New Zealand imposes an obligation on payers to withhold tax (NRCT) on payments to non-resident contractors in relation to certain contract activities undertaken in New Zealand. Contract activities generally relate to services but also include the granting of a right to use property in New Zealand.
The rate of NRCT depends on the type of work performed and whether the contractor has provided a completed notification form (IR330C). The default NRCT rate is currently 15% (or 45% for individuals and 20% for companies if the relevant paperwork is not provided). Some contractors are eligible to apply for an exemption or a reduced rate.
NRCT is not required to be withheld if the non-resident contractor:
## Offshore gambling duty
Offshore gambling operators are subject to a specific offshore gambling duty of 12% of gambling profits. Profits for the purposes of these rules exclude amounts that are already subject to a similar tax on sports betting.

## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 20 December 2024
## New Tax Bill
The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2024–25, Emergency Response, and Remedial Measures) Bill (the Bill), introduced in August 2024 is currently before the Finance and Expenditure Committee in New Zealand’s Parliament.
The Bill includes a number of measures including:
## Depreciation for commercial buildings
Tax depreciation deductions for commercial buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more have been removed (depreciation rate set to 0%) from the start of the 2024/25 income year (the year beginning 1 April 2024 for most taxpayers).
## Interest deductibility
Interest deductibility for borrowing on residential investment property will be phased back in over the next two tax years. From 1 April 2024, 80% of the interest expenses incurred for amounts borrowed in relation to residential property are deductible. This is regardless of when the property was acquired or when the loan was drawn down. From 1 April 2025, interest deductibility will be fully restored (i.e. 100% deductibility).
## Bright-line test
Under the bright-line rules, residential land that is disposed of within two years of acquisition is subject to tax (regardless of whether the taxpayer had a purpose or intention of disposal at the time of acquisition). The previous government had extended the bright-line period to ten years from the date of acquisition. The new government has enacted changes to reduce the bright-line period to two years for residential land disposed on or after 1 July 2024.
Rollover relief is available (subject to certain conditions) for transfers between associated persons, including blood relatives, associated companies, trustees of a trust, and transfers to certain non-profit organisations.
## Implementation of the Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) Rules
## Platforms - information reporting
The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 introduced a new information reporting requirement for platform operators based in New Zealand. At a high level, the new rules require platform operators to provide Inland Revenue with information about sellers who provide goods or services through digital platforms. These are based on model rules developed by the OECD, which are incorporated into New Zealand domestic law.
The amendments require platform operators based in New Zealand to collect and provide Inland Revenue with information about the income sellers receive from the following activities, provided through digital platforms:
The sale of goods and vehicle rentals (if there are non-resident sellers on the platform) may also be brought into the rules at a later date.
Sellers on digital platforms are required to provide additional information to platform operators, including their tax file number, country of tax residence, and other identifying information. New Zealand-based platform operators are required to report information to Inland Revenue about the income earned by sellers on their platform.
New Zealand-based reporting platform operators have been required to collect information on sellers that receive consideration from activities on their platforms from 1 January 2024. Reporting platform operators will be required to report this information to Inland Revenue in early 2025, and Inland Revenue could exchange information with other tax authorities in early 2025.
## Double tax agreements (DTAs)
New Zealand is currently negotiating new and updating DTAs with Australia, Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Portugal, Slovenia, South Korea, and the United Kingdom.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 20 December 2024
Residence is determined by place of incorporation, location of head office, centre of management, or by directors’ exercising control of the company in New Zealand.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Generally, DTAs to which New Zealand is a party define a PE as a fixed place of business through which a company carries on business. A PE can also exist without a fixed place of business if employees or dependent agents of the overseas company habitually exercise an authority to conclude contracts, or habitually play the principal role leading to the conclusion of contracts that are routinely concluded without material modification by the enterprise, in New Zealand. Further, a PE may be created where services are provided in New Zealand for a period of time.
The term 'permanent establishment' is also defined in domestic legislation. In the first instance, New Zealand’s domestic legislation will honour the PE definition included in the relevant DTA. However, in the event that the relevant DTA has not been amended to incorporate Article 12(1) of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (MLI), a domestic PE avoidance rule may apply in certain circumstances for large multinational groups.
There is also a new domestic law definition of PE (incorporating the OECD’s new PE definition) that applies where there is no relevant DTA, along with an associated amendment to New Zealand’s source rules that will deem income to have a source in New Zealand where it is attributable to a PE in New Zealand.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 20 December 2024
## Depreciation and depletion
For tax purposes, depreciation of property can be computed under the diminishing-value method, the straight-line method, or a pooling method. The rates of depreciation depend on the following factors:
Taxpayers must use the economic depreciation rates prescribed by Inland Revenue or make an application to Inland Revenue for a special depreciation rate. Fixed-life intangible property (including the right to use land and resource consents) is depreciable on a straight-line basis over its legal life. Any depreciation recovered on the sale of an asset (up to its original cost) is taxable in the year of sale.
Tax depreciation deductions for commercial buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more have been removed (depreciation rate set to 0%) from the start of the 2024/25 income year (the year beginning 1 April 2024 for most taxpayers). The depreciation rate for residential buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more remains at 0%.
Assets with a cost base of less than NZD 1,000 are immediately deductible in the year of purchase.
## Goodwill
Goodwill is generally regarded as a capital asset, thus any payment for goodwill is non-deductible. There is a limited exception for payments made to preserve goodwill.
## Start-up expenses
## Interest expense
Generally, interest incurred by most companies is deductible, subject to thin capitalisation, restricted transfer pricing, and anti-hybrid rules (*see the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*).
Interest incurred specifically in relation to residential property is subject to a specific set of rules whereby interest deductions may be disallowed (with deductions for interest on existing loans to be phased out over time). However, there are exemptions for new builds and build-to-rent land. The rules do not apply to most companies whose core business does not involve residential land (as determined by reference to a formula where residential property [including new builds] makes up less than half of their total assets). However, close companies (i.e. companies where five or fewer individuals or trustees own more than 50% of the company) will be subject to the rules.
Under these rules, tax deductibility depends on the 'use' of the borrowing, determined using a 'stacking' approach whereby taxpayers allocate loans first to assets that are not residential investment properties based on the market value of assets at 26 March 2021.
The rules also contain a grandparenting process that reduces the amount of deductible interest on mortgage debt in existence before 27 March 2021 relating to residential investment property. The process allows for 100% deductibility for interest incurred between 1 April 2020 and 30 September 2021, and reducing over the period to 0% from 1 April 2025 onwards.
From 1 October 2021, deductions are disallowed on all other interest on debt funding that is entered into on or after 27 March 2021 relating to residential investment properties, including drawdowns of debt that relates to the ownership or use of residential property on or after 27 March 2021.
Looking forward, the new Government proposes to restore interest deductibility for residential properties on a ’phased-in‘ basis (i.e. 60% interest deductibility for the 2023/24 income year, 80% deductibility for the 2024/25 income year, and 100% interest deductibility for the 2025/26 and following income years).
## Bad debt
A company that carries on a business of holding or dealing in financial arrangements is generally allowed a deduction for bad debt in the income year in which the debt is written off by the company if the debt that is written off is a financial arrangement of the same or a similar type as the financial arrangements held as part of the company’s business, and the company is not associated with the debtor.
## Charitable contributions
A company is generally allowed a deduction for charitable contributions it makes to an approved Inland Revenue donee organisation or a charity that performs its activities in New Zealand. The list of approved donee organisations is available on Inland Revenue’s website. The deduction available for charitable contributions is limited to the company’s net income for that income year.
R&D costs are generally tax deductible. However, expenses written off as immaterial and not tested against certain asset-recognition criteria are not automatically deductible for tax purposes.
### Unsuccessful software development costs
Taxpayers are allowed a deduction for expenditure incurred on unsuccessful software development projects in the year that the development is abandoned.
### Feasibility expenditure
'Blackhole feasibility expenditure' has been an issue for taxpayers where expenditure is incurred but that expenditure could not be capitalised nor deducted. Often this arises where the project is abandoned before a capital asset is created. This issue was further exacerbated due to the decision in *Trustpower Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue* [2016] NZSC 91, which further reduced the scope of deductible feasibility expenditure.
The feasibility expenditure provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 override this decision and confirm the deductibility of feasibility and other blackhole expenditure incurred by a taxpayer in situations where the project does not result in a capital asset. It also provides for an immediate deduction where a taxpayer incurs less than NZD 10,000 of this kind of expenditure in an income year.
## Residential rental expenditure
From 1 April 2019, deductions for expenditure incurred in relation to residential rental properties are limited to the extent of the residential income derived. Any excess expenditure is 'ring-fenced' and available to carry forward to offset against future residential rental income but generally will not be available to offset against other income streams.
## Entertainment expenditure
Entertainment expenditure is generally 50% deductible as it is considered to provide a private element. Common examples include social work gatherings and events.
However, certain categories of entertainment expenditure are 100% deductible. This includes light refreshments, food or drink provided at conferences or while travelling, and entertainment expenditure incurred overseas.
## Legal expenditure
Legal expenditure is generally deductible where the expenditure is:
However, the expenditure is not deductible if it is of a capital, private, or domestic nature.
Taxpayers with business-related legal expenditure totalling NZD 10,000 or less are able to deduct the full amount of the expenditure in the year it is incurred, whether or not it is capital in nature.
## Fines and penalties
Generally, no deduction is available where a company has incurred expenditure on fines or penalties paid in respect of breaches of statute or regulation. Expenditure on other fines and penalties requires further evaluation before its deductibility can be determined.
## Taxes
FBT is deductible, as is GST payable on the value of a fringe benefit.
## Net operating losses
Losses may be carried forward indefinitely or offset against future profits, subject to the company maintaining 49% continuity of ownership or meeting the business continuity test (BCT). That is, if a loss company cannot carry forward its tax losses due to a loss of shareholder continuity, it may still be able to carry forward those tax losses if it meets the BCT by maintaining the 'same or similar business' during the business continuity period.
The 'same or similar business' test supplements the 49% continuity threshold and will allow tax losses to be carried forward where there is no major change to the nature of the business before and after the change in shareholding. This is assessed based on factors such as:
The business continuity period is the period starting immediately before the ownership continuity breach and ending on the earlier of:
However, it is recognised that businesses will naturally evolve over time, resulting in changes to business activities and assets. Therefore, there are several carve-outs from what might otherwise be considered a 'major change'. These include changes to:
‘Permitted major changes’ would not result in tax losses being forfeited under the BCT.
The 'same or similar' business test applies from the 2021 income year and can apply to losses from the 2014 income year onwards. The business continuity test also applies to the carry forward of hybrid mismatch amounts.
Losses of a subsidiary are preserved on a spinout (i.e. when shares in the subsidiary are transferred to shareholders of its parent company).
## Payments to foreign affiliates
A New Zealand corporation can claim a deduction for royalties, management service fees, and interest charges paid to non-resident associates, provided the charges satisfy the ‘arm’s-length principle’, which forms the basis of New Zealand’s transfer pricing regime.
The hybrid and branch mismatch rules eliminate tax benefits arising (whether in New Zealand or elsewhere) from an entity or financial arrangement being treated differently for tax purposes by different countries. Broadly, the rules could apply where:
If the rules apply, deductions may be disallowed or taxable income increased.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 20 December 2024
Groups of resident companies that have 100% common ownership may elect to be subject to the consolidated group regime. The group is effectively treated as a single company, and transfers of assets, dividends, interest, and management fees among members of the group are generally disregarded for tax purposes. The group files a single return and is issued a single assessment. Group members are jointly and severally liable for tax purposes unless an election is made to limit the liability to one or more companies in the group.
Outside of the consolidated group regime, companies that are 66% or more commonly owned constitute a ‘group’. Group companies can offset losses by election as well as by subvention payment. A subvention payment is a payment made by the profit company to the loss company and cannot exceed the amount of the loss company’s loss. The payment is deductible to the profit company and assessable to the loss company.
Companies that are more than 66% commonly owned may transfer imputation credits as part of loss grouping (i.e. loss offsets or subvention payments). This allows the company receiving the benefit of the loss grouping to pay a fully imputed dividend despite engaging in loss grouping and allows the company to retain the benefit of the loss transfer.
Certain companies subject to special bases of assessment (e.g. mining companies other than petroleum extraction companies) are excluded from the grouping provisions. Branches of non-resident companies may be included, provided they continue to carry on business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment.
Losses incurred by a dual-resident company are not available for offset by election or subvention payment.
## Transfer pricing
The transfer pricing regime applies to cross-border, related-party transactions. This includes transactions between associated persons, transactions with members of a non-resident owning body (e.g. those who ‘act together’ to control the New Zealand taxpayer), and cross-border, related-party borrowings.
The transfer pricing rules are applied consistently with the OECD transfer pricing guidelines and require taxpayers to treat all cross-border transactions with associates as having been made for an arm’s-length consideration. One notable exception is the restricted transfer pricing rule, which applies to inbound debt in excess of NZD 10 million (*as discussed below*). New Zealand also has in place some simplification measures for low value-adding intra-group services, small value loans, and small wholesale distributors.
The transfer pricing rules apply to arrangements for the acquisition or supply of goods, services, money, intangible property, and anything else (other than non-fixed rate shares or capital transactions) where the supplier and acquirer are associated persons.
The documentation should demonstrate that:
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting requirements
The CbC reporting requirements have been published by the OECD in order to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). Each year, the New Zealand Inland Revenue will contact the New Zealand headquartered corporate groups required to file the CbC report and provide templates and guidance.
## Thin capitalisation
‘Inbound’ thin capitalisation rules apply to New Zealand taxpayers controlled by non-residents, including branches of non-residents. The aim of the rules is to ensure that New Zealand entities or branches do not deduct a disproportionately high amount of the worldwide group’s interest expense. This is achieved by deeming income to arise in New Zealand when, and to the extent that, the New Zealand entities in the group are thinly capitalised (i.e. excessively debt funded).
The inbound rules include situations where non-residents are 'acting together' and include trusts where the majority of settlements have come from non-residents or from entities subject to the thin capitalisation rules.
The ‘outbound’ thin capitalisation rules are intended to operate as a base protection measure to prevent New Zealand residents with CFC investments and certain FIF investments from allocating an excessive portion of their interest cost against the New Zealand tax base.
To reduce taxpayer compliance costs, the outbound thin capitalisation rules do not apply when the New Zealand taxpayer has 90% or more of their assets in New Zealand.
Further concessions are available under the ‘outbound rules’ to taxpayers who do not fall below this threshold. If the taxpayer’s interest deduction and dividends paid for fixed rate shares (the finance cost) is below NZD 1 million, no apportionment of deductible interest is required. If the finance cost is above NZD 1 million, but below NZD 2 million, the interest apportionment may be reduced.
An apportionment of deductible interest is required under the thin capitalisation rules when the debt percentage (calculated as the total group interest bearing debt/total group assets net of non-debt liabilities of a New Zealand entity or group) exceeds both:
The worldwide group debt percentage generally takes into account only genuine third-party debt and does not include related-party debt.
Foreign-owned banks operating in New Zealand are subject to specific thin capitalisation rules that deem income if the bank does not hold a level of equity equivalent to 6% of their New Zealand banking risk-weighted assets. In addition, banks are required to have sufficient equity to equity fund offshore investments that do not give rise to New Zealand taxable income in full.
The thin capitalisation regime includes an anti-avoidance rule to ensure that taxpayers do not repay loans just before year-end for thin capitalisation purposes.
## Anti-hybrid and branch mismatch rules
New Zealand’s hybrid mismatch rule can operate to deny deductions and/or include amounts of assessable income for New Zealand taxpayers. These rules aim to eliminate tax benefits arising due to a financial instrument or entity being treated differently for tax purposes by different countries.
It is important to note that the hybrid mismatch rules apply not only where there are direct hybrid dealings involving a New Zealand entity, but also where hybrid dealings exist within the global group, and to transactions with third parties in certain circumstances. Further, the hybrid mismatch rules do not have a *de minimis* or materiality threshold and can apply to any type of cross-border payment.
Inland Revenue issued an operational statement on 30 June 2021 on the administration of the imported mismatch rule, which applies for the income years beginning on and after 1 July 2018. It sets out the steps taxpayers should take before claiming deductions for cross-border related party transactions. Inland Revenue’s expectation is that the New Zealand taxpayer will obtain a written statement from the group's head office tax function confirming the steps that have been taken to ensure that there are no imported mismatches funded by the New Zealand payer. There may be severe consequences if the taxpayer is unable to produce this confirmation upon request within a reasonable timeframe. These could include the loss of any ability to challenge the denial of a deduction by the Commissioner.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
The CFC regime imposes New Zealand tax on the notional share of income attributable to residents (companies, trusts, and individuals) with interests in certain CFCs.
Central to the regime is the definition of a CFC. When five or fewer New Zealand residents directly or indirectly control more than 50% of a foreign company, or when a single New Zealand resident directly or indirectly controls 40% or more of a foreign company (unless a non-associated non-resident has equal or greater control), that company is a CFC. For interests that do not meet the definition of a CFC, the investment may be taxed under the FIF regime (*see below*).
Note that a person with an income interest in a CFC does not have attributed CFC income or losses if:
If the exemptions do not apply, only the CFC’s passive (attributable) income is subject to tax on attribution (on an accrual basis). However, no income attribution is required if a New Zealand resident has an income interest of less than 10% in the CFC.
### Active business test
A CFC passes the active business test if it has passive (attributable) income that is less than 5% of its total income. For the purposes of the test, taxpayers measure passive and total income using either financial accounting (audited International Financial Reporting Standards [IFRS] or NZ GAAP accounts) or tax measures of income.
CFCs in the same country may be consolidated for calculating the 5% ratio, subject to certain conditions.
### Australian exemption
A person with an interest in a CFC does not have attributed CFC income or a loss if the CFC is a resident in, and subject to income tax in, Australia and meets certain other criteria.
### Passive (attributable) income
Attributable, or passive, income is income that is highly mobile and not location-specific (i.e. income where there is a risk that it could easily be shifted out of the New Zealand tax base).
The broad categories of attributable income are as follows:
Taxpayers must disclose interests in CFCs in their annual tax returns. Failure to disclose CFC interests can result in the imposition of penalties.
## Foreign investment funds (FIFs)
The FIF regime is an extension of the CFC regime, which subjects persons with interests in certain foreign entities (that are not CFCs) to New Zealand tax. It also applies when the investor does not have a sufficient interest in a foreign entity to be taxed under the CFC regime.
Common examples of investments classified as FIFs include foreign companies, unit trusts, and life insurance policies issued by foreign entities not subject to New Zealand tax.
The FIF rules can be split into the following two regimes:
### Portfolio FIF rules
The portfolio FIF rules apply to interests of less than 10% in foreign companies, foreign superannuation schemes, and foreign life insurance policies issued by non-resident life insurers (if the CFC rules do not apply). However, a New Zealand resident does not generally have FIF income when:
There are also exemptions for interests in certain foreign employment-related superannuation schemes. These include interests held by returning residents and new migrants acquired before the person became a New Zealand resident or within the first five years of New Zealand residence.
When an interest is exempt from the FIF rules, distributions are subject to tax on a receipts basis in accordance with normal principles.
The taxable income of a New Zealand resident with an interest in an FIF that does not qualify for one of the exemptions is calculated using one of the following methods:
The nature of the interest held and the availability of information restrict the choice of method.
Taxpayers must disclose interests in certain FIFs in their annual tax returns. Failure to disclose can result in the imposition of penalties.
### Non-portfolio FIF rules
The active business exemption (which applies for CFCs) also includes certain non-portfolio FIFs. If the FIF fails the active business test, passive income will be attributed to the New Zealand shareholders. There is also an exemption for shareholders with a 10% or greater interest in an FIF that is resident and subject to tax in Australia.
When investors do not have sufficient information to perform the calculations required under the active business test (or choose not to apply the active business test), they will be able to use one of the attribution methods for portfolio FIF investments (*see above*).

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 20 December 2024
## Foreign tax credits
If a New Zealand resident company derives overseas income that is subject to New Zealand income tax, the company is generally allowed a credit for the foreign income tax paid in respect of that income.
Generally, the credit is limited to the lesser of the actual overseas tax paid on the overseas income or the New Zealand tax applicable to the overseas income.
Foreign tax credits can only be used if the taxpayer is in a tax paying position. If foreign tax credits are not claimed in the current year, they are forfeited.
## Inbound investment incentives
There are limited, specific tax incentives designed to encourage the flow of investment funds into New Zealand.
Legislation encourages foreign venture capital investment into unlisted New Zealand companies. Gains derived by certain non-residents from the sale of shares (held on revenue account and owned for at least 12 months) in New Zealand unlisted companies that do not have certain prohibited activities as their main activity are exempt from income tax. The rules apply to foreign investors who are resident in all of the countries with which New Zealand has a DTA (except Switzerland) and who invest into New Zealand venture capital opportunities.
## Capital investment incentives
Investment allowances on fixed assets are not available.
## Trans-Tasman imputation
Elective rules allow trans-Tasman groups of companies to attach both imputation credits (representing New Zealand tax paid) and franking credits (representing Australian tax paid) to dividends paid to shareholders.
The regime allows eligible wholly owned groups of Australian and/or New Zealand companies to group for imputation purposes only. Groups with both Australian and New Zealand members are known as trans-Tasman imputation groups (TTIGs). New Zealand companies within a trans-Tasman group maintain a separate ‘resident imputation subgroup’ account.
Eligible R&D expenditure gives rise to a 15% tax credit.
Core R&D activities that give rise to a tax credit are:
The expenditure must only relate to certain kinds of eligible R&D expenditure. This includes salary and wage costs, overhead costs, depreciation on assets, and direct expenditure on consumables and materials. Some specific activities and costs will be excluded from the tax incentive.
The incentive is available only for those taxpayers that spend between a minimum (NZD 50,000) and maximum (NZD 120 million) level of R&D expenditure per year, unless the taxpayer obtains approval to exceed the cap. The rules allow limited cash refundability for certain loss-making entities.
## R&D loss tax credit (RDLTC)
The RDLTC provides a refundable tax credit in relation to tax losses from eligible R&D activities and operates similar to a 'loan'. RDLTCs are ‘cashed-out’ in the year the losses are incurred and are paid back when certain events occur (e.g. the R&D assets are sold).

## Financial reporting standards for small-to-medium sized enterprises (SMEs)
Under the Financial Reporting Act 2013, entities that do not fall under the definition of ‘large’ or have ‘public accountability’ do not have to prepare general purpose financial statements in accordance with NZ GAAP. Entities that no longer have to prepare general purpose financial statements under the Financial Reporting Act 2013 are still required to prepare special purpose financial statements for tax purposes. Inland Revenue has provided the minimum requirements for financial statements in an Order in Council. These include a:
These financial statements:
Companies that do not have a statutory obligation to prepare financial statements, or companies that choose not to file financial statements with Inland Revenue, may instead file the financial statements summary (IR10) form.
## BEPS Multilateral Instrument (MLI)
New Zealand signed the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS (MLI) in June 2017. New Zealand has ratified the MLI, and the MLI is now in force in New Zealand.

## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 20 December 2024
## Foreign tax relief
A tax credit is available on the tax paid on foreign-sourced income derived by a resident (up to the level of New Zealand tax payable). In some cases, foreign tax credits will be limited to the lesser of the actual overseas tax paid on the overseas income or the New Zealand tax applicable to the overseas income.
## Tax treaties
## Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
The United States (US) Treasury and the New Zealand government have entered into an inter-governmental agreement (IGA) for the implementation of the FATCA rules, which came into force on 3 July 2014. The FATCA rules require all global financial institutions that are not exempted, including New Zealand financial institutions, to register with and report to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regarding certain financial accounts held with them.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 20 December 2024
## Double taxation agreements (DTAs)
New Zealand is currently negotiating new and updating DTAs with several countries, including Australia, Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Portugal, Slovenia, South Korea, and the United Kingdom.
## Trustee tax rate
Trustee income is subject to a tax rate of 39% from the 2024/25 income year, subject to some limited exclusions.
## ‘FamilyBoost’ tax credit
The FamilyBoost tax credit was introduced in 2024 in relation to childcare costs incurred by families. The credit is available from 1 July 2024.
The amount of the credit for a quarter is equal to 25% of the licensed early childhood education (ECE) fees paid for that quarter, up to a maximum of 975 New Zealand dollars (NZD). However, the amount of the credit abates at the rate of 9.75 cents in the dollar when quarterly household income is greater than NZD 35,000. The amount of the credit is zero when quarterly household income is NZD 45,000 or more.
The tax credit results in a refund for the applicant and is based on actual ECE fees incurred, subject to eligibility requirements. A New Zealand tax resident caregiver of one or more children enrolled with a licensed early childhood service for which ECE fees are incurred may be entitled.
## Bright-line test
Under the bright-line rules, residential land that is disposed of within two years of acquisition is subject to tax (regardless of whether the taxpayer had a purpose or intention of disposal at the time of acquisition). The previous government had extended the bright-line period to ten years from the date of acquisition. The new government has recently enacted changes to reduce the bright-line period to two years for residential land disposed on or after 1 July 2024.
Rollover relief is also available (subject to certain conditions) for transfers between associated persons, including blood relatives, associated companies, trustees of a trust, and transfers to certain non-profit organisations.
## Interest limitation rules
Interest deductibility for borrowing on residential investment property is being phased back in over the next two tax years. Since1 April 2024, 80% of the interest expenses incurred for amounts borrowed in relation to residential property have been deductible. This is regardless of when the property was acquired or when the loan was drawn down. From 1 April 2025, interest deductibility will be fully restored (i.e. 100% deductibility), subject to other provisions governing interest deductibility.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 20 December 2024
## Employment expenses
Generally, no deduction is allowed for expenditure incurred in deriving employment income. It is therefore necessary that employers assess the correct tax treatment of allowances and expense reimbursements at payroll (PAYE) submission time.
## Business deductions
Deductions are available for expenditure incurred in deriving assessable or excluded income (other than employment income) incurred in the course of carrying on a business. Subject to the entertainment expenditure provisions, certain entertainment expenditure is only 50% deductible.
The new government reinstated interest deductibility in relation to residential properties. Since 1 April 2024, interest deductibility has been available for 80% of interest expenses incurred in relation to residential property. From 1 April 2025, interest expenses are 100% deductible.
## Personal deductions
No deduction is permitted for medical, superannuation, or insurance contributions. Certain insurance premiums may be allowed as a deduction under the general permission (i.e. loss of earnings).
## Charitable contributions

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 20 December 2024
## Employment income
## Capital gains
New Zealand does not have a comprehensive capital gains tax. However, income tax legislation specifically includes various forms of gain that would otherwise be considered a capital gain within the definition of 'income’. Gross income includes gains on the sale of real estate in certain circumstances and on personal property where the taxpayer acquired the property for resale, where certain residential properties are bought and sold within two years, where the taxpayer deals in such property, or where a profit-making purpose or scheme can be inferred from the actions of the taxpayer.
Gains on financial instruments are taxable when realised or when the instruments are deemed to have been disposed of. Above certain thresholds, such gains are taxable on an accrual (yield-to-maturity) basis, which may include unrealised gains.
## Rental income
Rent derived from property is gross income. Deductions are allowed for most expenses incurred in deriving the rental income.
From 1 April 2019, deductions for expenditure incurred in relation to residential rental properties are limited to the extent of the residential income derived. Any excess expenditure is 'ring-fenced' and available to carry forward to offset against future residential rental income, but, generally, will not be available to offset against other income streams. Since 1 April 2024, interest expenses have been 80% deductible, and they will be fully deductible from 1 April 2025.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
The CFC regime imposes New Zealand tax on the notional share of income attributable to residents (companies, trusts, and individuals) with interests in certain CFCs.
Central to the regime is the definition of a CFC. When five or fewer New Zealand residents directly or indirectly control more than 50% of a foreign company, or when a single New Zealand resident directly or indirectly controls 40% or more of a foreign company (unless a non-associated non-resident has equal or greater control), that company is a CFC. For interests of less than 10%, the investment may be taxed under the Foreign Investment Funds (FIFs) regime (*see below*).
For income years starting on or after 1 July 2009, a person with an income interest of 10% or more in a CFC does not have attributed CFC income or losses if:
If the exemptions do not apply, only the CFC’s passive (attributable) income is subject to tax on attribution (on an accrual basis).
### Active business test
A CFC passes the active business test if it has passive (attributable) income that is less than 5% of its total income. For the purposes of the test, taxpayers measure passive and total income using either financial accounting (audited International Financial Reporting Standards [IFRS] or New Zealand Generally Accepted Accounting Principles [GAAP] accounts) or tax measures of income.
CFCs in the same country may be consolidated for calculating the 5% ratio, subject to certain conditions.
The active exemption test may also be available to investors with less than 10% interest income in a CFC if certain criteria are satisfied.
### Australian exemption
A person with an income interest of 10% or more in a CFC does not have attributed CFC income or a loss if the CFC is a resident in, and subject to income tax in, Australia and meets certain other criteria.
### Passive (attributable) income
Attributable, or passive, income is income that is highly mobile and not location-specific (i.e. income where there is a risk that it could easily be shifted out of the New Zealand tax base).
The broad categories of attributable income are as follows:
Taxpayers must disclose interests in CFCs in their annual tax returns. Failure to disclose CFC interests can result in the imposition of penalties.
## Foreign Investment Funds (FIFs)
The FIF regime is an extension of the CFC regime, which subjects persons with interests in certain foreign entities (which are not CFCs) to New Zealand tax. It also applies when the investor does not have a sufficient interest in a foreign entity to be taxed under the CFC regime.
Common examples of investments classified as FIFs include foreign companies, unit trusts, certain foreign superannuation schemes, and certain life insurance policies issued by foreign entities.
The FIF rules can be split into the following two regimes:
### Portfolio FIF rules
The portfolio FIF rules apply to interests of less than 10% in foreign companies, foreign superannuation schemes, and foreign life insurance policies issued by non-resident life insurers (if the CFC rules do not apply). However, a New Zealand resident does not generally have FIF income when:
There are also exemptions for interests in certain Australian superannuation schemes.
When an interest is exempt from the FIF rules, distributions are subject to tax on a receipts basis in accordance with normal principles.
The taxable income of a New Zealand resident with an interest in a FIF that does not qualify for one of the exemptions is calculated using one of the following methods:
The nature of the interest held and the availability of information restrict the choice of method.
Taxpayers must disclose interests in certain FIFs in their annual tax returns. Failure to disclose can result in the imposition of penalties.
### Non-portfolio FIF rules
The active income exemption (which applies for CFCs) also includes certain non-portfolio FIFs. If the FIF fails the active business test, passive income will be attributed to the New Zealand shareholders. There is also an exemption for shareholders with a 10% or greater interest in a FIF that is resident and subject to tax in Australia.
When investors do not have sufficient information to perform the calculations required under the active business test (or choose not to apply the active business test), they will be able to use one of the attribution methods for portfolio FIF investments (*see above*).
## Foreign superannuation
Interests in foreign superannuation schemes (excluding certain Australian schemes) that were acquired during a period of non-residence are not taxable on an accruals basis under the FIF rules. Instead, the regime for taxing foreign superannuation schemes applies to cash withdrawals, amounts transferred into New Zealand or Australian superannuation schemes, and disposals of a superannuation interest to another person in certain circumstances. These rules do not apply to regular foreign pension or annuity payments. These remain fully taxable with the exception of Australian superannuation schemes where the tax treatment is determined by the New Zealand-Australia double tax agreement. The rules also do not apply to superannuation schemes that were acquired while the person was a tax resident of New Zealand. These remain in the FIF rules (with the exception of Australian superannuation schemes that are excluded from the FIF rules).
Taxpayers who have already treated their foreign superannuation schemes, and withdrawals in the first 48 months of a person becoming a resident, will generally not be taxable. There are no changes to the tax treatment of Australian superannuation schemes.
Any lump sum withdrawals or transfers to New Zealand/Australian schemes to which the new rules apply are now taxed under one of two new calculation methods.
Under the schedule default method, the tax liability on withdrawal/transfer amount is calculated by applying a fraction to the withdrawal/transfer amount. The fraction is based on how long a person has been present in New Zealand since the end of the 48-month exemption period at the time the withdrawal/transfer is made.
The optional formula method provides an alternative to the default method and is only available for defined contribution plans (provided taxpayers have sufficient information available). This method gives taxpayers the ability to use a method that attempts to tax actual investment gains derived between the end of the 48-month exemption period and the time of withdrawal/transfer.
## Trans-Tasman retirement savings portability
Previously, Australians and New Zealanders working in Australia could not take their superannuation with them when they left Australia permanently.
The Australian government has completed legislative steps to allow individuals to transfer retirement savings between an Australian complying superannuation fund regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and a New Zealand KiwiSaver scheme, and vice versa. The new arrangements took effect from 1 July 2013. Participation in this is voluntary for both members and superannuation funds and schemes and allows the transfer with minimal costs. The savings will generally be subject to the rules of the host country. Lump sum retirement savings transferred between the two countries will be exempt from New Zealand income tax. New Zealand KiwiSaver members will be able to retain any member tax credits if the transfer is to an Australian scheme.
## Portfolio investment entities (PIEs)
A collective investment entity (i.e. a listed company, managed fund, super fund, or a KiwiSaver scheme) that qualifies as a PIE is able to elect into a set of tax rules (the PIE rules).
To be eligible to elect to become a PIE, the entity must be a New Zealand resident company (includes unit trusts), superannuation fund, or group investment fund that meets specific criteria in relation to investor size and investment type.
The key features of the PIE rules are:
The tax rates on PIEs have been aligned with the personal income tax (PIT) rate structure. The PIE tax rates are 10.5%, 17.5%, and 28%.
| Taxable income (NZD) | Taxable + PIE income (NZD) | PIE tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 to 14,000 | 0 to 48,000 | 10.5 |
| 0 to 14,000 | 48,001 to 70,000 | 17.5 |
| 14,001 to 48,000 | 0 to 70,000 | 17.5 |
| 48,001 to 70,000 | 48,001 to 70,000 | 28.0 |
| Any | 70,001 and over | 28.0 |
From 1 April 2025, the PIE tax rate thresholds will be amended to align with changes to PIT thresholds, which apply from 30 July 2024.
| Taxable income (NZD) | Taxable + PIE income (NZD) | PIE tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 to 15,600 | 0 to 53,500 | 10.5 |
| 0 to 15,600 | 53,501 to 78,100 | 17.5 |
| 15,601 to 53,500 | 0 to 78,100 | 17.5 |
| 53,501 to 78,100 | 53,501 to 78,100 | 28.0 |
| Any | 78,101 and over | 28.0 |
### Supplementary dividend tax credit regime
Previously, the supplementary dividend tax credit (previously known as foreign investor tax credit [FITC]) regime ensured that foreign investors were not taxed at more than the New Zealand corporate tax rate by effectively rebating the New Zealand WHT to the extent that the dividend was fully imputed. As non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) rates have been reduced to nil on most fully imputed dividends, a supplementary dividend tax credit is generally no longer required.
The supplementary dividend tax credit regime applies only to fully imputed dividends paid to shareholders holding less than 10% of the shares in the company on NRWT rates of at least 15%.
Broadly:
The changes affect provisional tax calculations for taxpayers who take into account their anticipated supplementary dividend tax credits in calculating their provisional tax. Taxpayers should also consider the need to impute dividends where a tax treaty applies to reduce the NRWT rate.

## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 20 December 2024
## Credits for taxes withheld or paid
Tax credits are available for the following:
## Imputation credits
The imputation system was designed to eliminate double taxation on company profits. Under the imputation system, a company effectively attaches imputation credits (representing tax paid at the company level) to cash and non-cash dividends and taxable bonus issues distributed to shareholders. The shareholders then use those imputation credits to reduce their own tax liability in respect of the company’s dividends. The shareholder includes both the dividends and the imputation credits as assessable income, with a credit being allowed against the shareholder’s income tax liability for an amount equal to the attached imputation credits. Imputation credits cannot be utilised by non-resident shareholders.
## Personal tax credits
Individuals with annual income between NZD 24,000 and NZD 70,000 and who meet certain requirements are entitled to an 'independent earner' tax credit of up to NZD 520 per week. For eligible individuals who earn over NZD 66,000, the annual entitlement decreases by 13 cents each additional dollar earned up to NZD 70,000, at which point the credit is fully abated.
## Credit for charitable donations
An individual can claim a 33.3% tax credit for eligible charitable donations, up to their taxable income.
## ‘Working for Families’ tax credit
Individuals may also be eligible for ‘Working for Families’ tax credits, which provide an in-work payment for families with dependent children. These credits are aimed at low and middle income families. They are generally paid in fortnightly instalments with any under or overpayment being calculated annually. Amounts received are not taxable. The definition of family scheme income means the amount, based on a person’s net income and adjusted as provided by section MB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, on which an entitlement and tax credit under the family scheme is based.
## ‘FamilyBoost’ tax credit
The FamilyBoost tax credit was introduced in 2024 to alleviate the financial pressures faced by low to middle income families in meeting the costs of childcare.
The tax credit results in a refund for the applicant and is based on actual early childhood education (ECE) fees incurred, subject to eligibility requirements. A New Zealand tax resident caregiver of one or more children enrolled with a licensed early childhood service for which ECE fees are incurred may be entitled.
The amount of the credit for a quarter is equal to 25% of the licensed ECE fees payable for that quarter, up to a maximum of NZD 975, however, the amount of the credit will abate at the rate of 9.75 cents in the dollar when quarterly household income is greater than NZD 35,000. The abatement amount is NZD 975, which eliminates the credit when quarterly household income is NZD 45,000 or more.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 20 December 2024
Residence is determined by either of the following tests:
## Non-residents’ exemption
A non-resident’s personal services income earned in New Zealand is exempt from New Zealand tax if all the following conditions apply:
The exemptions listed above do not apply to public entertainers, such as performing artists and professional athletes. They are subject to a maximum 20% withholding tax (WHT).
Special rules apply to non-resident contractors. WHT is required to be deducted from payments to non-resident contractors who do not hold valid certificates of exemption. The tax withheld is an interim tax credited against the taxpayer’s ultimate income tax liability. Non-resident contractors who are present in New Zealand for less than 92 days in any 12-month period and eligible for total relief under a DTA do not have to apply for a certificate of exemption, although they may wish to in order to obtain certainty for the payer. Also, any payments received by a non-resident contractor where the total contract payments are less than NZD 15,000 in a 12-month period will be exempt from non-resident contractor’s tax (NRCT) withheld.
## Double taxation agreements (DTAs)
A non-resident employee may seek relief from New Zealand tax if a DTA exists between New Zealand and the country in which the employee is a tax resident. The following conditions will need to be met in order to obtain relief under the treaty:
## Exemptions for new migrants
A temporary (four year) exemption from income tax is available on certain foreign income derived by new migrants or New Zealanders who return to New Zealand after an absence of at least ten years. The exemption applies to people becoming resident in New Zealand on or after 1 April 2006. The exemption can only be granted once in a lifetime. Employment income from overseas employment performed while living in New Zealand and business income relating to services performed offshore is excluded.
