## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 15 January 2025
## Inventory valuation
Inventories are generally stated at cost and can be valued using the compound average-cost method, first in first out (FIFO), retailer method, or specific identification method. Since all entities must keep legal records, any adjustment resulting from different methods of inventory valuation for tax and financial purposes should be recorded.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are taxed at 15%, which will be paid either through withholding at source or, when the tax cannot be withheld, it must be declared by the taxpayer. In addition, a global system is established that allows taxes that were withheld to be applied as payments on account of the tax on profits when said profits come from goods or rights that are used in the lucrative activity of the taxpayer.
Special rules apply for the 'first sale', and there are certain exemptions listed in the law (e.g. corporate reorganisation).
## Dividend income
In the Income Tax Law, Law number 7092, dividends are taxed as income from movable capital at 15%. The distribution of dividends is exempt when the parent company is another capital company domiciled in Costa Rica, when the latter develops an economic activity subject to income tax, or in the case of a controlling company of a group or regulated financial conglomerate.
### **Stock dividends**
Dividends paid in the form of stock of the distributing company are allowed and are exempt from taxes.
## Interest income
As a result of the Law No. 9635, interest is taxed as income from movable capital at a rate of 15%, unless considered the result of the usual economic activity, in which case it would become part of the global income with a maximum ordinary rate of 30% applicable to local source income.
It must also be considered that, as an exception established by Law No. 10.381, offshore source income can be considered as taxable income for entities that belong to a multinational group if deemed as non-qualified entities, such income would be deemed as taxable with a 15% rate.
Income generated from interest abroad prior to the enforceability of Law No. 10.381 was considered as taxable by the authorities due to the wider interpretation that was validated by judicial authorities and even by the Constitutional Chamber.
## Royalty income
Royalty income coming from sources related to normal business activities is taxable.
In the Income Tax Law, Law number 7092, royalty is taxed as income from movable capital at a rate of 15%, unless considered the result of the usual economic activity, in which case it would become part of the global income with a maximum ordinary rate of 30% for non-qualified entities as an exception of territoriality, which is a tax applicable to foreign source income.
## Foreign income
Foreign-source income is not taxable in Costa Rica.
a) dividends;
b) interest;
c) royalties;
d) capital gains;
e) real estate capital income;
f) other personal capital income.
Additionally, from a VAT perspective, cross-border digital services will be subject to a 13% tax rate.

# Costa Rica
## Overview
Last reviewed - 15 January 2025
Costa Rica, a country in Central America, is bordered by Nicaragua to the north, Panama to the southeast, the Pacific Ocean to the west, and the Caribbean Sea to the east. It became an independent and sovereign Republic in 1821. Costa Rica is divided into seven provinces, with San José as its capital. The official language of Costa Rica is Spanish, and the currency is the colón (CRC).
Although it still maintains a large agricultural sector, Costa Rica has expanded its economy to include strong technology and tourism industries. The standard of living is relatively high, and landownership is widespread. Prior to the global economic downturn, Costa Rica enjoyed stable economic growth. While the traditional agricultural exports of bananas, coffee, sugar, and beef are still the backbone of commodity export trade, a variety of industrial and specialised agricultural products have broadened export trade in recent years. High value-added goods and services, including microchips, have further bolstered exports. Tourism continues to bring in foreign currency, as Costa Rica's impressive biodiversity makes it a key destination for ecotourism. Foreign investors remain attracted by the country's political stability and relatively high education levels, as well as the fiscal incentives offered in the free-trade zones.
Over the last 25 years, Costa Rica has experienced sustained economic growth as a result of an externally oriented growth strategy based on openness to foreign investment and gradual trade liberalisation.
Costa Rica has also been considered a benchmark worldwide in terms of environmental policies and achievements, as well as in the conservation of forests and biodiversity.
Currently, Costa Rica has one of the lowest poverty rates in Latin America and the Caribbean. According to data from the National Institute of Statistics and Census, although there has not been a reduction in the percentage of poor households in Costa Rica, the variation does not represent a significant change (it went from 20.5% to 20% between 2016 and 2017, and to 21.10% in 2018), and the level of extreme poverty has not increased (6.3%).
Costa Rica is also characterised by its high indicators of human development, which place it in a ranking of prevalence with respect to the other countries of the region. Under the model of a social state, our country provides the population with different services, such as free education at all levels, security, and a universal health system.
The *per capita* income in Costa Rica for the year 2000 was 3,808.36 United States dollars (USD) and has grown to 11,630.67 in 2017, showing an overall increase over the other countries of the region, besides Panama, which shows similar stats.
Although the country had one of the highest average real growth rates in Latin America between 2010 and 2016 (4% versus 2.5% regional average), growth has weakened in recent years.
The main challenges facing the country at present are the fiscal deficit and the reduction of poverty.
Through a fiscal reform in 2018 and 2019, the Government established a tax on added value and capital gains, and creates a fiscal rule that would limit the growth of the current government expenditure, among others. The country also established measures to rationalise the expenses charged to the public treasury and for the evaluation and monitoring of public policies. This tax reform is intended to obtain fresh revenues that will reduce the fiscal deficit in the short or medium term.

# Costa Rica
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 15 January 2025
In the year 2023, Costa Rica passed a reform aimed at excluding Costa Rica from the “gray list” of the European Union and within the changes proposed, the taxation of foreign source passive income was incorporated under exceptional conditions. That said, if an entity belonging to a multinational group does not comply with the appropriate substance requirements in the country for the generation of its passive income, income from dividends, interest, royalties, capital gains, real estate income and other passive income could be subject to taxation in Costa Rica.
The CIT is calculated on the corporation's net income, which equals gross income minus deductible expenses. Gross income includes all income derived from any economic activity carried out in Costa Rica.
Corporate income is taxed at a 30% rate. However, the law establishes special rates for small companies whose gross income does not exceed ¢119,629,000 Costa Rican colones (CRC). For this category, the following rates apply:
In addition, the following exemptions are established for micro and small businesses registered with the Ministry of Economy, Industry, and Commerce (MEIC) or with the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG):
Non-residents are also subject to the principle of territorial source income; however, the method of taxation will depend on the presence of the non-resident in Costa Rica:
Entities without permanent establishment: Non-residents that do not constitute a permanent establishment are subject to withholding taxes on Costa Rican source income. Withholding rates vary according to the type of income but range from 5% to 30%.
## Local income taxes
There are no provincial income taxes in Costa Rica; however, there is a municipal tax. The rate depends on the municipality in which the company is located, but the most regular method of calculation is to apply a percentage over net income or sales.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 15 January 2025
## Taxable period
Income Tax Law, Law number 7092 established, the fiscal period will match the calendar year, but there will be special cases in which the taxpayers may request the approval of a fiscal period different than the calendar year.
## Tax returns
## Payment of tax
Employees who receive salaries and other similar or complementary remunerations or benefits must pay a monthly income tax that is withheld by the employer from the monthly payroll. Individuals do not need to file an annual tax return for this type of income.
Self-employed individuals are required to make instalments of estimated taxes, which are computed on the average of the last three fiscal years, and a final payment two and a half months after the end of the fiscal year.
The amounts paid can be treated as paid in account at the moment when the taxpayers file the income tax return to the tax authorities at the end of the fiscal period.

# Costa Rica
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 15 January 2025
## Taxable period
The fiscal period matches the calendar year, but there are special cases in which the taxpayer may request the approval of a fiscal period different than the calendar year.
## Tax returns
The general rule is that all companies must file the tax return two and a half months after its fiscal closing.
The tax system is one of self-assessment with occasional audits by the Tax Administration.
## Payment of tax
Taxpayers are required to make partial payments on account of income tax in each fiscal period, in accordance with the following general rules:
## Tax audit process
For a tax audit to begin, it is necessary that the Tax Administration send a notification to the taxpayer to be audited. The taxpayer is selected according to one of the selection criteria previously established, and this should be indicated in the communication at the beginning of the tax audit. The Tax Administration must start the audit within two months of the communication to the taxpayer.
Once the audit is completed, the auditors hold a meeting with the company and invite them to correct the issues found.
If the company does not accept the correction, it can start the described procedure and pay the respective tax until that procedure has finished along with the corresponding interest.
## Statute of limitations
The action of the Tax Administration to determine a tax liability will be under the statute of limitations of four years. The same term is valid to demand the payment of the tax and its interests.
The aforementioned term is extended to ten years for taxpayers non-registered with the Tax Administration, those that are registered but have filed returns qualified as fraudulent, or those that have failed to file the tax return.
The term of the statute of limitations should be counted as of the first day of the month following the date when the tax should be paid.

# Costa Rica
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 15 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The Value Added Tax (VAT) is an indirect tax levied on the sale of goods and services in Costa Rica. It came into effect on July1, 2019, replacing the previous General Sales Tax (GST).
VAT applies to the sale price of goods and services, including both tangible goods and digital or intangible services, regardless of whether they are domestic or imported.
The standard applicable rate is 13%, however there are specific goods and services that are subject to reduce rates and exceptions:
Tax Credit: Taxpayers may deduct VAT paid on purchase of goods and services (input VAT) from the VAT collected on sales (output VAT), provided the purchases are related to their respective taxable activity.
## Selective consumption tax
The selective consumption tax may be applied at a rate of up to 100% and is levied on goods that are considered non-essential. The tax base is the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) price plus import duties for imported items or the sales value for items produced in Costa Rica. The tax is levied at only one stage in the sale of merchandise. Payment of the tax is required at the time of importation or, for articles produced in Costa Rica, within 15 days of the month of the sale.
## Customs duties/import tariffs
In Costa Rica, all importation of goods and merchandise, with certain exemptions, are liable for corresponding import tariffs and customs duties. Other taxes (e.g. VAT, selective consumption tax) are also levied on the importation of said goods and merchandise.
The most important legal instruments for customs regulations are the Central American Uniformed Customs Code, the Customs Law and its rulings, and other administrative rulings that are periodically issued by the Customs Authority.
## Property tax
## Real estate transfer tax
Real estate transfer tax is calculated as 1.5% of the selling price of the real estate or its property tax value, whichever is higher. The tax is triggered by the direct sale of the real estate or through the indirect transfer of real estate when there is a modification in the control of the entity holding the real estate.
## Stamp duties
Through Law 10,586 the requirement to pay tax stamps was removed, which means this requirement is no longer needed for all testimony or certification of public instruments or documents not subject to registration in the National Registry, to all private contract documents, to all power of attorney or bond documents and to judicial transaction documents; or arrangement, transfer or sale; in the division or allocation of non-registerable assets.
## Franchise tax
The payments realised abroad for the use of a franchise will be subject to remittances abroad with a 25% withholding tax (WHT).
## Withholdings on salary
Companies are required to withhold from employees the amount corresponding to the tax on salary according to the following progressive table on a monthly basis in 2025:
| **Salary (CRC)** | **Withholding rate (%)** |
| --- | --- |
| Up to 922.000,00 | 0 |
| 922.000,00 to 1.352.000,00 | 10 |
| 1.352.000,00 to 2.373.000,00 | 15 |
| 2.373.000,00 to 4.745.000,00 | 20 |
| Over 4. 745.000,00 | 25 |
The tax applies over the excess over each of the frames, and the withholding is considered as 100% of the tax.
There is also a 13th annual payment, called '*Aguinaldo*', which is free of income and social security taxes.
## Social security contributions
Companies must withhold the monthly contribution to social security and submit its own contribution calculated as a percentage of the monthly income received by the employee:
This applicable contribution has been gradually increasing since 2009, until it reaches the 12.16% in the year 2029 onwards.
| **Period of time** | **Contribution** | **Distribution** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| From January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2025 | 10.66% | Employers: 5.42%Workers: 4.17%State: 1,57% |
| From January 1, 2026 to December 31, 2028 | 11.66% | Employers: 5.58%Workers: 4,33%State: 1,57% |
| Effective from January 1, 2029 | 12.16% | Employers: 5.75%Workers: 4,5%State: 1,91% |

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 15 January 2025
In most cases, the place where a company is incorporated is regarded by Costa Rican authorities as the corporate residence.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
According to Costa Rica's tax system, a PE is understood as any fixed site or place of business where the activity of the non-domiciled person is carried out, totally or partially.
The following are considered PEs:
A PE also includes:
The Tax Administration also applies the criteria of the Organisation for Economic and Co-operation and Development (OECD) to determine when an entity can be considered a PE of a company in a determined state. Accordingly, the Tax Administration takes into consideration the following conditions to determine the existence of a PE:

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 15 January 2025
However, the Tax Administration may reject or disregard the expense or cost, in whole or in part, if it is considered as excessive, inadmissible, or not indispensable to obtain taxable income.
## Depreciation
The straight-line and sum-of-the-years-digits methods of depreciation are allowed over the following useful lives:
| **Assets** | **Useful life (years)** |
| --- | --- |
| Buildings | 50 |
| Machinery and equipment | 10 |
| Furniture and fixtures | 10 |
| Vehicles | 10 |
| Agricultural plantations | 2 to 10 |
The Tax Administration, at the request of the taxpayer, can adopt technically acceptable special depreciation methods in cases duly justified by the taxpayer. In addition, the Tax Administration can authorise, through general resolution, accelerated depreciation methods on new assets acquired by corporations with monetary activities requiring constant technological updates, higher installed production capacity, and productive reconversion processes in order to maintain and strengthen their competitive advantage.
## Goodwill
From an income tax perspective, the CIT Law states that goodwill is considered as a non-deductible expense.
## Start-up expenses
A company’s organisational expenses may be deducted in the tax year in which they are paid or credited, or, if they accumulate, in five consecutive tax years, starting from the date of start of productive operations, until the balance is exhausted.
Organisational expenses are those costs and expenses that are necessary to initiate the production of taxable income that, in accordance with the law, are deducted from gross income.
## Interest expenses
Interest and other financial expenses paid or incurred by the taxpayer during the fiscal year directly related to the management of their business and the creation of taxable income are deductible from gross income if those interest expenses are not capitalised.
Note that those interest expenses with rates that exceed the usual market rates will not be considered deductible expenses by the Tax Administration.
The Law on Strengthening Public Finances, Law number 9635 establishes a limit on the deduction of non-bank interest; said deduction is 20% of the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) for each tax period.
There is a temporary provision stating that, for the first year, the above-mentioned limit will be 30%, decreasing 2% each year until it reaches the 20% ultimate floor. The deductions limit established for every year is:
| **2021** | **2022** | **2023** | **2024** | **2025** | **2026** | **2027** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 30% | 30% | 28% | 26% | 24% | 22% | 20% |
## Bad debt
Manifestly uncollectible unpaid debt will be deductible if this debt is originated in habitual operations from the taxpayer's business and all legal actions towards its collection have been exercised.
## Charitable contributions
The Income Tax Law, Law number 7092 establishes a limit on donations of 10% of the net income calculated by the donor contributor, without considering the donation.
## Taxes
Regarding the income tax, penalties, interests over any tax obligation, all other expenses related to the company's habitual commercial activity will be considered deductible, if they can be properly proved.
In VAT´s case, tax credit can be accrued from expenses required for the company's habitual commercial activity, which means it can be offset against the debit balance.
Any other tax is able to have its own exception to non-deductibility, which may be established in its own special law.
## Net operating losses
With the changes made to the Income Tax Law Regulations by Executive Decree 41818, as of June 17, 2019, all companies that have tax losses in a fiscal period may deduct them in the following three fiscal periods. In the case of agricultural companies, the deduction may be made in the following five periods.
This section did not receive any modification when Executive Decree 43198 replaced the old regulation with the new one on December 17, 2021.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Corporations may claim deductions for royalties, technical and management service fees, and interest charges paid to foreign affiliates if they have withheld the proper tax (25% for royalties, franchises, and professional services and 15% for interest). However, the deductions for technical, management service fees, and royalties may not exceed 10% of gross sales in the aggregate if paid to the parent company.

# Costa Rica
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 15 January 2025
There is no group taxation in Costa Rica.
## Transfer pricing
According to the Code of Tax Rules and Procedures of Costa Rica (Law No. 4755), published on 3 May 1971, article 12 states that the agreements between individuals are not admissible against the Treasury regarding tax matters.
On 10 June 2003, Interpretive Guideline No. 20-03, called Tax Treatment of Transfer Prices, was approved. This Guideline established the application of the principle of arm's-length in transactions between related parties. It was basically based on the comparison of the conditions of a determined operation with those transactions carried out by independent companies (i.e. those prices must be equivalent or reasonable to the corresponding similar transactions made between independent companies).
This Guideline attributed to the Tax Administration the power to analyse the operations carried out between related parties when the agreed valuation determines a tax lower than that resulting from the application of the arm’s length, in which case, it must proceed to practice the relevant adjustments.
By 10 September 2012, through Law No. 9069, Article 12 of the Code of Tax Rules and Procedures was modified, establishing that the elements of the tax obligation, such as the definition of taxpayer, taxable event, and others, may not be altered by acts or agreements of individuals, which will not produce effects before the Administration, without prejudice to their legal-private consequences. However, none of the laws indicated above covered essential aspects of the application of transfer pricing, such as:
On 13 September 2013, the Ministry of Finance issued the General Decree No. 37898-H to control the operations carried out between related parties with the objective of regulating the provisions related to the application of Guideline 20-03.
With the issuance of this Decree, taxpayers were forced to evaluate the prices agreed upon in operations involving goods or services sold to local or foreign related parties, considering the prices that would have been agreed upon between independent parties in accordance with the arm’s-length standard. This decree reaches any operation or transaction carried out by companies resident in the country with:
Resolution DGT-R-001-2018, of 11 January 2018, established the obligation to file the country-by-country (CbC) report, to all the parent companies residing in the country, where their global income amounts to more than 750 million euros (EUR). The taxpayers to whom said requirement applied had to submit the first declaration no later than 31 December 2018, for the transactions corresponding to the 2017 period.
## Thin capitalisation
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
In Costa Rican legislation, there is no mention of CFC rules.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 15 January 2025
Branch income is subject to tax at the same rates as corporate income.
There is a WHT of 15% on dividends distributed within the country to another entity with an economic activity of its own and a 15% tax, in lieu of a dividend WHT, on profits transferred abroad.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 15 January 2025
## Foreign tax credit
Costa Rica’s tax system does not allow for the possibility of foreign tax credits.
As an exception, taxpayers considered as non-qualified entities that obtain foreign source passive income, may credit the analogous tax withheld or paid abroad against the Costa Rican applicable tax regarding the same income.
## Free zones
Entities covered by the Free Trade Zone Law may enjoy exemption from import duties on goods, income tax, VAT, export tax, selective consumption tax, real estate transfer tax, and WHT on payments abroad, as well as the discretionary use of foreign currency generated abroad. However, due to rules established by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in force from year 2015, the manufacturing companies can apply to the Free Trade Zone Regime whether the sale of their products is in Costa Rica or outside Costa Rica as long as they comply with the requisites established in the Law. This same rule was extended by means of the Law 9689/2019 to the service companies, under which they can sell their services internally or abroad without any cap or restrictions. Right now, there are proposed regulations under discussion to implement the new rules brought by the Law 9689/2019.
## Drawback industries
Special benefits exist for industries that import semi-manufactured materials for assembly in Costa Rica and export finished products. Benefits consist of duty-free imports of raw materials for subsequent export as manufactured products. Machinery for these industries may also be imported duty-free.

# Costa Rica
## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 15 January 2025
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS) regimen
Costa Rica has made important steps to comply with the CRS developed by the OECD.
The first step was the reform through Law No. 9296 of 18 May 2015 to article 106 quater to the Code of Tax Rules and Procedures through which the procedure called ‘Procedure to request financial information for the exchange with other jurisdictions by virtue of an international agreement’ empowers the Costa Rican Tax Administration to implement the automatic exchange of information that is foreseeably relevant for tax purposes in cases in which an international agreement for the exchange of tax information is executed.
Taking into consideration that Costa Rica acceded to the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters through Law No. 9118 of 7 February 2013, and by virtue of the adhesion of Costa Rica to the Declaration on the Automatic Exchange of Information in Matter Prosecutor of the OECD, signed in May 2014, Costa Rica has implemented the Standard for the Automatic Exchange of Financial Information in Tax Matters as the tool through which Costa Rica will exchange information automatically with other jurisdictions, annually.
Because one of the core issues that the OECD has recorded in the Multilateral Agreement between Competent Authorities on the Automatic Exchange of Information on Financial Accounts is the implementation of the ‘Standard for the Automatic Exchange of Information on Financial Accounts in Tax Matters’ or ‘Common Reporting Standard for Financial Accounts’, known as the Common Reporting Standard (CRS), which establishes that the financial institutions of the countries committed to the exchange of information that is the subject of the mentioned Convention must apply the due diligence procedure to identify the financial accounts that will be subject to the report, and in order to comply with the aforementioned international agreement, the Ministry of Finance of the Government of Costa Rica issued Resolutions No. DGT-R-006-2017 and No. DGT-R-006-2018, referring to the due diligence in the supply of information of the financial and non-financial entities for the automatic exchange of tax information according to the OECD CRS rules.
In these resolutions, the Costa Rican tax authorities define the individuals, terms, procedures, and compliance deadlines that must be complied with by entities required to provide the information foreseeably relevant for tax purposes referred to in the financial accounts that they must report, as established by the CRS. The obligation of the institutions of the financial system to submit to the Tax Administration the information referring to the accounts and payments according to the Standard for the Automatic Exchange of Information on Financial Accounts in Tax Matters, adopted by the Council of the OECD, is established and indicates the general requirements of the obligation to report by Costa Rican financial institutions, with respect to each foreign account, the general due diligence requirements, the review procedures for pre-existing accounts of individuals, review procedures for new accounts of individuals, review procedures for pre-existing entity accounts, review procedures for new entity accounts, special due diligence rules, and a series of definitions.
## Tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs)
Costa Rica has a TIEA with the United States (US), effective since 12 February 1991, but it was replaced by another agreement on November 12, 2019 whereby both countries agree to exchange information, from and/or in relation to public and private entities and individuals, at the request of the party's corresponding authority in relation to any tax relevant issue. On November 12, 2019 this TIEA was replaced by the law 9449.
In April 2018, with the objective of meeting the current standard of fiscal transparency established by the OECD with respect to the exchange of information for fiscal purposes and mutual assistance, the governments of Costa Rica and the United States signed a new information exchange agreement between both countries. The agreement was signed but must be submitted to the Legislative Assembly for ratification.
Under this agreement, both countries will offer assistance through the exchange of information in order to determine, settle, and collect taxes, as well as to collect and execute tax claims, or to investigate or prosecute tax matters. All this information will be treated confidentially between both parties.
This new agreement shows the commitment of Costa Rica to carry out an effective exchange of information in accordance with the standards of the Global Forum of Transparency and Exchange of Information of the OECD.
Currently, Costa Rica has valid TIEAs with Argentina, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Ecuador, El Salvador, Faroe Islands, Finland, France, Greenland, Guatemala, Guernsey, Holland, Honduras, Iceland, Mexico, Nicaragua, Norway, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, and Sweden.
In addition, Costa Rica also signed, in 2013, the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, thanks to which Costa Rica can exchange tax information with all the countries that have this convention in force; currently, 117 countries have signed it.
## Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) agreement
By means of Law No. 9296 of 18 May 2015, a vehicle by which the IGA can be implemented in Costa Rica was created. Under such Law, the Tax Code was modified to include an article 106 quater in which the obligation was established for financial entities (and any other entity that, even without being classified as such, runs any type of financial activity) to provide the Tax Administration with all the information of its clients that is foreseeably relevant for tax purposes and that is required for the implementation of international instruments that contemplate the exchange of information on tax matters in any of its modalities. Thus, such financial information may be transferred by the Tax Administration to jurisdictions with which international instruments have been subscribed that contemplate the exchange of information on tax matters.
In order to obtain said information, the judicial authorisation procedure contained in article 106 ter of this Code, or the authorisation established in article 615 of the Commercial Code of Costa Rica, will not be required.
By means of Law No. 9416 of 14 November 2016, penalties were established for those financial entities that fail to comply with the provision of the pertinent information, and it was also established that said information must be handled in a confidential manner by the tax authorities.
## Free-trade bilateral treaties
Costa Rica is a full member of the Central American Common Market, which guarantees free trade among the countries of the area. It also has a free-trade bilateral treaty in force with Canada, the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), Chile, China, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), Mexico, Panama, Peru, and Singapore. The US-Central American-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) entered into force on 1 January 2009. Additionally, there is a free commerce and cooperation agreement with the European Union (EU) in force since 2013. These agreements aim to provide favourable conditions for the exchange of merchandise between contracting parties.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 15 January 2025
## Employment expenses
A domiciled individual, whether or not a national, whose only source of income is a salary for personal services cannot deduct business expenses.
## Personal allowances
In Costa Rica, personal allowances take the form of tax credits (*see the*[*Other tax credits and incentives*](other-tax-credits-and-incentives.html)*section for more information*).
## Business deductions
Self-employed individuals whose source of income is from professional services (i.e. non-dependent work relationship), insurance brokerage, commissions (sales), fees, etc. may deduct up to 25% of the gross income as a deduction without itemising the expenses or may elect to itemise the expenses incurred in producing the income.

# Costa Rica
## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 15 January 2025
## Employment income
Individuals domiciled in Costa Rica are taxed on salaries, commissions, fees, royalties, and other forms of remuneration for services rendered. Any income earned abroad while tax resident in Costa Rica is not taxable if not related to the economic structure of the country. Salary income operates exclusively on a withholding basis. In this regard, according to the Income Tax Law, all elements paid to the employee related to the labour relationship are considered taxable. All elements considered ‘salary in kind’ must be included in the salary reported in the payroll, and that amount will be the taxable base for both the salary income tax and the social security contributions, with certain exceptions.
Under Costa Rican law, salaried employees have the right to a mandatory Christmas bonus. The amount of mandatory year-end bonus (Christmas bonus) that does not exceed one-twelfth of net salary (which is one-thirteenth of gross salary) is exempt from income tax and is deductible for income tax purposes for the employer.
The reimbursement of personal living expenses and travel expenses for individuals not formally domiciled may be subject to taxes. This would include the reimbursement of similar expenses for the taxpayer’s family. Certain expense allowances at the discretion of the tax authorities are not subject to taxation, nor are they deductible for the taxpayer.
## Capital gains
Income Tax Law, Law number 7092 established that capital gains are subject to a 15% tax, which will be paid either through withholding at source or, when the tax cannot be withheld, declaration by the taxpayer. There is a possibility to opt for a 2.25% tax rate under certain conditions for the first sale of each asset based on the law 9635 enforced after 1 July 2019. In addition, a global system is established that allows taxes that were withheld to be applied as payments on account of income tax when said profits come from goods or rights that are used in the lucrative activity of the taxpayer.
## Interest income
In the Income Tax Law, Law number 7092, interest is taxed as income from movable capital at a rate of 15%, unless it is considered as part of the regular activity of the taxpayer, in which case it would become part of the global income with a maximum ordinary rate of 30%.
## Rental income
Since rental income denotes a permanent physical establishment in Costa Rica, the landlord must file a regular tax return indicating total income, without deduction of expenses.
It will be declared through the real estate capital income return, and subject to a 15% tax rate, with a predetermined 15% of deductible expenses (20% for real estate funds).

## Personal tax credits
Individuals are permitted annual tax credits, as shown below:
| **Allowances for employed/self-employed individuals** | **Annual tax credit (CRC)** |
| --- | --- |
| Spouse (1) | 31,200 |
| Child (each) (2) | 20,640 |

Only self-employed individuals who receive commissions, fees, royalties, or other forms of income for services rendered, and those who receive interest or rental income from local sources must file a tax return. If both spouses earn income, they must submit individual returns, in which case the personal child credit can be credited by only one of the spouses. The present legislation does not contemplate joint filing.
2. The child allowance is permissible only if the child is a minor, is unable to work, or is a university student under 25 years of age.
