## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is chargeable on all taxable goods and services supplied in, or imported into, the United Republic of Tanzania. The standard rate of VAT is 18% in Mainland Tanzania and 15% in Tanzania Zanzibar, except for banking, postal, telecommunication, insurance, and digital services where an 18% rate is applicable. Additionally, the export of goods and certain services is eligible for zero rating. Generally, businesses with or expecting to generate an annual taxable turnover of more than TZS 200 million in Mainland Tanzania and TZS 100 million in Tanzania Zanzibar must register for VAT. The Commissioner has the discretion to register (as intending traders) investors whose projects have not commenced production of taxable supplies but wish to be VAT-registered in order to reclaim the tax they incur on start-up costs. A business that only makes exempt supplies is unable to register for VAT and, consequently, unable to recover the VAT incurred on inputs.
Registered businesses must submit VAT returns, and pay any tax due, monthly.
There is also mandatory registration for professional service providers (e.g. lawyers and accountants) and government entities/institutions carrying out economic activities. A non-resident who carries on an economic activity in Mainland Tanzania without a fixed place (e.g. non-resident suppliers of B2C electronic services) and makes taxable supplies in excess of the VAT registration threshold (no threshold for non-resident suppliers of B2C electronic services) is required to appoint a VAT representative unless it is impractical to do so due to business circumstances, in which case the non-resident would be required to apply for a simplified registration in accordance with procedures prescribed in regulations.
For imported goods, VAT is payable at the time of importation together with any customs and excise duties. VAT payable with respect to specific capital goods (as defined) may be deferred, subject to certain procedures being followed. However, VAT deferment on imported capital goods will cease to apply from 30 June 2026.
For imported services, VAT is accounted for by registered businesses through a 'reverse-charge' mechanism, and such accounting is only relevant where a taxpayer has exempt supplies of 10% or more of the total supplies.
Depending on the industry, there are a number of exempt supplies. These include (this list is not exhaustive):
The VAT Act contains restrictions on claiming of input tax. For example, one cannot claim VAT incurred on entertainment; membership to sporting, social, or recreational clubs or associations; and spare parts and repair or maintenance costs in respect of passenger vehicles.
The input tax claim time limit is six months. However, this time limit starts to run by reference to the date of the fiscal receipt.
Input tax incurred on goods in the six months prior to VAT registration can be claimed no later than in the third VAT return submitted following registration.
A company with taxable supplies of more than 90% of total supplies is entitled to full input tax credit while a company with taxable supplies less than 10% of total supplies is not entitled to claim any input tax incurred.
A company with taxable supplies between 10% and 90% of total supplies is entitled to partial input tax recovery. Two methods of apportionment, namely the average method and direct attribution method, can be used. Imported services are not taken into account as supplies when determining the allowance of input tax for partial exemption purposes.
The VAT Act includes specific requirements to be met by a fiscal receipt to facilitate a refund claim. This includes claims made by diplomats and international organisations. A fiscal receipt is defined to include receipt issued by a fiscal device, by the Government Electronic Payment Gateway, and any other electronic system approved by the Commissioner General.
VAT in Tanzania Zanzibar is administered under a separate but similar legislation.
## Digital service tax
A non-resident involved in digital transactions (i.e. providing electronic services) is required to account for tax of 2% on the turnover (excluding VAT). The Regulations (Income Tax (Registration of Non-Resident Electronic Service Suppliers) Regulations, 2022) provide for procedures to be followed by non-residents providing electronic services, covering matters including scope of services, registration (online), filing simplified income tax returns (online), and payment requirements.
There is a monthly filing requirement of digital service tax returns to be done by the 20th day of the month following the month to which the payment relates.
## Customs duty
Tanzania is a member of the East African Community, which became a Customs Union on 1 January 2005 on the implementation of the East African Customs Union Protocol. This protocol provides for a common external tariff (CET), elimination of internal tariffs, rules of origin, anti-dumping measures, a common customs law, and common export promotion schemes.
Generally, the import duty rates applicable under the CET are as follows:
| Category | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Raw materials, capital goods, agricultural inputs, pure-bred animals, medicines | 0 |
| Semi-finished goods | 10 |
| Finished consumer goods | 25 |
| Specified products | 35 |
| Machinery and spare parts imported by licensed mining companies and used in mining activities | 0 |
| Machinery and inputs (excluding motor vehicles) imported by a licensed company for direct and exclusive use in oil, gas, or geothermal exploration, development, and distribution upon approval by the competent authority | 0 |
Goods originating in Southern Africa Developing Countries (SADC) or the East African Community (EAC) have preferential or nil customs duty rates, subject to meeting the Rules of Origin Criteria. Additionally, following the ratification of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which was officially launched in July 2019, goods imported in Tanzania may enjoy preferential tariff rates provided that they originate from state parties of AfCFTA.
Most imports are also subject to RDL of 2% (except goods that are exempted from import duty, pharmaceutical goods, fertilisers as defined in the EAC Common External Tariff, and kerosene type jet A1 fuel classified under HS Code 2710.19.21) and Destination Inspection Fee of 0.6% of the FOB value.
## Excise duty
Excise duty rates apply on a specific or *ad valorem* basis as follows (this list is not exhaustive, and exceptions may apply in some cases):

## Social security contributions
There is a state social security scheme known as the National Social Security Fund (NSSF), which every employer in the private sector must contribute to. The employer’s contribution is 20% of the employee’s remuneration; however, the employer is entitled to recover up to half of this from the employee.
Similar contribution rates (20%) apply to the Public Service Social Security Fund (PSSSF) scheme, which is a special fund for the employer and employees in the public sector; however, the employer is entitled to recover up to 5% from the employee.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Taxable period
While the year of income for tax purposes is the calendar year, an entity may apply to use its own accounting period rather than the calendar year.
## Tax returns
A statement of estimated tax payable, which contains an estimate of the chargeable income and the tax payable thereon, is due for submission within three months from the beginning of the accounting period. A final tax return must be furnished within six months from the end of the accounting period or within nine months from the end of the accounting period for public sector entities.
WHT returns must be submitted every month. The due date for filing the WHT return is the seventh day of the month following the month to which the tax relates.
## Payment of tax
Instalment tax is payable in four equal instalments not later than three months, six months, nine months, and 12 months from the beginning of the accounting period. Final tax is payable on the date on which the final return is due for submission, namely six months after the end of the accounting period or within nine months from the end of the accounting period for public sector entities.
WHT is due seven days after the month of deduction.
### Penalties
A late filing penalty applies monthly at an amount equal to the higher of (i) 15 currency points (currently TZS 300,000) or (ii) 2.5% applied to unpaid tax. If estimated tax is significantly underestimated, a penalty may also apply.
Interest on late payment is charged at the Bank of Tanzania discount rate on a compounding basis.
## Tax audit process
The normal practice is for the TRA to carry out a review every two or three years.
### Time limit set for the Commissioner to determine an objection
If no determination is issued within six months of an admission of an objection, the underlying tax assessment or decision will be treated as final/confirmed, and the taxpayer can appeal to the Board.
### A 100% tax deposit on objection to tax decisions where there is a flight risk
The Commissioner can demand a deposit of 100% of assessed tax where the Commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that the objector intends to permanently leave the country.
## Statute of limitations
There is a five-year time limit for the TRA to adjust an income tax return filed by a taxpayer (unless there is an instance of fraud, wilful neglect, or serious omission by the taxpayer, in which case there is no time limit). The five years runs from the due date of filing the final tax return.
## Functional currency
Taxable income and deductible expenditure is quantified in Tanzanian shillings. Upon request by the taxpayer, the Commissioner has the power, by notice in writing, to permit quantification in a foreign currency convertible to Tanzanian shillings.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
Income tax is payable by individuals resident in Tanzania (other than short-term residents) on their worldwide income. ‘Short-term residents’ and non-residents are taxable on income from a Tanzanian source.
Personal services have a Tanzanian source if (i) performed in Tanzania or (ii) performed outside Tanzania but where the payer is the government of Tanzania.
## Personal income tax rates
Non-resident individuals are subject to tax at a flat rate of 15% on employment income, which is final tax in Tanzania.
For individuals with business turnover not exceeding 100 million Tanzanian shillings (TZS) *per annum*, specific presumptive income tax rates apply, *as set out in the table under Business income in the [Income determination](tanzania/individual/income-determination.html) section*.
Where the income from investment represents a ‘final withholding payment’, the tax rate applicable is the relevant withholding tax (WHT) rate. The disposal of an investment with a Tanzanian source is subject to tax at a rate of 10% if disposed by a resident and 30% if disposed by a non-resident. The disposal by a resident of an investment with an overseas source is subject to tax at a rate of 30%.
### Resident rates
| Taxable income (TZS) - Monthly | | Tax on column 1 (TZS) | Tax on excess (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over (column 1) | Not over |
| 0 | 270,000 | - | 0 |
| 270,000 | 520,000 | - | 8 |
| 520,000 | 760,000 | 20,000 | 20 |
| 760,000 | 1,000,000 | 68,000 | 25 |
| 1,000,000 | And above | 128,000 | 30 |

# Tanzania
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December. Tax years not coinciding with the calendar year in relation to income from any source other than employment or services rendered are permitted, subject to approval from the Commissioner.
## Income from employment
Tax on employment income is accounted for by the employer WHT at source under the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) scheme.
## Final withholding payments
Tax on final withholding payments is deducted by the payer at source.
## Single instalment tax
Registration of title on the transfer of land and buildings situated in Tanzania, or of a transfer of shares in a locally incorporate company, or realisation of licence or concessional right on a reserved land requires a certificate from the Commissioner confirming that payment of tax (‘single instalment tax’) has been made.
There is also a reporting requirement to the Commissioner within 14 days from the date of realisation of the interest. The respective single instalment tax shall be paid within 30 days or such other period determined by the Commissioner from the date of realisation of an interest.
## Tax returns
An individual is not required to file a tax return if the only taxable income is employment income derived from a resident employer or income subject to tax by way of single instalment tax. Where an individual has taxable income other than this, then there is a requirement to file an individual tax return, a statement of estimated tax payable, and a final tax return, and make instalment tax payments and a final tax payment as appropriate.
The statement of estimated tax payable contains an estimate of the chargeable income for the year of income and is due for filing within three months of the beginning of the year of income (calendar year or accounting period).
A final tax return contains a statement of chargeable income for the year of income and is due for filing within six months of the end of the year of income.
## Payment of tax
Estimated tax is payable in four quarterly instalments (at the end of the third, sixth, ninth, and 12th months of the year of income). Any final tax payable is due by the deadline for filing the final tax return.
Interest on late payment is charged at the Bank of Tanzania discount rate on a compounding basis.
### Online remittance of withholding tax
Tax withheld monthly should be remitted online. The Revenue Gateway System generates a withholding certificate for taxpayers registered by the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA). The online certificate is used to claim credit against income tax. Non-resident taxpayers apply to the commissioner for a paper certificate as they are not registered with the TRA.

Tanzania is a country in East Africa bordered by Kenya and Uganda to the north; Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west; Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique to the south; and the Indian Ocean to the east. The United Republic of Tanzania came into being in 1964 following the union of the Republic of Tanganyika (formed in 1961) and Zanzibar. Its official languages are Kiswahili and English. Dodoma is the national capital of Tanzania, and the Tanzanian shilling (TZS) is the official currency.
Tanzania's major export industries include agriculture, mining, and tourism. A significant proportion of the population are employed in agriculture. Longer term, Tanzania’s significant gas reserves are expected to generate significant export earnings. Other significant sectors of the economy include construction, financial services, manufacturing, telecommunications, and utilities.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
A Tanzanian resident is taxed on worldwide income, irrespective of source. Non-residents are taxable on income with a source in Tanzania.
Gain from the disposal of investments in Tanzania is subject to income tax where such investments fall within the source rules, and, in such a case, the gain will be taxed at a rate of 30%.
## Reduced rate for newly listed companies
A reduced corporate income tax (CIT) rate of 25% applies for three consecutive years for companies newly listed on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE). To qualify, at least 30% of the company's shares must be issued to the public.
## Reduced rate for specific persons
Reduced CIT rates apply as follows:
## Alternative minimum tax (AMT)
AMT applies at a rate of 0.5% to the turnover of companies with perpetual unrelieved tax losses for the current and preceding two income years. Exemption applies to (i) agricultural companies (ii) tea processing companies (for a three-year period from 1 July 2024 to 30 June 2027), and (iii) companies engaged in provision of health or education.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Social security contributions
There is a state social security scheme known as the National Social Security Fund (NSSF), which every employer in the private sector must contribute to. The employer’s contribution is 20% of the employee’s remuneration; however, the employer is entitled to recover up to half of this from the employee.
Similar contribution rates (20%) apply to the Public Service Social Security Fund (PSSSF) scheme, which is a special fund for the employer and employees in the public sector; however, the employer is entitled to recover up to 5% from the employee.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Tanzania.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There are no inheritance, estate, or gift taxes in Tanzania.
## Skills and development levy (SDL)
SDL is a tax on the employer calculated as 3.5% of gross cash emoluments of employees. It is not a tax on the individual but is a cost that needs to be borne in mind when considering the overall cost of employment of employees. It is only applicable to employers who have a minimum of 10 employees.
The following institutions are exempted from SDL: (i) nursery, primary, and secondary schools; (ii) vocational, educational, and training schools; (iii) universities and higher learning institutions; and (iv) religious health institutions.
## Workers compensation fund tariff
Employers are subject to the workers compensation fund tariff. The tariff is payable on a monthly basis and is calculated as a percentage of cash sums paid to employees at 0.5%. Employers are also required to file a monthly return form.
## Property taxes
The property tax rates for valued properties vary depending on the value and location of the property. For unvalued properties, property tax is charged at TZS 18,000 for a normal building and TZS 90,000 per storey for a storey building.

# Tanzania
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
Subject to any provision to the contrary in the Income Tax Act, income is to be calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Local GAAP is in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Corporations must apply an accrual basis of accounting.
## Inventory valuation
Trading stock is valued at the end of the year at the lower of cost and market value. No explicit method is stated for determining inventory cost, and, so far, for tax purposes, such cost will match the cost determined in accordance with GAAP. Special rules apply for the valuation of long-term work in progress.
## Capital gains
There is no separate capital gains tax in Tanzania. Instead, income tax is charged on the taxable profit arising on a gain arising from the realisation of an 'investment asset' (a term that [subject to certain exceptions] includes shares, interests in land and buildings, and a beneficial interest in a trust). The gain is determined as the difference between costs incurred and sale proceeds.
## Dividend income
Dividend income will be included in calculation of taxable income unless it is exempt or a final withholding payment.
Dividend payments are taxed by way of WHT, and this is a final tax. The normal rate of WHT on dividends is 10%.
Where a dividend is paid by a resident corporation to another resident corporation holding 25% or more of shares and voting rights in the corporation paying the dividend, the WHT rate is 5%.
Dividends paid by a company listed on the DSE are subject to 5% WHT (regardless of whether they are paid to a resident or non-resident).
## Interest income
Interest income will be included in calculation of taxable income unless it is exempt or a final withholding payment.
The term 'interest' is defined as payment for the use of money and includes payment made or accrued under a debt obligation that is not a repayment of capital, as well as any gain realised by way of a discount, premium, swap payment, or similar payment.
Interest payments made by residents are taxed by way of WHT at 10%.
## Royalty income
Royalty income will be included in calculation of taxable income unless it is exempt or a final withholding payment.
Royalty payments made by residents are taxed by way of WHT at 15% (regardless of whether it is paid to a resident or non-resident), except for payment relating to the use of cinematography film, videotape, sound recording, or any other like medium, where the applicable rate is 10%, and payment to resident sports entities or the Tanzania Football Federation, where the applicable rate is 5%. WHT on royalty payments to a non-resident is a final tax.
The term 'royalty' means any payment made by the lessee under a lease of an intangible asset and includes payments for:
1. the use of, or the right to use, a copyright, patent, design, model, plan, secret formula or process, or trademark
2. the supply of know-how, including information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment or experience
3. the use of, or right to use, a cinematography film, videotape, sound recording, or any other like medium
4. the use of, or right to use, industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment
5. the supply of assistance ancillary to a matter referred to in paragraphs (i) to (iv), or
6. a total or partial forbearance with respect to a matter referred to in paragraphs (i) to (v), but excludes a natural resource payment.
## Foreign income
A resident person's foreign-source income or loss (from employment, business, and investment) is calculated as that person's worldwide income or loss less any income sourced in Tanzania and plus any loss sourced in Tanzania.
A resident person may claim a foreign tax credit on any foreign tax paid by the person on foreign income. However, such credit should not exceed the Tanzanian tax rate applicable to that income. Any unrelieved amount of foreign tax credit may be carried forward (subject to 'change in control' provisions *as detailed in the [Group taxation](tanzania/corporate/group-taxation.html) section*). An election may be made to relinquish foreign tax credit and claim a deduction for the amount of foreign income tax.
There are no provisions for the deferral of the taxation of foreign income.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
In calculating taxable profit, deductions are allowed for revenue expenditures incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of income, with some statutory exceptions. For capital expenditures, there are specific tax depreciation allowances.
There are special rules with regard to the valuation of trading stock and long-term contracts and in relation to the treatment of instalment sales and finance leases.
There is ring-fencing of mining or petroleum operations by reference to the relevant mining or petroleum licence area.
## Depreciation
The categories of depreciable assets and their tax depreciation rates are set out in the table below.
Expenditures on plant and machinery are generally written off on a reducing-balance basis at rates of 37.5%, 25%, or 12.5%, depending on the category of the asset. Certain plant and machinery for manufacturing, fish farming, and tourist hotels benefit from a 50% allowance equally enjoyed in the first and second years, with the normal rates applying to the remaining balance in subsequent years. There is an immediate write-off of expenditures on plant and machinery used in agriculture.
Expenditures on buildings qualify for a depreciation allowance of 5% per year on a straight-line basis. For intangible assets, the write-off is over the useful life of the asset.
Apart from the immediate write-off of plant and machinery, agricultural businesses also benefit from the immediate write-off of agricultural improvement expenditures (including the costs of clearing land, excavating irrigation channels, and planting perennial crops or tree bearing crops). Buildings, structures, dams, water reservoirs, fences, and similar works of a permanent nature used in agriculture, livestock, or fish farming are written off on a straight-line basis over five years.
Expenditure incurred in respect of mineral or petroleum operations during a year of income qualifies for depreciation allowance at the rate of 20% per year on a straight-line basis.
### Depreciation allowances rates
| Class | Depreciable assets | Rate (%) |

# Tanzania
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
There are no provisions for tax consolidation or group relief in Tanzania.
## Transfer pricing
With respect to transactions between related parties, there is an obligation to 'quantify, apportion, and allocate amounts' for income tax purposes on an arm's-length basis. The Transfer Pricing Regulations and Guidelines require:
## Thin capitalisation
There is a thin capitalisation restriction on the amount of deductible interest for what are termed 'exempt-controlled resident entities', where the debt-to-equity ratio exceeds 7:3. There are specific definitions of 'debt' and 'equity' for the purposes of thin capitalisation.
## Controlled foreign trusts and corporations
There are provisions that relate to the treatment of unallocated income of controlled foreign trusts and corporations.
## Change in control provisions
The change in control provisions are triggered at the moment the underlying ownership of an entity changes by more than 50% as compared to any time during the previous three years. Where there is such a change, the consequences are that:
In certain cases, such a change can also result in the forfeiture of unutilised tax losses and tax credits.
The Commissioner has to be notified immediately before and after the change in control has occurred.
### Exemptions
The change of control provisions do not apply in the following circumstances:
## Other anti-avoidance provisions
Other anti-avoidance provisions exist to address the following:
### Taxing right on an agent of a non-resident person or of a beneficial owner
A taxing right on a 'representative assessee' will apply in respect of income of a non-resident person or 'beneficial owner' for whom the 'representative assessee' acts as an agent.
Activities that can create the categorisation of 'agent of a non-resident person or of a beneficial owner' include employment, any 'business connection', receipt of income for the other party, or acting as a trustee.
The definition of the term 'beneficial owner' includes reference to aspects (whether direct or indirect) of 'substantial control', 'substantial economic interest in or … substantial economic benefit'.
The term 'business connection' includes reference to:

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
The income tax liability of a person with a PE in Tanzania is calculated as if the person and the PE are independent but as if the PE is resident in Tanzania. The income of the PE is taxed at the normal income tax rate for entities, namely 30% on net income or 5% of turnover for technical and management service providers to mining, oil, and gas entities.
The PE is also subject to a tax on 'repatriated income', which applies at a rate of 10% (the same rate as a company would withhold on dividends).
In certain circumstances, business activities of the head office may be attributed to the branch. Arrangements between a PE and head office are generally not recognised, other than the transfer of an asset or liability between the two. Amounts derived (or payments received) and expenditures incurred (or payments made) that relate to assets held by, or liabilities owed by, the business of the PE are attributed to the PE.

## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Foreign tax relief
A tax credit is available to a resident individual for any income tax paid in another country in respect of income sourced from that other country. Such credit cannot exceed the Tanzanian tax rate applicable to that income. Any unrelieved amount of foreign tax credit can be carried forward. An election can also be made to claim relief as an expense instead of as a credit.
Where the income arises in a country with which a double tax treaty (DTT) is in force, the treaty governs relief.
## Tax treaties
DTTs are in force with Canada, Denmark, Finland, India, Italy, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, and Zambia. An East African DTT has been signed but not yet ratified.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Employment income
Income from employment includes cash emoluments and the value of benefits in kind (generally the market value). There are special rules for taxing the provision of residential accommodation, motor vehicles, and preferential loans, as set out below.
### Housing benefit
Housing benefit is the lower of:
### Quantification of car benefits
Car benefit is taxed on the following annual values:
| Engine size | Vehicle less than 5 years old (TZS) | Vehicle more than 5 years old (TZS) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Not exceeding 1000cc | 250,000 | 125,000 |
| Above 1000cc but not exceeding 2000cc | 500,000 | 250,000 |
| Above 2000cc but not exceeding 3000cc | 1,000,000 | 500,000 |
| Above 3000cc | 1,500,000 | 750,000 |
No benefit is assessable in respect of the car where the employer does not claim a deduction in respect of the ownership, maintenance, or operation of the vehicle.
### Preferential loans
The statutory interest rate is determined by the prevailing rate as provided by the Central Bank. This is the rate to consider in assessing any taxable benefit in relation to preferential loans.
## Business income
### Presumptive income tax based on turnover
| Turnover (TZS) | Tax liability (TZS) | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Section 35 of the TAA 2015 is not complied with (i.e. taxpayer does not maintain records) | Section 35 of the TAA 2015 is complied with (i.e. taxpayer maintains records) |
| Less than 4 million | 0 | 0 |
| 4 million to 7 million | 100,000 | 3% of amount in excess of 4 million |
| 7 million to 11 million | 250,000 | 90,000 plus 3% of amount in excess of 7 million |
| 11 million to 100 million | 3.5% of turnover | |
### Presumptive income tax for individuals engaged in transportation of passengers or goods
| Class A: Passenger services vehicles | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S/N | Number of passengers | Tax payable (TZS) |
| 1 | Up to 15 | 250,000 |
| 2 | 16 to 30 | 650,000 |
| 3 | 31 to 45 | 1,100,000 |
| 4 | 46 to 65 | 1,600,000 |
| 5 | Above 65 | 2,200,000 |
| Class B: Tour service vehicles | | |
| 1 | Up to 15 | 650,000 |
| 2 | 16 to 25 | 900,000 |
| 3 | 26 to 45 | 1,300,000 |
| 4 | 46 to 65 | 1,800,000 |
| 5 | Above 65 | 2,400,000 |
| Class C : Goods carrying vehicles | | |
| 1 | Less than 1 | 250,000 |
| 2 | 1 to 5 | 500,000 |
| 3 | 6 to 10 | 750,000 |
| 4 | 11 to 15 | 1,100,000 |
| 5 | 16 to 20 | 1,300,000 |
| 6 | 21 to 25 | 1,650,000 |

| 8 | More than 30 | 2,200,000 |
| Class D: Private hire services vehicles | | |
| 1 | Motorcycle | 65,000 |
| 2 | Tricycle | 120,000 |
| 3 | Taxi | 180,000 |
| 4 | Ride hailing | 350,000 |
| 5 | Ride Sharing | 450,000 |
| 6 | Special Hire | 750,000 |
### Filing of financial statements
To reduce the administrative burden for sole traders and improve voluntary compliance, an annual turnover threshold of at least TZS 100 million is required for a taxpayer to submit audited financial statements with the revenue authority.
## Capital gains
The realisation of an investment asset (e.g. shares and securities, land, buildings) is a taxable event for income tax purposes. Where there is a disposal of an investment, then in arriving at the taxable ‘net gains’ a deduction can be claimed in relation to various costs, including costs in relation to acquisition, improvement, and disposal.
Relevant exemptions include:
The date of realisation of an interest in land, petroleum or mineral rights, buildings, shares or securities, and licence or concessional right on reserved land is the earlier of the date of:
The compliance requirements relating to the above realisation include:
### Other considerations
Resident individuals who do not have records of the costs of assets will, on realisation of interest in land or buildings, pay tax at the rate of 3% of the higher of the incomings from the realisation or the approved asset value (instead of 10% on the profits).
## Dividend income
Dividend income is subject to tax by way of WHT, which is a final tax.  The normal rate is 10%, but a reduced 5% rate applies to dividends paid by listed companies.
Dividend income from non-resident companies is subject to tax at a rate of 10% if paid to a resident individual (and not in the nature of business income).  A tax credit can be claimed for foreign income tax on the dividend.
## Interest income
Interest paid to an individual (unless the interest is in the nature of business income to the individual) is treated as a ‘final withholding payment’, whereby the WHT is a final tax.
## Rental income
Rent on land and buildings paid to a resident individual (unless the rent is received in the course of conducting a business) is treated as a ‘final withholding payment’, whereby the WHT is a final tax.
