# Barbados
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
## Inventory valuation
Inventory is generally stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. First in first out (FIFO) or average values are generally used for book and tax purposes. Last in first out (LIFO) is not acceptable for tax purposes. The Barbados Revenue Authority will normally accept a method of valuation that conforms to standard accounting practice in the trade. Conformity between book and tax values is expected.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are not taxed in Barbados.
## Dividend income
Dividends between two companies resident in Barbados are not taxed in the hands of the recipient. Dividends received by a resident Barbados company from a non-resident entity where the equity interest owned is at least 10% of the non-resident company and the shareholding is not held solely for the purpose of portfolio investments are not subject to tax.
Dividends paid by a regular business company to a non-resident shareholder are no longer subject to WHT when the amount paid as dividends is derived from income earned from sources outside of Barbados.
## Interest income
Amounts received on account of, in lieu of, or in satisfaction of interest are included in the calculation of assessable income. In certain instances (to the extent specified by regulation), certain types of interest may be exempt from inclusion into the calculation of assessable income, including interest on bonds, debentures, or stock of the government of Barbados that is beneficially owned by a non-resident; interest on tax reserve and tax refund certificates; and interest on holdings (within certain limits) of National Development Bonds, National Housing Bonds, Savings Bonds, and Sugar Industry Bonds classified as non-taxable bonds, as well as interest income from some CARICOM countries.
## Royalty income
Royalties received by a corporation are taxable as income from a business or property. Royalties earned from CARICOM sources are normally exempt from the payment of CIT.
## Partnership income
Amounts received from a partnership or syndicate for the income year, regardless of whether or not these amounts were withdrawn during the income year, are included in the calculation of assessable income.
## Foreign income
A Barbados corporation is taxed on foreign branch income as earned. Double taxation is avoided by means of foreign tax credits or an exemption where DTAs exist.

# Barbados
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
## Taxable period
CIT returns are prepared on a fiscal-year basis.
## Tax returns
Companies with fiscal years ending between 1 January and 30 September (both dates inclusive) are required to file a CIT return on or before 15 March in the year following the end of the fiscal period. Companies with fiscal years ending any time between 1 October and 31 December (both dates inclusive) are required to file a CIT return on or before 15 June in the year following the end of the fiscal period.
The Barbados Revenue Authority has instituted an online filing system, and CIT returns must be filed online using the online filing system known as TAMIS.
## Payment of tax
Companies with fiscal years ending between 1 January and 30 September (both dates inclusive) are required to make an instalment of CIT for the income year in which the fiscal period ends on or before 15 September of that year. The instalment is 50% of the net CIT payable for the preceding income year. The remainder of CIT due (if any) must be paid on filing of the CIT return by 15 March of the following year.
Companies with fiscal years ending between 1 October and 31 December (both dates inclusive) are required to make two instalments of CIT for the income year in which the fiscal period ends on or before 15 December of that year and 15 March of the following year. The instalments are each 50% of the net CIT payable for the preceding income year. The remainder of CIT due (if any) must be paid on filing of the CIT return by 15 June of the following year.
All companies (with the exception of approved small businesses) are now required to prepay CIT monthly in an amount equal to one-twelfth of the tax payable on the taxable income for the income year before the preceding income year. Prepayments must be paid no later than the 15th day of each calendar month.
For companies with fiscal years ending between 1 January and 30 September (both dates inclusive), any remainder of CIT due must be paid on filing of the CIT return by 15 March of the following year.
For companies with fiscal years ending between 1 October and 31 December (both dates inclusive), any remainder of CIT due must be paid on filing of the CIT return by 15 June of the following year.
It is possible to apply for a reduction or waiver in the instalments if lower profits are anticipated in the current year when compared with those of the income year before the preceding year.
### Penalties
The penalties and interest for failing to file a return on time and pay the CIT due are as follows:
The penalty for failing to make an instalment of CIT by the due date is 10% of the CIT instalment due, plus interest at 0.5% per month on the CIT instalment outstanding.
## Tax audit process
A person authorised by the Commissioner may, at any reasonable time, audit the books and records, or other documents that may relate to the information that should be in the books or records, examine property, request reasonable assistance from the owner, or, as necessary, seize or retain any documents that may be relevant.
## Statute of limitations
Every person required to deliver a return of assessable income for an income year shall keep adequate records and shall retain every such record or voucher for a period of up to five years after the end of the relevant income year, unless the Commissioner otherwise directs, before the disposal of such records. Every person carrying on a business must obtain written permission from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue before disposing of books or records.
Notwithstanding the above, the Commissioner may make a re-assessment within nine years after the end of an income year, where a misrepresentation has been made or a person has failed to disclose any material information.
The Barbados tax authorities have been focused on the efficient collection of taxes and voluntary compliance.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is levied at the rate of 17.5% on the value of a wide range of goods and services imported or supplied in Barbados by VAT-registered persons.
A number of services, including financial services, real estate, medical services, and education, are exempt. Intergroup transactions are taxable.
Persons operating under Barbados’ VAT regime must be registered for VAT. The threshold for VAT registration is 200,000 Barbados dollars (BBD), but voluntary registration is permitted for persons whose annual turnover is less than BBD 200,000.
Registered persons may deduct input tax from their output tax in calculating the tax payable for that VAT accounting period. Where input tax exceeds output tax, the registrant will be entitled to a refund of VAT.
Effective 1 December 2019, VAT applies on digital services to local consumers on the island by suppliers of digital services. The foreign company must apply, collect, and remit VAT on their digital sales.
The new measure will affect:
## Custom duties
Customs duty is levied on a wide range of imported goods at rates specified in Part 1 of the First Schedule of the Customs Act. Barbados’ Customs Tariff is based on the Common External Tariff of the Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM), with special derogations for certain items (e.g. spirituous beverages). Customs duty is calculated on either an *ad valorem* basis or at specific quantitative rates. The *ad valorem* rates for most items vary between 0% and 20%, but certain goods regarded as luxury items are subject to higher rates (e.g. jewellery 60%). In addition, a select group of items that are produced within Barbados and CARICOM (including some agricultural products) are subject to a duty rate of 60% when imported from outside the region.
Manufacturers and agriculturists, including persons involved in fishing and horticulture, are exempt from the payment of duty on inputs (including packaging materials, machinery, equipment, and spares) imported for use in their businesses.
The various departments and institutions, international bodies, and organisations listed in Part II-B of the Customs Tariff are exempt from the payment of customs duty. Specific goods (e.g. computers), also mentioned in Part II-B, are exempt from customs duty.
## Excise taxes
Five categories of goods (both locally manufactured, as well as imported) are subject to excise taxes. These are sweetened beverages, motor vehicles, spirituous beverages, tobacco products, and petroleum products. Most excisable goods are subject to the tax at a specific rate, with the exception of motor vehicles and sweetened beverages, which are subject to *ad valorem* rates.
A few persons and goods are exempt from excise taxes. These include motor vehicles imported by the diplomatic corps and other organisations exempt from customs duty under Part II-B of the Customs Tariff, goods imported for temporary use or for a temporary purpose that will be re-exported within three months, and goods (other than spirits) intended to be used as raw materials for the manufacture or production in Barbados of other taxable goods.
## Fuel tax
Effective 1 July 2018, a fuel tax was imposed on importations of gasoline and diesel at a rate of BBD 0.40 per litre and kerosene at a rate of BBD 0.50 per litre.
## Land tax
The following land tax rates are in effect:
| Land | Land tax rate |
| --- | --- |

| On first BBD 150,000 | 0 |
| On amounts between BBD 150,000 and BBD 450,000 | 0.10% of the improved value |
| On amounts between BBD 450,000 and BBD 850,000 | 0.70% of the improved value |
| On amounts exceeding BBD 850,000 | 1% of the improved value, capped at BBD 100,000 |
| On the improved value of each parcel of land on which there is a building other than a residence | 0.95% of the improved value |
| On the site value of each parcel of unimproved land | 0.80% of the site value up to 4,000 sq. ft; 0.90% of the site value over 4,000 sq. ft and valued up to BBD 450,000; 1% on excess |
The following concessions have been granted for land taxes:

## Overview
Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
Barbados, the eastern-most Caribbean island, gained full independence in 1966 and maintained ties to the British monarchy, represented in Barbados by the Governor General. On 30 November 2021, Barbados transitioned from a parliamentary constitutional monarchyto a parliamentary republic with a ceremonial indirectly elected president as head of state. The prime minister remains head of government. The island's capital city is Bridgetown, and the official language is English. The currency of Barbados is the Barbados dollar (BBD), which is pegged to the United States dollar (USD) at USD 1 = BBD 2.
Barbados has a largely free-enterprise, small open economy that was, until the 1970s, based primarily on sugar agriculture. Barbados now has four key productive industries: tourism, international financial services, agriculture, and manufacturing. Construction and real estate services have also increased significantly. The priority in economic growth is the generation of steady growth through foreign exchange earnings and employment generation, with special emphasis on tourism and international financial services.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
A corporation is deemed to be resident in Barbados if its management and control is exercised in Barbados.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The concept of a PE is described within a number of Barbados’s double taxation agreements (DTAs). A PE is, in general, created in line with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Convention and is defined in domestic legislation as:
Under domestic legislation, a non-resident person is deemed to have been carrying on business in Barbados, and hence required to file a CIT return, where in an income year such a non-resident person:
In either of the circumstances mentioned above, the non-resident shall be deemed to have been carrying on business in Barbados in that income year and the income of that business shall be deemed to be income derived from Barbados for that income year.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
Business expenses that are reasonable and incurred for the purpose of producing assessable income are deductible for tax purposes unless disallowed by a specific provision of the Income Tax Act. Deduction of capital expenditures is specifically prohibited, but special provisions may allow tax depreciation on these expenditures.
## Depreciation
Depreciation for tax purposes is computed on a straight-line basis at prescribed rates. The process is accelerated by additional initial allowances in the year of acquisition. Conformity between book and tax depreciation is not required. Gains on sales of depreciable assets are taxable as ordinary income up to the amount of tax depreciation recaptured, and losses on sales below depreciated value are deductible.
### Capital allowance
| Capital allowance | Rate |
| --- | --- |
| Annual allowance: |  |
| Plant and machinery | Various rates |
| Industrial buildings | 4% |
| Intellectual property | 10% of 50% of the amount expended |
### Renewable energy allowance
Companies that have had an energy audit, retrofitted a building, or installed a system to provide electricity from sources other than fossil fuels are granted an additional 50% of the annual allowance claimed in an income year.
### Depletion
For oil and gas companies, depending on certain circumstances, a depletion allowance of 20% or 10% is given in addition to annual depreciation on prescribed types of capital expenditure.
## Goodwill
Goodwill is not a depreciating asset, and tax amortisation is not available.
## Start-up expenses
There are no specific provisions in relation to deductions for start-up expenses. However, some of these are treated as costs incurred on account of capital expenditure. Such costs are therefore not allowable deductions for tax purposes.
## Interest expenses
A Barbados corporation can claim a deduction for interest expenses. However, where interest claimed as a deduction has not been paid within two years of being accrued (one year if on a loan from a related party), it should be added back to assessable income.
## Bad debts
Amounts representing debts owed that have been established as bad debts during the income year and have been previously included in calculating assessable income for that income year or a previous income year are deductible in calculating assessable income.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions are generally deductible where they are made to entities that are specifically registered as charities or not-for-profit organisations with the Corporate Affairs and Intellectual Property Office.
## Pension expenses
Contributions made by companies under registered pension schemes are deductible in calculating assessable income.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties imposed are generally not deductible.
## Taxes
Taxes on income are not deductible.
## Net operating losses
With effect from income year 2025, tax losses will only be available to be carried forward for five income years following the income year in which the loss was incurred.
From income years 2015 to 2024, losses can generally be carried forward for seven years (previously nine years) after the income year in which they are incurred and may be applied in full against future taxable profits. Notwithstanding this, a tax loss incurred by a person in respect of residential property can only be deducted against assessable income earned by that person in respect of residential property.
From income year 2019, tax losses brought forward available for offset in an income year are restricted to 50% of the taxable income in the year in which the tax loss is utilised instead of 100%.
Losses of general insurance companies can only be carried forward for five income years, and losses of life insurance companies cannot be carried forward at all.
No carryback is allowed for CIT losses.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
A Barbados corporation can claim a deduction for royalties and interest charges paid to foreign affiliates, provided that payments are no greater than what it would pay to an unrelated party.
Fees or charges for management and/or administrative services provided by a member of a group of companies to other members of the group in Barbados are not deductible for tax purposes.
### Restriction on deduction of management fees
Management fees paid or payable to non-residents may not be deducted for tax purposes.
### Restriction on deduction of interest
Interest payable on outstanding debts due to a non-resident related party that owns more than 10% of the company is not deductible to the extent that the total debt exceeds one and a half times the equity of the company.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
## Group relief
The provisions for group relief will enable the current trading losses of a surrendering resident company to be set-off, by way of relief from CIT, against the profits of a claimant company, whether in whole or in part. Group relief is available where:
Group relief will apply from income year 2024 with respect to all entities that have trading losses from income years prior to income year 2024 in excess of USD 50 million. For all other companies, group relief will apply from income year 2025.
## Transfer pricing
Although Barbados has no specific transfer pricing legislation or regulations in place, the Income Tax Act contains a section dealing with artificial transactions. This enables the revenue authorities to amend the assessable income of a person where they believe the main purpose of a non-arm's-length transaction is to artificially reduce that person's assessable income.
In such circumstances, the transaction is disregarded or modified to achieve the effect that no longer results in the artificial reduction of that person’s assessable income.
## Thin capitalisation
Barbados has introduced a thin capitalisation rule of 1.5 to 1 effective 1 September 2019. Interest payable on outstanding debts due to non-resident related parties, owning more than 10% of the company, will be deductible to the extent that the total amount of debt does not exceed more than one and a half times the equity of the company. Any portion of interest exceeding the above ratio will no longer be deductible.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Barbados does not have tax provisions with respect to CFCs.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
Branches are taxed on the same basis as corporations. In addition, a 5% (reduced to 0% if paid out of income earned outside of Barbados as of 1 April 2018) withholding tax (WHT) is imposed on the transfer or deemed transfer to the head office of the after-tax profits that are not reinvested in Barbados, unless a DTA overrides this.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
## Foreign tax credit
Barbados allows a credit for foreign taxes (taxes paid in jurisdictions outside Barbados). However, the credit claimed cannot reduce the total tax payable by the person on that income to less than 1%.
## Employment tax credit
Where a person carries on business in an income year and during that income year or any of the following two consecutive income years:
that person is entitled to a tax credit of 10% of the actual amount of the expenditure incurred in respect of wages for the increase in employees.
The credit is applied in the year in which persons meet the above-mentioned criteria. Any unused credit can be carried forward for three years from the end of the income year in which the credit was obtained, and no cash refund shall be allowed.
## Jobs credits
A jobs credit may be claimed by a company or PE carrying on business in specified sectors and incurring eligible payroll expenditure after 1 January 2024. The jobs credit will be determined as follows:
A claim for a jobs credit must correlate to the income year in which the eligible payroll expenditure was incurred. These credits may be set-off against any other tax liability for a period of four years.
## Patent box regime
Barbados has introduced a new patent box regime whereby, on election, income derived from qualifying intellectual property (IP) may be subject to tax at a rate of 4.5%. The categories of IP that qualify under the regime include rights to software copyright, rights to patents, and other similar legally protected rights.
## Productivity and innovation tax credit
Entities incurring expenditure that is innovative in nature and leading to the development of a new manufacturing process, product, service, or organisational procedure will be granted a tax credit of 25% of the amount expended in that income year. The credit will only be granted if the innovation was successfully introduced to the market as evidenced by increases in sales, productivity, or organisational efficiency.
Any unused tax credit shall be carried forward for a maximum of three years from the end of the income year in which the credit was obtained, but no cash refund will be allowed. Certification from the Executive Director of the National Productivity Council is required.
## Renewable energy
A number of tax concessions have been enacted with respect to the conservation of energy. These measures include a 150% deduction of actual expenditure, not exceeding BBD 25,000, for each year for five years in respect of the following:
The business must be current in the payment of its CIT, VAT, land tax, and National Insurance contributions, or, where not current, has entered into an agreement with the respective authorities to settle outstanding arrears.
Further tax concessions have been enacted with respect to the generation and sale of electricity from renewable energy sources and installation and sale of renewable energy electricity systems or energy efficient products, including:
From income year 2024, a company may claim an R&D credit of 50% of eligible expenditure incurred after 1 January 2024 in relation to qualifying R&D activities. Qualifying R&D activities include activities undertaken in the fields of medical sciences, engineering and technology, natural sciences, and financial technology. Qualifying R&D activities should be carried on wholly or mainly in Barbados, involve innovation and technical risk, and be carried on for the purpose of:
Qualified R&D activities are not eligible for persons engaged in the business of export to a country outside the Common Market on specified expenditure relating to market R&D for the purpose of promoting the export sales of the business.
These credits may be set-off against any other tax liability for a period of four years.
## Housing Incentives Act, Cap. 226A

In addition, 120% of certain expenditures directly related to the development of the business are deductible for tax purposes. Investors in such businesses are exempt from WHT on interest and dividends earned on their investment.
## Special Development Areas Act, Cap. 273A

# Barbados
## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
## Crypto-asset Reporting Framework
On 26 November 2024, Barbados signed the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on Automatic Exchange of Information under Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF MCAA).
The CARF MCAA establishes clear protocols for the automatic exchange of information on crypto-asset transactions. Barbados aims to implement the CARF MCAA framework in 2027, with the first exchange to occur in 2028.
## Pillar two subject to tax rule
Barbados signed the Multilateral Convention to facilitate the implementation of the Pillar Two Subject to Tax Rule (STTR MLI) on 24 September 2024. The STTR is a treaty-based rule that protects the right of developing Inclusive Framework members to tax certain intra-group payments, where these are subject to a nominal corporate income tax that is below the minimum rate.
## Country-by-Country Reporting Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (CbC MCAA)
On 23 December 2021, the Revenue Commissioner, as the designated competent authority of Barbados, executed the CbC MCAA and lodged the required notifications with the OECD.
## Country-by-Country (CbC) reporting
Barbados has entered into CbC reporting as part of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan set forth by the OECD. With the goal of promoting transparency and accuracy in reporting, CbC reporting requires MNEs to include detailed financial and tax information relating to the global allocation of their income and taxes, among other indicators of economic activity.
The Income Tax (Country-by-Country Reporting) Act, 2021-27 came into effect on 31 December 2021 and is the domestic, legal, and administrative framework to impose and enforce CbC reporting requirements on in-scope MNEs in Barbados. Under the Act, MNEs with total consolidated group revenue of more than USD 850 million, as reflected in their consolidated financial statements, are now required to prepare and submit a report to the Barbados Revenue Authority. Barbados' competent authority will annually exchange, on an automatic basis, the CbC report received from each reporting entity that is resident for tax purposes in Barbados with all such other competent authorities of jurisdictions with respect to which Barbados has an agreement in effect and in which, on the basis of the information in the CbC report, one or more constituent entities of the multinational group of the reporting entity are either resident for tax purposes or are subject to tax with respect to the business carried out through a Barbados PE.
CbC reporting is in effect for fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2021. The due date for reporting is 12 months after the fiscal year-end, and notification is required no later than the last day of the reporting fiscal year.
Constituent entities of an MNE group that are resident in Barbados must submit CbC notifications as well as CbC reports to ensure compliance with sections 4 and 5 of the Income Tax (Country-By-Country Reporting) Act, 2021-27 (the Act).
Any constituent entity that is resident for income tax purposes in Barbados must notify the Barbados Revenue Authority, whether it is the ultimate parent entity or the surrogate parent entity of the MNE group, no later than the last day of the reporting fiscal year of the MNE group. Where a constituent entity of an MNE group that is resident for tax purposes in Barbados is not the ultimate parent entity nor the surrogate parent entity, it must notify the competent authority of the identity and tax residence of the reporting entity, no later than the last day of the reporting fiscal year of the MNE group.
CbC reports must be filed within 12 months after the end of the fiscal year of the ultimate parent. MNE groups with an ultimate parent located outside of Barbados may be required to file the report locally in Barbados in circumstances where the CbC report would not be automatically exchanged with the Barbados Revenue Authority. There is a penalty of BBD 10,000 for failure to comply with the filing requirements.
## Economic substance
Barbados, in common with a number of other jurisdictions, was required by the European Union (EU) Code of Conduct Group on Business Taxation to introduce economic substance requirements for companies and partnerships that are tax resident on the island. As a result, Barbados has introduced economic substance legislation for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020. Barbados tax resident companies and partnerships carrying on relevant activities will be required to meet an economic substance test.
Relevant activities are defined as any of the following businesses:
There are financial penalties in the case of failure to meet the economic substance test of up to BBD 300,000. After failing to meet the economic substance test for two consecutive years, the Director of International Business may issue an order that the company be struck off the register of companies. There is provision for appeal against penalty determinations.
## United States (US) Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
On 17 November 2014, the US Treasury and Barbados signed and released an intergovernmental agreement (IGA). The regulations to the Income Tax Act to allow for automatic exchange of information were enacted on 3 September 2015, and the IGA entered into force on 25 September 2015.
## Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters
Barbados has signed and ratified the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, which entered into force, in respect of Barbados, on 1 November 2016 and for taxable periods beginning after 2017. Under the convention, Barbados will exchange tax information based on OECD standards, but is not required to collect taxes on behalf of another country or provide assistance in the service of related documents.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
In November 2014, the G20 countries endorsed a new CRS for automatic exchange of information developed by the OECD. Under the CRS, foreign tax authorities will provide information to the Barbados Revenue Authority relating to financial accounts in their jurisdictions held by Barbadian residents. The Barbados Revenue Authority will, on a reciprocal basis, provide corresponding information to the foreign tax authorities on accounts held by residents of their jurisdiction in Barbados.
The CRS in Barbados is effective from 1 January 2017. However, due to a delay in finalising the logistics in order to successfully fulfil their reporting obligations, financial institutions were required to report the relevant 2018 information by 31 July 2019. As of 31 December 2017, Barbadian financial institutions must have procedures to identify accounts held by residents of any country other than Barbados and to report the required information to the Barbados Revenue Authority.
On 26 November 2024, Barbados signed the Addendum to the CRS MCAA (the updated Common Reporting Standard (CRS 2.0)) at the 17th Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes Plenary Meeting.
This updated CRS Addendum strengthens reporting and due diligence requirements.
## Inclusive Framework (IF) on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)
On 4 July 2017, Barbados joined the IF on BEPS, becoming the 101st jurisdiction to do so. By joining the IF, Barbados will work on creating an equal footing with all other IF members on the implementation of the BEPS package and on developing further standards to address the remaining BEPS issues. As a signatory to the IF, Barbados has committed to implementing minimum standards related to:
Further to the OECD's Harmful Tax Practices - 2018 Progress Report on Preferential Regimes, Barbados has abolished the following regimes effective 1 January 2019:
In addition, the shipping regime was determined to not be harmful, and all ring-fencing provisions were removed and no grandfathering was provided.
## Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (Multilateral Instrument or MLI)
On 24 January 2018, Barbados signed the OECD BEPS Multilateral Convention to update the existing network of bilateral treaties and reduce opportunities for tax avoidance by multinational enterprises. The ratification instrument was deposited on 21 December 2020, and it will enter into force on 1 April 2021.
## Tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs)
TIEAs provide for the exchange of information on tax matters. TIEAs with Denmark, the Faroe Islands, Greenland, South Africa, and the United States are in force. The TIEA with Colombia is awaiting ratification; and TIEAs with France and Germany have been initialled and are awaiting signature.
## Bilateral investment treaties (BITs)
Barbados has entered into BITs with Canada, China, Cuba, Germany, Italy, Mauritius, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Venezuela. BITs with Ghana and the Belgium/Luxembourg Economic Union (BLEU) await ratification.
BITs typically cover the following:

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
## Employment income
Income includes salary, bonuses, and commissions, plus the value of all other benefits, whether in money or otherwise, including quarters, board, or residence, received or enjoyed in that income year in respect of that office or employment. The provision of rent-free accommodation gives rise to a taxable benefit to the employee up to a maximum of BBD 48,000 per year.
There are special concessions for appropriately qualified foreign employees of corporations engaged in the international financial services sector, whereby up to 60% of their remuneration may be exempt from tax.
## Capital gains
Barbados does not impose capital gains tax.
## Investment income
Interest, dividends (except dividends received from companies resident in certain other Caribbean Common Market [CARICOM] countries), rents, royalties, professional fees, business profits, and annuities are all subject to tax, as is any type of investment income remitted to Barbados by individuals who are resident but not domiciled in Barbados. 50% of the amount received as royalties is exempt from tax.
### Dividend income
Withholding tax (WHT) of 15% is deductible from ordinary dividends paid to resident individuals by local companies if the dividends are paid out of profits derived by the company after 30 June 1992. This represents the individual’s full tax liability on such dividends.
No WHT is deductible from dividends paid to resident individuals if paid out of profits derived by a company prior to 1 July 1992. However, such dividends must be grossed up by 15% and are subject to tax at the individual’s marginal income tax rate. A 15% dividend tax credit may be claimed.
### Interest income
WHT of 15% is deductible from local interest over BBD 100 paid or credited to the account of resident persons. This represents the individual’s full tax liability on such interest. No tax is withheld from interest paid to pensioners of 60 years of age and over.
Interest received by or credited to a special savings account designated as an ‘Education Savings Plan Account’ is exempt from tax.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
An individual becomes resident by spending more than 182 days, in the aggregate, in Barbados in an income (calendar) year or by being ordinarily resident in Barbados in the relevant income year. An individual is considered to be ordinarily resident if they have permanent accommodation available for personal use in Barbados and give notice to the Revenue Commissioner of intent to reside in Barbados for a period of at least two consecutive income years. In calculating the number of days, the days of departure and arrival are included. Domicile is a question of intention, and long-term residence does not necessarily determine domicile.
