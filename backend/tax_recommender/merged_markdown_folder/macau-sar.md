# Macau SAR
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
Complementary tax is imposed on the worldwide income earned by Macau-registered entities, irrespective of where their residence or headquarters are situated and irrespective of the nature of the income. The exception to the foregoing is rental income from leasing of immovable properties located in Macau SAR, which is taxed separately under the property tax regime.
Generally, if a foreign entity is engaged in commercial/industrial activities and/or rendering services in Macau SAR, the resultant gain from such commercial/industrial activities and/or services rendered will be subject to complementary tax.
According to the Macau Complementary Tax Law, complementary tax is imposed on a progressive rate scale ranging from 3% to 9% for taxable profits below or equal to MOP 300,000 and 12% for taxable profits over MOP 300,000. Taxable profits below MOP 32,000 are exempt from tax.
According to the Budget for the financial year 2025 approved by the Legislative Assembly (2025 Budget), the tax-free income threshold for complementary tax has been increased from MOP 32,000 to MOP 600,000 for income derived in the tax year 2024 (taxable income in excess of MOP 600,000 is taxed at 12%). The changes in the tax-free income threshold and the tax brackets are subject to approval by the Legislative Assembly on an annual basis unless such amendments are written into the relevant tax laws.
## Types of taxpayers and associated tax bases
### Group A taxpayers
Taxpayer entities whose registered capital reached MOP 1 million, or whose average taxable profits reached MOP 1 million per year in three consecutive years, will automatically become Group A taxpayers in the tax year following the year in which the relevant notification is issued by the Macau Finance Bureau (MFB). A taxpayer entity that is considered the ultimate parent entity of a multinational enterprise (MNE) will also be classified as a Group A taxpayer. Any taxpayer entity not falling under the above criteria can also elect to become a Group A taxpayer by filing a Group A declaration form. Profits of Group A taxpayers are assessed based on the actual accounting income after making necessary tax adjustments.
### Group B taxpayers
Group B taxpayers refer to any individual or any other form of companies not mentioned above and those taxpayers that do not keep detailed accounting records. Profits of Group B taxpayers are assessed on a deemed basis if the reported income is below the internal parameters set by the MFB for taxpayers in similar industries.

# Macau SAR
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
There is no VAT regime in Macau SAR.
## Customs duties/import tariffs
Apart from consumption tax imposed on tobacco and spirits entering into Macau SAR, there are no customs duties/import tariffs in Macau SAR.
## Consumption tax (excise duty)
Consumption tax is imposed only on tobacco and spirits entering into Macau SAR.
There are two methods for determining the amount of consumption tax payable, by quantity or by value. The former method of assessment is based on the weight or volume of goods and the latter is based on the price of the goods imported into Macau SAR. The rate of consumption tax varies depending on the classification of the imported goods.
## Property tax
Property tax is imposed annually on the owner of buildings situated in Macau SAR. This is first payable after acquiring a property or upon the expiry of the property tax exemption period, if applicable. Different exemption periods are granted, depending on the location of the property. Additional exemption periods may apply in special cases.
For leased properties, property tax is charged at 10% on the actual rental income, and, by application, a deduction based on 10% of the rental income derived to cover repair and maintenance expenses incurred will be granted if approved by the MFB. According to the Budget for the financial year 2025 approved by the Legislative Assembly (2025 Budget), the property tax rate for leased properties has been reduced from 10% to 8% for the tax year 2025.
For self-use properties, property tax is charged at 6% on the official ratable value as established by the appointed committee of the MFB. A deduction of 10% of the official ratable value to cover repair and maintenance expenses will be automatically granted for self-use property.
According to the 2025 Budget, there is a standard MOP 3,500 reduction in the property tax liabilities assessed in the tax year 2025 for both self-used and rental properties. This incentive does not apply to corporate and non-Macau residents.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is payable on certain types of documents and stampable transactions at a small fixed amount or at rates ranging from 0.2% to 10% on the value represented by the documents and transactions.
### Stamp duty for rental and *de facto* rental contracts
Rental and *de facto* rental contracts for immovable property are subject to 0.5% stamp duty based on the total rental payment over the contract term, payable within 15 days.
### Stamp duty for transfer of immovable property
Stamp duty at progressive rates ranging from 1% to 3% is payable on transfer of immovable property with a surcharge of 5% on the duty payable, resulting in effective stamp duty rates of 1.05% to 3.15%. The irrevocable transfer of certain assets without consideration is subject to a 5% stamp duty.
## Professional (Salaries) Tax
Professional Tax is payable by anyone receiving income from employment services performed in Macau SAR or from a Macau employment. In Macau SAR, the Professional Tax reporting, withholding, and remittance obligations rest with the employer.
## Payroll taxes
There is a pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system, similar to those used in other countries, which is applicable to salaried individuals only. The employing entity is obligated to report and collect the amount of Professional Tax payable from its employees each month and remit such payments to the MFB before the 15th day of the month following the quarter-end for local resident employees and foreign employees with valid work visas.
## Social security fund contribution
Social security fund contribution in the total amount of MOP 90 per month is payable for resident employees. The employer contributes two-thirds of the amount (i.e. MOP 60) and the employee contributes one-third of the amount (i.e. MOP 30).
## Annual industrial tax
The annual industrial tax has been exempted for the tax year 2025 and has been exempted on an annual basis by the Macau government since 2002.
Under the Industrial Tax Code, all commercial or industrial operations carried out in Macau SAR are subject to industrial tax at the beginning of each year. The amount of the tax is dependent upon the nature of the business. The table below is an illustration of the tax amounts applicable to certain types of businesses in Macau SAR.
| Type of business | Tax (MOP) |
| --- | --- |
| Commercial banks | 80,000 |
| Construction companies | 500 |
| Hotels | 500 |
| Insurance companies | 500 |
| Textile companies | 500 |
## Special gaming tax
Special gaming tax is levied at 35% on the gross gaming revenue derived by gaming concessionaires authorised to carry on the operation of games of chance in Macau SAR under Law 7/2022.
## Tourism tax
Tourism tax is imposed at the rate of 5% on bills of services, excluding telecommunication and laundry services, and service charges of up to 10% rendered in Macau SAR by establishments such as hotels, guest houses, dancing halls, night clubs, massage/sauna parlours, gymnasiums, karaoke, and the like. Such tax is generally borne by consumers.
Restaurants are exempt from tourism tax in the tax year 2025 and have been exempt, via an exemption published on an annual basis by the Macau government, since 2002.
## Motor vehicle tax
Motor vehicle tax is imposed on the sale of new motor vehicles to consumers and the importation of new motor vehicles for self-use. Exemptions are available to certain persons and organisations and for certain specific usages. Generally, motor vehicle tax is levied based on the listed selling prices as registered with the MFB. The rate of motor vehicle tax varies depending on the type of motor vehicle and its value.
## Land rent
Land rent is payable by lessees of leasehold land in Macau SAR on an annual basis according to the amount specified in the relevant lease contract.
According to the 2025 Budget, land rent below MOP 100 shall not be collected by the MFB in the tax year 2025. However, any such amount already collected shall not be refunded.

# Macau SAR
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
## Taxable period
The Macau tax year is on a calendar-year basis.
## Tax returns
Assessments are made by the MFB upon review of the tax returns, which must be lodged before 31 March or 30 June of each year for Group B or Group A taxpayers, respectively.
## Payment of tax
A provisional tax payment calculated based on the declared taxable profit for a Group A taxpayer or final assessed profit for a Group B taxpayer is payable in two equal instalments, in September and November. However, if the amount is not greater than MOP 3,000, payment will be requested in one lump sum amount in September. For Group A taxpayers, a final tax assessment will be issued upon completion of the tax assessment by the MFB and additional tax payment, if any, will be due around a month’s time after issuance.
## Tax audit process
There is no specific tax audit cycle in Macau SAR. The MFB is empowered by the Macau Complementary Tax Law to carry out a tax audit whenever the information provided by a taxpayer in its tax return is considered unclear or insufficient, and subsequent replies to the MFB’s queries, if any, are considered inadequate.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations period is five assessment years from the relevant year of assessment for both Group A and Group B taxpayers.
The MFB generally focuses on the deductibility of expenses (e.g. staff costs, provisions, depreciation, management fees, payments made to overseas service providers, bad debts, donations).

# Macau SAR
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
The paragraphs below describe the tax acceptable treatments under the prevailing Complementary Tax Law and are for reference only.
## Inventory valuation
Inventory should be stated at actual cost, and conformity between book and tax reporting is required. Market selling price or replacement cost is allowed only in special circumstances, and prior approval of the Director of the MFB is required for adoption of such inventory valuation methods. The write-down of inventory values is not permitted.
## Capital gains
Gains or losses from the realisation of capital assets of a corporate taxpayer are treated as current revenue or expense items for complementary tax purposes.
## Dividend income
Dividends from all sources are subject to complementary tax in the hands of a recipient incorporated in Macau SAR unless the dividends were paid out of profits that have been taxed at the corporate level in Macau SAR. Where dividends to shareholders are paid out of profits of a Macau entity that have not been taxed in Macau SAR, complementary tax will technically be charged on the dividend distribution to the shareholders.
## Interest income
Interest income received by or accrued to a corporate taxpayer in Macau SAR is subject to complementary tax.
## Royalty income
Royalty income received by or accrued to a corporate taxpayer in Macau SAR is subject to complementary tax. There is currently no withholding tax (WHT) imposed on royalties paid or accrued to a non-resident provided that such non-resident has not carried on commercial/industrial activities in Macau SAR.
## Foreign income
Companies incorporated in Macau SAR are subject to complementary tax on worldwide income, wherever received or credited. There are no provisions in the Macau Complementary Tax Law that allow foreign income to be deferred for tax purposes. Currently, double taxation relief is available under the respective double taxation agreements (DTAs) that Macau SAR has with Cabo Verde, Cambodia, the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong SAR, Mozambique, Portugal, and Vietnam.

# Macau SAR
## Overview
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
Macau Special Administrative Region (SAR), located in Southeast Asia, is bordered by Mainland China to the north and west and by the South China Sea to the south and east. The official languages of Macau SAR are Chinese and Portuguese, and the currency is the Macanese pataca (MOP).
Macau became an SAR of the People's Republic of China on 20 December 1999. According to the Basic Law (Macau SAR's constitutional document), Macau SAR is guaranteed a high degree of autonomy in all matters except foreign and defence affairs for the next 50 years after the sovereignty transfer under the 'one country, two systems' policy. The Basic Law ensures that Macau SAR has a legal system that is separate from Mainland China, vesting Macau SAR with executive, legislative, and independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication.
Macau SAR pursues an open economic policy despite having a relatively small economy. Macau SAR is a free port and has no foreign exchange controls, and the procedures for approval of investments by foreigners are the same as for local residents. The Macanese pataca is closely linked to the Hong Kong dollar (HKD), which is also widely accepted in Macau SAR. Macau SAR became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on 1 January 1995. The Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement and its supplements entered into with Mainland China, amongst others, offer Macau-made products tariff-free access into Mainland China and provides a window of opportunity for Macau SAR businesses to gain greater access to the Mainland China market. Macau SAR has the lowest corporate and individual income tax rates among the Asia Pacific region, making it attractive as an investment location.
Over the past two decades, Macau SAR has witnessed surging economic development, mainly due to the liberalisation of its gaming industry in 2002. Macau SAR also made tremendous effort to position itself as a world-class tourist venue. In July 2005, the World Heritage Committee accredited the Historic Centre of Macau SAR as a United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Site. Gaming and tourism have led to a massive increase in visitors, especially from Mainland China. In recent years, Macau SAR actively participates in quality development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area.
Apart from consolidating and improving traditional industries, Macau SAR actively develops policies to foster major industries. In particular, the ’1+4’ appropriate diversification development strategy aims to enrich Macau SAR’s function as ’One Centre‘ for integrated tourism and leisure, while facilitating the development of four nascent industries, namely the ’Big Health‘ industry, modern financial services, high and new technology, and convention and exhibition, sports, and the commercial and trade industries.
We provide organisations with the professional service they need, wherever they may be located. Our highly qualified, experienced professionals listen to different points of view to help organisations solve their business issues and identify and maximise the opportunities they seek.

# Macau SAR
## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
## Tax incentives for the tax year 2025
The Legislative Assembly approved certain tax incentives proposed by the Chief Executive of Macau Special Administrative Region (SAR) in the Budget for the financial year 2025. The key tax incentives include the following:
## New Tax Code to be effective on 1 January 2026
On 16 December 2024, the Legislative Assembly of the Macau SAR passed the bill for approval of Código Tributário (Tax Code) (hereinafter referred to as the ’new bill‘) with the effective date on 1 January 2026. The new bill changes the Macau tax system from worldwide to territorial and introduces new international tax concepts, including, but not limited to, transfer pricing, tax residency, and permanent establishment, to promote the modernisation of Macau's tax system and make it more aligned with the latest international tax standards.

# Macau SAR
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
Corporate residence is generally determined by reference to the place of establishment.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
There is no specific definition of PE in the Macau Complementary Tax Law. Technically speaking, there are two major criteria for determining whether a foreign entity should be subject to complementary tax, and the key phrases are 'engaging in commercial/industrial activities' and/or 'rendering services in Macau SAR'. These phrases are also not defined. Generally, if a foreign entity is engaged in commercial/industrial activities and/or rendering services in Macau SAR, the resultant gain from such commercial/industrial activities and/or services rendered will be subject to complementary tax.

# Macau SAR
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
Please note that the assessor is empowered to disallow any business expenses (e.g. entertainment, travelling) where the amount incurred is considered to be excessive.
## Depreciation
An initial allowance of 20% is granted on buildings. The rates of tax depreciation are detailed in Decree-Law No.4/90/M, dated 5 March 1990. The Decree-Law prescribes the maximum annual tax depreciation rates and the number of years of asset life for different asset classes under the straight-line method. For illustration, the maximum depreciation rates and the maximum useful life currently applicable to the general types of assets are set out below:
| Assets | Maximum annual percentage rate (%) | Maximum number of years |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Industrial buildings | 4 | 50 |
| Office and residential buildings | 2 | 100 |
| Machinery and installations, air conditioning, elevators, equipment | 10 to 20 | 20 to 10 |
| Tools | 20 to 33.3 | 10 to 6 |
| Laboratory, telex and interior telephone equipment, furniture, filing systems, typewriters, and accounting machines | 16.66 to 25 | 12 to 8 |
| Computer hardware | 25 | 8 |
| Office installations | 14.29 | 14 |
| Trucks | 14.29 | 14 |
| Automobiles | 20 | 10 |
| Intangible assets, pre-operating expenses incurred prior to commencement of business | 33.33 | 6 |
| Deferred expenses arising in connection with increases in share capital, changes in form of business enterprises, issuance of debentures, marketing and other studies, and financial expenses incurred for the acquisition or own production of fixed assets prior to completion | 33.33 | 6 |
| Patents | 10 | 20 |
| Manufacturing licences, concessionary agreements, and similar rights | \* | \* |
| Trademark | \* | \* |
\* At the discretion of the authorities.
In the case of commercial and industrial buildings, depreciation is not allowed for the value attributable to the cost of the freehold land. Where the value of the freehold land cannot be determined from the total cost of land and buildings, a portion equal to 20% is deemed to be attributable to the land value for the purpose of determining the value of buildings to be depreciated.
Depreciation can be claimed either on a prorated basis in accordance with the prescribed annual rates for assets that are not acquired at the beginning of the financial year or on an annual basis.
The cost of repairs and maintenance exceeding 10% of the acquisition cost of the asset in a given year is deemed to be an expense of a capital nature and should be capitalised and depreciated over the remaining life of the asset.
## Goodwill
Cost of acquisition of goodwill/amortisation of goodwill is generally deductible to the extent it is incurred in the generation of assessable profits.
## Interest expenses
There is no thin capitalisation rule in Macau SAR. However, the MFB may assess the reasonableness of the interest rate charged for interest expense paid to related parties.
## Bad debts
The amount provided against doubtful trade receivables is an allowable tax deduction, but the provision cannot exceed 2% of the total receivables, except in the case of banks, where the minimum provisions required under the local banking regulations are fully tax-deductible.
Debts considered uncollectible may be written off only when adequate proof can be shown, usually by way of bankruptcy court proceedings.
## Charitable contributions
A deduction of up to 0.2% of the taxpayer's turnover is allowable for donations to charitable organisations recognised by the tax authority.
## Pension expenses
The employer's contribution to the staff provident fund legally registered in Macau SAR is fully tax-deductible, up to 15% of the employees' basic salary.
## Fine and penalties
Tax fines are not deductible.
## Taxes
Taxes, except for complementary tax and taxes paid on corporate profits, are generally deductible to the extent they are incurred in the generation of assessable profits.
## Other significant items
## Net operating losses
Agreed tax losses can be carried forward for three consecutive years for Group A taxpayers. Group B taxpayers are not allowed to carry their tax losses forward to future years. Tax losses cannot be carried back in Macau SAR.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
The regulations make no specific mention of royalties and service fees paid to foreign affiliates. The MFB generally monitors the deductibility of such payments. Payments to foreign service providers for consulting services or construction-related services are not deductible if such consulting contracts are not properly registered in Macau SAR.

# Macau SAR
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
There is no provision for group taxation in Macau SAR.
## Transfer pricing
A taxpayer that is considered the ultimate parent entity of an MNE would be classified as a Group A taxpayer and would be required to maintain proper books and records for tax filing purposes. An ultimate parent entity would be required to fulfil the Country-by-Country Reporting (CbCR) filing obligation if the total revenue in its consolidated financial statements for the past financial year exceeds a certain threshold (currently set at MOP 7 billion). The CbCR will be exchanged with other tax jurisdictions through automatic tax information exchange under the multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters.
## Thin capitalisation
There is no thin capitalisation provision in the Macau tax regime.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no CFC rules in the Macau tax regime.

# Macau SAR
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
## Foreign tax credit
There is no foreign tax credit provision in the Macau Complementary Tax Law. Foreign tax credit is only available under the relevant provisions of the comprehensive tax arrangements/agreements that Macau SAR has entered into with Cabo Verde, Cambodia, the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong SAR, Mozambique, Portugal, and Vietnam, respectively.
## Capital investment incentives
A 50% reduction in complementary tax and stamp duty on certain transactions, as well as exemptions from annual industrial tax (currently exempt for all taxpayers) and property tax (up to periods prescribed by the MFB), are allowable for taxpayers in the manufacturing industry (as defined in the Decree-Law) whose capital investment is aimed at the introduction of new products or high technology, improvement of productivity, and increase in exports of goods to new markets.
Where profits are retained in reserves and reinvested in installation of new equipment within the following three financial years, the reinvested reserves can be deducted from taxable profits, provided that the reinvested reserves are attributable to profits earned from normal business operations and the investment is considered to be beneficial for the economic development of Macau SAR.
## Incentives for owners of touristic facilities
Additional incentives, such as an extended property tax exemption period, exemption from annual industrial tax (currently exempt for all taxpayers), reduction in stamp duty, as well as acceleration of depreciation for complementary tax purposes, are available to owners of facilities that qualify as touristic facilities.
## Incentives for financial leasing companies
Approved financial leasing companies are exempt from stamp duty for registration of start-up/additional capital, interest and commission, and financial leasing contracts. Premise purchased for financial leasing operation is exempt from stamp duty, subject to a cap of MOP 500,000.
For complementary tax deduction purpose, tax deductible depreciation for financial leasing assets can be accelerated to three times for complementary tax purposes. The complementary tax rate is reduced from 12% to 5%. The tax allowable threshold for bad debt provision is increased from 2% to 10% on total receivables; bad debt provision exceeding 10% of total receivables is not allowed as tax deduction. Financial leasing income derived from jurisdictions outside of Macau SAR will be exempt from complementary tax provided that such income has been subject to tax at its place of origin.
## Incentives for science, technology, and innovation business
On 21 January 2021, the Legislative Assembly passed the bill of tax incentive scheme for science, technology, and innovation business following the Macau SAR’s policy focus on promoting technological innovation for transforming Macau SAR into a smart city. The bill became effective on 1 April 2021, and the benefits granted under the scheme include the following:

# Macau SAR
## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
## Choice of business entity
A foreign company conducting business (except for short-term projects) in Macau SAR is obligated to set up a legal establishment, which can be in the form of a company or a branch.
There are generally two types of Macau companies: companies limited by shares and companies limited by quotas. The capital and corporate governance requirements for a company limited by shares are higher than a company limited by quotas, and, in general, a company limited by quotas is used by investors that are not in regulated industries.
## Exchange of information
Law 1/2022 is the legislation that governs the exchange of information by Macau SAR with other tax jurisdictions within the scope of bilateral and multilateral tax treaties or arrangements.
The following tables summarise the tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs) and DTAs that Macau SAR has signed, and the TIEAs and DTAs that are in negotiation:
TIEAs have been signed by Macau SAR with the following countries:
| Argentina | Guernsey | Malta |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Australia | Iceland | Norway |
| Denmark | India | Sweden |
| Faroe Islands | Ireland | United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland |
| Finland | Jamaica |  |
| Greenland | Japan |  |
TIEAs are in negotiation with the following countries:
DTAs have been signed by Macau SAR with the following countries:
| Treaty partners | Effective date |
| --- | --- |
| Belgium | Not yet effective |
| Cabo Verde | 25 November 2012 |
| Cambodia | 15 March 2023 |
| The Mainland of China | 1 January 2004 |
| Hong Kong SAR | 1 January 2021 |
| Mozambique | 11 January 2011 |
| Portugal | 1 January 1999 |
| Vietnam | 3 October 2018 |
In addition, the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters has entered into force for Macau SAR since 1 September 2018, and the Macau government has signed the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information.
As the information of a Macau taxpayer is becoming more transparent under comprehensive DTAs, TIEAs, and multilateral agreements, it is important for Macau entities with cross-border transactions to perform periodic tax health checks to ensure that tax planning arrangements, if any, that have been put in place in the past, remain technically defensible.
## Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
On 14 December 2016, Macau SAR and the United States (US) signed an inter-governmental agreement (IGA) that will facilitate compliance with the US FATCA by financial institutions in Macau SAR. FATCA is an anti-tax evasion regime enacted by the United States to detect US taxpayers who use accounts with non-US financial institutions to conceal income and assets from the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The IGA signed between Macau SAR and the United States is Model 2, which requires financial institutions in Macau SAR to report the relevant account information of US taxpayers to the US IRS directly, supplemented by group requests made by the US IRS, on a need basis, for exchange of information on relevant US taxpayers at a government level. Under the IGA, financial institutions in Macau SAR need to register and conclude separate individual agreements with the US IRS. Under the agreements, these institutions shall seek the consent of their account holders who are US taxpayers for reporting their account information to the US IRS annually. The IGA covers exemptions for financial institutions or products that present low risks for tax evasion by US taxpayers.

Residence and/or domicile are irrelevant for Macau Professional Tax purposes.
A taxpayer who is a resident of a country with which Macau SAR has a bilateral tax agreement or tax arrangement will have to refer to the relevant article of such agreement/arrangement to determine one’s liability to professional tax. *See the [Foreign tax relief and tax treaties](foreign-tax-relief-and-tax-treaties.html) section for a list of countries with which Macau SAR has a bilateral tax agreement or tax arrangement*.
