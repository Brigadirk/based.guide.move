## Overview
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Bosnia and Herzegovina, a country located on the Balkan Peninsula in Southern Europe, is bordered by Croatia to the north and west, Serbia to the east, and Montenegro to the south. The official languages are Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian.
Bosnia and Herzegovina declared sovereignty in October 1991. The country is politically decentralised and comprised of two governing entities, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) and Republika Srpska (RS), with a third region, the Brčko District (BD), being administered by both. Its capital is Sarajevo. The konvertibilna marka (convertible mark or BAM), the national currency introduced in 1998, is pegged to the euro (EUR).
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, direct taxes are imposed on entities at the district level, while indirect tax regulations are imposed at the state level.
Bosnia and Herzegovina became a full member of the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) in September 2007. Bosnia and Herzegovina has also signed the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the European Union (EU), applicable as of 1 January 2009, which brought down the customs tariff for EU products in different time periods. Bosnia and Herzegovina formally applied for EU membership on 15 February 2016 and became a potential candidate country.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is considered an upper-middle-income economy by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

# Bosnia and Herzegovina
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Taxable profit is profit determined by adjusting the accounting profit as stated in the profit and loss statement and determined in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards/International Accounting Standards (IFRS/IAS) and accounting legislation, in accordance with the provisions of the CIT law.
## FBiH income
Taxable income in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the income determined in the financial statements, increased for tax non-deductible costs and other tax non-deductible items and decreased for non-taxable items in accordance with the CIT Law of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Income on the basis of collected written-off debt, in the event that it was included in income in a previous period and was not subject to tax allowable or recognised expenditure, shall not be included in the tax base.
### FBiH inventory valuation
Expenses of production in accordance with accounting regulations and IFRS/IAS shall be recognised in the value of stocks of unfinished production, semi products, and finished products for the calculation of taxable profit.
The inventory is valued by using the average price method.
### FBiH capital gains
Capital gains that increase the CIT base are all amounts that directly increase the accumulated or current profit in the balance sheet in accordance with IAS.
Capital gains that increase the CIT base are also considered to be gains from transactions of sales or transfers of assets if such profit is not included in the balance sheet. Such capital gains are determined as the difference between the value of the transaction and the purchase value, deducted for tax depreciation. If such difference is negative, it is considered as a capital loss.
For the purpose of determining the capital gains, the price of the transaction is the price stipulated in the contract, or the market price of the transaction if the stipulated price is lower than the market price.
Increase or decrease of taxpayer's equity performed in accordance with the Company Law is not considered as capital gain or loss.
### FBiH dividend income
Dividends realised based on participation in the capital of other taxpayers shall not be included in the tax base. Shares in the profit of a business association will be considered dividends.
### FBiH interest income
Interest income is generally included in the taxable base. The exception, as per FBiH government decision, is for interest income realised from state bonds issued for war claims, which should not be included in the taxable base (the CIT law does not explicitly allow for this, which may lead to discussion with the tax authority).
### FBiH royalty income
Royalty income in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is generally included in the taxable base.
### FBiH foreign income
The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina taxes resident corporations on a worldwide basis. There are no deferral or anti-deferral provisions in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
## RS income
Taxable revenue for the purpose of computing the tax base in Republika Srpska includes total revenue presented in the income statement, with the exemption of revenue that has different tax treatment under the CIT Law.
### RS inventory valuation
Inventory includes goods used for resale, final goods produced by the taxpayer, semi-final goods used for further production, as well as main and auxiliary materials for production.
Purchase value of inventories at the beginning and end of a fiscal year has to be expressed using the same method for determination of purchase value of inventories.
The costs of material and purchase value of sold goods can be determined by using the weighted average cost method or the first in first out (FIFO) method.
### RS capital gains
Capital gain is realised through the sale or other type of transfer of capital or investment assets and represents a difference between the sales price and adjusted base of an asset. The sales price is the contracted price (i.e. the market price established by the competent tax authority in case it finds the contracted price to be lower than the market price).
Capital gains or losses realised during the fiscal year can be offset, and the realised net gain or loss is added or subtracted from the taxable base, if they are not already included in the income or expense.
### RS dividend income
Income from dividends is not included in the taxable base.
### RS interest income
Interest income is generally included in the taxable base.
Income in the form of interest or its functional equivalent from securities issued by Republika Srpska or by local authority is excluded from the taxable base.
### RS royalty income
Royalty income in Republika Srpska is generally included in the taxable base.
### RS foreign income
Republika Srpska taxes resident corporations on a worldwide basis. There are no deferral or anti-deferral provisions in Republika Srpska.
## BD income
Taxable income in Brčko District includes all income from any source (domestic or foreign), whether in cash or in kind, independent of the relationship to the business activity of the legal person.
### BD inventory valuation
The purchase value of inventories can be determined by using the FIFO method or the average cost method.
### BD capital gains
Capital gain is realised by sale or transfer of capital and investment goods and represents the positive difference between the sales price and adjusted property base.
Capital gains or losses realised during the fiscal year can be offset, and the realised net gain or loss added or subtracted from the taxable base, if they are not already included in the income or expense.
### BD dividend income
Income from dividends is not included in the taxable base.
### BD interest income
Income from securities issued by or guaranteed by the state authority, Central Bank BiH, or local authority is excluded from the taxable base.
### BD royalty income
Royalty income in Brčko District is generally included in the taxable base.
### BD foreign income
Brčko District taxes resident corporations on a worldwide basis. There are no deferral or anti-deferral provisions in Brčko District.

# Bosnia and Herzegovina
## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
The newest changes to the corporate income tax (CIT) regulations in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) relate to tax treatment of depreciation expense of the assets with the right to use in accordance with IFRS 16. The changes introduced full tax deductibility of such depreciation expenses calculated under the accounting depreciation rates. In other words, the depreciation expense is tax deductible for the period from commencement of a lease until the end of the useful life of the lease.

Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## FBiH deductions
Tax deductible expenditures are all documented expenditures, decreased for the deductible VAT, that a taxpayer incurred for the purpose of generation of profit, provided they are properly presented in the financial statements.
### FBiH depreciation
Depreciation cost is deductible only if it relates to the property subject to depreciation and being used.
Depreciation of fixed assets is deductible up to the amount established by proportionate application of the highest annual depreciation rates using the linear method, prescribed by the FBiH government, as follows:

| Intangible non-current assets | 20 |
Property being depreciated with a value of less than BAM 1,000 may be fully deducted in the purchase year, on condition that that the property was put in use.
Depreciated assets, once depreciated, shall not be re-included in the depreciation calculation for the purposes of the tax balance.
Expenditure arisen from devaluation of fixed assets, which are determined as the difference between current net value and the estimated retrievable value, is tax deductible in the tax period when the assets are sold or destroyed by *force majeure*.
### FBiH goodwill
Amortisation of goodwill is not tax deductible.
### FBiH start-up expenses
Start-up expenses are tax deductible if the expenses occurred, were necessary and related to the registered company, and if original documentation with regard to those expenses are available for inspection.
### FBiH interest expenses
Interest expense is generally tax deductible, except for interest from a related-party loan, which can be tax non-deductible if it does not meet the criteria set by the thin capitalisation rule (*see Thin capitalisation in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*).
### FBiH bad debt
The expenses occurring based on the write-off of doubtful debts are tax deductible. Debts are considered doubtful under the following conditions:

Depreciation deductions are allowed only with respect to depreciable assets that are owned by a taxpayer or acquired through a financial lease that are being used for performance of registered business activities.
Depreciation deduction is also allowed for investments made in fixed assets not owned by a taxpayer, under the condition that such investments increase purchase value of the asset and do not decrease rent from the lease agreement.
A depreciable asset is any tangible or intangible asset (except goodwill) with useful economic life longer than 12 months. Land or any other asset that does not decrease in value through wear and tear or obsolescence is not considered a depreciable asset.
Assets are depreciated using the proportional method of depreciation by applying the annual depreciation rates in the following amounts:

Interest expense is not tax deductible for the amount in which net interest expense exceeds 30% of the tax base, in which are not included interest income and expense. Net interest expense represents a positive difference between interest costs and interest revenue.

In the case of a bank or other authorised credit institution, a deduction is allowed for indirect write-off of placement presented in the income statement of a tax period, maximum to the amount prescribed by the Banking Agency of Republika Srpska, with exception for placements that have the most quality characteristics under those regulations.

A depreciable asset is any tangible or intangible asset that is held for use in the production or supply of goods and services, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes. Land or any other asset that does not decrease in value through wear and tear or obsolescence is not considered a depreciable asset.
Assets are depreciated using the linear method of depreciation, except for machines and equipment, which can be depreciated with acceleration (first year at 40%, second year at 30%, and third year at 30%). The CIT Rulebook prescribes a wide range of accepted depreciation rates, depending on type of assets.

For this purpose, a credit or trade receivable is considered a bad debt only if one of the following is true:
In the case of a bank or other authorised credit institution, a deduction is allowed for increases in the reserve account for customary losses due to unpaid loans, and the amount may not exceed 20% of the tax base.
In the case of an insurance or reinsurance company, a deduction is allowed for increases in reserves as registered in accounting documents and as authorised according to applicable law.

# Bosnia and Herzegovina
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## FBiH group taxation
A business association has the right to request tax consolidation on the condition that all businesses in the group are residents of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
A headquarters company and its branches may form a business association when there is direct or indirect control between them with no less than 50% share.
A request for tax consolidation must be filed to the authorised branch office of the tax authorities by a headquarters company.
Each group member is required to file its tax balance, and the headquarters of the business association may file a consolidated tax balance for the group.
The consolidated tax balance may offset losses of one or more businesses against the profit of other businesses in the association.
Individual group members are liable for the tax calculated on the consolidated balance proportionately to the profit from the individual tax balance, and the headquarters is the payer of the tax calculated on the consolidated balance.
Once approved, tax consolidation shall be applied for the consecutive period of no less than five years.
When one, several, or all the businesses in the association later opt for individual taxation, all group members shall be obligated to pay the difference proportionately on behalf of the tax privilege they have used.
## RS group taxation
The CIT Law of Republika Srpska does not envisage a possibility of group taxation in Republika Srpska.
## BD group taxation
An affiliated group of legal persons located within Brčko District may elect to file a consolidated annual tax declaration.
An affiliated group of legal persons is a group of one or more legal entities from Brčko District that are connected through the ownership of stock with a common parent, provided that the common parent owns at least 80% of the stock in a legal person that is included in the affiliated group.
## Transfer pricing
Transfer pricing requirements are imposed at the entity level. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republika Srpska, and Brčko District have different regulations in place, including different rules in regard to applicable methods, related parties, and documentation. The regulations in place do not differ if the transactions are within one entity, cross-border, or international. Basically, this means that all transactions can fall under the transfer pricing scope.
With Bosnia and Herzegovina not being an EU or an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member, the local legislation does not have the same requirements with respect to transfer pricing documentation as in EU countries nor does the legislation refer to the OECD guidelines.
### FBiH related parties
In the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a related party is considered to be an individual or legal person who has the possibility of control or significant influence on the business decisions of the taxpayer. Owning more than 25% of stocks or shares in a company is considered to be enabled control.
Significant influence is considered to be mutually high sales turnover, technical dependence, or otherwise gained control over the management.
### FBiH prescribed methods
The FBiH CIT law recognises the following methods:
Alternatively, in case these methods cannot be applied, the following methods can be used:
In case that none of the above-mentioned methods can be applied, any other method that can reasonably be applied for determination of the arm’s-length principle is allowed.
### FBiH country-by-country (CbC) reporting regime
The parent company is required to submit Form CBC-901 if the company is a resident of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and generates gross consolidated income of a minimum of BAM 1.5 billion.
### RS related parties
Under the CIT Law of Republika Srpska, a related party is a person or legal entity that directly or indirectly participates in management, control, or capital of another legal entity. Also, two legal entities are considered to be related if the same person(s) directly or indirectly participates in management, control, or capital of both legal entities.
It is considered that a person directly or indirectly participates in management, control, or capital of a legal entity when it directly or indirectly owns at least 25% of the shares in that legal entity or when it has a factual possibility to control business decisions of that other legal entity.
A person is considered to have a factual possibility of control on business decisions of another legal entity when one:
### RS CbC reporting regime
The transfer pricing documentation must provide an overview of the distribution of income, taxes, and business activities and a list of all units of the group by area of tax jurisdiction, the CbC form, if the income of the group to which the taxpayer belongs is more than 750 million euros (EUR).
### BD related parties
Under the CIT Law of Brčko District, related parties of a legal person are considered to be physical or legal persons if those persons possess more than 10% of active shares with voting rights.
A legal person can be a related party if it directly or indirectly possesses more than 10% active shares in the other person. Indirect ownership is considered to be:
### BD CbC reporting regime
The Brčko District has not enacted a CbC reporting regime.
### RS and BD prescribed methods
The RS and BD regulations prescribe the following five methods that can be used in order to establish whether the prices are in accordance with the arm’s-length principle:
## FBiH thin capitalisation
Under the thin capitalisation rule of the CIT Law of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in order to be entitled to deduct interest expenses on loans received from a related party, a company's ratio between total liabilities from related-party loans and the company's registered equity should not exceed 4:1. Interest expense related to the liabilities from related-party loans exceeding the ratio 4:1 shall be non-deductible for CIT purposes.
The CIT Law prescribes that this rule does not apply to banks and insurance companies.
## RS thin capitalisation
There are no thin capitalisation rules in Republika Srpska.
## BD thin capitalisation
There are no thin capitalisation rules in Brčko District.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Bosnia and Herzegovina has no rules on CFCs.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Representative offices of foreign companies can be registered in all three administrative units.
A branch of a foreign legal entity can be registered in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Republika Srpska. The tax treatment of the branch of a foreign legal entity is still quite unclear from the local perspective, so we recommend contacting a tax and accounting specialist.
BD regulations do not allow registration of branch of a foreign legal entity.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## FBiH tax incentives
### FBiH foreign tax credit
When a taxpayer generates income or profit through business activities outside of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (directly or through a business unit) and pays the profit tax on such activities, the tax paid abroad shall be credited, up to the amount of the profit tax that would have been paid for the income or profit generated by the same activities in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
### FBiH investment incentive
Taxpayers who invested their own resources in production equipment worth more than 50% of realised profit in the tax period shall be relieved from 30% of taxation for the year of the investment.
### FBiH employment incentive
A taxpayer who employed new employees is entitled to a tax-deductible expense in the double amount of gross salary paid to newly employed employees if the following conditions are met:
## RS tax incentives
### RS foreign tax credit
If a legal entity resident of Republika Srpska generates revenue in a foreign state and that revenue is taxable both in Republika Srpska and in the foreign state, then the tax paid in the foreign state will be deducted from the tax liability of the resident in Republika Srpska.
### RS incentive for investment in production
Tax base can be decreased in the tax period in which the plant and equipment were put in use.
If the taxpayer disposes the property and equipment before expiry of three years from the date when they were put in use, the taxpayer losses right to incentive and will have to pay the additional tax as if they never used the incentive, as well as penalty interest for late payments.
## BD tax incentives
### BD foreign tax credit
If a legal entity from Brčko District obtains revenue from a foreign state and the revenue is taxed both in Brčko District and in the foreign state, then the tax paid to the foreign state, whether paid directly or withheld and remitted by another person, is to be credited from the BD CIT, unless such legal entity from Brčko District elects to treat the foreign tax as a deductible expenditure in determining the fiscal year tax base.
### BD investment incentive
### BD employment incentive
For a taxpayer who employs new employees for an indefinite period of time during the tax period, a second deduction is allowed for the total amount of paid gross salaries for the new employees.
