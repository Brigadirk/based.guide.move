# Lithuania
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
## Taxable period
The Lithuanian tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December. However, a corporation may apply to adopt a substitute year of reporting (e.g. 1 July to 30 June).
## Tax returns
According to Lithuanian legislation, all the tax returns (except annual PIT returns for a Lithuanian resident) are submitted electronically, excluding cases when it is not possible to submit tax returns by electronic means due to objective reasons or the submission of a return by electronic means would cause disproportionate administrative burden.
### CIT
CIT returns must be submitted by the 15th day of the sixth month of the following tax period (15 June for companies using the calendar year).
Advance CIT returns due based on activity results for the previous year should be calculated and declared as follows:
The taxpayer may choose to pay the advance amount based on the projected amount of CIT calculated for the current year. The advance amount of CIT calculated on the basis of the projected amount of CIT for the tax period shall account for not less than 80% of the actual amount of the annual CIT; otherwise, late payment interest shall be calculated in respect of each amount of advance CIT that was not paid for the quarter.
If the taxpayer had chosen to pay the advance amount based on the projected amount of CIT for the current year, the return must have been submitted by the 15th day of the third month of the tax period (15 March for companies using the calendar year).
### WHT
A tax-withholding entity must submit to the tax authorities a special form of a return reporting the amounts of payments paid and taxes withheld during the calendar month no later than 15 days after the end of the month in which the amounts were paid. When a Lithuanian entity pays dividends to the foreign entity and these dividends are not taxed, these paid amounts are declared in the annual CIT return.
## Payment of tax
### CIT
The final payment deadline for CIT is aligned with the annual CIT return submission deadline, i.e. the 15th day of the sixth month of the following tax period.
The advance CIT must be paid no later than the 15th day of the last month of the respective quarter.
If the amount of tax indicated in the annual CIT return exceeds the amount actually paid during the tax period (i.e. the advance CIT), the taxpayer is obligated to transfer the additional amount no later than the annual CIT return submission deadline (i.e. by the 15th day of the sixth month of the following tax period). Overpaid tax can be offset with other tax dues or refunded in accordance with the law on tax administration.
### WHT
WHT on payments to foreign companies is to be calculated, withheld, and remitted by a Lithuanian company or a PE of a foreign company in Lithuania within 15 calendar days after the end of the month when the payment was made (i.e. no later than the return submission deadline).
## Tax audit process
The Lithuanian tax system for companies is based on self-assessment; however, the tax authorities undertake ongoing compliance activity to ensure corporations are meeting their tax obligations. The tax authorities take a risk-based and materiality approach to compliance and audit activities, with efforts generally focused on taxpayers with a higher likelihood of non-compliance and/or material consequences of non-compliance. Compliance activities take various forms, including general risk reviews, questionnaires, reviews of specific issues, and tax audits.
## Files and data reported to the tax authorities
### Accounting data reporting: Standard Audit File for Taxes (SAF-T)
Full accounting data reporting in xml format (SAF-T) was implemented in Lithuania as of 1 January 2017.
Entities are obligated to be ready to submit accounting data upon request of the tax authorities as follows:
An entity has to be ready to submit the file for periods starting from 1 January 2020 (and subsequent periods) when its net sales revenue for the financial year preceding the previous year exceeds EUR 300,000.
After the obligation to submit the file has arisen (according to the criteria described above), the obligation remains if the net sales revenue of the entity for the financial year for which the file is required exceeds EUR 300,000.
The requirement to be ready to submit the file does not apply to certain entities (e.g. foreign entities registered for VAT purposes in Lithuania, branches, representative offices, PEs).
### Invoice data reporting (i.SAF)
All VAT-registered taxable persons are required to report monthly data on invoices issued and received to the tax authorities' i.SAF subsystem.
### Transport data reporting (i.VAZ)
### DAC6 implementation
The EU Directive on the mandatory disclosure and exchange of reportable cross-border tax arrangements (referred to as DAC6 or the Directive) has been introduced into Lithuanian law. Under DAC6, taxpayers and intermediaries are required to report cross-border reportable arrangements from 1 January 2021.
Cross-border reportable arrangement is an arrangement that meets at least one or more hallmarks, the presence of which indicates a potential risk of tax evasion. It includes all taxes, except VAT, customs duty, excise duty and mandatory social security contributions.
Interested taxpayers must provide information on the reportable cross-border agreement for each year, when they use or have used it, after the end of the calendar year, until June 15 of the following calendar year, by filling out the special form (PRC914).
## Statute of limitations
As of 1 January 2020, the tax authorities may investigate the current and three previous tax periods. However, in some cases, a longer period may be applied.
The statute of limitations of the current tax period and five previous tax periods will be applied:
The limit of ten previous tax periods will be applied when an entity applies VAT deduction on immovable property, when the mutual agreement procedure (MAP) is being carried out, or when damage to the state in a penal case has to be calculated.
## Minimum criteria for reliable taxpayers
As of 1 January 2019, new minimum criteria for reliable taxpayers have been introduced. A taxpayer meets minimum criteria for reliable taxpayers if:
The Lithuanian tax authorities are focusing on the following areas of corporate taxpayers’ compliance:

## Social security contributions
The following income is subject to social security and health insurance contributions (only the main types of income are commented):
Individuals are also able to choose to additionally contribute for pension to the second-tier pension fund. Not contributing individuals under 40 years old as at 1 January of the respective year who are included in the register of insured individuals on 2 January of the same year are automatically involved in the participation in such pension accumulation system (such involvement will be performed every three years); however, they are allowed to choose whether to participate or not. Individuals over 40 years old are able to choose such a participation voluntarily.
Individuals who did not historically participate in this pension accumulation system are able to start contributing 3% in 2024. The state respectively adds the contribution of 1.5% on the state average remuneration amount.
There is also an option to pay higher contributions (above 3%) either by individuals themselves or their employers. Such expenses are PIT deductible for individuals and corporate income tax (CIT) deductible for employers.
Social security returns should be submitted by employers on a monthly basis by the 15th day of the following month, and the contributions should be paid on a monthly basis by the 15th day of the following month. The social security returns must be submitted electronically.
### International social security
The Lithuanian legislation on social security has been harmonised with the European Union (EU) regulations. Foreign employees seconded to Lithuania from a European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland and their employers are not required to pay social security contributions in Lithuania if an A1 certificate is obtained.
Employees temporarily seconded to Lithuania from third countries, with which Lithuania has no reciprocal social security agreements, are not required to pay the Lithuanian social security contributions as well, unless their permanent place of employment becomes Lithuania or the secondment exceeds one year.

Goods and services that are exempt without credit include, but are not limited to, the following:
Sale and contribution in kind of a business or part of a business is treated as being out of scope of VAT (under certain conditions).
## Customs duties
EU customs law is applicable in full.
EU customs law, also known as the Union Customs Code, compiles the rules, arrangements, and procedures applicable to goods traded between the European Union and non-member countries. The Union Customs Code indicates an obligation on a person to pay the amount of the import or export duties that apply to specific goods under the EU provisions in force. The application of the EU customs law means that:
## Excise taxes
Excise duty is imposed on the following goods produced in or imported (brought to from other EU countries) into Lithuania: ethyl alcohol and alcoholic beverages, including beer and wine; processed tobacco, including cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, and smoking tobacco; raw tobacco; heating tobacco products; electronic cigarettes liquid; energy-related products, including petrol, gasoline, certain oils and their substitutes or additives; coal, coke, lignite and peat intended for heating; natural gas; electricity. The tax rate and exemptions depend on the type of goods.
Significant changes to excise duty rates will come into force on 1 January 2025. More information on the changes can be found [here](https://www.vmi.lt/evmi/akcizu-pakeitimai-nuo-2025-m.).
## Land tax
Lithuanian and foreign entities are subject to land tax collected by the municipalities for the land they own in Lithuania. Roads for general use and forestland are exempt (other tax benefits are indicated in the special tax law). The assessment and payment terms are set forth by the municipalities, which are also entitled to grant land tax incentives.
The annual land tax rate ranges from 0.01% to 4% of the land tax value, depending on local municipalities. Please see the table below describing the main features of the land tax:
| Tax rate | 0.01% to 4%, defined by municipality. |
| --- | --- |
| Taxable value | The average market value calculated according to the land value zone maps prepared during the mass land valuation and the models for determining the average market value of the land plot. |
| The mass valuation is performed not rarer than every five years. |
| A possibility to apply the value determined during the individual valuation if it differs from the market value by more than 20% (principles are similar to RET). |
| Tax period | Calendar year. |
| Declaration | Template of a tax return is completed and sent by the tax authority until 1 November. |
| Payments | Annual payment due 15 November. |
## Land lease tax
State-owned land that is leased for Lithuanian and foreign entities is subject to land lease tax at a rate established by the municipalities. The minimum tax rate set by the government is 0.1%, and the maximum rate is 4% of the value of the land. Municipalities have an opportunity to apply tax incentives.
## Real estate tax (RET)
The tax is paid by the owners of real estate (i.e. individuals and legal entities of Lithuania and foreign countries (with some exemptions). In case individuals (residents) transfer the real estate owned by them to legal entities to use for an indefinite period or for a period longer than one month, then the RET on such property must be declared and paid by the legal entities.
The RET rate ranges from 0.5% to 3% of the real estate tax value. Municipal councils establish a specific tax rate for real estate situated in their territories annually. The RET exemptions are provided for in the tax law, however, municipalities also have an opportunity to apply tax incentives. Please see the table below describing the main features of the land tax:
| Tax rate | 0.5% to 3%, defined by municipality. |
| --- | --- |
| Taxable value | The average market value of the property: depending on the type and purpose of the property it can be assessed either by mass valuation method or using the replacement value (costs) method. |
| The mass valuation is performed not rarer than every five years. |
| A possibility to apply the value determined during the individual valuation if it differs from the market value by more than 20% (principles are similar to land tax). |
| Tax period | Calendar year. |
| Declaration | Tax return must be submitted by the 15th day of the second month of the following tax period (15 February). |
| Payments | Annual payment due 15 February of the following tax period. Legal entities are also obliged to pay advance taxes during the year (¼ of the annual tax amount, three times a year). |
## State duties (stamp taxes)
There are no stamp duties applied in Lithuania; however, minor fees for the services of state institutions, such as the issuance of documents having legal force and other deeds, may apply (e.g. notary fees apply on share purchase agreements [SPAs] meeting certain criteria).
## Payroll taxes
Employers should withhold PIT at the rate of 20% from the employee’s salary. In case employment related income exceeds a certain threshold (EUR 114,162 for 2024) per calendar year, the employee is required to pay the higher 32% PIT rate on the part exceeding such threshold while filing the annual PIT return (i.e. to additionally transfer 12% on such income part after the calendar year ends).
There are no additional payroll taxes applicable to an employer other than the employee’s and employer's SSC and the employer’s contributions to the Guarantee Fund and to the Long-term Employment Fund (*see below*).
## Social security contributions (SSC)
SSC is composed of employee’s and employer’s parts (both payments are administered by employer). Rates are higher for annual income up to a certain threshold (EUR 114,162 for 2024).
Employee’s income up to this threshold is subject to the standard rate of SSC for employers in the range from 1.45% to 2.17% and from 12.52% to 19.5% (from 15.52% to 22.5% with pension accruals) for employees. Income above this threshold is subject to lower employee’s SSC of 6.98%, and the employer's SSC part is not capped.
Also, SSC (employee’s and employer’s parts) must be paid by the employer on the official minimum monthly salary amount in force regardless of the fact that an employee receives lower salary (not applicable when an individual is employed in another company, receives an old age pension benefit, is not older than 24 years, has limited capacity to work, or receives maternity/paternity or childcare benefit, etc.).
## Contributions to the Guarantee Fund and Long-term Employment Fund
Employers also pay an additional contribution to the Long-term Employment Fund amounting to 0.16% on employee remuneration in order to entitle the individuals to receive payment from this fund if their employment agreement is terminated upon employer’s initiative without employee’s fault (special conditions apply).
## Environmental tax
Environmental tax is imposed on pollutants discharged into the environment, dumped waste, a few specified products (e.g. tyres, batteries), and certain types of packaging.
According to the Law on Tax on Environmental Pollution:
The tax for environmental pollution from mobile pollution sources is paid by natural persons, legal entities, other organisations, and their divisions, which use mobile pollution sources for commercial activities in order to receive and/or earn income or other economic benefits.
## Tax on natural resources
A tax on natural resources is payable on the amount of extracted natural (mineral, water, soil) resources. The object of the tax also includes hunting animals, taxed according to categories of hunting areas. According to the Law on Taxes on Natural Resources, the taxpayers are legal and natural persons extracting Lithuanian natural resources, for which a permit is required, and natural and legal persons who have permission to use hunting animal resources in a unit of hunting areas in accordance with the Law on Hunting of the Republic of Lithuania.
## Tax on extraction of hydrocarbon resources
## Tax on lotteries and gambling
Taxpayers are legal entities that organise lotteries according to the Law on Lotteries and organise gambling according to the Law on Gambling.
The tax base for lotteries and gambling is as follows:
These tax rates for lotteries and gambling are applied to the tax base (specified above) as follows:
Also, legal entities seeking to obtain a licence to organise gambling are charged with a one-time fee (varying from EUR 100,000 to EUR 1 million, depending on the type of licence) from 1 July 2022. The one-time fee for issuing a license to organise gambling is paid before the licence is issued.
The tax period is a quarter of the calendar year. The tax is calculated and paid after the end of each tax period until the 15th day of the first month of the next tax period.

# Lithuania
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year in Lithuania is a calendar year.
## Tax returns
Under the tax payment procedure, an individual’s income (including income that is non-taxable) is divided into two classes, Class A (where the tax is calculated and withheld by the person making the payment, e.g. the employer) and Class B (where tax is paid personally by an individual filing a personal tax return).
Class A income includes the following income received from a Lithuanian entity, a foreign entity through its permanent establishment (PE), or a non-resident of Lithuania through one’s permanent base:
Class A income also includes the following income received from a resident of Lithuania:
Class B income includes the following income:
Monthly returns of income tax withheld from Class A income (including Class B income, on which PIT was incorrectly withheld/paid) must be filed by employers on or before the 15th day of the next month. The summarised annual report on income tax withheld from Class A income must be submitted on or before the 15th day of the second month of the following tax period (i.e. 15 February).
A Lithuanian entity, a foreign entity through its PE, or a non-resident of Lithuania through their permanent base that has paid out Class B income must submit the annual statement on Class B income paid out on or before 15 February of the next calendar year.
At the close of the tax period, a resident of Lithuania who, during the tax period, derived income that, subject to the tax payment procedure, is attributable to both Class A and Class B income is obligated to submit an annual income tax return to the tax administrator on or before 1 May of the following year and declare therein total income derived during the previous tax period and the amount of income tax computed thereon.
Individuals who do not wish to take advantage of the allowable deductions or who received only Class A income (when income tax is correctly withheld and paid to the state budget by the companies paying this income to the individuals) and whose tax exempt amount does not have to be recalculated, as well as if the higher PIT rate should not apply, may choose not to file an annual income return.
When an individual becomes a Lithuanian tax resident due to more than 280 days spent in Lithuania in two successive tax periods, the tax return and tax payment for the first period are due by 31 December of the second year.
Lithuanian tax non-residents are obligated to file tax returns on a monthly basis and pay PIT within 25 days from the receipt of income derived under employment contracts from foreign entities not having their PEs in Lithuania and non-residents of Lithuania not having their fixed bases. Individuals have an obligation to file the annual non-resident’s tax return if the higher PIT rate should be applied to the Lithuanian-source income amounts exceeding the established thresholds. Such annual tax return submission deadline is 1 May of the following year.
## Payment of tax
Income tax withheld by employers must be paid to the state budget on or before the 15th day of the respective month (if a portion of income has been paid out on or before the 15th day of that month) or on or before the last day of the respective month (if the last portion of income has been paid on or before the last day of that month).
Lithuanian tax residents filing their annual income tax returns have to pay the related PIT on or before 1 May.
Lithuanian tax non-residents who file tax returns on a monthly basis have to pay PIT within 25 days from the receipt of income that is reported. In case an individual should pay the additional PIT amount due to the fact that income amounts exceed the established thresholds, PIT should be paid by 1 May of the following year.
## Tax audit process
Generally, the Lithuanian tax system for individuals is based on self-assessment; however, the tax authorities can undertake special activities to ensure that individual taxpayers meet their tax obligations. Such activities can be of various forms, including general reviews of submitted individual tax returns, sending reminders for income reporting/tax payment due to income related information received from third parties (e.g. companies that made payments to individual taxpayers, foreign tax administrators), questionnaires for specific areas (e.g. for self-employed individuals), initiating the reviews of specific issues, and tax audits.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations in Lithuania is the current and five previous tax periods for PIT (except for individuals performing registered individual activities, to whom a three-year open period applies) and the current and three previous tax years for social security contributions. However, the statute of limitations may be extended if a criminal case has been initiated against the taxpayer and it requires determining the damage caused to the state.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
Worldwide income received by a Lithuanian tax resident is subject to PIT. However, only the following income sourced in Lithuania by a non-resident is subject to PIT:
## Personal income tax rates
PIT at a 20% rate is applied to income amounts not exceeding EUR 126,532 per calendar year in 2025 and at a 32% rate for the exceeding part for:
Income from profit distribution (e.g. dividends) is taxable at a flat PIT rate of 15%.
Individual activity income is taxed depending on the amount of income received. PIT calculated at the 15% flat rate on taxable income is reduced by applying a PIT credit, calculated according to special formulas (effective rate may vary from 5% to 15%). *Please see Business income in the [Income determination](lithuania/individual/income-determination.html) section for more information*.
Other income not specified above is taxed at a PIT rate of 15% if income amounts do not exceed EUR 253,065 per calendar year. A 20% PIT rate is applicable to income exceeding this threshold.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
The standard CIT rate is 15% (16% from 1 January 2025). However, small companies and agricultural companies can apply a reduced CIT rate of 0% or 5% (0% or 6% from 1 January 2025) if certain conditions are met.
An amendment to the Law on CIT entered into force on 1 July 2022, which ensured that an increased CIT rate of 20% (15% and additional 5%; 21% (16% and additional 5%) from 1 January 2025) is applied on taxable profits of credit institutions exceeding the threshold of EUR 2 million for an indefinite period (previously, it was applicable only for a limited time period, starting from 1 January 2020 and ending with 2022). Special rules for calculation of taxable profit apply.
Generally, CIT is applied on taxable income received by a Lithuanian tax resident from its local and worldwide activities. Taxable income is calculated by reducing general income of a certain tax period with deductible expenses and non-taxable income, also increasing it with amounts of additional taxable income, and adjusting it according to tax reliefs and other tax attributes.
The deductible expenses should include all the usual costs that an entity incurs for the purpose of earning taxable income or receiving economic benefit.​
Income of a tax resident company is not subject to taxation in Lithuania if it was received from activities through a PE in a foreign country that is in the European Economic Area or that has a double tax treaty (DTT) with Lithuania and if the income was subject to taxation there.
Furthermore, CIT may be reduced or even not applied if foreign-sourced income received not through a PE is taxed with a withholding tax (WHT) in a foreign country and this country has a DTT with Lithuania.
Non-resident companies are generally taxed on Lithuania-sourced income received through a local PE and reduced by deductible expenses or on income subject to WHT in Lithuania.
## Reduced CIT rate for small companies
Entities with fewer than ten employees and less than EUR 300,000 in gross annual revenues can benefit from a reduced CIT rate of 0% for the first year of operations and 5% (6% from 1 January 2025) for the following periods if certain conditions are met.
## CIT regime for certain maritime activities
The rate of CIT on certain maritime activities is 15% (16% from 1 January 2025), with the base set by reference to the functional capacity of the ship. This fixed CIT may be applied to maritime entities that fulfil certain conditions indicated in the law. In order to apply this regime, it is necessary to inform the local tax authority.
## Local income taxes
There is no local or municipal CIT in Lithuania.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
## Social security contributions
The following income is subject to social security and health insurance contributions (only the main types of income are commented):
Individuals are also able to choose to additionally contribute for pension to the second-tier pension fund. Not contributing individuals under 40 years old as at 1 January of the respective year who are included in the register of insured individuals on 2 January of the same year are automatically involved in the participation in such pension accumulation system (such involvement will be performed every three years); however, they are allowed to choose whether to participate or not. Individuals over 40 years old are able to choose such a participation voluntarily.
Individuals who did not historically participate in this pension accumulation system are able to start contributing 3% in 2024. The state respectively adds the contribution of 1.5% on the state average remuneration amount.
There is also an option to pay higher contributions (above 3%) either by individuals themselves or their employers. Such expenses are PIT deductible for individuals and corporate income tax (CIT) deductible for employers.
Social security returns should be submitted by employers on a monthly basis by the 15th day of the following month, and the contributions should be paid on a monthly basis by the 15th day of the following month. The social security returns must be submitted electronically.
### International social security
The Lithuanian legislation on social security has been harmonised with the European Union (EU) regulations. Foreign employees seconded to Lithuania from a European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland and their employers are not required to pay social security contributions in Lithuania if an A1 certificate is obtained.
Employees temporarily seconded to Lithuania from third countries, with which Lithuania has no reciprocal social security agreements, are not required to pay the Lithuanian social security contributions as well, unless their permanent place of employment becomes Lithuania or the secondment exceeds one year.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate is 21%.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Lithuania.
## Inheritance tax
Property for inheritance tax purposes is defined as real estate and movable property as well as securities and cash. Foreigners pay this tax in the same manner as citizens of Lithuania, however, only inherited real estate and movable property subject to registration in Lithuania is subject to taxation.
Inheritance tax is not imposed if:
Otherwise, the tax rates for inherited property are 5% (if the taxable value is up to EUR 150,000) and 10% (if the taxable value exceeds EUR 150,000).
## Gift tax
There is no gift tax applicable in Lithuania.
## Real estate tax (RET)
For families raising three or more children until the age of 18, as well as for families raising older disabled children with special need of constant nursing, the value of immovable property exceeding EUR 200,000 is subject to RET. All other above stated values of immovable property are increased by 30%.
## Luxury tax
There is no luxury tax applicable in Lithuania.

# Lithuania
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
## Domestic legislation
Generally, income of a foreign entity in Lithuania not derived through a PE is deemed to be Lithuanian-source income and is subject to WHT at the following rates:
0% WHT is applied on royalties paid to related parties meeting requirements of the European Commission (EC) Interest and Royalty Directive.
Lithuanian WHT on interest paid to entities established in the European Economic Area or DTT countries is 0%.
WHT is not applied on government securities issued on international financial markets, interest accumulated and paid on deposits, and interest on subordinated loans that meet the criteria established by legal acts adopted by the Bank of Lithuania.
Dividends distributed by a resident company to another resident company are subject to a 15% (16% from 1 January 2025) CIT, which is withheld by a distributing company.
The dividends distributed by a resident company (for both Lithuanian and foreign companies) are exempt from WHT if the recipient company has held not less than 10% of the voting shares in the distributing company for at least a 12-month period without interruption and the distributing entity is subject to 5% or 15% Lithuanian CIT rate. However, this relief is not applied if the foreign entity (recipient) is registered or otherwise organised in blacklisted territories (*see Blacklisted territories in the [Deductions](lithuania/corporate/deductions.html) section*), as specified by the Ministry of Finance. Please note that the requirement of the 12-month holding period does not necessarily have to be fulfilled on the day of dividend distribution.
Dividends distributed by a foreign entity are generally subject to a 15% (16% from 1 January 2025) CIT if they are to be paid by the receiving Lithuanian entity.
Dividends distributed by a foreign company to a Lithuanian company are exempt from CIT if the distributing foreign entity is established in the European Economic Area and related profit is properly taxed in the domiciled country.
The dividends are also exempt from WHT if the recipient company has held not less than 10% of the voting shares in the distributing company for at least a 12-month period without interruption and the profit of a distributing entity is subject to CIT or similar tax. This participation exemption satisfies the requirements of the EC Parent-Subsidiary Directive. The exemption also applies to dividends paid by non-EU foreign companies, except those registered or organised in blacklisted territories.
Dividends paid out to foreign companies or received from foreign companies are not subject to tax exemption in cases where tax benefit is the main or one of the main objectives of a particular structure of companies. Dividends received from foreign companies are also not subject to tax exemption if they were deducted from taxable profit at the distributing company level.
According to the changed provisions of the Law on CIT, the payments received by a foreign entity for the activities of the members of the supervisory board in Lithuania are recognised as income of the foreign company in Lithuania, regardless of the frequency of such payments and whether they are paid as *tantiemes* or as other types of payments. These payments are subject to 15% (16% from 1 January 2025) WHT, which should be withheld by the paying company in Lithuania. The tax is applicable only if the member of the supervisory board is a foreign company (not an individual).
## Tax treaties
Where a treaty for the avoidance of double taxation and prevention of fiscal infringement with the country in question contradicts the local regulations, the treaty provisions prevail. Lithuania now has 58 DTTs in force with foreign countries.
The following WHT rates apply to dividends, interest, and royalties paid to a recipient or beneficial owner resident in a tax treaty country. The lower of the domestic or the treaty rate is given.
| Recipient | WHT (%) | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dividends (1) (16% instead of 15% from 1 January 2025) | Interest (2) | Royalties (3) |

\**On 1 October* *2024* *the Lithuanian law denouncing the DTT between Lithuania* *and the Russian* *Federation was adopted and the DTT will no longer be valid from 1 January 2026.*
Notes
1. Dividends are exempt from WHT if the recipient company has held not less than 10% of the voting shares in the distributing company for at least a 12-month period without interruption. However, this relief is not applied if the foreign entity (recipient) is registered or otherwise organised in blacklisted territories (*see Blacklisted territories in the [Deductions](lithuania/corporate/deductions.html) section*), as specified by the Ministry of Finance. If participation exemption criteria are not met, the standard WHT rate of 15% (16% from 1 January 2025) should be applied. However, some of the DTTs allow applying WHT at a reduced rate of 5% or 10%.
2. Under the domestic law, the rate is nil if interest is paid to a company established in a country that has a DTT with Lithuania or is a member of a European Economic Area. In other cases, еxcept for Cyprus, Latvia, and the United Arab Emirates where 0% WHT is established in the DTT, a 10% WHT rate should be applied.
3. Under the domestic law, 0% WHT is applied on royalties paid to related parties meeting requirements of the EC Interest and Royalty Directive.
4. Royalties for the use of industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment: 5%; other royalties: 10%.
5. Based on the most-favoured nation principle established in the DTTs or their Protocols with indicated countries, and as a result of Lithuania signing the DTT with Japan, royalties paid to these countries are not subject to WHT in Lithuania (DAS-1 form should be completed by the recipient).
Reduction of, or exemption from, WHT under a DTT may be obtained if a special residence certificate (Form DAS-1) is completed and approved by the tax authorities before a taxable payment is transferred. If a payment that would have been subject to a tax treaty has already been made and WHT at the local rate was withheld, it is possible to obtain an appropriate refund (reduction) by completing a special claim for a refund of the Lithuanian tax withheld at source (Form DAS-2) and obtaining the approval of the tax authorities.
In addition, the tax authorities may require completion of a special certificate giving information about income received and taxes paid in Lithuania (Form DAS-3).

# Lithuania
## Overview
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
Lithuania, located in Eastern Europe along the Baltic Sea, is bordered by Latvia to the north, Belarus to the south and east, Poland to the south, and Russia (Kaliningrad district) to the southwest. The capital of Lithuania is Vilnius. The official language is Lithuanian, and the currency is the euro (EUR).
On 11 March 1990, Lithuania declared its independence. Lithuania gained membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) in May 2004 and joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU) in the spring of 2004. Lithuania joined the Eurozone in 2015. As of 5 July 2018, Lithuania is a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
Lithuania has strong trading relations not only with its Central and Eastern European neighbours (Poland and Latvia) but also with Estonia, the United States, Germany, and the Netherlands. The government of Lithuania continues a high-profile campaign to attract foreign investment and to develop export markets. In 2024, the gross domestic product (GDP) of Lithuania increased by 2.2%. It is expected to grow by 3% for 2025 and, also, by 3% for 2026. The commercial environment is generally friendly to foreign companies, and most of the EU directives are implemented into the Lithuanian legislative system.

Under domestic accounting legislation, stock used in the production and included in the cost of produced goods is valued in the financial statements by the first in first out (FIFO) method. The last in first out (LIFO), weighted-average, progressive-average, actual-price, or another method that corresponds to the stocks’ movement can also be used. Usage of another method than FIFO is not required to be separately approved by the tax authorities; however, the method used must be disclosed in the notes to the annual accounts.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are taxed as part of the corporate profit of the enterprise.
Capital gains are treated as non-taxable income when they are derived from the transfer of shares in a company incorporated in the European Economic Area or in a country with which Lithuania has a valid DTT and that pays CIT or an equivalent tax. This holds true if the Lithuanian holding company holds more than 10% of voting shares for a continuous period of (i) at least two years or (ii) at least three years when the shares were transferred in one of the established forms of reorganisation. Certain restrictions apply.
Capital gains derived from the transfer of shares/units in collective investment undertakings are treated as non-taxable income, provided that those collective investment undertakings are not registered or otherwise organised in blacklisted territories and/or are not residents of such territories.
## Dividend income
The receiving company does not include the dividends received from other entities in its taxable income.
## Interest income
Interest income is treated as general taxable income and is subject to 15% CIT (16% from 1 January 2025).
## Royalty income
Royalty income is treated as general taxable income and is subject to 15% CIT (16% from 1 January 2025).
## Exemptions from taxable income
The following additional types of income are exempt from CIT:
## Foreign income
Income is not subject to taxation in Lithuania if it was received from activities through a PE in a foreign country that is in the European Economic Area or that has a DTT with Lithuania and if the income was subject to taxation there. Since such income is not subject to taxation in Lithuania, costs related to the income cannot be deducted from income that is subject to taxation in Lithuania.

## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
## Amendments to the tax laws from 2025
The following amendment to the Law on Corporate income tax (CIT) will enter into force as of 2025.
### Car purchase and rental costs
From 1 January 2025, the part of the purchase price of a passenger car that is considered as an asset of a unit can be deducted from income, not exceeding:
The part of the purchase price of a passenger car that exceeds the established limitations will have to be attributed to non-deductible expenses during the period that the passenger car will be depreciated.
There are no restrictions on the cost of the purchase of passenger cars, if these cars are used only for rental activities, for the provision of driving training services or for the provision of transport services.
The monthly rental costs of a passenger car that is not considered as an asset of a unit are deducted from income within (i) the limit set above and (ii) the applicable depreciation normative ratio (in years) divided by 12 of the fixed asset group to which the leased passenger car should be assigned if it were considered as an asset of a unit. This shall not apply to leases with a total period of no longer than 30 days during the tax period.
## Amendments to the tax laws from 2023/24
The following amendments to the laws on CIT, personal income tax (PIT), and social security contributions (SSC) entered into force as of 2023/24.
### Corporate income tax (CIT)
From 1 January 2023, the new amendments to the Law on CIT relating to anti-hybrid rules have come into force.
With the new amendments, it is aimed to prevent non-taxation of income achieved by the foreign shareholders of Lithuanian hybrid entities, i.e. to prevent situations when the income is neither taxed as being that of a Lithuanian hybrid entity nor as being that of foreign shareholders.
The tax base of a Lithuanian hybrid entity shall include the part of income (attributable to the foreign shareholder[s] of the Lithuanian hybrid entity) that is not otherwise subject to CIT or an equivalent tax in accordance with the legislation of the Lithuanian Law on CIT or any other country whose resident is a participant of the Lithuanian hybrid entity for tax purposes.
More detailed information explaining the application of this rule is currently not available (should be provided by the tax authorities later). However, the provision does not apply to collective investment vehicles meeting certain criteria.
### Payroll taxes
Starting from 1 January 2024, the threshold when the higher PIT rate is applicable increased for employment related income from EUR 101,094 per calendar year to EUR 114,162. A 32% PIT rate for the income exceeding this threshold is applied.
### Social security contributions (SSC)
Starting from 1 January 2024, the ceiling for SSC withholding increased from EUR 101,094 to EUR 114,162 per calendar year. The ceilings are not applicable to the health insurance contributions and employer's contributions.
## Other significant amendments
### Implementation of Pillar I and Pillar II
From 1 July 2024, the Lithuanian Law of ensuring the minimum level of taxation of groups of entities entered into force, which partially transfers and implements the 14 December 2022 Provisions of the Council Directive EU 2022/2523 on ensuring the universal minimum level of taxation of international corporate groups and large groups of local entities in the Union (hereinafter referred to as the Directive).
The changes are related to the comprehensive international tax reform plan and its implementation, based on two pillars:
With the exception of the initial stage of activity, the additional tax that should be calculated and paid by the main parent entity of an international group of entities located in Lithuania on the profits earned by such group in Lithuania, as well as the additional tax that would be assigned to international entities located in the territories of third countries for taxable entities of the group, whose location is in Lithuania, is reduced to zero in each financial year in which such group implements the initial stage of activity, but not longer than five financial years. The additional tax, which would be calculated for the group of Lithuanian entities, is reduced to zero for the entire transition period, i.e. also for five financial years.
The law does not apply to entities deemed to be exempt entities, i.e. public interest entities (e.g. government entities, international organisations, non-profit organisations), tax-neutral investment entities (e.g. mutual funds and real estate investment entities when they are part of a chain of ownership of a group of entities above, as well as pension funds), and certain entities controlled by excluded entities that substantially complement the activities of those excluded entities or are established for the purpose of managing their assets.
The law, however, transposes the Directive only partially, taking into account the fact that Lithuania has chosen to apply the exception set out in Article 50 of the Directive (postponing mandatory taxation rules for no more than six years), the application of the income inclusion rule, and the rule of undertaxed profit. This means that the law transposes and implements the provisions of the Directive governing its scope, the procedure for determining the location of a unit, and the procedure for providing the information necessary to ensure the minimum level of taxation of profits earned by large groups of units in each jurisdiction.
However, at this moment the Lithuanian parliament (*Seimas*) is considering a draft law to fully transfer and implement the Directive. As drafted, the law for the full implementation is to enter into force on 1 January 2025.
### Temporary solidarity contribution
From 16 May 2023, the Law on Temporary Solidarity Contribution came into force.
According to the provisions of the Law on Temporary Solidarity Contribution, this contribution is paid by banks established in the Republic of Lithuania in accordance with the Law on Banks, branches of banks licensed in the member states of the European Union (EU) and member states of the European Economic Area (EEA) and foreign banks, and financial groups of central credit unions operating in accordance with the Law on Central Credit Unions.
The base of this contribution consists of net interest income, calculated by applying the principles established by the Law on Temporary Solidarity Contribution. The contribution payment period used for calculating the contribution for the year 2023 is the period from 16 May 2023 (Enforcement of the Law on Temporary Solidarity Contribution) until 31 December 2023, and the payment period used to calculate the contribution for the year 2024 is the calendar year ending on 31 December 2024 and for the year 2025 is the calendar year ending on 31 December 2025.
The contribution must be declared (using form KIT713) and paid (only the calculated difference of the amount of the contribution stated in the annual contribution return and the paid amount of advance contributions for that payment period, if any) after the end of the payment period until 15 June of the following year.
The Law on Temporary Solidarity Contribution also stipulates an advance contribution. The advance contribution return must be submitted and the advance contribution is paid after the end of the quarter of the payment period, until the last day of the second month of the next quarter.
The Law on Temporary Solidarity Contribution is valid until 16 June 2026.
### The Law on Implementation of Regulation 2022/1854
From 1 January 2023, the Law of the Republic of Lithuania on the Implementation of Regulation 2022/1854 No. XIV-1680 came into force as a limited measure to mitigate the effects of high energy prices.
The obligation to pay solidarity contribution is established for entities and PEs of the European Union defined in point 17 of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2022/1854 performing activities in the crude oil, natural gas, coal, and oil refinery sectors.
The base for calculating the solidarity contribution and the solidarity contribution are calculated for the tax year starting in 2023. The calculation of the excess profit of the entities subject to solidarity contribution and/or the amount of their solidarity contribution to be paid is guided by the provisions of the Law on CIT.
The application of Article 6(1) of Regulation (EU) 2022/1854 shall be ensured by collecting excess revenue from the market revenues of electricity generators producing electricity from resources referred to in Article 7(1) of Regulation (EU) 2022/1854. The excess revenue is collected from the market revenues received in relation to the electricity produced and actually delivered during the period referred to in Article 22(2)(c) of Regulation (EU) 2022/1854 (i.e. 1 December 2022 - 30 June 2023), exclusive of those referred to in paragraph 6 of this Article.
### Provision of information about the activities carried out on online platforms
From 1 January 2023, online platform operators are required to collect and, once a year, submit information on sellers using the platforms (name, address, current accounts, country of residence, income received, etc.) for the previous calendar year to the tax authorities (with some exceptions). The requirement applies to all operators of online platforms (including mobile apps).
Information must be provided if income is received from one of the following activities:
For the first time, platform operators will have to submit data for the previous calendar year until 31 January 2024. Standardised information collection requirements will be applied throughout the EU internal market, and a common EU register will be created. Tax administrators of all EU member states will participate in this system and exchange information about the platforms.
If the platform operator (except for the foreign platform operator) does not fulfil the obligation to provide information, there is a possibility for the tax authorities to cancel access to the platform operator's website until the platform operator eliminates the violation. If the foreign platform operator does not fulfill the obligation to provide information, the tax authorities cancel the registration of the foreign platform.
### Provision of data on international payment transactions
From 1 January 2024, in accordance with Council Directive (EU) 2020/284, payment service providers will have to store and provide to the tax authorities data on international payments made through them every calendar quarter.
Data will have to be provided by the following payment service providers specified in the Law on Payments of the Republic of Lithuania:
Payment service providers will have to provide information only on international payments when:
Payment service providers must submit the collected information for the calendar quarter no later than the end of the month following the end of the calendar quarter. When the tax authorities receive information from payment service providers, it will submit this data to the Central Electronic System of Payment information (CESOP). Payment service providers will be required to store data for at least three calendar years from the end of the calendar year in which the payment transaction was completed, and the data will be able to be revised/adjusted for the same period (three calendar years).
### CIT information report
From 22 June 2023, the requirement for companies to prepare the CIT information report, to submit it to the manager of the Register of Legal Entities, and to publish it on the company's website entered into force.
The CIT information report contains all the information related to the company's activities (company name, list of corporate groups, number of employees, brief information on activities, income, profit, etc.). These reports would be prepared for reporting periods starting on 22 June 2024 and later (the template of this report is set by the European Commission).
The requirements will apply to:
### **Provision of taxi dispatch data**
In order to reduce the conditions for the shadow economy in the passenger transport sector by light vehicles for a fee, from 6 May 2024 the obligation for taxi dispatch centers to collect, store, and provide the data to the Tax Authority (at the frequency and in the manner specified by it) and to law enforcement and state road transport supervision institutions (on their request) came into effect. This data includes: 1) the name and surname of the individual conducting passenger transport by light vehicle for a fee; 2) the taxi permit number; 3) the estimated trip cost.
The mentioned data must be submitted no later than 15 February for the previous reporting period (the data for the period from 6 May 2024 to 31 December 2024 must be submitted by 15 February 2025).
### Fines and penalties
From 1 May 2023, if the tax administrator determines during the tax inspection that the taxpayer did not calculate the undeclared tax (including the tax calculated in the customs declarations) or did not declare the declared tax or illegally applied a lower tax rate and for these reasons illegally reduced the tax payable, in addition to the amount of tax payable, a fine from 20% to 100% (up till then, 10% to 50%) of the unpaid taxes may be imposed, unless the relevant tax law provides otherwise.
Late payment interest applied from 1 May 2023 to 31 October 2023 is 0.029%, from 1 November 2023 to 30 April 2024 is 0.03%, from 1 May 2024 to 31 October 2024 is 0.029% and from 1 November 2024 is 0.027% per day.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
A company is a tax resident in Lithuania if it is incorporated there. It may also be subject to taxation if its activities create a PE for tax purposes or if it in Lithuania earns income subject to WHT in Lithuania.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
According to local legislation, a foreign company is deemed to have a PE in Lithuania when:
DTTs may establish different rules of PE recognition. According to domestic law, where there is a DTT, the provisions of the treaty take precedence.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
Allowable deductions include all the usual costs that an entity actually incurs for the purpose of earning income or receiving economic benefit unless the Law on CIT provides otherwise.
## Depreciation
Tangible and intangible assets may be depreciated using a directly proportional (straight-line) depreciation method, a production depreciation method, or a double-declining-balance depreciation method. Depreciation may not exceed maximum rates established by the law. For certain typical assets, depreciation rates relevant for tax purposes are shown in the chart below:
| Asset | Depreciation period (years) |
| --- | --- |
| New buildings used for business activities | 8 |
| Residential buildings | 20 |
| Electrical transmission and communication equipment (excluding computer networks) | 8 |
| Furniture | 6 |
| Plant and machinery | 5 |
| Trucks, trailers, semi-trailers, buses (not older than 5 years) | 4 |
| Computer and communications equipment | 3 |
| Software | 3 |
## Goodwill
Goodwill can be amortised for tax purposes using a straight-line method over 15 years after a merger of a purchasing company and an acquired company, provided that certain conditions are met.
## Start-up expenses
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are generally deductible for tax purposes. Interest expenses should be generally recognised as non-deductible for tax purposes if, after acquisition, a purchasing company and an acquired company are merged and debt used for acquisition of shares is pushed down to the acquired company (possibility to deduct interest after merger remains only if certain conditions are met, e.g. economic benefit for surviving entity from such exercise is substantiated).
Interest paid to related parties may be non-deductible for tax purposes if thin capitalisation rules are infringed, limits of the EBITDA rule are exceeded, or the interest rate on a debt from the related party does not correspond to a fair market interest rate (*see Thin capitalisation and EBITDA rules and Transfer pricing in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*).
## Charitable contributions
Generally, double the amount of donation/sponsorship can be deducted for tax purposes (i.e. 200% deduction is available) but only if donation/sponsorship was provided to registered recipients and only up to a limit of 40% of taxable result before deduction of donation/sponsorship and utilisation of tax losses carried forward.
## Taxes
All taxes, fees, and other compulsory payments to the state budget are deductible for CIT purposes, except VAT and CIT paid to the budget. Note that VAT can be treated as deductible for CIT purposes if it is treated as fully or partly non-deductible for VAT purposes and this input/import VAT relates to deductible expenses.
## Other significant items
Limited deductible expenses also include the following:
Non-deductible expenses also include the following:
## Net operating losses
Operating losses may be carried forward for an indefinite period, provided that certain requirements are met.
Losses incurred due to the transfer of securities and/or derivative financial instruments may be carried forward for five years (indefinitely for financial institutions) and can offset only profit from transfer of securities and/or derivative financial instruments.
Reduction of taxable profit by accumulated tax losses is limited to 70% of the taxable profit for the current year (except for entities that are subject to the reduced CIT rate of 5% (6% from 1 January 2025)). The rest of the accumulated tax losses can be carried forward for an unlimited period of time. However, such transfer shall be terminated if the entity ceases to carry on the activities that caused these losses, unless the entity ceases to carry on the activities for reasons beyond its control.
No limitation for carry forward due to the change of direct or indirect ownership of the entity arises, unless legal status of the entities is changed.
Current year operating losses can be transferred to another legal entity of the group if certain conditions are met.
No carryback of losses is available in Lithuania.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments to foreign affiliates (e.g. interest, royalties, management fees, fees for other services) are deductible for tax purposes if the payment serves a business purpose, provides a benefit to the payer, is at arm’s length, and is substantiated by sufficient documentation. Payments to foreign affiliates may also be subject to various WHTs. Certain payments to affiliates located in tax haven (blacklisted) countries are subject to a 15% (16% from 1 January 2025) WHT rate.
## Blacklisted territories
A list of 49 offshore territories (including the newly listed Russian Federation since 1 December 2023) has been published. With certain exceptions specified in the law, all payments to offshore companies or their branches for any work or services, commodities, interest on funding, insurance premiums, guarantees, etc. are non-deductible for CIT purposes unless the Lithuanian entity provides evidence to the state tax authorities that:

# Lithuania
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
Group taxation legislation and regimes are not available in Lithuania. Each Lithuanian entity is regarded as a separate taxpayer and may not deduct tax losses accumulated from previous tax periods at the level of any other group entity.
Transfer of current year operating tax losses incurred to an entity of the same group of companies is allowed if certain requirements are met.
## Transfer pricing
All transactions between associated parties must be performed at arm’s length. The tax authorities have a right to adjust transaction prices if they do not conform to market prices.
The Lithuanian rules refer to the Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations established by the OECD to the extent that they do not contradict with the domestic rules.
According to the Lithuanian transfer pricing regulations, companies may apply the following methods, although traditional methods should be given preference:
Transfer pricing documentation consists of two files: (i) Master File, which describes inter-company transactions in the worldwide context of an entity’s group, and (ii) Local File, which includes more detailed information and analysis about the local entity's inter-company transactions.
Local File should be prepared by all Lithuanian entities and foreign entities’ PEs with annual previous period’s revenue exceeding EUR 3 million, as well as all banks, insurance companies, and credit institutions (disregarding revenue).
Master File is mandatory if an entity belongs to the international group of companies and its previous period’s revenue in Lithuania exceeds EUR 15 million.
Intra-group transactions that exceed a threshold of EUR 90,000 per year must be documented in the Local File. If an entity enters into multiple similar transactions with one associated party, the threshold is applicable for the total amount of all transactions with that party. If the transaction is inextricably linked to another transaction, the same threshold of EUR 90,000 for the two transactions is applied jointly. No threshold is applied on transactions with associated parties that are registered or otherwise organised in blacklisted territories.
Starting from 1 January 2020, transfer pricing documentation requirements are not applicable to controlled transactions of a Lithuanian entity or a foreign entity operating through a PE in the Republic of Lithuania that are concluded with another Lithuanian entity or a foreign entity operating through a PE in the Republic of Lithuania, a permanent resident of Lithuania, and/or a non-permanent resident of Lithuania carrying out individual activities under a business certificate on a permanent basis if such transactions are related to their activities in Lithuania.
Starting from 1 January 2021, the possibility of applying a simplified transfer pricing approach for low value-adding intra-group services transactions was enacted. Under this simplified approach, a 5% mark-up on costs related to the provision of services that can be defined as low value-adding could be applied without requiring a formal benchmarking study. Domestic legislation regarding low value-adding intra-group services is in line with the Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations established by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
Transfer pricing documentation can be prepared in any language; however, tax authorities may request to provide translations to Lithuanian.
Transfer pricing documentation should be prepared by the 15th day of the sixth month after the end of the tax period when such transaction between associated parties took place. At the request of the tax administrator, documentation must be submitted within 30 days.
Information about the transactions provided in the documentation should be updated annually. If the economic circumstances of the controlled transactions remain the same and the relevant market situation does not change significantly, the benchmarking studies/comparative transaction data may be updated every three years; however, information on the controlled intra-group transactions still must be documented annually.
Penalties, amounting from EUR 1,820 to EUR 6,000, for non-compliance with the transfer pricing documentation requirements for transactions between associated persons could be imposed. Penalties are imposed on the head of the company or an authorised person.
Advance pricing agreements (APAs) and binding rulings are available in Lithuania. Taxpayers can apply for an APA or a binding ruling from the Lithuanian tax authority in respect of future transactions for the current and next five financial periods.
Decisions in the form of a binding ruling or APA will be issued by the Lithuanian tax authority regarding the application of tax legislation provisions and pricing principles. The above-mentioned decisions will be particularly relevant to companies planning to undertake new transactions where the taxation principles of such transactions are not clearly defined in the tax legislation and to international companies planning to perform significant transactions with associated parties.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
The CbC reporting obligation applies for multinational groups of companies with consolidated revenue of not less than EUR 750 million. According to the approved rules, the CbC report must be submitted electronically within 12 months after the last day of the taxpayer’s financial year.
The CbC report can be submitted in parts and it will be considered to be submitted when the last part of the CbC report is submitted.
Effective November 20, 2024, the Head of the State Tax Inspectorate under the Ministry of Finance has implemented new guidelines for the preparation and submission of CbC notification. These guidelines stipulate that all notifications must be prepared, submitted, and revised electronically through the Mano VMI system. It is mandatory for each company within a multinational enterprise (MNE) group to file a notification for every financial year by the end of that fiscal period.
## Thin capitalisation and EBITDA rules
The Lithuanian thin capitalisation rules apply in respect to borrowings from related parties as well as borrowings from third parties guaranteed by related parties. The controlled debt-to-fixed-equity ratio is 4:1. Interest expenses calculated on the exceeding part of the controlled debt are non-deductible unless a Lithuanian company (borrower) can prove that the same loan under the same conditions would have been granted by a non-related entity. The rule does not apply to financial institutions providing financial rental (leasing) services.
Additionally, as of 1 January 2019, a new interest limitation rule has been introduced. An entity is given the right to deduct interest costs exceeding interest revenue up to 30% of taxable EBITDA or up to EUR 3 million. If an entity belongs to the group of entities, the above criteria shall be applied jointly for all Lithuanian entities and PEs of foreign entities in Lithuania that belong to the same group. Restrictions do not apply if an entity's financial results are included in the consolidated financial results of a group, and the equity-to-asset ratio of that entity is not more than 2 percentage points lower than the equivalent ratio of the group. Interest costs exceeding interest revenue could be carried forward without time limitation. The mentioned rules do not apply to financial institutions and insurance companies.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Positive income of a CFC, i.e. income not derived from operating activity (including interest, royalties, leasing, dividend income, etc.), shall be included in the taxable income of a controlling Lithuanian company if:
An entity is treated as a CFC if more than 50% of its voting rights or shares are owned, directly or indirectly, by the Lithuanian entity.
A Lithuanian company may reduce tax payable in Lithuania by the tax paid in a foreign country on the positive income of CFC included in the tax base of that Lithuanian company.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
## Foreign tax credit
A company may reduce tax payable on certain foreign-sourced income in Lithuania by taxes paid on that income in a foreign country if that Lithuanian company has received appropriate notice from that foreign country. The tax credit may not exceed the CIT rate payable in Lithuania.
## Investment project incentive
Entities involved in an investment project can reduce their taxable profits by up to 100% of the actually incurred acquisition costs of long-term assets meeting certain requirements. Please note that depreciation (amortisation) expenses of such assets shall be deducted in a common manner.
Taxable profits can be reduced by such costs incurred from 2009 to 2028.
This relief is applied to the following categories of fixed assets:
The assets must be not used and produced not earlier than two years ago (as calculated from the date when such fixed assets were put into use).
The costs exceeding the above-mentioned 100% limit can be carried forward for four years.
There are certain criteria defining what could be considered an investment project. The project should be precisely described to meet the criteria allowing a company to use the tax relief.
Expenses, except for fixed assets’ depreciation (amortisation) expenses, incurred for R&D purposes can be deducted three times in the tax period when they are incurred, provided that R&D works performed are related to ordinary business activities. The entity also may apply accelerated depreciation rates to fixed assets used in R&D activities.
A company applying tax relief for R&D has to prepare R&D documentation. This documentation has to cover the performed project, substantiate conformity with certain tax requirements, and specify the amount of expenses for R&D activities.
As of 1 January 2018, a new tax incentive for companies investing into R&D was introduced. Such companies have the possibility to not only deduct the expenses incurred for R&D works from the taxable income three times, but they are also entitled to apply the reduced 5% (6% from 1 January 2025) CIT rate on the profit deriving from the commercial exploitation of patented inventions (it is similar to 'patent box' regimes available in other countries).
A company can apply the reduced CIT rate of 5% (6% from 1 January 2025) if:
## Funds granted for producing a film or a part of a film
Funds granted for producing a film or a part of a film can be deducted from taxable income and from CIT payable due during the period from 2019 to 2028 if the following conditions are met:
Not more than 75% of funds granted free of charge for production of film or of a part thereof in Lithuania can be deducted from taxable income.
Certain restrictions for reduction of taxable income and tax due apply.
## Large project relief
Starting from 1 January 2021, revenue an entity earned in the course of carrying out a large investment project may be exempt from CIT for a period of 20 years (or until the maximum state aid is reached). The relief applies only if at least 75% of the entity’s revenue for the relevant tax period consists of revenue from (i) manufacturing, (ii) data processing, or (iii) internet server services (hosting) and related activities. The requirements for the application of the relief are one of the following:
An investment agreement with the government of the Republic of Lithuania for the application of large project relief is required. This agreement must be signed by 31 December 2025.
The relief starts to apply from the tax period when the above-mentioned thresholds are reached. The application of the relief is suspended for the tax periods in which the amount of capital investment and/or the average number of employees and/or amount of salaries falls below the required threshold. The exemption will be renewed for the tax period when the required thresholds are reached again. Moreover, the exemption will not be granted to companies established in and benefiting from the preferential taxation in an FEZ.
It should be mentioned that if the investment agreement is signed, there are other benefits for the investor (green corridor initiative):
## Free economic zones (FEZs)
There are seven FEZs in Lithuania: in Kaunas, Klaipėda, Akmenė, Kėdainiai, Marijampolė, Panevėžys, and Šiauliai.
As of 1 January 2018, entities operating in an FEZ and fulfilling certain requirements are entitled to FEZ relief (i.e. do not pay CIT for the first ten years and apply 50% lower CIT rate for further six years). Also, no real estate tax has to be paid in an FEZ.
FEZ relief is applicable to the entities registered and actually performing its activities in the FEZ, if all of the following requirements are met:

## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
## Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) agreement with the United States (US)
Lithuania signed an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) with the United States under the framework of FATCA. Lithuania and the United States will exchange information about the accounts of foreign (US or Lithuania, respectively) residents held in local financial institutions or local branches of foreign financial institutions.
## Implementation of base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) provisions
The OECD has announced a package of BEPS recommendations aiming to increase transparency of international taxation and prevent tax evasion and aggressive tax planning. Many OECD countries, including Lithuania, have already started shifting certain provisions related to implementation of the BEPS recommendation package into their tax legislation (*see below*).
### Hybrid mismatch arrangements
Hybrid mismatch rules aim to prevent obtaining a double non-taxation benefit by exploiting differences between the tax treatment of entities and instruments across different countries. Lithuanian rules state that when the payment is deductible in two countries, or deductible in one country and non-taxable in another, tax discrepancies are neutralised by treating such payment as non-deductible expense or taxable income in Lithuania.
From 1 January 2023, the new amendments to the Law on CIT relating to anti-hybrid rules have come into force (*please see* *Amendments to the tax laws in the [Significant developments](significant-developments.html) section*).
### Controlled foreign company (CFC) rules
### Limitation on interest deductions
### Mandatory disclosure rules (DAC6)
### Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
The CbC reporting obligation applies for multinational groups of companies with consolidated revenue of not less than EUR 750 million. According to the approved rules, the CbC report must be submitted electronically within 12 months after the last day of the taxpayer’s financial year.
### Multilateral Instrument
Lithuania signed the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting ('Multilateral Instrument' or MLI) and deposited its instrument of ratification on 11 September 2018. The Multilateral Instrument entered into force on 1 January 2019 for Lithuania.

# Lithuania
## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
## Foreign tax relief
Residents are entitled to a relief from double taxation under effective double taxation treaties (DTTs).
According to the domestic legislation, income received by a resident of Lithuania in a foreign country that is an EU member state or with which Lithuania has a valid DTT is tax exempted in Lithuania only if the documentary evidence concerning the income received in that foreign country and the amount of income tax or equivalent tax paid on such income is submitted to the tax authorities.
This rule does not apply for interest, dividends and royalties received. In these cases, tax credit can be taken in Lithuania for PIT (or its equivalent) paid abroad. However, tax credit may not exceed Lithuanian PIT attributable to the income taxed abroad. Also, it cannot be higher than foreseen by the DTT between the two countries (even though the national law may allow taxation at higher rates).

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
Starting from 1 January 2025, the higher 32% personal income tax (PIT) rate for the income exceeding the threshold of 126,532 euros (EUR) should be applied.
Employment income exceeding the EUR 126,532 threshold is subject to a lower rate of social security contributions at 6.98%. Employer‘s social security contributions of 1.77% (standard rate) are not capped.
The legislation was amended where the possibility to refund social security contributions paid during the calendar year at a standard rate was foreseen for the employees having more than one employer and exceeding the aforementioned annual income threshold in total. In previous years, social security contributions ceilings were applied to each employer separately, and the refund was not possible even if the annual threshold was reached by adding the individual's income from all employers.
Taxation of other personal income was slightly reduced, and the progressive PIT rate at 20% is applied to annual income exceeding EUR 253,065.
### Investment account
Since January 1, 2025, Lithuania has implemented a new investment account (IA) scheme, creating more favourable conditions for individual investors. IA gives the opportunity to defer income tax payments until the funds in the account are used for non-investment purposes.
Key points of the IA scheme:

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
## Employment expenses
Employment-related expenses are not deductible from individual employment compensation.
## Personal deductions
The following expenses incurred by Lithuanian tax residents over the tax period may be deducted from taxable income:
The total amount of deductible expenses specified above is limited to 25% of the taxable income (subject to 15%, 20%, and 32% PIT rates) during the calendar year. The total deductible life insurance premiums and both types of pension contributions amount should not exceed EUR 1,500.
## Standard deductions
A monthly tax-exempt amount (TEA) is applied only to employment-related income of Lithuanian tax residents, as follows:
The annual TEA shall be applied to the total annual income received by the individual. In cases where an individual receives additional income to the salary income (or salary increases during the year), corrections are made at the end of the year (when filing the annual income tax return). The calculation is made taking into consideration the annual taxable income, including tax exempt income received for the work performed in the country Lithuania has a double taxation treaty (DTT) concluded with and accordingly taxed in such a country. Also, income from individual activities derived under business certificates is not included in the calculation of the annual TEA.
The annual TEA can be applied to Lithuanian tax non-residents only at the end of the tax period by submitting the annual PIT return, provided their annual gross income does not exceed EUR 34,370.67.
For all children, the Lithuanian local municipal offices pay to families EUR 122.50 per month per child from birth to 18 years of age or older if they study according to a general curriculum until they reach the age of 21. The additional children allowances are also possible for families receiving certain low amounts of income, having three or more children, etc.
## Personal allowances
There are no personal allowances available in Lithuania.
## Business expenses
Expenses incurred for the purpose of receiving income from individual activities by self-employed individuals are tax deductible. There are two options to deduct expenses from income received/earned during the tax year:
## Losses
In certain cases, individuals performing individual activities can carry forward the losses for an unlimited period of time, until the activity that resulted in such losses is terminated.
Generally, losses resulting from the sales of shares and other financial instruments can reduce the profits earned from such sales during the same tax year (certain restrictions apply). However, losses resulting from other sales of property (e.g. immovable property) do not reduce the taxable base of other sales transactions of such property. Moreover, it is not possible to carry forward losses resulting from capital gains.

## Employment income
Taxable monthly earnings in cash and in kind received from the principal workplace include wages, various additional payments (e.g. sickness and maternity benefits paid from social insurance), bonuses, employee stock option benefits, incentive payments, taxable allowances and other similar payments, compensation upon discharge from work (e.g. compensation for remaining vacation), gratuities, and compensation for unlawful dismissal from work.
The following income derived from employment in a Lithuanian legal entity is non-taxable for PIT purposes:
### Equity compensation
For tax purposes, equity compensation received by an employee in kind or in cash is treated as employment-related income and is subject to PIT. The taxable amount is calculated based on the difference between fair market value of the equity granted and the amount paid for it by the employee, if any.
Employee stock options exercised at no cost or for lower than their fair market value price not earlier than three years following their grant date will be treated as non-taxable income for PIT purposes, meaning that taxation should arise only at the time of share sale. This relief applies to stock options granted after 1 February 2020.
## Business income
An individual's business income derived from self-employment and other individual activities, including income received from rent, sale, or transfer of property related to individual activities (not taking into account objects of immovable kind) is taxed depending on the amount of income received. PIT calculated at the 15% flat rate on taxable income is reduced by applying a PIT credit, calculated according to special formulas. Therefore:
Income under a business certificate (including certain rental income) can be received if it does not exceed the limit of EUR 45,000; the excess is taxed at a PIT rate of 15% by applying a PIT credit as commented above.
## Capital gains
Taxable income derived from the sale of property is calculated as the difference between the sale price and the acquisition price, and the taxable gain is subject to a 15% PIT rate for income amount not exceeding EUR 253,065 per calendar year for 2025. The exceeding part is taxable at a PIT rate of 20%.
The following capital gains are non-taxable:
## Dividend income
Dividends are subject to a flat 15% PIT rate.
## Interest income
The following interest income is tax exempt:
## Rental income
Income derived from rent is subject to a 15% PIT rate for the income amount not exceeding EUR 253,065 per calendar year for 2025. The exceeding part is taxable at a rate of 20%.
## Exempt income
Certain items of income are non-taxable in Lithuania, including:
