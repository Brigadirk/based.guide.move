## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
All undistributed corporate profits are tax exempt. This exemption covers both active (e.g. trading) and passive (e.g. dividends, interest, royalties) types of income. It also covers capital gains from the sale of all types of assets, including shares, securities, and immovable property. This tax regime is available to Estonian resident companies and permanent establishments (PEs) of non-resident companies that are registered in Estonia.
The taxation of corporate profits is postponed until the profits are distributed as dividends or deemed to be distributed, such as in the case of transfer pricing adjustments, expenses and payments that do not have a business purpose, fringe benefits, gifts, donations, and representation expenses.
Distributed profits are generally subject to the 20% CIT at 20/80 of the net amount of profit distribution. For example, a company that has profits of 100 euros (EUR) available for distribution can distribute dividends of EUR 80, on which it must pay CIT of EUR 20.
From 2018 onwards, a lower CIT at the rate of 14% for those companies making regular profit distributions is available. The payment of dividends in the amount that is below or equal to the extent of taxed dividends paid during the three preceding years will be taxed with a rate of 14% (the tax rate on the net amount being 14/86 instead of the regular 20/80). In cases where the recipient of the 14% dividend is either a resident or non-resident individual, a 7% WHT rate will apply unless a tax treaty provides for a lower WHT rate (5% or 0%). 2018 is the first year to be taken into consideration for the purposes of determining the average dividend.
In Estonia, resident companies are taxed on profits distributed from their worldwide income, while PEs of non-residents are taxed only on profits distributed from income derived from Estonian sources. Other Estonian-source income derived by non-residents may be subject to final WHT or CIT by way of assessment.
## Local income taxes
There are no municipal or local income taxes in Estonia.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The following transactions are subject to Estonian VAT:
The standard VAT rate is 22%. A reduced rate of 9% is applied to books, periodicals (with few exceptions), hotel accommodation services, and listed pharmaceuticals. A reduced rate of 5% is applied to certain periodicals both on physical medium and electronically.
The VAT rate on the export of goods and certain services is 0% (i.e. exempt with credit). Certain services, such as health care, education, insurance, certain financial, and transactions with securities, are exempt (i.e. exempt without credit).
Transactions in real estate are generally exempt from VAT. Transactions in new and significantly renovated buildings and building land are taxable. Taxpayers can elect to add VAT to real estate transactions if certain conditions are met.
Domestic reverse-charge mechanism applies to the supply of real estate and investment gold opted for VAT, scrap metal, certain precious metals and scrap, and certain metal products. Domestic reverse charge applies only to transactions between VATable persons.
If the taxable supplies of Estonian resident businesses or a fixed establishment of a non-resident business in Estonia exceed EUR 40,000 in a calendar year, VAT registration is required. Voluntary registration is also possible. Certain transactions of non-resident businesses require Estonian VAT registration without any threshold.
The VAT accounting period is generally a calendar month, and a VAT return should be submitted and VAT due paid on or before the 20th day of the following month.
Under certain conditions, an EU taxable person that is not registered for VAT in Estonia will be entitled to a refund of input VAT paid in Estonia. Non-EU taxable persons are entitled to claim VAT refunds based on reciprocity.
Estonia has implemented a system that allows, under certain conditions, a company to account for VAT on imports in the VAT returns without paying import VAT to the customs authority.
## Customs duties
After becoming a member of the European Union, Estonia also became a member of the Customs Union. The Community Customs Code and related implementation regulations apply, meaning that:
## Excise duties
Excise taxes are levied on tobacco, alcohol, electricity, some packaging materials, and motor fuel.
## Land and property taxes
There is no property tax (i.e. tax on the value of buildings).
Property transfers are generally subject to state and notary fees.
## Transfer taxes
There are no transfer taxes in Estonia.
## Stamp taxes
Certain transactions may be subject to insignificant stamp taxes (i.e. state fees).
## Payroll taxes
In addition to payment of the social tax, unemployment insurance contributions, and compulsory accumulative pension scheme contributions (*see below*), employers should withhold personal income tax (PIT) at the flat rate of 20% after deduction of the employee’s contribution to unemployment insurance scheme, compulsory accumulative pension scheme, and, if relevant, personal deduction, which may be up to EUR 654 per month.
## Social tax and unemployment insurance
Employers operating in Estonia (including non-residents with a PE or employees in Estonia) must pay social tax on certain payments to individuals at the rate of 33% (where 20% is used for financing public pension insurance and 13% is used for financing public health insurance). Social tax paid by employers is not capped and mainly applies to salaries, directors’ fees, and service fees paid and fringe benefits granted to individuals.
In addition to social tax, employers are also required to pay and withhold unemployment insurance contributions. Employers must pay 0.8% and employees must pay 1.6% (collected by employers through payroll withholding). The contributions mainly apply to salaries and service fees paid to individuals.
## Compulsory accumulative pension scheme
Employers’ payroll withholding includes 2% contributions to the compulsory accumulative pension scheme if the employee has joined that pension scheme. Under the compulsory accumulative pension scheme, resident employees born after 31 December 1982 are obligated to join the compulsory accumulative pension scheme and make contributions at 2% from gross salary. For resident employees born before 1983, joining the compulsory accumulative pension scheme is voluntary, but, after joining, it becomes compulsory and employees may not subsequently leave the scheme.
## Heavy goods vehicle tax
The heavy goods vehicle tax is paid for the following classes of vehicles that are registered with the Estonian National Motor Vehicle Register and are intended for the carriage of goods:
The tax is paid by the owners or users of the vehicles. The quarterly tax rates range from EUR 0 to EUR 232.60 per heavy goods vehicle.
## Gambling tax
Gambling tax is imposed on amounts received from operating games of skill, totalisator, betting, lotteries, and promotional lotteries. Tax is also charged on gambling tables and machines used for games of chance located in licensed premises. The tax is paid monthly by authorised operators.
## Local taxes
Local taxes can be imposed by rural municipalities or city councils; however, the fiscal significance of local taxes is almost non-existent. Local taxes include advertisement tax, road and street closure tax, motor vehicle tax, tax on keeping animals, entertainment tax, and parking charges.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
## Social security contributions
Employers operating in Estonia (including non-residents having a permanent establishment [PE] or employees in Estonia) must pay social tax on certain payments to individuals at the rate of 33% (whereof 20% is used for financing public pension insurance and 13% for financing public health insurance). Social tax paid by employers is not capped and mainly applies to salaries, directors’ fees, and service fees paid and fringe benefits granted to individuals. The period of taxation is a calendar month.
The net business income derived by individuals registered as sole proprietorships is also subject to 33% social tax (capped). Sole proprietorships are required to make quarterly advance payments of social tax in fixed amounts, which are credited against the final annual social tax liability.
## Unemployment insurance contributions
Employers are also required to pay and withhold unemployment insurance contributions. Employers must pay 0.8% and employees must pay 1.6% (collected by employers through payroll withholding). The contributions mainly apply to salaries and service fees paid to individuals.
## Compulsory accumulative pension scheme
Resident employees born after 31 December 1982 are obligated to join the compulsory accumulative pension scheme and make 2% contributions to the scheme (mostly collected by employers through payroll withholding). The contributions mainly apply to salaries, directors’ fees, and service fees. For resident employees born before 1983, joining the pension scheme is voluntary; however, after joining, it becomes compulsory and the employees may not subsequently leave the scheme. In addition to the 2% contribution made by the employee, 4% of the social security contribution payable by the employer (33%) will be transferred to the employee’s pension account.
Employees had an opportunity to increase the pension contributions from 2% to 3% (temporarily for the period 2014 to 2017) by submitting a respective application before 15 September 2013. Where the employee opted for the increased contributions, the contribution by the state was increased from 4% to 6% on account of the employee's personal pension account.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate is 22%. A reduced rate of 9% is applied to books, periodicals (with few exceptions), hotel accommodation services, and listed pharmaceuticals. A reduced rate of 5% is applied to certain periodicals both on physical medium and electronically.
The VAT rate on the export of goods and certain services is 0% (i.e. exempt with credit). Certain services, such as health care, education, insurance, certain financial, and transactions with securities, are exempt (i.e. exempt without credit).

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
## Taxable period
The tax period is generally a calendar month, but a calendar year for certain tax objects such as exceeding borrowing costs.
## Tax returns
The combined CIT and payroll tax return (form "TSD" with appendices) must be submitted to the local tax authorities by the tenth day of the month following a taxable distribution or payment. Tax returns may be filed electronically.
## Payment of tax
CIT and payroll taxes must be remitted to the local tax authorities by the tenth day of the month following a taxable distribution or payment. No advance CIT payments are required.
## Advance rulings
The aim of the advance ruling system is to provide certainty on the tax consequences of specific transactions or combination of transactions taking place in the future. The ruling is binding on the authorities (and not on the taxpayer) if the transaction was made within the deadline and the description provided in the ruling and the underlying legislation has not been substantially changed in the meantime. Estonian legislation specifically excludes obtaining rulings when the interpretation of the legislation is objectively clear, the situation is hypothetical, or the main purpose of the planned transaction is tax avoidance. In addition, transfer pricing valuation issues are excluded from the scope of the binding ruling system.
## Tax audit process
There is no statutory tax audit cycle in Estonia.
## Statute of limitations
As a general rule, the statute of limitations is three years. In case of intentional tax evasion, it is five years.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
An individual who is a resident of Estonia is liable to tax on worldwide income, irrespective of the origin of the income. Non-residents are taxed on their Estonian-source income.
Taxable income includes both active income, such as employment and business income, as well as passive income, such as capital gains, rents and royalties, interest, dividends, certain insurance proceeds, pensions, scholarships, grants, prizes and lottery winnings, etc. This list is not exhaustive; consequently, any income derived by a resident individual not falling within the above categories is taxable, unless a tax exemption is available.
Most items of personal income are taxed on a gross basis, mainly through withholding at source, whereas business income and capital gains are taxed on a net basis subject to certain conditions.
There are no special taxation rules for expatriates.
## Personal income tax rates
Estonia has a proportional (i.e. flat) tax rate of 20%, which applies to all items of income derived by a resident taxpayer. From 2018 onwards, dividends that have been subject to the reduced rate of 14% at the level of the distributing Estonian company will have withholding tax (WHT) of 7% levied. Certain pension payments are subject to 10% income tax.
## Local income taxes
There are no local taxes on income.

## Taxable period
The period of taxation is a calendar year.
## Tax returns
In general, resident individuals must file an individual tax return by 30 April following the year in which the income arises. Electronic filing of tax returns becomes available from 15 February. Certain items of foreign-source tax-exempt income must be reported for information purposes.
Married resident taxpayers may elect between filing their tax returns jointly or separately.
For non-residents, the tax withheld at source at domestic or treaty rates generally constitutes final tax as regards their Estonian-source income, and the non-resident is generally not obligated to submit a tax return to the Estonian tax authorities for income so taxed. However, for certain types of Estonian-source income, non-residents are liable under Estonian domestic law to self-assess Estonian tax and submit a tax return to the Estonian tax authorities by the following deadlines:
## Payment of tax
A resident individual will receive an income tax assessment based on one’s return as filed at least 30 days before the tax payment is due and, based on that, must pay the final amount of income tax due by 1 October of the year following the period of taxation. The resident taxpayer who reported business income, foreign income, or capital gains in the tax return must pay the final amount of income tax due by 1 October of the year following the period of taxation.
Non-residents will not receive tax assessments. In general, non-residents must pay the income tax due to the tax authorities within three months from the deadline of submitting the tax return.
Late payment interest on tax arrears is 0.06% per day.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
Withholding agents must withhold CIT from certain payments. Withholding agents include resident legal entities, resident individuals registered as sole proprietorships or acting as employers, and non-residents having a PE or acting as employers in Estonia. The tax must be reported and paid by the tenth day of the month following the payment. CIT is not withheld from payments to resident companies, registered sole proprietorships, and registered PEs of non-resident companies. The following rules are in place with respect to payments that are subject to WHT:
For non-residents without a PE in Estonia, the tax withheld from these payments at domestic or treaty rates constitutes final tax in terms of their Estonian-source income, and they do not have any tax reporting requirements in Estonia.
For certain types of Estonian-source income, non-residents are liable under Estonian domestic law to self-assess their Estonian tax and submit a tax return to the Estonian tax authorities. These types of income include:
From 2019, Estonia has effective tax treaties with the territories listed in the table below. A treaty has been signed with Morocco, but this is not yet effective.
The following WHT rates apply to dividends, interest, and royalties paid to a recipient or beneficial owner resident in a tax treaty country. The lower of the domestic or the treaty rate is given.

Notes
1. Under the domestic law, the rate is nil for all non-resident corporate shareholders and 7% for non-resident individual shareholders if the dividend distribution has been taxed with the reduced CIT rate at the hands of the distributing company.
2. Under the domestic law, the rate is nil for all non-resident individual and corporate creditors.
3. The rate is nil for arm’s-length royalties paid to an associated EU or Swiss company if certain conditions are met.
4. The lower 5% rate applies to royalties paid for the use of industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment.
5. The lower 5% rate applies to royalties paid for the use of copyright royalties, excluding software royalties.
6. The lower 8% rate applies to royalties paid for the use of industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment.
7. The definition of royalties precludes fees paid for the use of equipment, and royalties are exempt from WHT in Estonia.

# Estonia
## Overview
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
Estonia is located in Northeastern Europe, bordered by the Baltic Sea to the west, the Gulf of Finland to the north, Latvia to the south, and Russia to the east. It is divided into 15 counties and 79 local municipalities, with Tallinn as its capital city. Estonian is the official language of Estonia, and the currency is the euro (EUR).
After centuries of German, Danish, Swedish, Polish, and Russian rule, Estonia attained independence in 1918. Incorporated into the USSR in 1940, an action never recognised by the United States, it regained its freedom in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Since all the occupational forces left in 1994, Estonia has been free to promote economic and political ties with Western Europe.
Estonia has a modern, market-based economy and one of the higher *per capita* income levels in Central Europe and the Baltic region. Estonia's successive governments have pursued a free market, pro-business economic agenda and have wavered little in their commitment to pro-market reforms. The current government has pursued relatively sound fiscal policies that have resulted in balanced budgets and low public debt. Estonia's priority has been to sustain high growth rates, which are, on average, 6% per year. The economy benefits from strong electronics and telecommunications sectors and strong trade ties with Finland, Sweden, and Germany.
Estonia joined both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU) in the spring of 2004. Estonia became the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) 34th member country on 9 December 2010. Estonia adopted the euro on 1 January 2011.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
Distributable profits are determined based on financial statements drawn up in accordance with Estonian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) or International Accounting Standards (IAS)/International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and there are no adjustments to accounting profits for tax purposes (e.g. tax depreciation, tax loss carryforward or carryback).
The CIT liability associated with the distribution of dividends is accounted for as an expense at the time the dividends are declared, regardless of when the profits were generated or distributed.
Dividends paid by Estonian companies are generally subject to 20/80 CIT at the level of the distributing company. However, dividends distributed by Estonian companies are exempt from CIT if the distributions are paid out of:
In addition, stock dividends (bonus shares) distributed to stockholders are exempt from 20/80 CIT charge.
Certain domestic and foreign taxes can also be credited against the 20/80 CIT charge under domestic law or tax treaties.
From 2018 onwards, a lower CIT at the rate of 14% for those companies making regular profit distributions is available. The payment of dividends in the amount that is below or equal to the extent of taxed dividends paid during the three preceding years (20%) will be taxed with a rate of 14% (the tax rate on the net amount being 14/86 instead of the regular 20/80). 2018 is the first year that is taken into account for determining the average dividend payment. In cases where the recipient of the 14% dividend is either a resident or non-resident individual, a 7% WHT rate will apply unless a tax treaty provides for a lower WHT rate (5% or 0%).

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
## Social security contributions
Employers operating in Estonia (including non-residents having a permanent establishment [PE] or employees in Estonia) must pay social tax on certain payments to individuals at the rate of 33% (whereof 20% is used for financing public pension insurance and 13% for financing public health insurance). Social tax paid by employers is not capped and mainly applies to salaries, directors’ fees, and service fees paid and fringe benefits granted to individuals. The period of taxation is a calendar month.
The net business income derived by individuals registered as sole proprietorships is also subject to 33% social tax (capped). Sole proprietorships are required to make quarterly advance payments of social tax in fixed amounts, which are credited against the final annual social tax liability.
## Unemployment insurance contributions
Employers are also required to pay and withhold unemployment insurance contributions. Employers must pay 0.8% and employees must pay 1.6% (collected by employers through payroll withholding). The contributions mainly apply to salaries and service fees paid to individuals.
## Compulsory accumulative pension scheme
Resident employees born after 31 December 1982 are obligated to join the compulsory accumulative pension scheme and make 2% contributions to the scheme (mostly collected by employers through payroll withholding). The contributions mainly apply to salaries, directors’ fees, and service fees. For resident employees born before 1983, joining the pension scheme is voluntary; however, after joining, it becomes compulsory and the employees may not subsequently leave the scheme. In addition to the 2% contribution made by the employee, 4% of the social security contribution payable by the employer (33%) will be transferred to the employee’s pension account.
Employees had an opportunity to increase the pension contributions from 2% to 3% (temporarily for the period 2014 to 2017) by submitting a respective application before 15 September 2013. Where the employee opted for the increased contributions, the contribution by the state was increased from 4% to 6% on account of the employee's personal pension account.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate is 22%. A reduced rate of 9% is applied to books, periodicals (with few exceptions), hotel accommodation services, and listed pharmaceuticals. A reduced rate of 5% is applied to certain periodicals both on physical medium and electronically.
The VAT rate on the export of goods and certain services is 0% (i.e. exempt with credit). Certain services, such as health care, education, insurance, certain financial, and transactions with securities, are exempt (i.e. exempt without credit).
## Land and property taxes
There is no property tax (i.e. tax on the value of buildings).
Property transfers are generally subject to state and notary fees.
## Local taxes
Local taxes can be imposed by rural municipalities or city councils; however, the fiscal significance of local taxes is almost non-existent. Local taxes include advertisement tax, road and street closure tax, motor vehicle tax, tax on keeping animals, entertainment tax, and parking charges.

# Estonia
## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
Estonia is regarded as offering a relatively favourable income tax regime, as all undistributed corporate profits are tax exempt. Estonia levies a corporate income tax (CIT) only on profits that are distributed as dividends, share buy-backs, capital reductions, liquidation proceeds, or deemed profit distributions. Distributed profits are generally subject to 20% corporate tax (20/80 on the net amount of the profit distribution).
Two significant amendments to the Income Tax Act entered into force on 1 January 2018.
Firstly, a new anti-tax avoidance clause was introduced, which obligates a resident company to pay income tax on a loan issued to a shareholder or a partner if the 'circumstances of the transaction indicate that it might be a hidden profit distribution'. If the due date of an outbound loan exceeds 48 months, then the Ministry of Finance assumes that certain loans issued to related parties may constitute hidden profit distributions, and, once the deadline is met, the burden to prove the opposite lies with the taxpayer. This amendment is applicable on qualifying loans granted onwards from 1 July 2017.
As a second amendment, from 2019 onwards, a lower CIT at the rate of 14% for those companies making regular profit distributions is available. The payment of dividends in the amount that is below or equal to the extent of taxed dividends paid during the three preceding years (20%) will be taxed with a rate of 14% (the tax rate on the net amount being 14/86 instead of the regular 20/80). In cases where the recipient of the 14% dividend is either a resident or non-resident individual, a 7% withholding tax (WHT) rate will apply unless a tax treaty provides for a lower WHT rate (5% or 0%).
From 1 January 2019, amendments based on the anti-tax avoidance rules from the European Union (EU) 2016/1164 Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD) were transposed into Estonian legislation. These amendments introduced controlled foreign company (CFC) rules, a new general anti-abuse rule (GAAR), and thin capitalisation rules in the form of taxation of 'exceeding borrowing costs'.
From 1 January 2020, a set of rules are added to the Income Tax Act to prevent double non-taxation (so-called 'hybrid mismatches'), which transpose the measures against hybrid mismatches from Directive 2017/952 into domestic legislation.
From 1 January 2025, the general CIT rate will rise to 22% and the existing lower rate of 14% will be abolished.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
A legal entity is considered resident in Estonia for tax purposes if it is established under Estonian law. There is no management and control test for the purpose of determining corporate residency. Most tax treaty tie-breakers for legal entities are based on competent authority procedures.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
A PE (including a branch registered in the Commercial Register) of a foreign entity is deemed to be a taxpayer. Under the domestic law, which deviates from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Tax Convention, a PE is defined as an enterprise through which the permanent business activities of the non-resident are conducted in Estonia. A PE is deemed to be created as a result of the business activities conducted in Estonia that are geographically linked or have movable character or as a result of the business activities of an agent that is authorised to conclude contracts in the name of the non-resident.

# Estonia
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
Distributable profits are determined based on financial statements drawn up in accordance with Estonian GAAP or IAS/IFRS, and there are no adjustments to accounting profits for tax purposes (e.g. tax depreciation, tax loss carryforward or carryback).
## Fringe benefits
Employers operating in Estonia (including non-resident companies that have a PE or employees in Estonia) are liable to Estonian taxation on any fringe benefits granted to their employees (including directors).
Fringe benefits are subject to an exceptional tax treatment in Estonia, as only the employer is obligated to pay taxes on the fringe benefits furnished to the employee. Taxable fringe benefits received by a resident employee are generally not included in the taxable income of the employee for Estonian tax purposes. Fringe benefits are subject to 20/80 CIT and 33% social tax. For example, where the amount of the benefit is EUR 100, the CIT due by the employer would be EUR 25 (20/80 x 100) and the social tax due EUR 41.25 (0.33 x 125), for a total fringe benefit tax charge of EUR 66.25.
Sports and health costs of an employee are to be exempted from income and social tax in the sum of up to EUR 100 per employee in one quarter. Previously, if the employer bore such costs without a respective obligation deriving from law, the costs were deemed fringe benefits.
## Gifts, donations, and representation expenses
The 20/80 CIT is generally due on gifts and donations. Gifts and donations made to certain qualifying recipients are only subject to 20/80 CIT if such expenses exceed one of two limitations:
Representation expenses, those expenditures whose character and primary purpose is for representational or entertainment related activities, are generally subject to 20/80 CIT only if they exceed the threshold of EUR 32 per month plus 2% of the calculated social tax base of the calendar month in which the expenses are paid.
## Taxes
All taxes paid are deductible for CIT purposes. In certain circumstances, domestic or foreign taxes may be creditable against the 20/80 CIT charge under domestic law or an applicable tax treaty.
## Other significant items
The 20/80 CIT is generally due on expenses and payments that do not have a business purpose and that are regarded as deemed profit distributions. These may include, for example, late payment interest on tax arrears, penalties imposed by law, bribes, purchase of services or settlement of obligations not related to the taxpayer’s business, and acquisition of assets not related to the taxpayer’s business.
Furthermore, there are specific anti-tax haven rules treating certain transactions and dealings with tax haven companies as deemed profit distributions, which are therefore subject to 20/80 CIT. These include the following:
From 2018, a new anti-tax avoidance clause entered into force, which obligates a resident company to pay income tax on a loan issued to a shareholder or a partner if the 'circumstances of the transaction indicate that it might be a hidden profit distribution'. If the due date of an outbound loan exceeds 48 months, then the Ministry of Finance assumes that certain loans issued to related parties may constitute hidden profit distributions, and, once the deadline is met, the burden to prove the opposite lies with the taxpayer. This amendment is applicable on qualifying loans granted onwards from 1 July 2017.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments to foreign affiliates are deductible for tax purposes (i.e. not subject to 20/80 CIT as deemed profit distributions) if the payment serves a business purpose, provides a benefit to the payer, is at arm’s length, and is substantiated by sufficient documentation.
Payments to foreign affiliates may also be subject to various WHTs. Certain payments to affiliates located in tax haven countries are always subject to 20/80 CIT or a 20% WHT rate.

# Estonia
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
There is no form of consolidation or group taxation for CIT purposes in Estonia.
## Transfer pricing
Transfer pricing rules are applicable to all types of transactions between related parties. Both domestic and cross-border transactions with related parties must be conducted at arm’s length. Estonian tax legislation includes a relatively broad definition of related parties. Under the present corporate tax system, if the transactions between related parties do not follow the arm’s-length principle, then the subsequent transfer pricing adjustments are treated as hidden profit distributions subject to 20/80 monthly CIT.
As a general rule, Estonian group companies and PEs of foreign companies are obligated to prepare transfer pricing documentation to prove the arm's-length nature of the inter-company transactions with all related parties.
However, this documentation requirement does not apply to small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) unless they have conducted transactions with entities located in low-tax territories. A company or PE is deemed to be an SME if the consolidated results of the previous financial year of an Estonian company or a PE, together with its associated enterprises or head office (i.e. at the group level), are below all of the following criteria:
Apart from the formal transfer pricing documentation and general requirement to disclose the transactions with the related parties in the annual reports, there are no additional reporting requirements related to transfer pricing in relation to inter-company transactions.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
In 2017, the Estonian Parliament approved a law that introduced a CbC reporting obligation for multinational enterprises with consolidated revenue of over EUR 750 million. The first reporting period was set for 2016 with the exception that subsidiaries operating in Estonia are obligated to submit the report for 2017 for the first time in case the parent company does not comply with the reporting obligation for 2016.
Estonian tax residents who are members of large multinational groups and are not the reporting entity of the CbC report need to notify the Estonian tax authorities about the group’s reporting entity. Once the notification has been submitted, there is no need to provide the information on annual basis, unless the reporting entity changes.
The deadline for the CbC report is on the 31st of December following the reporting period at the latest.
## Thin capitalisation
There are no thin capitalisation rules in the Estonian tax legislation. However, with transposing ATAD into domestic legislation, certain 'exceeding borrowing costs' will become taxable at the hands of the Estonian company. Based on the draft law, exceeding borrowing costs will be taxed if they exceed set thresholds. Generally, borrowing costs are interest expenses on all types of obligations, but also other costs that accompany borrowing (e.g. guarantee and arrangement fees). In order for the tax obligation to be triggered, the following conditions will have to be met**:**
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
CFC rules for companies will be introduced from 2019 onwards on the basis of ATAD.
A CFC is defined as any non-resident enterprise in which the resident company alone or together with its related parties holds more than 50% of the voting rights or capital, or is entitled to receive more than 50% of the profits. A foreign PE of an Estonian company is also considered to be a CFC.
In order for the tax obligation to be triggered, the following conditions will have to be met:
An exception allows the company to exclude from the scope of the provision a CFC that simultaneously meets the following two conditions:

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
Registered PEs of non-residents, much as with resident companies, are subject to CIT only in respect of profit distributions, both actual and deemed, as defined in domestic law.
Transactions and dealings between a head office and its PE(s) should be conducted on arm’s-length terms. Thus, such profits should be attributed to a PE of a non-resident taxpayer that the PE would be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate taxpayer engaged in the same or similar activities, and under the same or similar conditions, and dealing in a wholly independent manner with its head office.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives

There are no special tax incentives in Estonia. However, the entire Estonian corporate tax system, which provides for an indefinite deferral for taxing corporate profits, may be viewed as a tax incentive that promotes reinvestment of profits and thus stimulates economic growth.

## Exchange of information
Estonia has transposed the OECD Common Reporting Standard (CRS) as well as Council directive 2014/107/EU amending Directive 2011/16/EU as regards mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation into domestic law. Estonian financial institutions covered by the CRS must annually report certain income and asset information on certain non-resident account holders to the Estonian tax authorities.
The first exchange of information took place in 2017.
## Company restructurings
In accordance with the EC Directive 2009/133/EC on mergers, divisions, partial divisions, transfers of assets, and exchanges of shares concerning companies of different member states, the mergers, divisions, and re-organisations of companies are generally tax-neutral in Estonia. The principle of going concern is applied in taxation of referred restructuring transactions.

## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
## Foreign tax relief
Estonian-resident taxpayers who have received foreign-source taxable income are allowed to credit foreign income tax against their Estonian income tax liability if certain conditions are met. The tax credit is generally limited to 20% of foreign taxable income and is computed separately for each foreign country.
Resident taxpayers who receive from abroad more than 75% of their taxable income qualifying for the exemption method may apply deductions only in proportion to their taxable income received from Estonia. The restriction does not apply if the taxpayer voluntarily opts for the credit method to apply in respect of the foreign-sourced income.
## Tax treaties
## Totalisation agreements (social security agreements)
European Commission (EC) regulations 883/2004 and 987/2009 apply to EU member states, EEA countries, and Switzerland.
Estonia has effective social security agreements with Canada and Ukraine.

The minimum monthly tax allowance is raised to 654 euros (EUR) starting from 2023, but it is set to decrease as the gross income increases. Consequently, personal tax allowances will become progressive in nature, and, as a result, the net income of low- and medium-income earners will increase.
From 1 January 2025, the personal income tax (PIT) rate will rise to 22%.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
## Personal allowances and deductions
Starting from 1 January 2023, the system of personal allowances underwent a significant reform. Mainly, the minimum monthly basic personal allowance was increased to EUR 654, but it is set to decrease for income over certain levels, which results in a specific progressive personal allowance system.
Resident individuals are allowed to make certain deductions from their annual gross income. These include the basic personal allowance of EUR 7,848 (i.e. EUR 654 per month), which, from 2023, only applies to the full extent if annual income is up to EUR 14,400. For annual income over EUR 14,400, the yearly allowance is calculated under the following formula: 7,848 - 7,848 / 10,800 x (sum of income - 14,400). For annual income exceeding EUR 25,200, the basic allowance will be zero.
In addition, deductions are allowed for certain personal allowances, as well as certain deductible documented expenses, which fall into two categories.
The first category includes certain mandatory payments, which can be deducted without any limitations, including unemployment insurance contributions, contributions to compulsory accumulative pension scheme, and certain obligatory contributions to foreign social security schemes.
The second category includes deductions that are allowed for tax policy reasons and which have various limitations on deductibility. The second category includes certain educational expenses, certain gifts and donations, and certain payments to personal pension schemes.
As of 2016, a 20% deduction is available for income from renting out immovable property. 20% is an estimate of incurred expenses related to the property; these expenses do not have to be documented.
A non-resident individual of another European Union (EU) or European Economic Area (EEA) member state can make various deductions from one's income proportionally to the Estonian-source income share of their entire taxable income for the period of taxation.
## Business deductions
Business deductions can only be made from business income by individuals registered as sole proprietorships. For income tax purposes, sole proprietorships must follow cash basis accounting for their income and expenditure.
Sole proprietors have a right to open a special bank account where they can carry all their business income during the ten days after they have received it. The increase of the amount in that bank account is deducted from the taxable income of the sole proprietor and the decrease of the amount in the account is added to their taxable income.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
In general, individual taxpayers are taxed on a cash basis. Exceptionally, the Estonian controlled foreign company (CFC) (anti-deferral) rules attribute undistributed profits of foreign ’tax haven’ companies to resident individual taxpayers if such companies are controlled by Estonian residents.
## Employment income
Employment income is taxed on a gross basis and includes salaries, fees for personal services, and directors’ fees. In general, fringe benefits are only taxable at the employer level and are not included in the gross income of an employee.
For resident individuals, foreign-source employment income is exempt from Estonian income tax if the following two conditions are met:
Non-resident individuals are liable to Estonian income tax on Estonian-source employment income. This is deemed to arise if the location of performing personal services is in Estonia and the remuneration is paid by an Estonian employer (including non-residents acting as employers in Estonia and PEs of non-residents if the remuneration is paid out or borne by it) or if the individual has been present in Estonia for employment purposes for more than 182 days during any 12-month period. Directors’ fees paid for the work done for Estonian companies are always taxable in Estonia regardless of the residence of the payer of the fees.
## Capital gains and investment income
Capital gains from the sale or exchange of assets are generally taxed on a net basis as part of ordinary income, but capital losses can only be offset against capital gains. Certain qualifying capital gains are exempt from income tax, such as the gain from the sale of a personal residence.
Certain capital gains realised by non-residents form part of their Estonian-source income, for which they are liable for self-assessing 20% Estonian income tax and submitting a tax return to the Estonian tax authorities. Such types of income include:
Investment income is generally taxed on a gross basis as part of ordinary income. This may include, for example, certain foreign dividends, interest, and insurance proceeds. However, a tax-exempt investment account scheme is applicable for resident individuals, under which individuals can defer the moment of taxation of investment income and capital gains derived from qualified securities. Under certain conditions, individuals can reinvest such income or gains without paying any income tax.
In fear of an increase in payment of 'dividend salaries', the total corporate income tax (CIT) burden of a dividend is kept at approximately 20%. If a resident individual receives a dividend that has been taxed at 14%, then a 7% WHT rate applies. Foreign dividends are tax exempt provided that either the underlying profits out of which dividends are paid have been subject to foreign income tax or if income tax was withheld from dividends received.
If the recipient of a dividend that is taxed at 14% CIT is a non-resident individual, a 7% WHT rate will apply unless a tax treaty provides for a lower rate of WHT (5% or 0%).
## Rental and royalty income
Rents and royalties generated from the use of certain assets are generally taxed on a gross basis as part of ordinary income, unless the taxpayer elects for net basis taxation as part of business income.
For non-resident individuals, the gross amounts of rents and royalties are generally subject to WHT at source, at 20% and 10%, respectively.
## Exempt income
For resident individuals, there exist numerous items of tax-exempt income (i.e. excluded from gross income). *As described above*, some of the more important items of tax-exempt income include qualifying foreign employment income, qualifying foreign dividends, and certain qualifying capital gains.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
Individuals are considered residents of Estonia if they have a permanent residence in Estonia, their stay in Estonia during any 12-month period exceeds 183 days, or they are Estonian public servants who are sent abroad on assignment. An individual may be deemed to have become a tax resident from the date of one’s arrival to Estonia. For the purposes of determining the number of days, any part of a day counts as a full day.
The change of tax residence must be notified to the Tax and Customs Board.
