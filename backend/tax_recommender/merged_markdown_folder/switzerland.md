## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Social security contributions
If an individual is subject to the Swiss social security, the following social security contributions are payable (as of 1 January 2024):
| Insurance | Contribution rate | | Cap (CHF) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Employer (%) | Employee (%) |
| Old age, survivors’ and disability insurance | 5.3 | 5.3 | No cap |
| Unemployment Insurance | 1.1 | 1.1 | 148,200 |
| Family Compensation Fund | 1-3 | 0 | No cap |
| Occupational accident insurance | 0.17 to 3 | 0 | 148,200 |
| Non-occupational accident insurance | 0 | 1 to 4 | 148,200 |
| Occupational pension scheme | Depending on pension plan, employer specific | Depending on pension plan, employer specific |  |
| Medical insurance |  | Depending on coverage, private insurance |  |
All social security taxes (except for the medical insurance) are the employer’s responsibility. The employer must withhold and remit the total deduction and deducts the employee’s share from his gross pay. If the individual is self-employed, they basically have to cover the employer’s and the employee’s share, however different contribution rates may be applicable.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
As a matter of principle, proceeds of sales made and services provided in Switzerland are subject to VAT at the standard rate of 8.1%. Goods for basic needs are subject to VAT at the reduced rate of 2.6%. Furthermore, services in connection with the provision of lodging are subject to VAT at the special rate of 3.8%. A registered taxpayer generally is entitled to offset the amount of VAT charged by suppliers or paid on imports against the VAT payable.
## Net wealth tax
All cantons levy a net wealth tax based on the balance of the worldwide gross assets minus debts. Some cantons may allow additional social deductions. Reportable assets are as follows:
The fair market value of the assets is subject to taxation; consequently, some assets are subject to depreciation, which is considered for wealth tax purposes but cannot be claimed as a deduction for income tax purposes. Leased assets are not considered for wealth taxation. Movable assets are deemed to be located in Switzerland and therefore subject to wealth taxation in Switzerland. Properties abroad are only considered for tax rate determining purposes but are exempted from actual taxation in Switzerland.
Worldwide debts (e.g. mortgages or other loans) are deductible with no applicable cap. If assets are located abroad, the total debts are subject to an international allocation in accordance with the allocation of the total gross assets.
Household goods are not subject to wealth taxation.
### Zurich
#### I - Single taxpayers (wealth taxes)
| Taxable wealth (CHF) | | Basic tax on column 1 (CHF) | Percentage on excess (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 80,000 | - | 0.00 |

| 2,309,000 | 3,262,000 | 3,384 | 0.25 |
| 3,262,000 |  | 5,767 | 0.30 |
#### II - Married taxpayers and single taxpayers with minor children (wealth taxes)
| Taxable wealth (CHF) | | Basic tax on column 1 (CHF) | Percentage on excess (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 159,000 | - | 0.00 |
| 159,000 | 398,000 | - | 0.05 |
| 398,000 | 795,000 | 120 | 0.10 |
| 795,000 | 1,432,000 | 517 | 0.15 |
| 1,432,000 | 2,387,000 | 1,473 | 0.20 |
| 2,387,000 | 3,342,000 | 3,383 | 0.25 |
| 3,342,000 |  | 5,771 | 0.30 |
For Zurich cantonal taxes, the above rates can be applied directly. For the additional municipal taxes, the above rate has to be multiplied by the respective municipal tax factor, which varies between 0.72 and 1.30 (City of Zurich: 1.19). For church tax the basic tax above is multiplied by the church tax factor, which is between 0.06 and 0.17.
### Geneva
On 18 June 2023, the Geneva citizens voted in favour of the modification of the law on real estate fiscal valuation, which will not only impact owners of real estate properties in the canton, but all Geneva domiciled persons liable to wealth tax. While the law was meant to enter into force in 2024, an appeal has been filed against this law. The modifications to the law would introduce new principles for the fiscal valuation of some real estate properties in the canton, generally leading to an increase in wealth tax for real estate owners. In parallel, the special property tax rate for principal residences would decrease from 0.1% to 0.02%, and the global wealth tax rate would generally decrease in the canton for all taxpayers. Additionally, the sale of real estate properties following a holding period longer than 25 years would no longer be exempt from real estate capital gain tax (minimum taxation of 2% is introduced). By dint of a referendum approved by the people in November 2024, a reduction in taxation of between 11.4% and 5.3% (depending on taxable income) will occur from 1st January 2025.
#### I - Wealth tax
A deduction of CHF 82,200 per adult and CHF 41,100 per child is made from the individual’s net wealth. The net wealth is divided into bands and is taxed as follows for 2025:
| Taxable wealth (CHF) | | Tax rate applicableto the band (%) | Maximum tax for the band(CHF) | Total tax (CHF) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |

| 3,331,758 |  | 0.1475 | - | - |
The above tax rates are basically applicable to taxpayers filing a tax return. Effective cantonal income and wealth tax is determined by multiplying the basic tax by the multiplier applicable for the tax (calendar) year in question, and then by adding the supplementary tax on wealth.
## Inheritance and gift taxes
With the exception of two cantons (i.e. Schwyz and Obwalden), all cantons levy inheritance and/or gift taxes if the deceased or donor had been resident of the respective canton, or if real estate located in the canton is transferred. In all cantons, spouses are exempt from inheritance and gift taxes, and most cantons also exempt direct descendants. The tax rate is progressive and is in most cases multiplied by a factor depending on the relationship between the deceased and the recipient. Switzerland has concluded a small number of tax treaties concerning inheritance taxes, but gift taxes are not covered by any tax treaty.
## Property taxes
Some cantons levy a tax just on the holding of real estate. The tax rates and how this tax is calculated vary from canton to canton.
## Excise taxes, turnover taxes, registration taxes, custom duties
At the federal level, the import of goods will be subject to custom duties based on weight and/or value and depending on the type of good as well as its origin.
In addition, the cantons and municipalities levy a number of excise taxes, such as road taxes, registration taxes, fire brigade taxes etc. These are usually smaller amounts and vary often by municipality.
## Other non-income taxes
### Stamp taxes
Stamp duties are levied on certain transactions i.e. on the issue of Swiss securities, on security transactions in Switzerland, and on certain insurance (mainly liability and household insurance). The stamp taxes are levied by the broker or the insurance company and are in the end paid by the client. Rates are 0.15% for Swiss security transaction, 0.30% for foreign security transactions and normally 5% for insurance.
### Transfer taxes
The transfer of real estate is taxed in most cantons. This tax is levied separately from a possible capital gains tax on the sale of the real estate. There is no corresponding tax at the federal level.
### Treatment of foreign owned real estate
Real estate located abroad needs to be included in the Swiss tax return for tax rate determining purposes, but any income out of it (actual or deemed rental income) will not actually be taxed in Switzerland.
### Church tax
Almost all cantons levy a church tax for registered members of one of the respective official religious affiliations. The determination of the religious affiliation is part of registration process with the municipal authorities. Individuals without religious denomination or members of other than the official Swiss churches (e.g. Muslims, Jews, Anglo-Saxon church members) are not subject to cantonal church tax.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
This section shall provide a general overview and an indication of the residual WHT on outbound payments from Switzerland. There might be certain exceptions or further reductions available in the DTT, which, for the sake of clarity, are not reflected in the table below. Accordingly, the table below does not replace a thorough assessment of a specific case based on the applicable DTT in force.
The statutory rate of Swiss WHT is 35%. Relief, if any, is generally granted by refund. With respect to dividends between qualifying related companies, a mere notification/reporting procedure may be requested for the fraction of the Swiss WHT exceeding the residual WHT (which is 0% in many cases). Starting 1 January 2023, newly issued notification certificates are valid for five years (previously limited to three years). The table further below shows the residual/remaining tax for the recipient. Credit for the unrelieved portion of Swiss WHT may be available in the country of the recipient.
In Switzerland, there is no WHT on interest deriving from regular loan agreements. Swiss WHT of 35% is only levied on interest paid by banking institutions (or paid by entities tax-wise qualified as 'banking institutions') to non-banks, interest on bonds, and interest on bond-like loans. The residual rates in the table below show the standard treaty rates and do not reflect further reliefs available in certain DTTs (e.g. on traded bonds or other traded securities).
With respect to royalties, Switzerland does not levy WHT.
Many of the DTTs concluded between Switzerland and other jurisdictions contain a full relief if dividends or interest is paid to governments (including political subdivisions and other governmental institutions), central banks, or pension funds.
Note that in the DTTs concluded between Switzerland and other jurisdictions, the reduced WHT for substantial holdings usually is only available if the recipient of the dividend is a corporate body (e.g. not taxed as a partnership).
Interest paid on contingent convertible bonds (CoCos) and on write-off bonds (bonds with claim waiver) of systematically important banks is exempt from Swiss WHT. The WHT exemption is restricted to bonds issued by the respective institutions between 2013 and 2026. Additionally, interest of certain bail-in bonds issued by the respective institutions between 2017 and 2026 is not subject to WHT. These bonds must, furthermore, fulfil specific criteria in order to benefit from the WHT exemption. During its meeting on 21 August 2024, the Federal Council approved a temporary extension of the special rules on WHT for too-big-to-fail (TBTF) instruments to 31 December 2031. The effective implementation into the law is to be monitored.
## Capital contribution principle
The capital contribution principle allows the repayment of qualifying shareholders’ capital contributions without deduction of Swiss WHT at the level of the distributing company and without income tax implications at the level of Swiss individual shareholders (holding the shares as private wealth). In general, the capital contribution principle applies for premiums, additional paid-in capital, and contributions into the reserves of a company without increasing the nominal share capital.
It should be noted that since 1 January 2020 there have been restrictions to the amount that a company listed at the Swiss stock exchange may distribute as capital contribution reserves. There are no restrictions for any other companies.

\* Switzerland and the European Union (EU) signed an Agreement regarding the Introduction of the Global Automatic Exchange of Information Standard on 27 May 2015, applicable as of 1 January 2017. The Agreement signed is a protocol of amendment that replaces the Savings Agreement between Switzerland and the European Union, which has applied since 1 July 2005. Article 9 of the Automatic Exchange of Information Agreement (AEOI) provides the same benefits as the former Savings Agreement, as follows:
Upon request, Swiss WHT on dividends paid by a Swiss subsidiary company to its EU parent company may be reduced to 0% (reduction at source) and is only subject to a notification/reporting procedure, provided the following key conditions are cumulatively met:
Upon request, WHT on interest and royalty payments made between associated companies or their PE resident, respectively situated in Switzerland and the European Union, may be reduced to 0% (reduction at source) in the source state, provided the following key conditions are cumulatively met:
The application of the Bilateral Agreement is subject to foreign and Swiss misuse conditions.
DTTs between Switzerland and EU countries with more favourable tax treatment of dividend, interest, and royalty payments remain unaffected.
Notes
1. There is no Swiss WHT on royalties, licences, and similar fees payable by Swiss individuals or corporations (provided that the dealing at arm’s-length principle is met).
2. The statutory Swiss WHT rate of 35% is levied but refunded, provided that the respective earnings are declared as income for tax purposes.
3. Between Swiss group companies, Swiss WHT of 35% is usually fully refundable. Furthermore, in many cases, the tax liability can be met by the notification/reporting procedure. For this purpose, a direct investment of at least 20% in the share capital of the payer of the dividend is required.
4. 20% minimal shareholding plus foreign investment of at least 200,000 United States dollars (USD).
5. Only applicable if holding period is at least 12 months.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
The statutory accounts of a Swiss company (or in the case of a non-resident company, the branch accounts) serve as the basis for determining taxable income. There are generally very few differences between statutory profit and taxable profit apart from the participation relief for dividend income and capital gains (*see below*), adjustments required by the tax law, and the usage of existing tax loss carry forwards (*see Net operating losses in the [Deductions](switzerland/corporate/deductions.html) section*).
## Inventory valuation
Swiss CIT treatment does, in principle, follow underlying Swiss statutory accounting treatment. Inventory valuation is therefore determined according to the accounting rules of the Swiss code of obligations. As the Swiss code of obligations and hence the Swiss accounting rules favour the prudence principle, a valuation allowance is allowed to be recorded on the inventory in excess of the actual devaluation of the inventory due to a lower market value (*see Obsolete inventory provision in the [Deductions](switzerland/corporate/deductions.html) section*). Such valuation allowance is accepted for tax purposes in an amount up to a maximum of one-third of the inventory’s acquisition costs or its production costs, respectively its lower market value.
Accordingly, the maximum inventory value represents the inventory’s acquisition costs or its production costs. In case these costs exceed the inventory’s market value at the balance sheet date, the latter lower market value must be applied. In order to determine the inventory’s acquisition or production costs, various methods exist.
It is at the corporate taxpayer’s discretion to determine which method shall apply (e.g. weighted average method, first in first out [FIFO], last in first out [LIFO], highest in first out [HIFO]).
## Participation relief
Participation relief is the term generally used for the tax relief on qualifying dividend income and capital gains from the disposal of a subsidiary. Participation relief is not an outright tax exemption, but rather a tax abatement mechanism. It is therefore also commonly referred to as 'participation deduction' or ‘participation exemption’.
Participation relief is a percentage deduction from CIT that is equal to net participation income divided by taxable income. Net participation income consists of the gross participation income from qualifying dividends and (usually) qualifying capital gains less related administration and financing costs and any depreciation of the participation that is linked to the dividend distribution. In most cases, the participation relief results in a full exemption of participation income from CIT, or to an exemption close thereto. Note that the participation relief may be diluted in certain cases (e.g. if tax loss carry forwards are offset).
The participation relief on dividend income is mandatory at the federal CIT as well as at the cantonal/communal levels. The participation relief on capital gains is voluntary for cantonal/communal tax purposes, but nonetheless implemented by all cantons.
### Dividend income
Dividends qualifying for participation relief are those from participations representing at least 10% of the share capital or 10% of profits and reserves of another company and/or those having a market value of at least CHF 1 million. Note that there is neither a minimum holding period nor a requirement that the dividend paying subsidiary is liable to CIT in its jurisdiction of residence.
### Capital gains
Capital gains derived from the disposal of a qualifying participation are generally entitled to participation relief if the following conditions are cumulatively met:
It is noteworthy that capital gains are only entitled to participation relief to the extent the sales price exceeds the original investment costs (commonly also referred to as 'acquisition costs') of the participation, whereas the so-called 'recaptured depreciation' (i.e. the amount of former depreciations) is taxable.
## Interest income
Interest income earned is taxable income. It is of no relevance whether the payment of the interest was made by a related party (affiliated company or shareholder) or by a third party (*see Interest expense in the [Deductions](switzerland/corporate/deductions.html) section*).
## Royalty income
Royalty income represents taxable income. It is generally subject to ordinary CIT at federal, cantonal, and communal levels.
With the Swiss tax reform, a patent box was introduced at cantonal and communal levels on 1 January 2020. It reduces CIT on license income from qualifying patents (i.e. reduced taxation of income realised from patents) upon request. There is further the option for cantons to introduce an R&D super deduction.
## Foreign exchange gains
Realised foreign exchange gains in relation to a transaction (transaction gains) are included in the tax basis of a corporation as taxable. Realised and, as a result of the prudence principle of the Swiss accounting rules, unrealised transactional foreign exchange losses are tax deductible. Based on a federal court decision in 2009, foreign exchange gains (or losses) resulting from the translation of financial statements in a foreign (functional) currency to Swiss franc (presentation currency) are not taxable (respectively tax deductible).
## Foreign income
Swiss tax resident corporations are basically taxed on their worldwide income. However, income attributable to a foreign PE (i.e. a PE outside of Switzerland) is not taxed in Switzerland. Such income may only be taken into account to determine the applicable tax rate, in case progressive tax rates apply. The same rule applies for income from real estate property situated abroad.
Dividends, interest, and royalties from Swiss or foreign sources are included in taxable income. However, in certain cantons, special methods of assessment may apply for dividend and other income originating outside Switzerland. For dividend income, a relief generally is available for CIT purposes at the federal, cantonal, and communal levels (*see Participation relief above*). The irrecoverable portion of foreign WHT of most treaty countries can be credited against the related Swiss CIT on the same income. Foreign WHT of non-treaty countries generally is not creditable but is deductible for CIT purposes.

# Switzerland
## Overview
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
Switzerland is located in the heart of Europe between the Alps and the Jura mountains, where it is bordered by Germany to the north, France to the west, Italy to the south, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Because of this central location, Switzerland offers a great variety in cultures and languages. The capital of Switzerland is Bern, and the official currency is the Swiss franc (CHF). The official languages of Switzerland are German, French, Italian, and Rhaeto-Romanic. Its liberal economic system, political stability, and its close integration with the economies of other countries make it an attractive business location.
Switzerland has a federalist structure and is divided into three political levels: the federal, the cantonal, and the municipal level (also referred to as communal level). The country consists of 26 cantons, which are sovereign insofar as their sovereignty is not limited by the federal constitution. The Federal Assembly, also called parliament, consists of two chambers: The National Council, which represents the 'sovereigns' (the Swiss people), and the Council of States, which represents the 26 cantons. The federal government is known as the Federal Council. It consists of seven members (the heads of respective departments) and operates as a collegial body.
In 1961, Switzerland signed the Convention on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Since 2002, Switzerland has been a member of the United Nations (UN), which has its office in Geneva, and it also plays an important role in UN's specialised and important economic organisations. Further, since 1960, Switzerland has been a member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Switzerland, however, is not a member of the European Union (EU).
Switzerland is a prosperous, modern, and liberal market economy with low unemployment, a highly skilled labour force, and a *per capita* gross domestic product (GDP) that is among the highest in the world. Switzerland's economy benefits from a highly developed service sector, led by financial services; a strong manufacturing industry that specialises in high-technology and knowledge-based production; and a well-established pharmaceutical and chemical industry. In recent years, Switzerland brought its economic practices largely into conformity with the European Union in order to enhance its international competitiveness. In 2009, Switzerland agreed to conform to OECD regulations on administrative assistance in tax matters, including tax evasion. In 2019, the Multinational Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS), the so-called Multilateral Instrument (MLI), entered into force in Switzerland.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
As a matter of principle, proceeds of sales made and services provided in Switzerland are subject to VAT at the standard rate of 8.1%. Goods for basic needs are subject to VAT at the reduced rate of 2.6%. Furthermore, services in connection with the provision of lodging (accommodation) are subject to VAT at the special rate of 3.8%.
Any person, regardless of legal form, objects, and intention to make a profit, is liable to VAT if that person carries on a business and is not exempt from the tax liability. A person carries on a business if the person independently performs a professional or commercial activity with the aim of sustainably earning income from supplies and acts externally under the person's own name. Taxable persons must register with the Swiss Federal Tax Administration of their own accord in writing within certain deadlines. A registered taxpayer generally is entitled (in the course of its business activity) to offset the amount of VAT charged by suppliers or paid on imports against the VAT payable.
The tax liability of foreign companies that supply goods to Switzerland is calculated on their worldwide turnover. Accordingly, if a company generates less than 100,000 Swiss francs (CHF) from the supply of goods to Switzerland, but at least CHF 100,000 in turnover globally, it is liable for VAT in Switzerland from its first Swiss franc of turnover.
Since 1 January 2019, foreign-based mail-order companies are liable for VAT in Switzerland if they generate at least CHF 100,000 annual turnover from small consignments to Switzerland. Such foreign-based mail-order companies are equated with the Swiss companies for VAT purposes.
The VAT rates are dependent on the goods sold or the services provided. Some supplies are exempt from tax without credit (e.g. hospital treatment, cultural services, insurance and reinsurance turnovers, specific turnovers in the field of money and capital transactions), and some supplies are fully exempt from tax (e.g. supply of goods that are transported or dispatched directly abroad / export). The difference relates to the fact that input VAT related to supplies exempt from tax without credit cannot be deducted, whereas supplies exempt from tax are fully eligible for input VAT deduction.
The Federal Council implemented the partial revision of the Value Added Tax Act (VAT Act) in August 2024, which was passed by Parliament in June 2023, and will enter into effect on 1 January 2025. At the same time, the partially revised Value Added Tax Ordinance (VAT Ordinance) will enter into effect as well. An exception is the portal obligation for the areas of net tax rate as well as flat tax rate method, group taxation, and deregistration as a taxable person, which will not be introduced until 1 January 2027. The partially revised VAT Ordinance includes both the implementing provisions for the amended VAT Act and independent adjustments, particularly concerning the net tax and flat tax rate method as well as portal obligations.
Additionally, the amendment to the VAT Ordinance at the level of net tax rates will also enter into effect on 1 January 2025. The review of net tax rates, conducted every seven years, has resulted in tax rate adjustments for approximately 15% of industries and activities.
One of the important elements of the partial revision of the VAT Act is the introduction of platform taxation. Starting 1 January 2025, a ‘deemed supplier concept’ will be introduced for sales of goods conducted through online platforms, thus, the obligation to register for VAT will shift from the supplier to the platform. From a VAT perspective, there are not just one but two deliveries: a first supply of goods is assumed to be between the seller and the platform operator. A second supply of goods is assumed to be between the platform operator and the Swiss customer; thus, the platform has to charge, declare, collect and remit the VAT on the supplies of goods to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration (SFTA).
Furthermore, an obligation to provide information is introduced for all online platforms (i.e. upon request by the SFTA, they must provide information on suppliers offering supplies via the platform to an extent that could trigger VAT liability. To enforce the new rules, the SFTA can take administrative measures if mail order platforms or companies have wrongfully failed to register or if they do not meet their billing and payment obligations. The SFTA can impose an import ban on deliveries from the company in question and as a last resort, order the destruction of the items. In addition, the SFTA can publish the names of the companies against which such measures are applied in order to protect customers.
Currently, VAT can be settled quarterly, half-yearly or monthly. As of 1 January 2025 SMEs can also voluntarily settle VAT annually (i.e. submitting an annual VAT return), making the settlement process more efficient. This option is only available to VAT-liable persons who generate an annual turnover of a maximum of CHF 5,005,000. Annual settlement is linked to the obligation to pay instalments. The instalments are set by the SFTA, usually based on the tax claim from the last tax period.
The SFTA has the option to waive the requirement for appointing a tax representative, if the fulfillment of procedural obligations is ensured in another way (according to the draft practice publications, this is option is only foreseen for online platforms). Platform operators can confirm in writing to the SFTA that they meet the conditions set by the SFTA. In the event of an inspection by the SFTA or the initiation of administrative or criminal proceedings by the SFTA, the platform operator must provide a domestic correspondence address.
It is not yet clear how often the SFTA will actually waive this requirement. Also, it is not yet clear how the SFTA will determine when a tax representative is still required (e.g. when registering a foreign entity for Swiss VAT).
Newly exempt from VAT (without credit) as of 1 January 2025 are:
As of 1 January 2025, the SFTA can demand a security from individuals responsible for a legal entity (i.e., members of the board etc.) if there is a range of indications that their conduct could endanger taxes, interest and costs (procedural and enforcement costs). It aims at members of executive bodies who deliberately cause serial bankruptcies by robbing companies of their assets and, for example, transferring them to straw men who bring about liquidation. It must be clear from the totality of the circumstances that there is non-compliant behaviour that could give rise to criminal prosecution.
The acquisition tax (reverse charge mechanism) will apply when trading/transferring emission rights, certificates for reducing emissions, proof of electricity sources, and similar documents as of 1 January 2025. Sales to domestic companies will be subject to acquisition tax, even if the seller is VAT-registered in Switzerland or Liechtenstein. This measure addresses VAT fraud risks in the transfer of such rights and certificates.
According to the new provision of the VAT Act, a subsidy always exists if a public authority expressly describes the funds as a subsidy or other public-law contribution (legal fiction).
The VAT ordinance clarifies that public authorities can classify funds as subsidy or other public contribution until the finalization deadline for the tax period in which the payment was made.
## Customs duties
All goods arriving in Switzerland from abroad are generally subject to customs duty and import VAT. The customs duty is calculated on the gross weight of imported goods, where category-specific weight rates apply. Products like alcoholic drinks, tobacco products, food, and textiles are typical categories of higher duty rates. Furthermore, imported goods are subject to import VAT of generally 8.1%. A reduced rate of 2.6% applies on certain goods (e.g. food, non-alcoholic beverages, books, magazines, pharmaceutical products).
## Excise taxes
In Switzerland, various excise taxes are levied. To name a few, the following excise taxes are levied at the federal level:
## Property taxes
With regard to the ownership and the transfer of real estate property in Switzerland, property taxes may apply. Depending on the location of the real estate property, ownership-related property taxes are levied at the cantonal and/or communal levels or do not exist at all.
In case of the sale of real estate property, real estate transfer tax and taxes on the capital gain may apply.
At the federal level, capital gain realised on the sale of real estate property is subject to ordinary CIT. At the cantonal and communal levels, depending on the canton concerned, capital gain realised is either subject to the ordinary CIT (dualistic method) or subject to a special real estate capital gain tax (monistic method).
## Securities transfer tax
Swiss securities transfer tax (often known as 'securities turnover tax' or 'transfer stamp tax') is levied on the transfer of Swiss or foreign securities, in which Swiss security dealers participate as contracting parties or as intermediaries. The ordinary tax rate of Swiss securities transfer tax is 0.15% for securities issued by a tax resident of Switzerland and 0.3% for securities issued by a tax resident of a foreign country.
Swiss security dealers are defined as any person professionally engaged in buying or selling of securities for one's own account or for another person, including Swiss banks and other Swiss bank-like institutions. The definition also includes companies holding taxable securities whose book value exceeds CHF 10 million and remote members of a Swiss stock exchange.
Taxable securities include, but are not limited to, shares and bonds. Options and many other derivative instruments are not subject to Swiss securities transfer tax. However, the exercise of such financial instruments or derivatives may result in a taxable transfer of a security.
Various transactions are exempt from the Swiss securities transfer tax. Generally, no Swiss securities transfer tax is levied in the case of a merger or a reorganisation in which a Swiss security dealer is involved, and taxable securities (including participation) are transferred. Furthermore, the like-kind exchange of a participation by a Swiss security dealer is also exempt from the Swiss securities transfer tax. This is particularly important for holding companies, which may qualify as Swiss security dealers.
## Issuance stamp tax
Issuance stamp tax (often known as ‘capital duty’) on equity contributions to Swiss corporations is levied at the rate of 1% on the fair market value of the contribution. An exemption on the first CHF 1 million of equity in exchange for ownership rights applies, whether made in an initial or subsequent contribution.
A multitude of transactions qualify for an issuance stamp tax exemption. In particular, special tax provisions allow for most reorganisations to take place on a tax neutral basis. In addition, an existing non-resident company may generally redomicile to Switzerland without incurring Swiss issuance stamp tax. However, if the company was formed abroad and re-domiciled to Switzerland exclusively or mainly in order to avoid Swiss stamp taxes, issuance stamp tax may apply.
The issuance of Swiss bonds and money market instruments is not subject to Swiss issuance stamp tax.
In addition, the conversion of certain contingent convertible bonds (CoCos) into equity will also not trigger Swiss issuance stamp tax on the newly created equity. In more detail, this relief applies to CoCos according to the Swiss banking law only; other convertible bonds will still trigger Swiss issuance stamp tax if converted into equity.
## Capital tax
Corporate capital tax is only levied at the cantonal and the communal levels (not at the federal level). It is based on a corporation’s equity (i.e. the taxable equity corresponds to the sum of nominal capital, paid in surplus, retained earnings, other equity reserves, and, according to Swiss thin capitalisation rules, potentially existing deemed or hidden equity). The ordinary capital tax rates vary between 0.001% and 0.5%, depending on the company’s location of corporate residence in Switzerland. The Federal Act on the Harmonisation of Direct Taxation at Cantonal and Communal Levels allows the cantons to introduce an adaptation of the capital tax base for participations, patents, and loans to group companies.
The cantons are further allowed to foresee in their tax law that CIT is creditable against a corporation’s capital tax. By now, many cantons have introduced such a credit mechanism.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Social security contributions
If an individual is subject to the Swiss social security, the following social security contributions are payable (as of 1 January 2024):
| Insurance | Contribution rate | | Cap (CHF) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Employer (%) | Employee (%) |
| Old age, survivors’ and disability insurance | 5.3 | 5.3 | No cap |
| Unemployment Insurance | 1.1 | 1.1 | 148,200 |
| Family Compensation Fund | 1-3 | 0 | No cap |
| Occupational accident insurance | 0.17 to 3 | 0 | 148,200 |
| Non-occupational accident insurance | 0 | 1 to 4 | 148,200 |
| Occupational pension scheme | Depending on pension plan, employer specific | Depending on pension plan, employer specific |  |
| Medical insurance |  | Depending on coverage, private insurance |  |
All social security taxes (except for the medical insurance) are the employer’s responsibility. The employer must withhold and remit the total deduction and deducts the employee’s share from his gross pay. If the individual is self-employed, they basically have to cover the employer’s and the employee’s share, however different contribution rates may be applicable.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
As a matter of principle, proceeds of sales made and services provided in Switzerland are subject to VAT at the standard rate of 8.1%. Goods for basic needs are subject to VAT at the reduced rate of 2.6%. Furthermore, services in connection with the provision of lodging are subject to VAT at the special rate of 3.8%. A registered taxpayer generally is entitled to offset the amount of VAT charged by suppliers or paid on imports against the VAT payable.
## Net wealth tax
All cantons levy a net wealth tax based on the balance of the worldwide gross assets minus debts. Some cantons may allow additional social deductions. Reportable assets are as follows:
The fair market value of the assets is subject to taxation; consequently, some assets are subject to depreciation, which is considered for wealth tax purposes but cannot be claimed as a deduction for income tax purposes. Leased assets are not considered for wealth taxation. Movable assets are deemed to be located in Switzerland and therefore subject to wealth taxation in Switzerland. Properties abroad are only considered for tax rate determining purposes but are exempted from actual taxation in Switzerland.
Worldwide debts (e.g. mortgages or other loans) are deductible with no applicable cap. If assets are located abroad, the total debts are subject to an international allocation in accordance with the allocation of the total gross assets.
Household goods are not subject to wealth taxation.
### Zurich
#### I - Single taxpayers (wealth taxes)
| Taxable wealth (CHF) | | Basic tax on column 1 (CHF) | Percentage on excess (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

#### II - Married taxpayers and single taxpayers with minor children (wealth taxes)
| Taxable wealth (CHF) | | Basic tax on column 1 (CHF) | Percentage on excess (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 159,000 | - | 0.00 |

| 3,342,000 |  | 5,771 | 0.30 |
For Zurich cantonal taxes, the above rates can be applied directly. For the additional municipal taxes, the above rate has to be multiplied by the respective municipal tax factor, which varies between 0.72 and 1.30 (City of Zurich: 1.19). For church tax the basic tax above is multiplied by the church tax factor, which is between 0.06 and 0.17.
### Geneva
On 18 June 2023, the Geneva citizens voted in favour of the modification of the law on real estate fiscal valuation, which will not only impact owners of real estate properties in the canton, but all Geneva domiciled persons liable to wealth tax. While the law was meant to enter into force in 2024, an appeal has been filed against this law. The modifications to the law would introduce new principles for the fiscal valuation of some real estate properties in the canton, generally leading to an increase in wealth tax for real estate owners. In parallel, the special property tax rate for principal residences would decrease from 0.1% to 0.02%, and the global wealth tax rate would generally decrease in the canton for all taxpayers. Additionally, the sale of real estate properties following a holding period longer than 25 years would no longer be exempt from real estate capital gain tax (minimum taxation of 2% is introduced). By dint of a referendum approved by the people in November 2024, a reduction in taxation of between 11.4% and 5.3% (depending on taxable income) will occur from 1st January 2025.
#### I - Wealth tax
A deduction of CHF 82,200 per adult and CHF 41,100 per child is made from the individual’s net wealth. The net wealth is divided into bands and is taxed as follows for 2025:
| Taxable wealth (CHF) | | Tax rate applicableto the band (%) | Maximum tax for the band(CHF) | Total tax (CHF) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 111,059 | 0.149 | 165.50 | 165.50 |
| 111,059 | 222,117 | 0.191 | 212.10 | 377.60 |
| 222,117 | 333,176 | 0.234 | 2599.90 | 637.50 |

| 3,331,758 |  | 0.1475 | - | - |
The above tax rates are basically applicable to taxpayers filing a tax return. Effective cantonal income and wealth tax is determined by multiplying the basic tax by the multiplier applicable for the tax (calendar) year in question, and then by adding the supplementary tax on wealth.
## Inheritance and gift taxes
With the exception of two cantons (i.e. Schwyz and Obwalden), all cantons levy inheritance and/or gift taxes if the deceased or donor had been resident of the respective canton, or if real estate located in the canton is transferred. In all cantons, spouses are exempt from inheritance and gift taxes, and most cantons also exempt direct descendants. The tax rate is progressive and is in most cases multiplied by a factor depending on the relationship between the deceased and the recipient. Switzerland has concluded a small number of tax treaties concerning inheritance taxes, but gift taxes are not covered by any tax treaty.
## Property taxes
Some cantons levy a tax just on the holding of real estate. The tax rates and how this tax is calculated vary from canton to canton.
## Excise taxes, turnover taxes, registration taxes, custom duties
At the federal level, the import of goods will be subject to custom duties based on weight and/or value and depending on the type of good as well as its origin.
In addition, the cantons and municipalities levy a number of excise taxes, such as road taxes, registration taxes, fire brigade taxes etc. These are usually smaller amounts and vary often by municipality.
## Other non-income taxes
### Stamp taxes
Stamp duties are levied on certain transactions i.e. on the issue of Swiss securities, on security transactions in Switzerland, and on certain insurance (mainly liability and household insurance). The stamp taxes are levied by the broker or the insurance company and are in the end paid by the client. Rates are 0.15% for Swiss security transaction, 0.30% for foreign security transactions and normally 5% for insurance.
### Transfer taxes
The transfer of real estate is taxed in most cantons. This tax is levied separately from a possible capital gains tax on the sale of the real estate. There is no corresponding tax at the federal level.
### Treatment of foreign owned real estate
Real estate located abroad needs to be included in the Swiss tax return for tax rate determining purposes, but any income out of it (actual or deemed rental income) will not actually be taxed in Switzerland.
### Church tax
Almost all cantons levy a church tax for registered members of one of the respective official religious affiliations. The determination of the religious affiliation is part of registration process with the municipal authorities. Individuals without religious denomination or members of other than the official Swiss churches (e.g. Muslims, Jews, Anglo-Saxon church members) are not subject to cantonal church tax.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year is the business year. Thus, the basis for corporate taxation is the applicable accounting period, which may end at any date within a calendar year.
## Tax returns
The tax system for corporate income and capital taxes is based on taxpayers' declarations, with subsequent assessments being issued by the tax authorities based on the tax returns filed. The tax return must be filed annually (an exemption exists in the first business year in case an extended business year shall apply). The filing deadlines vary from canton to canton (usually between six and nine months after the close of the business year). Companies are initially assessed on a provisional basis, with the final assessments being issued after the tax base was either subject of a tax audit or declared final by the authorities.
## Payment of tax
Unless instalment payments are specifically requested, federal, cantonal, and communal taxes on income and capital are, in most cantons and for federal tax purposes, payable only upon receipt of a demand based on a provisional or final assessment.
Note that cantonal exceptions apply. As an example, based on the date of maturity of the respective tax year (30 September), the canton of Zurich levies late payment interest to the extent that the full (final) tax amount had not been paid in time (independent from any earlier provisional tax invoices). About one month before the due date, a (provisional) tax bill based on the latest tax return filed or the assessment of the preceding period is sent to the taxpayer. Payment is usually made in two or three instalments. If the entire amount is paid up front, a discount may be granted.
The provisional federal CIT is usually due by 31 March of the year following the tax period at question. The due date of the final federal CIT and the provisional or final cantonal CIT varies.
## Tax audit process
Swiss CIT law does not outline specifics of the tax audit process. At first, the tax authorities review the tax return and its enclosures as filed by the taxpayer. Such review is usually desk-related work. The competent tax authorities are obligated and entitled to clarify all relevant information necessary to assess taxpayers on a true and complete base. The tax authorities may request further information/documentation or may inspect the taxpayer’s premises.
## Statute of limitations
As a general rule, the right to assess a taxpayer in relation to corporate income and capital taxes expires five years after the end of the corresponding tax period (relative statute of limitations). Under certain conditions (e.g. where the relative statute of limitations is interrupted), the absolute statute of limitations of 15 years applies.
In case of tax fraud (*‘Steuerbetrug’*) or tax evasion (*‘Steuerhinterziehung’*; e.g. where specific information was not available to the tax inspector at the time of the assessment), finally assessed tax periods can be reopened. The statute of limitations to reopen finally assessed tax periods is ten years after the end of the corresponding tax period.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
All tax-resident individuals are taxed on their worldwide income and wealth. Non-tax-resident individuals are only taxed on Swiss sources of income and wealth.
Income taxes are levied at three different levels: at the federal level (which is the same all over Switzerland), at the cantonal level (which is the same within a certain canton and is based on the canton's own tax law and tax rates), and at the municipal level (municipalities follow the cantonal tax law, but are entitled to set their own communal tax rate within certain parameters). Income tax rates are progressive at the federal level and in most of the cantons. Some cantons have recently introduced flat rate taxation.
All income is taxed on the basis of the same tax return with generally the same tax rate (i.e. all income sources are added together), and from such total income all applicable deductions are subtracted. This results in an applicable tax rate that is levied on all taxable income. Based on applicable DTTs, the actual taxable income in Switzerland may differ from the tax rate determining income. Furthermore, dividend income from substantial participations may be taxed at a lower tax rate based on domestic federal and cantonal law.

For the additional municipal taxes, the above rate has to be multiplied by the respective municipal tax factor, which varies between 0.72 and 1.30 (City of Zurich: 1.19). For church tax the basic tax above is multiplied by the church tax factor, which is between 0.06 and 0.17.
### Geneva cantonal tax (basic tax)
The Geneva tax table is quite complex as it does not apply a tax bracket system. The tax rates are increasing continuously in small increments with each increase in income. The table below therefore only provides a general overview (for 2023).

The tax rate applicable to a married couple or individuals in a Swiss registered partnership is the rate applicable to 50% of their combined income (so-called 'splitting'). The tax rate applicable to single, widowed, divorced, or separated individuals living with a dependant (child or adult) is the rate applicable to 50% of the income.
The above tax rates are basically applicable to taxpayers filing a tax return. Effective cantonal income and wealth tax is determined by multiplying the basic tax by the multiplier applicable for the tax (calendar) year in question, and then by adding the supplementary tax on wealth.
Developments in individual taxation in Geneva – single/divorced/separated parents:
## Local income taxes
### Geneva communal tax
Each commune of the canton of Geneva determines the multiplier applied on the cantonal tax rate and hence its communal tax rate autonomously depending on its financial needs. As result, the communal taxes can vary significantly. The communal taxes are, as mentioned above, a percentage of the cantonal taxes, and are levied in conjunction with the cantonal taxes. For example, the effective communal tax of the city of Geneva is 45.5% of basic cantonal tax. The highest communal tax rate is 51% of the basic cantonal tax and is levied in the communes of Chancy and Avully. On the contrary, the lowest communal tax rate is applicable in the communes of Genthod (25%), Cologny (27%), and Collonge-Bellerive or Vandoeuvres (both 29%).
## Withholding requirements for sales of property, dividends, interest and royalties
In general, interest and dividend income derived from Swiss sources is subject to a 35% withholding tax (WHT), which tax has to be withheld from the paying party (e.g. bank or Swiss company) and is directly deducted from the gross amount paid to the recipient. Based on the facts and circumstances, this tax may be credited towards the overall income tax liability in Switzerland or may be refunded.
On payments received for loans secured by a property located in Switzerland (without repayment amounts, e.g. mainly mortgage interest) a tax at source may be due if the creditor (individual or legal entity) is domiciled abroad. Tax at source has to be withheld by the payer of the interest. Applicable DTTs may cap or abolish the applicable cantonal tax rates.

# Switzerland
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year in Switzerland is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
The respective tax return has to be filed by 31 March of the following year (a few cantons have different deadlines) in the canton where the taxpayer has been resident at the end of the respective tax period. Filing extensions are usually granted until September/November upon request. Married couples mandatory file a joint Swiss tax return and are assessed together.
### Resident foreign nationals
Resident foreign nationals, who are taxed through the wage withholding system, can only (and have to) file a tax return if their gross employment income exceeds CHF 120,000 per year. If the threshold is not exceeded, there may still be a requirement to file a supplementary tax return if the individual has other reportable income or wealth. For this, the cantons have set different *de minimis* amounts.
If the taxpayers want to apply for such supplementary tax return, they must submit a corresponding application to the competent cantonal tax administration by March 31 of the tax year following the due date of the benefit.
When submitting a retrospective ordinary assessment, utmost caution is required, as this may also result in a worse position. An application for a retrospective ordinary assessment for persons resident in Switzerland also has a legally binding effect for all future years. In other words, this person will always be subject to a retrospective ordinary assessment in the future. Thus, the voluntary application for a subsequent ordinary assessment requires a careful analysis.
Non-resident individuals (Swiss and foreign nationals) subject to wage withholding taxes usually cannot file a tax return for their employment income. Individuals who cannot file a tax return may claim a correction of the withheld wage taxes in order to claim certain additional deductions or to correct a wrongly used tariff. Such wage tax corrections have to be filed by 31 March of the following year with no filing extension available.
If a non-resident individual owns property in Switzerland, they have to file a special tax return in the canton where the property is located.
### Note recent changes for non-resident individuals
As of 1 January 2021, the construct of 'quasi-residency' has been officially introduced throughout Switzerland.
In order to meet the demand for equal tax treatment of Swiss and foreign nationals, a completely new construct was introduced in the Federal Law on Direct Federal Tax (DBG) as well as in the new Withholding Tax Ordinance (QStV): Quasi-residence. It applies to persons liable to withholding tax who are tax resident abroad. These employees, who meet the requirements for quasi-residency, have the right to submit an application for subsequent ordinary assessment to the competent cantonal tax administration for each year until 31 March of the tax year following the due date of the benefit.
The requirements for a subsequent ordinary assessment in the case of quasi-residence are met if at least 90% of the worldwide gross family income is taxable in Switzerland in the corresponding tax year. In principle, this request can be made every year.
This construct requires increased attention and attentiveness since the spouse living in a legally and actually inseparable marriage is also added for the calculation of the worldwide income of the withholding taxpayer or for the 90% rule.
## Payment of tax
Resident individuals, who are not subject to wage withholding taxes, are paying their taxes through filing a tax return. Cantonal and municipal taxes are usually collected on a provisional basis throughout the respective tax year. Cantonal rules differ. Federal taxes are paid on a provisional basis by 31 March of the year following the respective tax year. Final tax payments or tax refunds are due once the tax return has been finally assessed by the authorities. If there is a balance in favour of the tax authorities (i.e. the final tax liability minus any pre-payments), interest is usually levied between a certain due date and the date of the assessment as compensation for being able to use these monies in this period for private investments. Payment due date after having received the final tax assessment and bill is usually 30 days. After this, late payment interest is normally levied.
Foreign nationals who are resident in Switzerland (except those having a permanent residence permit or are married to a Swiss spouse or a spouse holding a permanent residence permit) are subject to wage tax withholdings on a monthly basis. The wage taxes cover federal, cantonal, and municipal taxes, and, if applicable, church taxes. If the employee is obligated to file a Swiss tax return, the final tax liability is assessed on the basis of the tax return and the already withheld wage taxes will be credited against this.
Non-resident taxpayers, regardless of their nationality, usually pay their taxes via wage withholding, which is normally the final tax liability, i.e. there are no further tax payments or refunds. Exceptions apply to non-resident owner of Swiss real estate, as they have to file a tax return and pay the respective taxes based on this return.
## Tax audit process
Every tax return filed goes through a formal tax assessment process with the tax authorities in charge. In the course of the tax assessment process, the tax authorities may ask for additional information and statements. In the end a formal tax assessment is issued, in which the taxable factors, i.e. taxable and tax rate determining income and assets are noted. If no legal action is taken, the tax assessment comes into legal force, and based on this final tax bills are issued.
## Statute of limitations
The right to assess a filed tax return by the authorities in general lapses five years after the tax period in question has elapsed. The tax authorities can open a special tax procedure up to ten years after the tax period has elapsed, if they identify that a previously assessed tax return has been faulty (or that no assessment was issued at all) if new facts or evidence is brought forward that was previously not known to the tax authorities.
Each and every income tax return is reviewed and assessed by the tax authorities. Currently, the tax authorities are especially looking into expatriate status and the respective income/deductions declared in the tax return.
The authorities have begun to compare financial information received under the program for automatic exchange of information with the declarations in the tax return. They are requesting clarification from individuals where they spot inconsistencies.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
Resident companies are subject to Swiss corporate income tax (CIT) on their taxable profits generated in Switzerland. CIT is levied at the federal, cantonal, and communal levels. Foreign-source income attributable to foreign permanent establishments (PEs) or real estate property located abroad is excluded from the Swiss tax base and only taken into account for rate progression purposes in the cantons that apply progressive tax rates.
Non-resident companies may be subject to Swiss CIT if they (alternatively) have a PE in Switzerland, own real estate property in Switzerland, are partners of a Swiss business, have loan receivables secured by a mortgage on Swiss real estate property, or deal with or act as a broker of Swiss real estate property. Non-resident companies are taxed on their income generated in Switzerland (*see the [Branch income](switzerland/corporate/branch-income.html) section*).
## Federal level
Switzerland levies a direct federal CIT at a flat rate of 8.5% on profit after tax. Accordingly, CIT is deductible for tax purposes and reduces the applicable tax base (i.e. taxable income), resulting in a direct federal CIT rate on profit before tax of approximately 7.83%. At the federal level, no corporate capital tax is levied.
## Cantonal/communal levels
In addition to the direct federal CIT, each canton has its own tax law and levies cantonal and communal corporate income and capital taxes at different rates. Therefore, the tax burden of income (and capital) varies from canton to canton. Some cantonal and communal taxes are imposed at progressive rates.

The Federal Council implemented the partial revision of the Value Added Tax Act (VAT Act) in August 2024, which was passed by Parliament in June 2023, and will enter into effect on 1 January 2025. At the same time, the partially revised Value Added Tax Ordinance (VAT Ordinance) will enter into effect as well. The partially revised VAT Ordinance includes both the implementing provisions for the amended VAT Act and independent adjustments, particularly concerning the net tax and flat tax rate method as well as portal obligations. Further changes are postponed to 1 January 2027, i.e., the portal obligation for the areas of net tax rate as well as flat tax rate method, group taxation, and deregistration as a taxable person.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
A company is considered resident in Switzerland if its domicile is in Switzerland. Residency is also linked to the place of effective management, which may be the place from which day-to-day activities are directed and/or the place from which managerial decisions are taken.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
For Swiss tax law purposes, the term 'permanent establishment' means a fixed place of business through which the business activity of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on. In particular, PEs are branches, factories, workshops, sales agencies, permanent representations, mines and other places of extraction of natural resources, as well as building or construction sites that are maintained for at least 12 months. This definition is generally in line with the criteria according to the current Article 5 paragraph 2 of the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
The statutory accounts of a Swiss company are the basis for determining taxable income. To be tax deductible, an expense must be booked in the statutory accounts accordingly.
Generally, all business expenses that are booked in the statutory accounts are tax deductible, assuming they are economically/commercially justified from a tax perspective. If an expense is not a justifiable business expense in the sense of the tax law, it will be added back to taxable income. Examples typically include excessive depreciation, non-justified payments to related parties (e.g. hidden profit distributions), etc.
## Depreciation and amortisation
Maximum safe harbour depreciation/amortisation rates allowed for tax purposes are issued by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration. Higher depreciation/amortisation is allowed for tax purposes if the taxpayer can prove that such higher depreciation/amortisation is required (and not only allowed) from a statutory accounting perspective. Some cantons follow the federal guidelines, whereas some cantons apply their own (more liberal) depreciation/amortisation rates.
The following summary of the rates specified by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration provides the general range of tax-accepted depreciation:
| Assets | Declining-balance (%) | Straight-line (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Commercial buildings: |  |  |
| Buildings alone | 4 | 2 |
| Buildings and land combined | 3 | 1.5 |
| Equipment: |  |  |
| Office furniture and equipment | 25 | 12.5 |
| Computer hardware and software | 40 | 20 |
| Other assets: |  |  |
| Motor vehicles | 40 | 20 |
| Intangible assets | 40 | 20 |
Some cantons (e.g. Basel-City, Bern, Grisons, Zurich) take a more liberal approach and even permit, for tax purposes, an immediate write-down of certain assets (including fixed assets) to 20% or nil of the purchase price in the first year, provided that such write-downs do not, in the aggregate, result in a drastic decline in taxable income or even a tax loss. For CIT purposes, such immediate write-downs must be booked in the statutory accounts and generally disclosed in the tax return. As the cantonal tax authorities are responsible for assessing not only cantonal/communal CIT but also federal CIT, the immediate write-down will typically be accepted for federal CIT purposes as well.
## Goodwill
Only acquired goodwill (derivative goodwill) may be capitalised in the statutory accounts and be amortised. Amortisation is generally allowed straight-line over five years. Special limitations apply to acquired shares, where the purchase price for these shares partly represents inherent goodwill.
## Start-up expenses
The Swiss code of obligations does not contain any specific Swiss statutory accounting provision regarding start-up expenses. For Swiss statutory accounting purposes, start-up expenses shall be expensed as incurred. For Swiss CIT purposes, business-related start-up expenses as booked in the statutory profit and loss statement are likely fully tax deductible.
## Interest expense
Interest paid by a corporation to a third party is a deductible business expense. Interest paid to related parties (especially affiliated companies and shareholders) has to reflect the fair market rate and is subject to limitations (*see Thin capitalisation in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*).
With respect to related parties, the Swiss Federal Tax Administration annually issues safe harbour interest rates to be used on loans denominated in Swiss franc on the one hand and in foreign currencies on the other hand. The corporation may deviate from these safe harbour rates as long as it can prove with hard facts that the rates used are arm’s length and more appropriate in the present case. The cantons usually follow these federal guidelines.
The safe harbour rules for loans denominated in Swiss franc applicable as of 1 January 2024 are as follows:
| For loans to related parties | Minimum interest rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Financed from equity | 1.5 |
| Financed from debt (actual costs plus at least): |  |
| On amount up to and including CHF 10 million | Own cost plus 0.50 |
| On amounts of more than CHF 10 million | Own cost plus 0.25 |
| But in all cases at least | 1.5 |
| For loans from related parties | Maximum interest rate (%) | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Real estate loans: | 2.25 | 2.75 |
| A loan up to the amount generally acceptable for mortgages (i.e. ⅔ of the market value of the real estate) |
| Rest, whereby the following maximum interest rates for debt are applicable: | 3.00\* | 3.50\* |
| Other real estate up to 80% of the market value |
| Operational loans up to CHF 1 million: |  |  |
| Granted to trading and production companies | - | 3.75\* |
| Granted to holding and asset administration companies | - | 3.25\* |
| Operational loans above CHF 1 million: |  |  |
| Granted to trading and production companies | - | 2.00\* |
| Granted to holding and asset administration companies | - | 1.75\* |
## Notional interest deduction (NID)
The Federal Act on the Harmonisation of Direct Taxation at Cantonal and Communal Levels allows cantons to introduce a notional interest deduction (NID) on excess equity, if certain conditions are fulfilled. Currently, the NID is only available for companies that are tax resident in the canton of Zurich. The NID rate on such excess equity is generally based on the 10-year Swiss government bond rate. To the extent it relates to inter-company loans, an arm’s-length rate can be applied.
## Bad debt provision
Based on a longstanding practice in Switzerland, it is admissible to set up a statutory accounting provision for specific impaired receivables, which will be accepted for CIT purposes. Unlike most other countries, it is also possible to account for an additional ('lump sum') bad debt provision of 5% on most domestic and 10% on most foreign receivables (i.e. a provision in addition to the provision for specific impaired receivables). The most common exceptions are for inter-company receivables and receivables to the public, enabling the taxpayer to defer the related tax liability until this provision has been released. Some cantons, such as Zurich, accept an even higher reserve (i.e. 10% on domestic and 20% on foreign receivables). This additional bad debt provision may have the character of a 'hidden' (i.e. undisclosed) reserve and is appropriate because the Swiss statutory accounting standards favour prudence over true and fair view accounting principles.
## Obsolete inventory provision
Similarly to the bad debt provision, it is possible to account for an additional (i.e. undisclosed) reserve on a company’s inventory. This provision, which must also be booked in the statutory accounts, is on most inventory categories accepted for tax purposes (like the bad debt provision). Specifically, a company may book a provision for specific obsolete inventory as well as a general provision of up to one-third (slightly varies per canton) on the inventory value after deduction of the obsolete inventory.
## Charitable contributions
At the federal level, charitable contributions of up to 20% of the net profit (after tax) of a company are tax deductible, provided certain criteria are met. In particular, the charitable contribution must be remitted to (i) Swiss legal entities that are exempt from taxation based on their public welfare or exclusively charitable objective or to (ii) the Swiss Federation, a Swiss canton or municipality, or their agencies (‘*Anstalten*’). The cantons usually apply the same rules and similar thresholds.
Sponsoring contributions are only tax deductible if commercially justified (without specific thresholds).
## Royalties
Royalty payments are generally deductible for tax purposes if the royalty rate is arm’s length.
## Costs of employee share plans and stock option plans
The cost of employee share plans and stock option plans are generally deductible, assuming the employees eligible for the plan are employed by the Swiss company. The same holds true for the recharge of costs for plans covering local employees.
## Costs for job-related training and continuing education of employees
As far as they are recognised as an expense in the statutory books, costs incurred for job-related training and continuing education of employees are generally tax deductible.
## R&D super deduction
The Federal Act on the Harmonisation of Direct Taxation at Cantonal and Communal Levels provides all cantons with the option to introduce an R&D super deduction at the cantonal and communal levels. Upon request by the taxpayer, an additional deduction of up to 50% (depending on cantonal rules) may be granted on qualifying Swiss R&D personnel expenses as well as expenses for third party contract R&D in Switzerland.
## Fines and penalties
Under Swiss tax law, fines imposed as a penalty, as well as financial administrative sanctions, insofar as they have a punitive purpose, are not tax deductible. Fines imposed in the context of skimming of profits, insofar as they do not have a punitive purpose, are tax deductible.
## Tax expenses
Corporate income and capital taxes paid to the federal government, as well as to the cantons and the municipalities, are tax deductible. Indirect taxes (e.g. real estate transfer tax) are tax deductible as well.
## Net operating losses
Tax losses can be carried forward for a maximum of seven years and can be offset against the taxable income of the following seven years. There is no carry back of tax losses in Switzerland. According to an ongoing legislative project, Switzerland may extend the loss offsetting period for companies from seven to ten years.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Management and service fees paid by a Swiss company to a related party are generally tax deductible if the fees are arm’s length.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Transfer pricing
So far, Switzerland has not introduced specific transfer pricing regulations. There is, however, an increasing awareness of transfer pricing matters and a related concern on the part of the Swiss tax authorities that taxpayers may transfer profits without sufficient economic justification either to countries with strict transfer pricing rules and documentation requirements in order to avoid challenges by the respective local tax authorities or to offshore locations. In this context, Swiss tax authorities take an increasing interest in a company’s transfer pricing position in order to defend their own position. Some cantonal as well as the federal tax authorities have started to particularly focus on low risk/low profit entities located in Switzerland.
## Thin capitalisation
Swiss thin capitalisation rules are, in general, only applicable for related parties. In case of a thin capitalisation, the related party debts can be treated as taxable equity. The respective circular letter 6a issued by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration provides for debt-to-equity ratios as safe harbour rules. As an example, the debt-to-equity ratio is generally fixed at 6:1 for finance companies (safe harbour). Interest paid on loans that exceed the relevant ratios are generally not tax deductible; further, such interest may be deemed as a hidden distribution subject to Swiss WHT. There are no limitations on the financing of Swiss corporations by independent third parties (e.g. banks).
Interest rates paid to affiliated companies are also subject to periodically fixed safe harbour interest rates (*see Interest expense in the [Deductions](deductions.html) section*). The tax deduction of interest in excess of the permitted safe harbour rate may be disallowed and treated as a hidden distribution subject to Swiss WHT.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
In Switzerland, no CFC or 'subject to tax' rules exist. Foreign companies are therefore recognised for Swiss tax purposes if they are managed and controlled offshore and are not set up purely for the reason of avoiding Swiss taxes.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
Foreign legal entities having a branch in Switzerland are subject to limited taxation in Switzerland. Such branches generally qualify as PEs in line with the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital. The branch's income is, in general, subject to the same CIT rules that apply for Swiss corporations. It is worth noting that there is no Swiss withholding tax (WHT) on profit transfers from the Swiss branch to its foreign head office.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
In addition, many cantons offer tax incentives for newly established companies or for expansion investments, such as tax holidays or significant tax relief for cantonal and communal tax purposes for up to ten years. In some specific economic development regions and regional centres, a tax holiday may even be granted for federal CIT purposes if certain conditions are met.
## Patent box
On 1 January 2020, a patent box was introduced at cantonal and communal levels reducing CIT on income from qualifying patents upon request. The proportion of income from patents and similar rights to the extent it is based on qualifying R&D expenses in Switzerland is exempt from CIT up to a maximum of 90% (depending on the cantonal implementation) capped with a maximum relief that is linked to overall relevant income of the company. To enter the patent box, previously incurred R&D expenses that arose to develop the respective patents will have to be taxed at the applicable CIT rate based on a company’s location of corporate residence in Switzerland. The magnitude of the patent box benefits varies from canton to canton.
## Foreign tax credit
Swiss tax resident corporations and branches may suffer foreign non-recoverable WHTs on dividend, interest, and royalty income derived from foreign sources. As such foreign-source income is generally subject to corporate income taxation in Switzerland, a double taxation occurs. In case a double tax treaty (DTT) exists and in order to reduce or to eliminate double taxation, Switzerland usually applies the credit method (for branches as of 1 January 2020). Specific conditions and formalities will need to be met to benefit from foreign tax credits.

Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Reorganisations
Most corporate reorganisations (e.g. mergers, de-mergers, transfer of business assets within a group of companies, vertical and horizontal spin-off of business or part of business, share-for-share transactions and cross-border reorganisations where the Swiss tax residency and Swiss taxation of assets is maintained, and like-kind exchange of participations) are typically possible without triggering adverse Swiss tax consequences (tax neutrality is available). In addition, special rules provide for a legal framework to tax neutrally substitute assets and qualifying shareholdings. For reorganisations, it is best practice to apply for advance tax rulings with the competent tax authorities. Advance tax rulings covering certain cross-border reorganisation aspects may be subject to the spontaneous exchange of information (*see Spontaneous exchange of information below*).
## Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
In 2013, Switzerland and the United States (US) signed a bilateral FATCA agreement. The FATCA agreement will help Swiss financial institutions by means of simplifications in the implementation of the US FATCA legislation. The FATCA agreement and the implementing Swiss act entered into force on 2 June 2014 and 30 June 2014, respectively.
The FATCA agreement shall ensure that accounts held by US persons with Swiss financial institutions are disclosed to the US tax authorities either with the consent of the account holder or through ordinary administrative assistance channels (no automatic information exchange).
## Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS)
Based on the results of the BEPS project, Switzerland has launched several actions in order to implement BEPS measures into the Swiss tax law, in particular:
The implementation of further BEPS actions into the Swiss tax law and DTTs is an ongoing process.
## Automatic information exchange
In view of the OECD’s developments on a new standard for the automatic exchange of information, Switzerland switched to an automatic exchange of information between the competent authorities on a reciprocal basis.
Switzerland has agreed on the automatic exchange of information in respective agreements with numerous partner states (e.g. the EU member states, many offshore countries, as well as most of the OECD member states).
## Spontaneous exchange of information
The ordinance on international administrative assistance in tax matters (StAhiV) contains rules on the spontaneous exchange of information. A spontaneous exchange of information is an unrequested exchange of information available to the competent Swiss tax authorities that may be of interest to the competent foreign tax authority.
The spontaneous exchange of information covers the following advance tax rulings:
The relevant information regarding such advance tax rulings shall be spontaneously exchanged with the competent foreign tax authorities within three months after the receipt of the information by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration.

## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Foreign tax relief
As far as a DTT is applicable, irrecoverable foreign taxes on investment income (interest, dividends) are usually credited against and up to the respective actual Swiss tax on this income. Unused credits cannot be carried forward.
For all other income and assets, Switzerland applies the ‘exemption with progression’ method with regard to treaty countries to avoid double taxation. Therefore, Switzerland will not grant a credit for foreign taxes. The only exception applies with regard to the treaty rate on foreign source interest, royalties, and dividends.
Income and wealth taxes levied in countries with which Switzerland has not concluded a DTT can neither be credited against Swiss taxes nor is the underlying income or assets exempt from Swiss taxation. However, the taxpayer may apply for a pre-tax deduction in the amount of irrecoverable foreign taxes.
## Tax treaties
Switzerland has a rather exhaustive network of income tax treaties with currently over 100 jurisdictions.
Most treaties follow, in principle, the OECD model treaty. Double taxation is generally avoided by applying the ‘exemption with progression’ method, i.e. all income is considered in order to determine the applicable tax rate, but on the exempted income no taxes are actually levied. Irrecoverable foreign taxes on investment income (interest, dividends) are usually credited against and up to the respective actual Swiss tax on this income. Unused credits cannot be carried forward.
Income and wealth taxes levied in countries with which Switzerland has not concluded a DTT can neither be credited against Swiss taxes nor is the underlying income or assets exempt from Swiss taxation. However, the taxpayer may apply for a pre-tax deduction in the amount of irrecoverable foreign taxes.

Notes
1. Treaty with United Kingdom is applicable.
### Social security agreements/totalisation agreements
### Brexit – New Swiss-UK social security agreement
The new Swiss-UK social security treaty is provisionally applicable as of 1 November 2021, until final agreement of both parties. The new agreement intends to ensure the coordination between the social security systems of both states in the long run.
The new social security agreement largely grants insured persons equal treatment and facilitated access to social security benefits. It avoids over insurance and insurance gaps for persons who come into contact with the social security systems of both states. This also includes the temporary deployment of workers in the respective other state. The agreement largely corresponds to the coordination of social security systems in the new Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is based on the principles of EU coordination law, which Switzerland applies under the Free Movement of Persons Agreement (FMPA).
### Estate and gift tax conventions
Switzerland has concluded tax treaties on estate taxes with ten jurisdictions (Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States). All these treaties only cover estate/inheritance taxes, while gift taxes are not covered in any of the treaties.
### Tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs)
Switzerland has concluded a small number of separate TIEAs with countries with which Switzerland has not concluded an ordinary DTT. For other countries, these questions are treated within the specific DTTs. Based on recent international developments, Switzerland has renegotiated some of the DTTs with regard to these specific provisions.

## Double Tax Treaty (DTT): German cross-border and managerial staff
According to art. 15 para. 4 of the DTT between Switzerland and Germany, the income of an individual who is resident in one contracting state but works as a director, managing director, or authorised signatory of a corporation that is resident in the other contracting state may be taxed in the second state, unless the activity is limited to tasks outside this state. If the second state does not tax the income, it may be taxed in the state of residency (so-called ‘Leitender Angestellter / Executive Clause’).
The definition of individuals falling under this clause has been the basis for disputes between the national tax authorities of the two countries. In a consultation agreement dated 18 September 2008, the two countries agreed on a more restrictive interpretation, stating that the clause should only apply to employees with procura resp. signatory rights for the company or if the individuals function as listed in art. 15 para. 4 is stated in the commercial register.
In contrast, the new consultation agreement dated 6 April 2023 allows a broader interpretation of the clause. It now applies to individuals who are listed in the commercial register with individual or collective signatory rights without designation of the function. It also applies to individuals who are not listed in the commercial register at all but, from a civil law perspective, occupy a position within a corporation that is comparable to the functions mentioned in art. 15 para. 4 and representation authority, taking into account the overall circumstances of the individual case. The management function and representation authority must be equivalent to at least a procura. This may be proven with a respective power of attorney to represent the company, e.g. through a circulation resolution, internal signatory regulations, or company statutes.
When analysing the overall circumstance of the individual, the following factors should be considered:
The new consultation agreement is to be applied to all open cases and its duration is limited until 31 December 2025, unless the competent authorities agree on a continuation of the agreement.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
All deductions are subtracted from the total income as per the tax return. If the individual is performing a self-employed activity and having related business assets, special deductions in relation to this may be applicable; however, as this is rather in the realm of corporate tax, no further information will be provided in this section.
Based on a court decision, guidance has been published regarding the treatment of non-resident employees when it comes to claiming deductions. The guidance allows for more deductions for non-resident individuals who earn the majority of their income (at least 90% of the worldwide family gross income) in Switzerland and which would then be considered as taxable in Switzerland. Currently, the new favourable tax treatment is limited to European Union (EU)/European Free Trade Association (EFTA) individuals who reside in an EU or EFTA country.
## Employment expenses
An employee’s social security contributions are deductible from gross employment income. Contributions to foreign social security systems may be deductible as well. Usually, the employer’s share of the social security contributions is not seen as taxable income and is thus tax-free for the individual.
Tax resident individuals are entitled to deduct several business-related expenses, such as actual commuting costs (capped for federal tax purposes and in most cantons), additional costs for meals at place of work (lump-sum), general business-related expenses (actual or lump-sum), and costs related to further education (actual or lump-sum). If both spouses are performing a gainful activity, double earner deductions may be applicable as well. As cantonal law regulates these deductions at the cantonal level, there are substantial differences per canton regarding the type of deductions as well as the maximum amounts. Such deductions can also be claimed at federal level in accordance with the federal tax law.
Tax-residents and non-tax-residents may claim expatriate tax deductions.
## Personal deductions
Several other deductions can be claimed in the tax return as listed below. Cantonal law may allow for further deductions. Conditions and limitations are defined by federal law as well as per canton and may therefore vary substantially.
### Alimony
Alimony and subsistence payments paid to minor children are tax deductible for the payer and taxable for the recipient for federal tax purposes and in many cantons. Subsistence payments paid to children of age (18+) are no longer deductible but may allow for a lump-sum child deduction under certain circumstances.
### Charitable contributions
A deduction (actual) for donations made to a qualifying Swiss based charity organisation can be claimed on the tax return. On the federal level, and in many cantons, the deduction is capped with a certain ratio of the taxable income.
### Day-care expenses
Depending on the circumstances, actual childcare costs up to a capped amount may be claimed at federal level and in many cantons.
### Life insurance premiums
Generally, actual insurance premiums are not deductible; however, cantons may provide a standard deduction for insurance premiums (lump-sum, capped) based on the status of the taxpayer (i.e. married, single, or number of children).
### Mortgage deduction
A deduction for interest payments for mortgages and other loans/debts may also be claimed on the tax return. Amortisation payments are not deductible. Certain caps regarding the deductible interest payments (in relation to investment income) are applicable.
### Social security and pension schemes
Social security contributions of the employee, if not already deducted from the gross employment income, can be claimed as a deduction. Payments made to recognised pension schemes (actual) and other recognised retirement schemes (actual, capped). If made to non-Swiss schemes, deductibility needs to be assessed.
Switzerland has a very attractive pension system, allowing employees to make additional contributions for missing years or for increases in salary. Such additional contributions are fully deductible in the tax return and therefore can result in substantial tax savings. While this principle is untouched, a court decision has ruled that additional contributions made less than three years before a lump-sum withdrawal (e.g. retirement) of pension funds can no longer be deducted for tax purposes. Based on this court decision, the Swiss Tax Conference (a body formed by the cantonal tax administrations) has issued a new guidance in this regard, which should be thoroughly considered before making substantial voluntary contributions into Swiss pension schemes. Potential taxes at the time of a pay-out (annuity or lump-sum) should also be considered, especially if the potential pay-out happens while resident in another country.
### Real estate costs
A deduction can be claimed on the tax return for maintenance costs for self-owned real estate (actual or lump-sum).
### Bank charges
A deduction can be claimed on the tax return for qualified bank charges (actual; or lump-sum, capped).
### Medical expenses
A deduction can be claimed on the tax return for un-reimbursed medical expenses (actual, exceeding threshold).
## Personal allowances (for 2024)

## Business deductions
### Accrued expenses
In general, accrued costs/debts (e.g. a pending tax bill that has not yet been formally issued by the tax authorities) can only be considered for wealth tax purposes, but not for income tax purposes.
For self-employed individuals, limited possibilities for deducting accrued costs from the taxable income may exist depending on the accounting standard applied for their mandatory accounting.
### Contingent liabilities
Self-employed individuals may be able to claim this as an accrual against their taxable income. The likelihood of occurrence of the contingent liability will determine whether this will be accepted or not. Otherwise, contingent liabilities could only be considered for wealth tax purposes.
### Depreciation of fixed assets/amortisation of intangibles
Self-employed individuals may be able to claim depreciation expenses in relation to their business assets as a deduction against their taxable income. Otherwise, depreciation of fixed assets is usually only possible for cars as part of the declarable assets for wealth tax purposes. Depreciation expenses that do not relate to qualifying business assets of self-employed individuals cannot be set off against taxable income.
The following deductions are not specifically considered by Swiss tax law and are thus, in general, not tax deductible:
## Losses
There is no carry forward of losses to future tax years if, for example, the total deductions are higher than the total income. Capital losses from movable assets are not deductible, as likewise capital gains from movable assets are tax free.
## Related party transactions/payments to foreign related parties
Payments made to e.g. family members or other persons are in general not deductible from the taxable income. Under certain circumstances (recipient was in financial need of the payment, federal and/or cantonal thresholds are met) a capped deduction may be available. Depending on the tax domicile of the payer/donor and the recipient/donation recipient and the degree of relationship between these two parties, gift taxes could be triggered.

## Individual - Other issues
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Treatment of business entities
Principal forms of doing business:The usual form of doing business is setting up an AG/SA (a corporation) or a GmbH/Sarl (a limited liability company or LLC), even for smaller businesses. Those are treated as non-transparent from a tax perspective, whilst partnerships are treated as transparent.
Asset protection via family limited partnerships: These are not common in Switzerland.
Foreign trusts: They are usually treated as transparent for either the settler or the beneficiary depending on the type and conditions of the trust. Only rarely will the tax authorities consider a trust as an independent asset.
Aircraft: No special provisions exist in Switzerland for the treatment of aircraft.
## Residence and work permits
Individuals must obtain a residence and work permit for the canton in which they intend to stay before entering Switzerland. Employees from EU member states only require a residence permit. A residence permit is issued if the individual has a Swiss employment contract and is subject to quotas and control of wage and work conditions. A new provision in the Swiss constitution foresees a limitation of migration into Switzerland, which may result in an annual maximum quota of residence/work permits also for EU citizens.
The State Secretary of Economy has issued a directive regarding body leasing within a group of companies. Therein, it is stated that also within a group of companies the same restriction applies with regard to body leasing as between unrelated third parties (i.e. permits may be required and body leasing from abroad into Switzerland is generally not allowed). It may affect common secondments or transfers from abroad into Switzerland. Therefore, it may affect the staffing of Swiss-based projects with foreign group employees. The directive may have an impact on the process of obtaining a work permit.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Employment income
All gross remuneration from employment, whether in cash or in kind, is subject to taxation at the time the employee has received the remuneration or has received an irrevocable right to the remuneration. It is irrelevant whether the remuneration results from a Swiss or foreign employment or whether the remuneration is paid to a Swiss bank account or not.
Payments made to an employee to compensate for business related expenses are not taxable as long as these payments are not considered as covering cost of living expenses for the employee or persons related to the employee.
## Assignment related income
Generally, income exclusively relating to an assignment of an employee to Switzerland is subject to taxation. However, various cantonal and federal regulations exempt certain types of income from taxation if they can be considered special expenses for the expatriate. These exceptions are strictly limited. Depending on how the benefits are delivered and on the individual circumstances, such expatriate benefits may either be tax-free income or allow the expatriate to claim a special deduction in the tax return.
Only expatriates are entitled to these deductions. The law defines an expatriate as a managerial employee or a specialist temporarily seconded to Switzerland for a period of up to five years, i.e. the (assignment) contract has to be limited in time for a maximum of five years. An employee with a local contract may also be considered an expatriate if the duration of the contract is limited for a period of up to five years maximum and the foreign employer guarantees re-employment afterwards. Foreign and Swiss employer must be of the same group of companies. Other foreign local hires are usually not considered expatriates and cannot claim these special deductions.
## Equity compensation
Income from stock options that were acquired privately is generally exempted from income taxation. However, if stock options, or other equity participation instruments, were acquired through employment, income derived from such equity participation instruments is qualified as employment income and subject to income taxation.
## Business income
If an individual is performing a self-employed activity, then basically the net profit, e.g. the gross revenue minus all business-related expenses, is taxable.
## Capital gains
Private capital gains on movable assets (e.g. shares) are normally tax-exempt throughout Switzerland as long as an individual does not qualify as being a professional securities dealer.
Capital gains realised upon selling Swiss non-movable assets, i.e. real estate, is however subject to a cantonal capital gains tax. The tax rate varies per canton and is usually progressive depending on the gain itself. Often surcharges apply for short holding periods (less than two to three years) and reductions are granted for longer holding periods (more than five years).
## Dividend income
Dividend income derived from investments is taxed at the ordinary rates together with the other income. In general, dividends from Swiss sources are subject to a 35% WHT that can be credited against the Swiss income tax liability if such dividend income is declared correctly and in full.
## Interest income
Interest income derived from investments is taxed at the ordinary rates together with the other income. In general, certain interest from Swiss sources (e.g. Swiss bank accounts) is subject to a 35% WHT. Swiss WHT can generally be credited against the Swiss income tax liability if such interest income is declared correctly and in full.
## Rental income
Rental income derived from investments is taxed at the ordinary rates together with the other income.
Income from real estate located in Switzerland is subject to tax at the ordinary rates. The owner of self-used real estate is deemed to generate income (i.e. deemed rental income). Foreign rental income is exempted with progression in Switzerland. Therefore, the actual or deemed rental income, and any maintenance or repair costs and respective mortgage interest, must be declared on the Swiss tax return to determine the applicable tax rate.
## Intellectual property
Royalties are also subject to income taxation in Switzerland.
## Exempt income
In principle, all income is subject to income taxation. For some specific circumstances, federal and cantonal tax law specifically states that no income tax is due, for example:
