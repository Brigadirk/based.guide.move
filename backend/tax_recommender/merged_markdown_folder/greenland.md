# Greenland
## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
## Social security contributions
There are no Greenlandic social security contributions for individuals (only for employers). The rate applicable to employers is 1.1% on payroll (2.1% for the income year 2025).
## Mandatory pension scheme
All employees subject to full tax liability in Greenland must pay 10% in 2024 (11% in 2025 and onwards) to a Greenlandic pension fund based on the A-tax basis (salaries, etc). This does not apply for an employee who is a limited taxpayer staying in Greenland less than six months.
Greenlandic employees have to pay to a recognised pension fund. However, the Greenland tax authorities may, upon application, grant permission for contributions to a pension scheme established in Norway, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, or a country that is a member of the European Union (EU) for a period of up to two income years. This exception is based on certain conditions that must be met.
## Consumption taxes
There is no Greenlandic value-added tax (VAT).
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There is no Greenlandic tax on net wealth.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Inheritance is generally not taxable. If the deceased’s spouse continues with the joint estate as an undivided estate, the spouse will roll over into the deceased’s tax position. This provision has a narrow field of application outside of cases of the deceased running a business, given that almost no assets are subject to capital gains taxation.
Gifts are generally taxable in Greenland as ordinary income. However, gifts to a spouse, children or stepchildren and their offspring, spouses of deceased children and stepchildren, parents, stepparents, and grandparents are exempt from tax.
Gifts are taxable by normal tax rates of 42% to 44% (2014 percentages).
## Property taxes
There is no tax in Greenland on property for private use.
## Luxury and excise taxes
There are import and/or excise duties on a variety of consumables, including alcohol, tobacco, sugar, chocolate, coffee, tea, soft drinks, meat, poultry, perfume, and cosmetics. There are import duties on cars, mopeds, and snowmobiles.
## Stamp taxes
Stamp tax is payable on a few documents, such as a deed of transfer of real estate, registration when mortgaging real estate, and transfer of ships (1.5% of the transfer sum), including on transfer of shares in companies that own ships.

# Greenland
## Overview
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
Greenland is an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark. Greenland is divided into four local municipalities, with Nuuk as the capital. Since 2009, Greenlandic has been the official language. However, in practice, Danish is still much used in the administration. The currency is the Danish krone (DKK).

# Greenland
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
Taxable income is generally calculated as income determined for accounting purposes, which is adjusted and modified for several items as prescribed by the tax laws. One typical timing difference is depreciation.
## Inventory valuation
There are no formal rules about inventory valuation in Greenland. Generally, inventory is valued at acquisition cost according to a first in first out (FIFO) principle.
## Capital gains
## Dividend income
Income from dividends is generally included in taxable income. There is no relief, such as participation exemption or the like, meaning that any form of Greenlandic holding structure is generally inefficient. Dividends from foreign companies, however, are tax free, provided that the recipient holds at least 25% of the shares in the distributing company for at least one year.
### Exception regarding chapter 3b
For Greenlandic companies with activity within the industries of mineral resources, exploitation of water resources for energy production, and who have elected to be taxed under chapter 3b, the below special differences/treatments apply (note that the rules below do have certain aspects and conditions):
If a taxpayer decides to be taxed under chapter 3b, the taxpayer is bound to the chapter for at least five income years.
## Interest income
Interest income is generally included in taxable income.
## Rental income
Rental income is generally taxable in Greenland; however, rental income from real estate located outside of Greenland is not taxable.
## Royalty income
Royalty income is taxable in Greenland.
## Partnership income
Partnership income is treated similarly to other income. Partnerships are generally fiscally transparent.
## Unrealised gains/losses
Unrealised gains/losses are not taxable in Greenland. Greenland does not use a mark-to-market principle on capital gains.
## Stock transactions
Gains and losses on equity transactions are taxable.
## Foreign currency exchange gains/losses
Foreign exchange gains/losses are taxable in Greenland if realised; however, only foreign exchange gains/losses on receivables are taxable, not on debentures.
## Foreign income
Greenlandic companies are taxable to Greenland on their worldwide income, except for certain income relative to foreign real estate; consequently, income from foreign PEs is taxable to Greenland.
The income of a foreign subsidiary may be taxed in the hands of its Greenlandic parent company if the subsidiary constitutes a controlled foreign company (CFC). *See Controlled foreign companies (CFCs) in the [Group taxation](greenland/corporate/group-taxation.html) section for more information*.

## Limited international general anti-abuse
Greenland has introduced a limited international general anti-abuse rule whereby a taxpayer will not be granted the advantages of a DTT if it is reasonable to conclude, in light of all relevant circumstances, that granting this advantage is one of the principal aims of the arrangement or transaction, unless it is satisfied that granting the advantage in the concrete circumstances is in accordance with the content and purpose of the provision in question.

# Greenland
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year is from 1 January to 31 December.
## Tax returns
Provisional taxes are withheld or collected on the basis of an estimated income for the current year. Accordingly, a preliminary tax return must be filed with the Greenlandic tax authorities.
All individuals who are either subject to full or limited tax liability to Greenland are basically obligated to submit a tax return, including all necessary additional information regarding income, to the Greenlandic tax authorities by 1 May in the year following the relevant income year. However, foreigners who are taxable to Greenland under the special expat regime are exempt from lodging Greenlandic tax returns. The same applies to individuals with limited tax liability in the form of withholding tax (WHT) on royalties.
A tax surcharge of DKK 200 per day (maximum DKK 2,000) is levied for late submission of the tax return.
When the final tax return has been reported, the Greenlandic tax authorities elaborate a final tax assessment that states whether the individual has an underpayment of tax, excess tax, or neither of the two.
Individuals leaving Greenland have to file a tax return at the normal deadline.
## Payment of tax
Taxes on wages (including wages in labour hire-out situations) and dividends (and royalties for individuals with limited tax liability on royalties) are withheld at source on the basis of the preliminary tax return.
When the final tax has been assessed during the year following the income year in question, an underpayment of tax or an excess tax may occur. Underpayment of tax is payable in three instalments with due dates on 20 September, 20 October, and 20 November in the year of the assessment and will include a surcharge of 8%.
Overpayment of tax is due to be returned before 1 September including a surcharge of 2%.
## Tax audit process
Tax audits are a rather formless affair. A letter of intent to change the tax assessment, including a fact presentation, must be sent to the tax payer by the Tax Agency.
## Statute of limitations
The tax authorities must send out the abovementioned letter of intent no later than 31 October in the fifth income year after the year under scrutiny. The same time bar applies to the taxpayer seeking to amend a prior year’s tax return.
In case the Tax Agency or the taxpayer, for reasons unattributable to it and for which it is not responsible, did not know of information of either factual or legal nature that justify a change of the tax return, a tax return may be reopened even outside the stated time bar. Renewed assessment or application for reopening, as the case may be, must be processed no later than six months after the information justifying the change came to the attention of the Tax Agency or taxpayer.

# Greenland
## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
An individual may be taxed in Greenland on the basis of full or limited tax liability.
An individual who is resident in Greenland is subject to full tax liability on one’s worldwide income unless the individual is considered a resident of another country according to a double residence clause in a relevant double taxation treaty (DTT).
An individual who is fully tax resident in Greenland will, as a main rule, be taxed at up to 44%, depending on the municipality of taxation. Some deductions are applicable.
An individual not fully tax liable may have limited tax liability to Greenland. Limited tax liability is restricted to income from Greenlandic sources, listed in the Greenlandic Tax Act Section 2, including:
An individual with limited tax liability to Greenland will, as a main rule, be taxed at up to 44% on income from sources in Greenland.
## Personal income tax rates
Generally, individuals are subject to state taxes (national income tax) and municipal tax.
The tax percentages may be adjusted every year, and the 2020 percentages are as follows:
| **Municipality** | **Municipality tax (%)** | **National tax (%)** | **Joint local municipality tax (%)** | **Total tax (%)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Kujalleq | 28 | 10 | 6 | 44 |
| Sermersooq | 26 | 10 | 6 | 42 |
| Qeqqata | 26 | 10 | 6 | 42 |
| Qeqertalik | 28 | 10 | 6 | 44 |
| Avannaata | 28 | 10 | 6 | 44 |
| Outside municipal areas | 26 | 10 | N/A | 36 |
## Special regime for oil, gas, and mineral activities and certain construction activities
Individuals working in Greenland in relation to oil, gas, and mineral activities or construction activities outside existing towns and settlements are taxed at a flat rate of 35% with no deductions allowed, provided that they have not been taxable to a local Greenlandic municipality for six months prior to the commencement of the activities.

# Greenland
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
## Taxable period
The taxable period is the calendar year. Permission can be granted to use a 12-month period other than the calendar year, provided that the period starts on the first day of a calendar month.
## Tax returns
Tax returns are completed on the basis of audited financial accounts with adjustments for tax. Tax returns should be filed no later than four months following the end of the income year, meaning 1 May for companies using the calendar year as the income year. However, if the company submits tax returns via the official web portal for tax return submissions, the deadline is 15 June.
The tax system, in practice, is based on self-assessment. Tax assessments are made by the tax authorities on the basis of the tax return.
## Payment of tax
The corporate tax is due for payment by 20 November of the following year. Greenland does not have an on account tax system, so there are no advantages in paying the tax prior to this date.
### Penalties
A tax surcharge of DKK 200 per day (maximum DKK 5,000) is levied for late submission of the tax return.
## Tax audit process
Tax audit is a rather informal procedure, whereby questions for clarification and/or documentation may be asked by the Greenlandic Tax Agency. There are few rules governing audit other than statutory limitation rules.
## Statute of limitations
The general statute of limitations is 31 October in the fifth calendar year after that of the end of the relevant income year.
There does not seem, presently, to be particular focus areas of the Greenlandic Tax Agency, and none have been publically announced.

# Greenland
## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
## Social security contributions
There are no Greenlandic social security contributions for individuals (only for employers). The rate applicable to employers is 1.1% on payroll (2.1% for the income year 2025).
## Mandatory pension scheme
All employees subject to full tax liability in Greenland must pay 10% in 2024 (11% in 2025 and onwards) to a Greenlandic pension fund based on the A-tax basis (salaries, etc). This does not apply for an employee who is a limited taxpayer staying in Greenland less than six months.
Greenlandic employees have to pay to a recognised pension fund. However, the Greenland tax authorities may, upon application, grant permission for contributions to a pension scheme established in Norway, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, or a country that is a member of the European Union (EU) for a period of up to two income years. This exception is based on certain conditions that must be met.
## Consumption taxes
There is no Greenlandic value-added tax (VAT).
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There is no Greenlandic tax on net wealth.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Inheritance is generally not taxable. If the deceased’s spouse continues with the joint estate as an undivided estate, the spouse will roll over into the deceased’s tax position. This provision has a narrow field of application outside of cases of the deceased running a business, given that almost no assets are subject to capital gains taxation.
Gifts are generally taxable in Greenland as ordinary income. However, gifts to a spouse, children or stepchildren and their offspring, spouses of deceased children and stepchildren, parents, stepparents, and grandparents are exempt from tax.
Gifts are taxable by normal tax rates of 42% to 44% (2014 percentages).
## Property taxes
There is no tax in Greenland on property for private use.
## Luxury and excise taxes
There are import and/or excise duties on a variety of consumables, including alcohol, tobacco, sugar, chocolate, coffee, tea, soft drinks, meat, poultry, perfume, and cosmetics. There are import duties on cars, mopeds, and snowmobiles.
## Stamp taxes
Stamp tax is payable on a few documents, such as a deed of transfer of real estate, registration when mortgaging real estate, and transfer of ships (1.5% of the transfer sum), including on transfer of shares in companies that own ships.

# Greenland
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
There is no VAT in Greenland.
## Import duties
There are no general import duties on operating equipment in Greenland. However, if present in Greenland for more than an eight-month period, operating equipment has to be declared to the Greenlandic tax authorities for statistical purposes. There are import duties on some assets, such as cars, etc.
There are also import duties on alcohol, cigarettes, food products, etc. The fares vary depending on the exact goods in question.
## Excise duties
There are Greenlandic excise duties on fishing of some fish species, alcohol produced in Greenland, lottery and gambling activities, motor vehicles, and various other excise taxes. The duties depend on the exact circumstances.
## Property taxes
There are no property taxes in Greenland.
## Stamp taxes
Stamp tax is payable on a few documents, such as a deed of transfer of real estate and ships (1.5% of the transfer sum), including on transfer of shares in companies that own ships.
## Capital gains taxes
There are capital gains taxes on receivables, equity instruments, real estate, financial contracts (derivatives), and depreciable assets, including oil, gas, and mineral licences. The tax rate is identical to the general corporate tax rate, effectively 31.8% (30% for oil, gas, and mineral licence holders).
Losses on financial instruments may only be deducted from gains on financial assets.
## Payroll taxes
Other than social security contributions (*see below*), no additional payroll taxes are applicable in Greenland.
## Social security contributions
Employers (not employees) are obligated to pay 1.1% (2.1% for the income year 2025) of all paid wages and salaries as social security contributions (AMA).
AMA is based on the monthly grossed-up salary, including fringe benefits, for each employee on the same scheme as income tax.
All Danish, Greenlandic, and Faroese employers are subject to Danish social security payments (ATP). This applies to both foreign and Danish employees. However, foreign employees are exempt unless they are working in Greenland for more than six months.
Foreign employers are exempt from ATP unless they employ Danish employees who are not residents in Greenland.
## Environmental taxes
In Greenland, environmental taxes are paid on mineral oil products, which in Greenland are used for the production of heat, electricity, and motor fuel.

# Greenland
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
Greenlandic companies are taxable to Greenland on their worldwide income, except for income from real estate outside of Greenland, which is exempt. Non-resident companies are liable to tax in Greenland on business profits derived through a permanent establishment (PE) in Greenland. Further, non-resident companies are tax liable in Greenland for business profits derived in relation to the exploration for or exploitation of oil, gas, and minerals, regardless of the existence of a PE. Very few DTTs offer relief since Greenland only has full-fledged DTTs covering corporate tax with Denmark, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Norway.
The corporate tax rate is 25% for both Greenlandic and foreign companies from 1 January 2020.
From 1 January 2022, a company is able to pay on account tax to the Greenland tax authorities. This on account tax has to be paid before the end of the year for the present tax year. If the actual corporate tax exceeds the prepaid on account tax, there is a ‘surcharge’ of 6% of the corporate tax payable; consequently, the effective corporate tax rate is 26.5%. The tax with surcharge is due for payment on 1 November with final due date for payment on 20 November.
Oil and mineral licence holders are exempt from the 6% surcharge according to current practice.
## Oil companies
All companies with mineral exploration licences (current and future) are required to pay a government royalty as a condition for grant of a production licence. The royalty terms form part of the licence conditions and vary with the age of the licence.
On licences issued prior to 2014, oil companies pay a ‘surplus royalty’ of 7.5%, 17.5%, and 30%, which should be paid when the internal rate of return exceeds, respectively, 21.75%, 29.25%, and 36.75% plus the official Danish discount rate, and pay (‘carry’) the state-owned oil company’s 12.5% share of the costs (8% for licences in the ‘open door area’). Newer licences apply a gross royalty of 2.5% and a surplus royalty of 7.5%, 17.5%, and 30%, which should be paid when the accumulated turnover exceeds 35%, 45%, and 55%, respectively. Further, the state participation is reduced to 6.25% (carried).
Nonetheless, the model licence terms for upcoming rounds in Baffin Bay contain surplus royalty levels of 7.5%, 10%, and 12.5% at 35%, 45%, and 55% internal rates of return, respectively. In other words, royalty levels are likely to differ between licences and should therefore be scrutinised.
## Mining companies
The standard licence terms for mining licences also include provisions on royalties. The standard term gross royalties are 5.5% on gemstones, 5% on uranium and Rare Earth Elements (REE), and 2.5% on all other minerals (excluding oil & gas). Paid or due corporate taxes and dividend WHTs may generally be deducted in the calculation of royalties due, except for uranium licences and gemstone licences. For gemstone licences, there is an additional ‘surplus royalty’ imputed on gross profits exceeding 40%. Detailed provisions apply.
The concrete licence terms should always be consulted rather than the standard licence terms.
## Tax exemption for specific licensed purposes
Companies with a public licence to explore and utilise specific types of feedstock or natural resources (e.g. water or ice) or to produce hydroelectric energy may be tax exempt to the extent this follows from the relevant licence. The purpose of this is to allow for replacement of corporate taxes with other payments stipulated by a licence grant, such as turnover based royalties or other forms of payment. This system duplicates the system already in place for licences under, for example, the Natural Resources Act (*råstofloven*), which comprises the exploitation of oil, gas, and minerals.
## Local income taxes

# Greenland
## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
## Multiple changes to tax legislation
A bill for changes to the Greenland tax legislation was approved on 14 November 2023. The bill includes various amendments and changes to the Greenland tax legislation, including (but not limited to):
There are some exceptions where the interest WHT of 25% does not apply (e.g. if the recipient of interest is subject to controlling influence of a parent company resident in Denmark, Faroe Islands, or a country with which Greenland has a DTT, provided that the recipient will be subject to local controlled foreign company (CFC) taxation, should the local conditions therefore be met.
Group companies with activity associated with the above industries/activities can also be covered, under certain conditions.
The tax calculation under chapter 3b follows the general Greenland tax principles but with the below special differences/treatments (note that the rules below do have certain aspects and conditions):
The law changes will have effect from the 2024 income year and going forward.
## New Greenlandic transfer pricing guidance
A new regulation has been issued on 17 October 2023, stating that certain companies must submit transfer pricing documentation within 60 days after the tax return deadline.
Whether the company is obligated to prepare and submit transfer pricing documentation depends on whether the controlled transactions reported in specific fields on the S40 form with the tax return exceed the threshold based on a special ’median value‘ calculation. The threshold for 2023 is DKK 500 million (DKK 250 million for 2024).
The threshold will be gradually reduced, and from 2030 all entities with controlled transactions, regardless of size, must submit transfer pricing documentation every year.
The Greenlandic transfer pricing rules also apply to transactions between Greenlandic group entities (no joint taxation in Greenland).
## Change in corporate tax rate and on account tax
The corporate tax rate is 25% for both Greenlandic and foreign companies from 1 January 2020. Previously, a ‘surcharge’ of 6% of the corporate tax payable was applicable, hence the effective corporate tax rate was 26.5%. From 1 January 2022, a company is able to pay on account tax to the Greenland tax authorities. This on account tax has to be paid before the end of the year for the present tax year (the deadline is pushed in cases of income year not following calendar year). If the actual corporate tax exceeds the prepaid on account tax, there is a ‘surcharge’ of 6% of the corporate tax payable; consequently, the effective corporate tax rate is 26.5%. The tax with surcharge is due for payment on 1 November with final due date for payment 20 November. Oil and mineral licence holders are exempt from the 6% surcharge according to current practice.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
A corporation is resident in Greenland for tax purposes if it is registered in the Danish Companies Register with its principal seat of business in Greenland or if it has its effective seat of management in Greenland. The effective seat of management is typically the place where the management decisions concerning the company’s day-to-day operations are made.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Non-resident companies are liable to tax in Greenland on business profits derived through a PE in Greenland. Generally, Greenland may be assumed to rely on the principles of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) model tax treaty in the determination of whether a PE exists. There is virtually no published practice on the issue. Apart from income from a PE, foreign companies are tax liable on income in connection with the exploration and exploitation of oil, gas, and minerals, regardless of whether a PE exists. This includes all activity ultimately serving the extractive industries, including all kinds of subcontractors and service providers to the industry.

# Greenland
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
The general deduction scheme is fairly standard, although the Greenlandic Tax Agency seems to have a restrictive view of the kinds of expenses that are deductible. One very unusual feature is that dividends paid are deductible for the distributing company.
## Depreciation and amortisation
Tax depreciation is not required to be in coherence with book depreciation.
Operating assets can be depreciated by 30% a year on a declining-balance basis, ships and aeroplanes can be depreciated by 10% on a straight-line basis, and buildings and installations can be depreciated by 5% on a straight-line basis. Oil and mineral licences can be depreciated over ten years (oil) and four years (minerals) on a straight-line basis. If the lifetime of the licence is shorter than ten or four years, the licences are depreciated over the lifetime of the licence on a straight-line basis.
Depreciation allowances that are recaptured as part of a capital gain on the sale of an asset are generally fully taxable.
A new rule, with effect from 1 January 2024, will make it possible to postpone a taxable gain related to sale of buildings, vessels, and airplanes, to be taxed the following income year, under the condition that new assets are acquired in that subsequent year. The taxable gain should then reduce the acquisition value of the buildings/vessels/airplanes acquired in the subsequent year. A surcharge of 1% per month will be added to the taxable gain in the tax calculation for the subsequent income year if no new assets were acquired.
## Goodwill
Goodwill can be depreciated as an operating asset (i.e. by 30% on a declining-balance basis).
## Start-up expenses
No specific rules in Greenlandic tax law govern the treatment of start-up expenses. Instead, these expenses are treated according to general tax law.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are generally deductible under Greenlandic tax law. However, there are some limitations (*see Thin capitalisation in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*).
## Bad debt
Companies can deduct losses on bad debt for Greenlandic tax purposes only to the extent the losses are realised. Note that there is a high threshold for when a loss is deemed to be realised.
An exception to this rule is that financial institutions shall deduct provisions for bad debt and guarantee liabilities in accordance with the accounting rules applicable to them. The same applies to mortgage institutions, but only if they are domiciled in Greenland.
## Charitable contributions
Contributions to charity are not deductible for Greenlandic tax purposes.
## Pension expenses
Pension expenses are deductible as operating expenses.
## Payments to directors
Payments to directors are deductible as operating expenses.
R&D expenses may be deductible or not, depending on whether they are deemed operating expenses or capital expenses.
## Bribes, kickbacks, and illegal payments
There is no published practice on the deductibility of bribes, kickbacks, return commissions, and the like. In Danish and Greenlandic practice, illegal payments are generally not deductible. Since 2008, any bribery payments, whether in or outside Greenland and whether towards a national or international authority, have been a criminal offence. Consequently, it may reasonably be inferred that no such payments are deductible.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are not deductible for Greenlandic tax purposes.
## Taxes
Income taxes are, in general, not deductible for corporate tax purposes. Excise duties are deductible.
## Other significant items
A highly unusual item is that dividends distributed are deductible in the hands of the distributing company. If a decision to distribute is made before the deadline for filing the income tax return (1 May) on the basis of the preceding year’s profits, the deduction may be carried back into the preceding year.
## Net operating losses
With effect from 1 January 2024, tax losses can be carried forward for ten years (previously five years), under the condition that the taxpayer, each year before the tax return deadline, submits a specification of the tax losses and a declaration that the taxpayer will keep all accounting material relevant for the tax losses until at least two years after the utilisation of the tax loss. The filing of the declaration and specification must be performed digitally, and the accounting material should be shared with the Greenland tax authorities no later than 60 days after a potential request hereof.
Oil and mineral licence holders can carry losses forward indefinitely.
Tax losses may not be carried back and utilised in previous income years.
Tax losses are forfeited at ‘significant’ change of ownership or, unusually, activity of the company. Dispensation is available. ‘Significant’ is interpreted as 30% of ownership rights.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
A Greenlandic corporation can claim a deduction for royalties, management fees, and similar payments made to foreign affiliates, provided that such amounts are made on an arm’s-length basis and reflect services received. Interest at normal commercial rates paid to foreign affiliates generally will be allowed as a deduction but is subject to thin capitalisation (*see Thin capitalisation in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*).

# Greenland
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
Joint taxation is not possible in Greenland.
## Transfer pricing
Greenlandic transfer pricing rules apply to transactions between related parties (e.g. intra-group transactions). The rules apply when a company or person directly or indirectly owns more than 50% of the share capital or 50% of the voting rights in another company.
Companies are obligated to disclose in the annual tax return certain information regarding type and volume of intra-group transactions.
A new regulation has been issued on 17 October 2023, stating that certain companies must submit transfer pricing documentation within 60 days after the tax return deadline.
Whether the company is obligated to prepare and submit transfer pricing documentation depends on whether the controlled transactions reported in specific fields on the S40 form with the tax return exceed the threshold based on a special ’median value‘ calculation. The threshold for 2023 is DKK 500 million (DKK 250 million for 2024).
The threshold will be gradually reduced, and from 2030 all entities with controlled transactions, regardless of size, must submit transfer pricing documentation every year.
The Greenlandic transfer pricing rules also apply to transactions between Greenlandic group entities (no joint taxation in Greenland).
## Thin capitalisation
Greenland limits interest deductions according to the thin capitalisation rule. Up to and including 2023, the rule works to disallow gross interest costs and capital losses on related-party debt to the extent the overall debt-to-equity ratio exceeds 2:1. With effect from the 2024 income year, the existing thin capitalisation rule (interest limitation) will be changed to a 4:1 debt-to-equity.
Related-party debt is defined so as to include external bank debt if group member companies or shareholders have provided guarantees to the bank. This rule does not apply if the controlled debt is less than DKK 5 million.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
According to the Greenlandic CFC rules, a Greenlandic company has to include in its taxable income the CFC income of a foreign subsidiary if all of the following criteria are met:
There is no black or white list that exempts subsidiaries resident in certain countries.
CFC income is defined in some detail and includes a broad spectrum of passive and financial income.

# Greenland
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
Greenlandic PEs of foreign companies, and taxable income connected to oil, gas, and mineral activities, are taxed under the same rules and rates as Greenlandic resident companies. There is no branch profits remittance tax or other similar tax on branch profits. As a branch is considered to be the same legal entity as the headquarters, interest paid from the branch to the headquarters is not tax deductible.
Unusually, if one foreign company has more than one location or PE in Greenland, these are treated as separate taxable entities with no possibility of consolidation.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
There are no tax credits or tax incentives in Greenland in general. However, current oil licence holders do, in their surplus royalty basis, qualify for an extra deduction in their capital and operating expenditure of 21.75%, 29.25%, and 36.75%, respectively, plus the Danish discount rate, provided that the surplus royalty basis never has been positive. This is akin to the so-called ‘uplift’ known to other oil tax regimes.
It is also possible for mineral licence holders to get a tax holiday from the corporate tax. However, this is only possible if the corporate tax is replaced entirely by other forms of fiscal levies or duties that provide the Greenlandic government with at least the same income as the corporate tax would have done.
## Foreign tax credit
According to Greenlandic tax law, relief is generally available to credit foreign tax paid on non-Greenlandic source profits against the Greenlandic tax on the same profits. If relief is offered by treaty, the level of relief is capped at the level offered by the treaty. There are only treaty provisions to this effect with Canada, Denmark, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Norway.

## United States (US) Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
In relation to the US FATCA, a Model 1 Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) is treated as 'in effect' by the US Treasury as of 29 June 2014. The United States and Greenland have reached an agreement in substance, and Greenland has consented to disclose this status. In accordance with this status, the text of such IGA has not been released, and financial institutions in Greenland are allowed to register on the FATCA registration website consistent with the treatment of having an IGA in effect, provided that the jurisdiction continues to demonstrate firm resolve to sign the IGA as soon as possible.

## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
## Foreign tax relief
An individual resident in Greenland is entitled to deduct foreign income taxes paid or accrued on foreign-source income from the Greenlandic tax payable up to a maximum of Greenlandic tax paid on that part of the taxable income that is foreign-source income. Relief according to DTTs may be claimed if their provisions are more favourable.
Unutilised credits are not refundable and cannot be carried back or forward.
## Tax treaties
Greenland only has DTTs covering employee tax with Denmark, the Faroe Islands, Guernsey, Iceland, Isle of Man, Jersey, and Norway. Additionally, Greenland has exchange of information treaties with a number of small nations, such as Aruba, Bahamas, Cayman Islands, San Marino, Monaco, etc.
Greenland has introduced a limited international general anti-abuse rule whereby a taxpayer will not be granted the advantages of a DTT if it is reasonable to conclude, in light of all relevant circumstances, that granting this advantage is one of the principal aims of the arrangement or transaction, unless it is satisfied that granting the advantage in the concrete circumstances is in accordance with the content and purpose of the provision in question.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
On 1 January 2016, an amendment was adopted to the expat flat-tax regime that applies to individuals working in the extractive industries or involved in construction and installation outside existing towns and settlements.
The amendment states that such individuals are not tax liable on interest and dividends from sources outside Greenland, provided that the individual earns less than 350,000 Danish kroner (DKK) per income year from the employment that gives rise to Greenlandic tax liability. If there is no other income, such individuals are exempt from the duty to file a tax return.
The purpose of the amendment is to avoid unnecessary administration in connection with tax returns for taxpayers and the tax authority alike in a situation where there is unlikely to be tax revenue of any significance at stake.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
## Employment expenses
Generally no expenses are deductible from employment income.
## Personal deductions
### **Alimony**
Paid alimony is generally deductible for Greenlandic tax purposes under the following circumstances:
Further, the payments of alimony are only deductible for Greenlandic tax purposes if the payer has a legal obligation to pay the alimony, and the payments are recognised as taxable income for the persons receiving the alimony.
### Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions are not deductible for Greenlandic tax purposes.
### Childcare expenses
Childcare expenses are deductible for Greenlandic tax purposes under the same rules as described above regarding alimony.
### Education expenses
Education expenses are not deductible for Greenlandic tax purposes. However, most education in Greenland is tax funded and free of student payments.
### Healthcare expenses
Healthcare expenses are not deductible for Greenlandic tax purposes. Generally, however, the Greenlandic healthcare system is tax funded and free of charge for the patients.
### Life insurance premiums and contributions to pension funds
Payments to life insurance premiums and contributions to pension funds are basically deductible for Greenlandic tax purposes, provided that the payments are made to a Greenlandic pension fund or insurance company. However, deductibility for Greenlandic tax purposes is also subject to several other conditions being fulfilled.
### Mortgage interest expenses
Interest expenses are deductible for Greenlandic tax purposes in the year of accrual. However, if the debtor is unable to pay the interests, the interests are only deductible for Greenlandic tax purposes when paid. Interests regarding property located outside of Greenland are not deductible for Greenlandic tax purposes.
### Taxes paid
Paid taxes are not deductible for Greenlandic tax purposes. However, one should be aware of any obligations or rights in DTTs.
## Standard deductions
Fully tax liable individuals and individuals with limited tax liability from employment and employment related income are entitled to an allowance of DKK 48,000 a year (2016 amount). Persons with full tax liability to Greenland are further entitled to an extra allowance of DKK 10,000 a year (2016 amount). The amounts can be subject to adjustment every year, but have been stable for a number of years.
Foreigners who are subject to the expat flat-tax regime of 35% are not entitled to an allowance on their employment income, but have access to the standard allowance on other income.
## Personal allowances
There are no personal allowances or exemptions for Greenlandic tax purposes.
## Business deductions
The same expenses that are deductible for corporate tax purposes are also deductible for personal business purposes. *See the [Deductions](../corporate/deductions.html) section in the Corporate summary for more information on business expenses*.
## Losses
Business losses can be carried forward for a five-year period. This includes capital losses to the extent they form part of the income. Capital losses on financial contracts may only be offset against capital gains on financial contracts.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
## Employment income
All remunerations from employment, whether in cash or in kind, are subject to tax when the employee has obtained a legal right to the remuneration, regardless of where payment is made and regardless of whether remitted. The liability extends to any living or housing allowance and any reimbursement of tax or other personal liability, whether paid directly to an employee or borne by the employer on the employee’s behalf.
Payments to an employee for expenses of travel, entertainment, or any other service to be performed on behalf of the employer are taxable only to the extent that they are not actually expended in the performance of the service.
Employees who are given a free telephone, certain types of free housing, free food, and certain other benefits from their employer are taxed on fixed amounts, regardless of actual usage and saved private expenditures. The standardised values are published once a year in a tax value table.
## Equity compensation
Share-based payments are, as a starting point, taxed as any other remuneration from employment, at a tax rate of 42% to 44%, depending on the local municipality in question. There is a very rare exception available upon application in case of ownership transfer by way of generational change, by which taxation may be deferred.
## Business income
In general, private business owners (i.e. individuals operating a business on their own account and risk) are comprised by the general tax rates, etc. as employees.
## Capital gains
As a main rule, capital gains are not taxable for individuals in Greenland. There are two exceptions: (i) ‘financial contracts’ (i.e. derivatives, etc.) and (ii) debentures with a nominal interest below 2% *per annum*. Capital gains on these two asset classes are taxable as normal income by tax rates of 42% to 44% (2014 percentages).
## Dividend income
Dividend income is treated as normal taxable income.
Loans and security granted by a company to certain major shareholders are re-characterised as dividends.
## Interest income
Interest income is treated as normal taxable income.
## Rental income
Rental income is treated as normal taxable income.
## Exempt income
Foreigners subject to the expat flat-tax regime are not tax liable on foreign-sourced interest and dividends if their Greenlandic-sourced wage income is less than DKK 350,000 in the year in question.
There are marginal examples of other tax-exempt income, such as certain types of welfare payments, certain lottery prizes and winnings comprised by excise duties on lotteries and gambling, gifts from closely related family, certain types of payments of life insurance, and certain disability compensation, insurance payments concerning critical illness, and pension payments if the contributions are non-deductible in Denmark, the Faroe Islands, or in Greenland.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
An individual who does not set up residence will become subject to full Greenlandic tax liability from the first day of one’s stay if one stays in Greenland for at least six consecutive months. When determining the six-month period, short stays outside Greenland due to holidays, etc. are included, whereas stays abroad due to employment may interrupt the six-month period.
